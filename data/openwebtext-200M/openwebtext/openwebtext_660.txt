Once again , House Republicans are on Capitol Hill during the August recess , and once again , they are holding something of a sit-in , giving spirited speeches about coastal drilling for tourists and congressional staffers who happen to pass by the charade .
Yesterday , however , there was a bit of a twist in the Republican rhetoric .
Far - right lawmakers actually believe they ’re affecting the market by talking to each other .
House Republicans on Tuesday said their protest of Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s ( D - Calif . ) decision not to allow a vote on expanded offshore oil drilling has helped lower gas prices .
Heading into a third day of speeches in the near - empty chamber , Republicans acknowledged that the average price of gas and oil has declined in recent weeks .
But they claimed credit for part of that reduction .
“ I think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking , ” said Rep. John Shadegg ( R - Ariz . ) at a joint press conference with other GOP lawmakers .
“ I think the market realizes this kind of pressure from Congress may , in fact , lead to a change in policy . ”
The Republican members did not answer questions about whether they would take the blame if gas prices go up again .
Yes , House Republicans are hosting a very sad little photo - op on the Hill , and some of them are willing to argue , out loud , in public , that simply by talking to each other about drilling , they ’re able to bring the price of fuel down .
If you told me that Speaker Pelosi ’s office was paying these clowns money to make House Republicans look ridiculous , I ’d be tempted to believe you .
Keep in mind , they ’re not the only unhinged Republicans claiming magical rhetorical powers .
There was also this item two weeks ago .
John McCain — whose campaign launched an ad this week blaming Barack Obama for high prices at the pump — said Wednesday President Bush ’s new push for offshore oil drilling deserves the credit for the recent drop in crude oil prices .
“ In case you missed it , soon as the President announced that we were going to end the moratorium on offshore drilling the price of a barrel of oil went down $ 10 , ” the presumptive Republican nominee said at a Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania town hall .
So , to hear McCain tell it , Bush was able to bring down the price of a barrel of oil simply by making a symbolic gesture .
I knew McCain and his GOP cohorts were slipping from reality , but this is just sad .
Talking to tourists and empty White House gestures do not , in our reality , lower the price of oil .
It ’s no wonder Republicans are so bad at governing — they ’ve obviously flunked Economics 101 .
Oil prices kept falling Tuesday , sinking as low as $ 118 a barrel on growing concerns that a U.S. economic slowdown and high energy costs are curbing consumer demand for gasoline and other petroleum products . [… ]
A day after plunging as much as $ 5 a barrel in a dramatic sell - off , crude continued its downward trend Tuesday as traders sold oil contracts on the belief that prices are still too high in relation to demand and have further room to fall . [… ]
“ The market psychology has finally shifted , ” said Stephen Schork , an analyst and trader in Villanova , Pa. , adding that “ $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline has clearly killed demand . ”
On Monday , the Commerce Department said consumer spending after adjusting for inflation fell 0.2 percent in June — the biggest drop since February — as shoppers dealt with higher prices for gasoline , food and other items .
Oil prices also fell after Tropical Storm Edouard did not severely disrupt oil and natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico .
The dollar ’s gains against the euro also contributed to oil ’s decline Tuesday .
The euro fell to $ 1.5467 from the $ 1.5587 it bought late in New York trading Monday , making oil and other commodities less attractive to investors seeking a hedge against inflation and dollar weakness .
It ’s called supply and demand .
Maybe Republicans have heard of it .

Veteran investor says Obama ’s agenda will only exacerbate the problem

Friday , December 19 , 2008
Veteran investor Jim Rogers warns that the policies of central banks and politicians are turning what would have been a recession into a new great depression , and that Barack Obama ’s taxation agenda will only make the problem much worse .
Speaking to Bloomberg News , Rogers said that the crisis would at least be the worst since the second world war and that “ it could well be ” as bad as the great depression .
“ 1929 was the stock market bubble which popped , we were going into a recession and then the politicians around the world starting making horrendous mistakes which turned it into a depression , it would have been just a normal recession otherwise but the American politicians and the European politicians – everyone got in on the act and that seems to be happening this time too , ” said Rogers .
Rogers labeled it “ unfathomable ” what central banks were doing and totally at odds with the lessons of history , adding that President elect Barack Obama ’s intention to impose protectionism and taxation of capital would fuel a depression .

“ If that happens , it ’s all over , ” warned Rogers , adding that the same thing will happen to the U.S. as happened to Britain between 1918 and 1939 , which went from being the richest and most powerful country in the world to being a shambles .
China would replace America as the great superpower in the 21st century , said Rogers .
Rogers explained that the only safe haven during such a period would be commodities and precious metals like gold , which always perform well during times of extreme upheaval .
Rogers said he had bought a significant amount of gold at the start of its bull run in 2002 and that he had n’t sold any of it .
The veteran investor stated that shortages would translate into a strong comeback for oil , which slipped down to $ 36 dollars a barrel yesterday from a peak of over $ 145 dollars a barrel in July .

Prof Christie said : " It 's a rather clever mixture of what we would expect to see - such as the Embankment , Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square - but it also has these wonderful close ups of individuals .
John Maynard Keynes was twitted with changing his mind .
He replied , “ When the facts change , I change my opinion .
What do you do , sir ? ”
My favorite example of a change of mind was Norman Mailer at The Village Voice .
Norman took on the role of drama critic , weighing in on the New York premiere of Waiting for Godot .
Twentieth century ’s greatest play .
Without bothering to go , Mailer called it a piece of garbage .
When he did get around to seeing it , he realized his mistake .
He was no longer a Voice columnist , however , so he bought a page in the paper and wrote a retraction , praising the play as the masterpiece it is .
Every playwright ’s dream .
I once won one of Mary Ann Madden ’s “ Competitions ” in New York magazine .
The task was to name or create a “ 10 ” of anything , and mine was the World ’s Perfect Theatrical Review .
It went like this : “ I never understood the theater until last night .
Please forgive everything I ’ve ever written .
When you read this I ’ll be dead . ”
That , of course , is the only review anybody in the theater ever wants to get .
My prize , in a stunning example of irony , was a year ’s subscription to New York , which rag ( apart from Mary Ann ’s “ Competition ” )
I considered an open running sore on the body of world literacy — this due to the presence in its pages of John Simon , whose stunning amalgam of superciliousness and savagery , over the years , was appreciated by that readership searching for an endorsement of proactive mediocrity .
But I digress .
I wrote a play about politics ( November , Barrymore Theater , Broadway , some seats still available ) .
And as part of the “ writing process , ” as I believe it ’s called , I started thinking about politics .
This comment is not actually as jejune as it might seem .
Porgy and Bess is a buncha good songs but has nothing to do with race relations , which is the flag of convenience under which it sailed .
But my play , it turned out , was actually about politics , which is to say , about the polemic between persons of two opposing views .
The argument in my play is between a president who is self - interested , corrupt , suborned , and realistic , and his leftish , lesbian , utopian - socialist speechwriter .
The play , while being a laugh a minute , is , when it ’s at home , a disputation between reason and faith , or perhaps between the conservative ( or tragic ) view and the liberal ( or perfectionist ) view .
The conservative president in the piece holds that people are each out to make a living , and the best way for government to facilitate that is to stay out of the way , as the inevitable abuses and failures of this system ( free - market economics ) are less than those of government intervention .
I took the liberal view for many decades , but I believe I have changed my mind .
As a child of the ’60s , I accepted as an article of faith that government is corrupt , that business is exploitative , and that people are generally good at heart .
These cherished precepts had , over the years , become ingrained as increasingly impracticable prejudices .
Why do I say impracticable ?
Because although I still held these beliefs , I no longer applied them in my life .
How do I know ?
My wife informed me .
We were riding along and listening to NPR .
I felt my facial muscles tightening , and the words beginning to form in my mind :
Shut the fuck up . “ ? ” she prompted .
And her terse , elegant summation , as always , awakened me to a deeper truth : I had been listening to NPR and reading various organs of national opinion for years , wonder and rage contending for pride of place .
Further : I found I had been — rather charmingly , I thought — referring to myself for years as “ a brain - dead liberal , ” and to NPR as “ National Palestinian Radio . ”
This is , to me , the synthesis of this worldview with which I now found myself disenchanted : that everything is always wrong .
But in my life , a brief review revealed , everything was not always wrong , and neither was nor is always wrong in the community in which I live , or in my country .
Further , it was not always wrong in previous communities in which I lived , and among the various and mobile classes of which I was at various times a part .
And , I wondered , how could I have spent decades thinking that I thought everything was always wrong at the same time that I thought I thought that people were basically good at heart ?
Which was it ?
I began to question what I actually thought and found that I do not think that people are basically good at heart ; indeed , that view of human nature has both prompted and informed my writing for the last 40 years .
I think that people , in circumstances of stress , can behave like swine , and that this , indeed , is not only a fit subject , but the only subject , of drama .
I ’d observed that lust , greed , envy , sloth , and their pals are giving the world a good run for its money , but that nonetheless , people in general seem to get from day to day ; and that we in the United States get from day to day under rather wonderful and privileged circumstances — that we are not and never have been the villains that some of the world and some of our citizens make us out to be , but that we are a confection of normal ( greedy , lustful , duplicitous , corrupt , inspired — in short , human ) individuals living under a spectacularly effective compact called the Constitution , and lucky to get it .
For the Constitution , rather than suggesting that all behave in a godlike manner , recognizes that , to the contrary , people are swine and will take any opportunity to subvert any agreement in order to pursue what they consider to be their proper interests .
To that end , the Constitution separates the power of the state into those three branches which are for most of us ( I include myself ) the only thing we remember from 12 years of schooling .
The Constitution , written by men with some experience of actual government , assumes that the chief executive will work to be king , the Parliament will scheme to sell off the silverware , and the judiciary will consider itself Olympian and do everything it can to much improve ( destroy ) the work of the other two branches .
So the Constitution pits them against each other , in the attempt not to achieve stasis , but rather to allow for the constant corrections necessary to prevent one branch from getting too much power for too long .
Rather brilliant .
For , in the abstract , we may envision an Olympian perfection of perfect beings in Washington doing the business of their employers , the people , but any of us who has ever been at a zoning meeting with our property at stake is aware of the urge to cut through all the pernicious bullshit and go straight to firearms .
I found not only that I did n’t trust the current government ( that , to me , was no surprise ) , but that an impartial review revealed that the faults of this president — whom I , a good liberal , considered a monster — were little different from those of a president whom I revered .
Bush got us into Iraq , JFK into Vietnam .
Bush stole the election in Florida ; Kennedy stole his in Chicago .
Bush outed a CIA agent ; Kennedy left hundreds of them to die in the surf at the Bay of Pigs .
Bush lied about his military service ; Kennedy accepted a Pulitzer Prize for a book written by Ted Sorenson .
Bush was in bed with the Saudis , Kennedy with the Mafia .
Oh .
And I began to question my hatred for “ the Corporations ” — the hatred of which , I found , was but the flip side of my hunger for those goods and services they provide and without which we could not live .
And I began to question my distrust of the “ Bad , Bad Military ” of my youth , which , I saw , was then and is now made up of those men and women who actually risk their lives to protect the rest of us from a very hostile world .
Is the military always right ?
No .
Neither is government , nor are the corporations — they are just different signposts for the particular amalgamation of our country into separate working groups , if you will .
Are these groups infallible , free from the possibility of mismanagement , corruption , or crime ?
No , and neither are you or I .
So , taking the tragic view , the question was not “ Is everything perfect ? ” but “ How could it be better , at what cost , and according to whose definition ? ”
Put into which form , things appeared to me to be unfolding pretty well .
Do I speak as a member of the “ privileged class ” ?
If you will — but classes in the United States are mobile , not static , which is the Marxist view .
That is : Immigrants came and continue to come here penniless and can ( and do ) become rich ; the nerd makes a trillion dollars ; the single mother , penniless and ignorant of English , sends her two sons to college ( my grandmother ) .
On the other hand , the rich and the children of the rich can go belly - up ; the hegemony of the railroads is appropriated by the airlines , that of the networks by the Internet ; and the individual may and probably will change status more than once within his lifetime .
What about the role of government ?
Well , in the abstract , coming from my time and background , I thought it was a rather good thing , but tallying up the ledger in those things which affect me and in those things I observe , I am hard - pressed to see an instance where the intervention of the government led to much beyond sorrow .
But if the government is not to intervene , how will we , mere human beings , work it all out ?
I wondered and read , and it occurred to me that I knew the answer , and here it is :
We just seem to .
How do I know ?
From experience .
I referred to my own — take away the director from the staged play and what do you get ?
Usually a diminution of strife , a shorter rehearsal period , and a better production .
The director , generally , does not cause strife , but his or her presence impels the actors to direct ( and manufacture ) claims designed to appeal to Authority — that is , to set aside the original goal ( staging a play for the audience ) and indulge in politics , the purpose of which may be to gain status and influence outside the ostensible goal of the endeavor .
Strand unacquainted bus travelers in the middle of the night , and what do you get ?
A lot of bad drama , and a shake - and - bake Mayflower Compact .
Each , instantly , adds what he or she can to the solution .
Why ?
Each wants , and in fact needs , to contribute — to throw into the pot what gifts each has in order to achieve the overall goal , as well as status in the new - formed community .
And so they work it out .
See also that most magnificent of schools , the jury system , where , again , each brings nothing into the room save his or her own prejudices , and , through the course of deliberation , comes not to a perfect solution , but a solution acceptable to the community — a solution the community can live with .
Prior to the midterm elections , my rabbi was taking a lot of flack .
The congregation is exclusively liberal , he is a self - described independent ( read “ conservative ” ) , and he was driving the flock wild .
Why ?
Because a ) he never discussed politics ; and b ) he taught that the quality of political discourse must be addressed first — that Jewish law teaches that it is incumbent upon each person to hear the other fellow out .
And so I , like many of the liberal congregation , began , teeth grinding , to attempt to do so .
And in doing so , I recognized that I held those two views of America ( politics , government , corporations , the military ) .
One was of a state where everything was magically wrong and must be immediately corrected at any cost ; and the other — the world in which I actually functioned day to day — was made up of people , most of whom were reasonably trying to maximize their comfort by getting along with each other ( in the workplace , the marketplace , the jury room , on the freeway , even at the school - board meeting ) .
And I realized that the time had come for me to avow my participation in that America in which I chose to live , and that that country was not a schoolroom teaching values , but a marketplace .
“ Aha , ” you will say , and you are right .
I began reading not only the economics of Thomas Sowell ( our greatest contemporary philosopher ) but Milton Friedman , Paul Johnson , and Shelby Steele , and a host of conservative writers , and found that I agreed with them : a free - market understanding of the world meshes more perfectly with my experience than that idealistic vision I called liberalism .
At the same time , I was writing my play about a president , corrupt , venal , cunning , and vengeful ( as I assume all of them are ) , and two turkeys .
And I gave this fictional president a speechwriter who , in his view , is a “ brain - dead liberal , ” much like my earlier self ; and in the course of the play , they have to work it out .
And they eventually do come to a human understanding of the political process .
As I believe I am trying to do , and in which I believe I may be succeeding , and I will try to summarize it in the words of William Allen White .
White was for 40 years the editor of the Emporia Gazette in rural Kansas , and a prominent and powerful political commentator .
He was a great friend of Theodore Roosevelt and wrote the best book I ’ve ever read about the presidency .
It ’s called Masks in a Pageant , and it profiles presidents from McKinley to Wilson , and I recommend it unreservedly .
White was a pretty clear - headed man , and he ’d seen human nature as few can .
( As Twain wrote , you want to understand men , run a country paper . )
White knew that people need both to get ahead and to get along , and that they ’re always working at one or the other , and that government should most probably stay out of the way and let them get on with it .
But , he added , there is such a thing as liberalism , and it may be reduced to these saddest of words : ” . . . and yet . . . “
The right is mooing about faith , the left is mooing about change , and many are incensed about the fools on the other side — but , at the end of the day , they are the same folks we meet at the water cooler .
Happy election season .

The Israeli military is investigating a video in which a Palestinian detainee appears to be humiliated by a group of Israeli soldiers .
The video , broadcast by Israeli TV after being posted on YouTube , shows a blindfolded man kneeling near a barrier being forced to repeat Hebrew phrases .
Some refer to the elite Golani infantry brigade .
Others are of a sexual nature .
In a statement to the BBC , the Israeli army said it considered the incident " grave " , and condemned the behaviour .
" Investigative procedures were opened as soon as the footage was received " from Israeli Channel 10 TV on Thursday , it added .
Abuse ' the norm '
The video shows a bearded Palestinian detainee , blindfolded , and apparently kneeling close to a high concrete barrier .
Investigative procedures were opened as soon as the footage was received
Israeli army statement Around him are a group of Israeli soldiers , some of whom are jeering .
One soldier goads the blindfolded man into repeating what he is saying .
The taunt ends with the words : " Golani will bring you a log to stick up your ass . "
As the man repeats it , the soldiers can be heard laughing loudly .
The BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says we have no clue as to when or where this video was shot and it is impossible to know just how frequently such incidents occur .
But a leading Israeli human rights group says " many instances of abuse are not exposed because they have become the norm " .
Palestinians themselves frequently complain that their contact with Israeli soldiers on occupied territory results in delays , insults and sometimes violence , our correspondent says .
The Israeli army insists though that behaviour of this type goes against the force 's " core values and high standards " .

People wasting billions of dollars on ' quack ' health food products
Globally every year , obese people waste billions of pounds on food products that ' imply ' that they aid weight loss , but are totally ineffective , says a nutritional expert on bmj.com today .
Professor Lean from the University of Glasgow , is hopeful that a new European Union ( EU ) Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices , adopted this year in UK , will finally protect vulnerable consumers who are tricked into to buying useless food products or supplements in attempts to combat their disease .
Unlike medicines , food products that are marketed for health reasons are not subject to the same stringent research trials and control , and consumers are often misled .
It is already illegal for unsubstantiated claims to be made about the composition or nutritional function of food products , eg. that they are low in fat , high in fibre or help lower cholesterol , and it is also illegal to claim that a food can treat or prevent any disease — including obesity .
However , many unsubstantiated health claims are still made , or implied .
Misleading marketing can be found within brand names and images on packaging , in shelf or shop names , or on websites which suggest that products help weight control , are slimming , or are " Health Foods " , when there is no evidence .
Lean is concerned that obese people have been fooled into parting with billions of pounds every year on products that cannot help them .
In 2000 , people in the US spent $ 35 bn ( £ 22 bn ) on weight loss products , many of them making false and unsubstantiated claims .
The " commercial exploitation of vulnerable patients with quack medicines " will hopefully be brought to an end with the introduction of the new EU directive , say Lean .
However , the laws need to be enforced proactively to enable doctors and consumers to move towards managing diseases confidently with evidence based treatment and diet programmes .
He points out that , of all the hundreds of products currently on sale to help people lose weight , only energy - restricted diets and exercise , the drugs orlistat and sibutramine , and in some cases bariatric surgery , are safe , effective and cost - effective .
The remainder , he says , are either not effective or not safe .
The new regulations " may even help with the bigger battle to prevent obesity , by prohibiting advertisements across the EU that encourage children to buy energy dense products or to pester their parents to buy them " , he adds .
CHARLOTTE , N.C. , Oct. 31 ( UPI ) -- Sen. Elizabeth Dole , R - N.C. , is blasting her Democratic opponent in a new ad for attending a fundraiser by an adviser for the atheist group Godless Americans .
" If Godless Americans threw a party in your honor , would you go ? " the ad released Friday asked voters in the Tarheel State .

The Hill described the ad as a " step back " from an earlier ad that was rough enough to be publicly repudiated by several North Carolina newspapers .
That commercial featured Hagan 's face and a female voice , not Hagan 's , stating , " There is no God . "
Friday 's ad focused on the fact that fact that Hagan was present at a fundraiser organized by a group that Dole 's campaign claims wants to take God out of " our everyday lives . "
Hagen 's camp dismissed the ad and told The Hill .
" Sen .
Dole knows Kay is a strong Christian , a former Sunday school teacher and a member of Greensboro 's First Presbyterian Church , and she knows that her advertisements are lies , " declared campaign spokeswoman Colleen Flanagan .

Dan Callahan has written : " I doggedly believe we will one way or the other have to set limits on health care for the elderly , even if a specific age limit will not do …a good society ought to help young people become old people , but is under no obligation to help the old become indefinitely older . "
When he says " we will " set limits , he means the collective " we . "
He means that the Medicare system will set limits .
When he speaks of " society " helping young people but not old people , he means that Medicare will allocate money to young people but not old people .
Collectivist thinking about health care is not unusual today .
After all , Medicare is a collectivist institution .
Collectivism , by common definition : " The principles or system of ownership and control of the means of production and distribution by the people collectively , usually under the supervision of a government . "
The " means of production " include all wealth .
Wealth is anything that exchanges for a price .
The personal qualities of a person are sources of wealth .
The personal qualities include a range of things like decisiveness , knowledge , skills , intellect , will , drive , know - how , emotions , attractiveness , leadership quality , decision - making ability , foresight , empathy , understanding , energy , drive , health , fortitude , stamina , plus moral and intellectual capacities .
The personal qualities are used to provide labor and services that are bought and sold .
The vast majority of human wealth is through personal qualities .
There is therefore no ownership and control of the means of production without controlling human beings .
Collectivism to be collectivism has to be a system that includes control of the personal qualities of each person by all people collectively ( which , in reality , means control by government officials and bureaucrats ) .
Collectivism is totalitarian , the latter meaning a system in which government exercises complete control over each person ’s life or personal qualities .
As Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. has written : " A totalitarian regime crushes all autonomous institutions in its drive to seize the human soul . "
Seizure of the person is exactly what collectivism is about .
It is about taking the property that each of us has in his person and life .
This means we lose the power to make decisions over our own lives .
In collectivism , the property in our lives and persons belongs to the collective .
Through the centralization of health - care financing and rule - making , Medicare officials and bureaucrats decide who is going to live and who is going to die .
Medicare is collectivist .
In Double Indemnity , Edward G. Robinson explains the predicament of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck , who have committed a collective murder of Barbara ’s husband .
“ They ’ve committed a murder and it ’s not like taking a trolley ride together where they can get off at different stops .
They ’re stuck with each other and they ’ve got to ride all the way to the end of the line and it ’s a one - way trip and the last stop is the cemetery . ”
They are bound together in a collective fate from which there is no escape short of the cemetery .
A person and his life either belong to him or they belong to others .
Either we decide as persons how we live and die , or we give up those decision rights to the collective and faceless officials and bureaucrats of government .
The trolley we are on is the latter , the totalitarian line .
Some of us want to get off .
We did not commit the murder .
If the ones who want to ride that trolley will let us off , they can continue their ride .
That is a peaceful solution .
It will mean the end of the U.S. government as we know it .
But there is no reason why several governments cannot operate on the territory now under the jurisdiction of the U.S.A .
But it is possible that the others wo n’t let us off , because they are collectivists and wish to control us .
That sort of basic difference will not go away .
It will lead to conflict .
The U.S. government , with the vague and diffuse blessing of majority America and the specific and narrow support of various health - care lobbies , committed a murder in 1965 when it instituted Medicare .
On July 30 , 1965 , President Johnson signed the death warrant for markets in health care .
On our behalf , the protestations of many of us notwithstanding , he placed us and our health - care system on a one - way trip to the cemetery .
The murder was suicide by a slow - acting poison that is still spreading through the body politic and the associated economy .
The government already decides who lives and who dies via its large - scale intrusions into markets for health care .
The connections to life and death are manifold , but they are beneath the surface of public recognition .
They are felt , but they are largely unseen and unremarked .
As the trolley approaches the cemetery , we get closer to that time when the government will decide ever more explicitly who lives and who dies .
The future in our government - dominated society is often visible in academia , because that is where the future is created and propagated by intellectual apologists for government .
Academic intellectuals quite often act as if they are neutral scientists in search of truth when , in point of fact , they publish lengthy articles in which they accept and often support the premise of big government .
Various governments support many intellectuals financially .
This is a cozy , self - perpetuating , and thoroughly evil arrangement whereby the government gets to control the minds , if only partially but nonetheless effectively , of those who think they are getting educated .
The government - academic nexus often ends up as a totalitarian mechanism .
Duke University began a journal in 1976 called Journal of Health Politics , Policy and Law .
It is still published .
The editor spoke of the major ultimate goal as " decent care for the suffering . "
He did not take to the pulpit to encourage us to help the suffering .
He mentioned no religious figures .
He did not delve into moral philosophy .
He did not speak of how a free people alleviates its own suffering .
He spoke instead of " health policy - making " as being the journal ’s focal point , as befits its title .
I briefly mention the content of the first three articles in the first issue of this journal .
The authors of these articles are , as we all are , on the trolley ride to that health - care cemetery , but they do not recognize the basic cause of that fact , which is Medicare .
And so they recommend more government measures that actually speed up the trolley and make sure that everyone is aboard when it reaches its destination .
Goodwill often combines with ignorance and bad philosophies to produce tragic results .
The first article in the first issue of the new journal was written by Theodore Cooper , Assistant Secretary of Health , U.S. Department of Health , Education , and Welfare .
The title was " Federal Health Policy . "
The rhetoric of his opening lines is the rhetoric of today , some 33 years later .
Obama could have spoken these words penned in 1976 by this government official :
" A host of problems today confronts the health care system .
None is new but all are vastly larger and more pressing than ever before .
There are problems having to do with the cost of health care , both the cost to individuals and the aggregate cost to society .
There are problems concerning the quality of care , access to care , and the appropriateness of the manner and settings in which health care is dispensed …
But the super - problem in health is cost .
The intolerable escalation of cost throughout the system is pushing it toward significant change . "
Connecting any of this to Medicare ’s existence was beyond Cooper ’s ken .
From where he sat as a bureaucrat in government , Medicare was a given .
To him , Medicare was there as an outcome of public policy .
He thought that the legislation was an outcome of public demand .
He mentioned the public ’s expectations and the national expectation of health care .
He noted that " people expect so much because of the inexorable movement toward the idea that personal health or medical care is a public responsibility .
This is an ideological shift … "
The reality is that Medicare came into being as the result of decades of lobbying by various health care businesses and organizations , not as a result of public demand .
Cooper ’s reaction shows that bureaucrats who administer the program need not and may not understand the politics of Medicare ’s beginnings or the economics of its replacement of markets in health care .
What they see is a huge demand after the program is put in place , and they then rationalize that as a shift in ideology when it is really an expression of economics operating within the new political framework .
And those who have that sort of belief , caused by witnessing the public demand under that program , do not realize that the demand exists just as powerfully in markets prior to government ’s entry .
They cannot recognize the government program as a source of problems that did not exist in unhampered markets , and they cannot recommend the termination of the government operation , which , by the way , employs them .
Instead , to complete their rationalization , they seek to find fault with the markets and to fantasize that people in general wanted government health care .
Medicare , no matter how it came into being , is now operating as an independent cause of social change .
It is now fueling the trolley ’s movement .
Because Medicare pools health care money , it creates a problem for government bureaucrats of deciding who will get that money .
They then invoke arbitrary criteria .
For example , seeing that elder care costs more money per person than middle - age care , they decide to allocate less to the elderly and more to the middle - aged .
They then argue that this is fair and just .
Seeing that procedure A is more expensive than procedure B , they control ( lower ) the price of procedure A , and this creates excess demand for procedure A .
The number of rules , restrictions , and controls is endless .
Medicine becomes a branch of politics .
The second article , again from 1976 , reviewed national health insurance proposals .
It said that the 1972 platforms of both parties spoke of comprehensive coverage .
It said that the cost of a cradle - to - grave coverage was estimated as $ 285 — $ 580 billion ( in today ’s dollars ) .
We may note here that then , as now , government always under-estimates costs .
The article spoke of a Massachusetts plan , just as several years ago Governor Romney of Massachusetts achieved a lot of publicity with his health insurance plan .
Congress , we are told , was considering three proposals ; and " The first is Senator Kennedy ’s proposal … "
That has n’t changed either .
Health insurance covering all Americans is an aim of the current administration .
It will probably be enacted in some form .
They ’ll probably dedicate it to Senator Kennedy .
The trolley ride to the cemetery continues .
The last stop is the death of markets in health care , replaced by a totalitarian system .
The third article , written by several members of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation , began by informing us that " Since 1965 , the federal government has become the principal purchaser of health care services primarily through its financing of the Medicare and Medicaid programs . "
These health care professionals were on the receiving end of various laws passed by Congress in 1972 to deal with the problems of Medicare ( cost increases , waste , deterioration of quality ) .
But these laws created even more paperwork and cost !
The authors called for quality care , while they bemoaned " the sheer quantity of paperwork that will force providers to hire additional staff , " whose cost detracts from actually doctoring and nursing the ill .
They complained about " the unbelievable crush of paperwork … "
Then , not recognizing that Medicare and Medicaid were the source of the resulting problems of cost and excess demand or not willing to call for their termination , these authors called for changes in the control systems .
This tinkering has now gone on for 43 years .
Dan Callahan ’s book on setting health care limits came out in 1987 .
The topic of rationing health care and the duty to die emerged in academia .
One could find ancient writers who believed that the elderly should die , perhaps with society pushing them to die , so that resources would be made available for the young .
The modern resurgence of interest in this topic was due to the government ’s presence and prominence in medical care .
Since the government controls the resources going to medical care , it has to say where they go and who gets them .
As long as the government controls health care , it has to say who lives and who dies .
The academics get into the act by advising government whom to kill , how to kill them , who should get the supposedly - released resources , who should get a CT - scan and who should not , and so on .
Academics think , and they think about every aspect of the issue except one , which is getting the government out of health - care markets .
The academics accept collectivism .
It is their bread and butter .
It is their mother ’s milk .
They analyze health care in the name of efficiency and occasionally in the name of justice .
We are supposed to repose and take our guidance on these matters from the priests known as professors ( not from the renegades of that class ) .
Adam Smith begins his inquiry into the wealth of nations by mentioning : " Such [ savage ] nations , however , are so miserably poor , that from mere want , they are frequently reduced , or , at least , think themselves reduced , to the necessity sometimes of directly destroying , and sometimes of abandoning their infants , their old people , and those afflicted with lingering diseases , to perish with hunger , or to be devoured by wild beasts . "
Is America now in the class of savage nations that is so miserably poor that we are given to intellectual pondering about the destruction of old people ?
Do such investigations , ideas , and deeds naturally accompany the killing of infants ?
Do they naturally accompany socially - approved abortion ?
They do .
These are all birds of a feather .
America ’s turn to savagery does not originate in America ’s being poor .
Americans were poorer centuries ago without discussing the killing of old people and babies .
Taking care of elderly persons has always been costly .
Medicare brings out into the open the fact of resource limitations that always beset mankind .
It exacerbates the rationing problem by centralizing all resources and decision - making .
But , as we have seen , Medicare itself reflects the same factors that imply savagery , by which I mean brutal , merciless , and vicious .
Savagery is associated with a cluster of other ideas and beliefs that have a grip on American thought .
They include collectivism , which is against a person having property in his own mind , body , and life ; that is , having control over his own mind , body , and life .
For once one owns and controls others , even via a collective sense of ownership , the sense of restraint that governs behavior when each of us has property in ourselves disappears .
We are free to act as we will , and that allows a broader scope for our more evil and selfish impulses .
Another of these ideas is collective utilitarianism , which is an attempt to tote up the costs and benefits of policies to broad collectives .
Once we abandon the idea that each of us is a person who makes decisions for himself over his life , and replace that with the idea that a person ’s essence arises by virtue of belonging to some collective group , and the idea that everyone within a group is the same , the way is open to mistreating vast numbers of persons by labeling them and treating them all in government - specified ways .
The Holy Bible expounds a social philosophy that is entirely at odds with the collectivization of medical care .
There is no room for discussions of euthanasia and age - based rationing in such commandments as " Thou shalt not kill , " and " Honour thy father and mother . "
There are no tradeoffs of young for old in " Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honour the face of the old man , and fear thy God : I am the LORD . "
Can anyone doubt the meaning of " Hearken unto thy father that begat thee , and despise not thy mother when she is old " ?
Professor Margaret P. Battin wrote an article in 1987 titled " Age Rationing and the Just Distribution of Health Care : Is There a Duty to Die ? "
After 24 pages of intense mental gymnastics that attempted to figure out what people would think about old - age medical care if they were placed in a Rawlsian veil of ignorance , she decided that thou shalt kill if there is a substantial scarcity of resources .
( Who will decide that little matter ? )
She decided that one need not hearken to thy father after all and one might despise thy mother ’s life as long as the resources released from this will be indeed transferred to the young .
She also spoke up for talking older people into agreeing to end their lives .
Her language was not as blunt as mine .
A sample : " Nevertheless , whether death in old age is feared or welcomed is very much a product of social beliefs and expectations , and these not only undergo spontaneous transformations but can be quite readily altered and engineered . "
As more and more retirees go on Medicare and the costs rapidly escalate , the government shall more and more explicitly be making life and death decisions .
What we think is civilization in this regard is actually savagery .

It ’s here : the Google Phone .
After years of speculation and months of waiting , the first Google Android OS - based smartphone has finally been released by T - Mobile USA .
The device formally known as the G - 1 and made by HTC has started to ship and will be made available to those who have pre-ordered the phone sometime today .
T- Mobile USA sent me a pre-release review unit , and after playing around with it for a few days , I have some observations , which might help you make a buying decision about this device .
I am eschewing the traditional review format because there are dozens of very smart people who have reviewed the G - 1 after putting it through its paces .
Here are my major takeaways :
This is n’t an iPhone competitor .
If you look at it , you can very quickly see that the G - 1 is a Honda to iPhone ’s BMW .
After a few days of usage I have become increasingly convinced that people who like the Apple iPhone will find Google - based G - 1 aesthetically lacking .
[ digg=http://digg.com/hardware/The_Google_Phone_Review_The_Good_The_Bad_The_Ugly]
Maybe it ’s because I have been so conditioned by the iPhone ’s touch screen , but I do n’t care for too much buttons on a phone that has touch - screen ability , though it makes navigating through a complex array of features relatively easy .
I like the trackball , which makes flipping through features very easy as well .
The device is very easy to use overall .
It took me less than an hour to figure out how to use the phone — most of its features including touch - screen abilities , surfing and setting up the network — without as much as referring to the accompanying handbook even once .
Most people who use Windows XP or Vista for their daily computing will find the Google Android user interface remarkably familiar and find comfort using this device .
In other words , it will sell a lot of units .
And yes it is going to become a thorn in Windows Mobile ’s side .
What I like about the G - 1 Phone .
It has the width of a normal phone , and still packs a big enough screen to make web browsing via a great Webkit - based browser a meaningful experience .
( iPhone still has a better , bigger , crisper screen . )
The keyboard makes it easier to sift through a lot of emails , whether they are coming to your Gmail account or from your IMAP account .
Seamless instant messaging with Google Talk , Windows Live , AOL and Yahoo Messenger , and the cutest , funniest smiley icons based on the Android logo .
This has to be the best Mobile IM client on the planet !
Google Apps and Search are so tightly integrated into the phone that you often wonder why you do n’t use these services more often .
Amazingly robust operating system with little or no lag time .
It makes Windows Mobile feel like a retiree ; even the iPhone feels like a middle - aged person compared to Android OS .
A simple , easy and comfortable keyboard designed with real people in mind .
The keys are small but well spaced and comfortable to type with thumbs .
Music player supports MP3 , M4A ( iTunes AAC , DRM - free ) , AMR , WMA , MIDI , WAV , OGG Vorbis .
Phone part of this smartphone actually works like a phone , something I ca n’t unfortunately say about the iPhone .
Multitasking of apps is the best amongst all mobile platforms .
What I hate about the G - 1 .
G - 1 feels bulky in hand , even though it has svelte dimensions .
It is heavier than the iPhone : 5.6 ounces vs. the iPhone 3G , which weighs in at 4.7 ounces .
Despite the heft , the battery life is n’t superior to the iPhone if you have all networks ( including Wi - Fi ) turned on
Google Maps on G - 1 feels like a poor cousin of the iPhone - based Google Maps and Microsoft Maps on Windows Mobile .
Though I do like this feature , which uses the built - in compass on the phone to allow users to view locations and navigate 360 degrees by simply moving the phone with their hand .
G - 1 also lacks turn - by - turn directions .
Not enough built - in storage – the device comes with a puny 1GB MicroSD memory storage .
The AppStore when compared to the iPhone lacks in user experience , and reminds me of the carrier decks , which are awkward and non-intuitive .
And lastly , I hate the dialer on this phone .
It just is n’t good enough .
So what is my verdict ?
Will I recommend this phone to anyone out there looking for a smartphone ?
The answer is yes , especially if you do n’t much care for either Windows Mobile or Apple ’s iPhone device .

Swabs will be fed in to the ' Itemiser ' device to test for drugs Pub - goers in Aberdeen are facing a drugs test before entering bars as part of a crackdown by Grampian Police .
Officers in the force will be the first in Scotland to use an Itemiser - a device which can detect traces of drugs from hand swabs in a matter of seconds .
The test is voluntary , but customers will be refused entry if they do not take part .
They could be searched and even arrested if traces are found .
The device was trialled by the police force in the area earlier this year .
The Itemiser allows police officers or door staff to swab customers hands as they enter a pub or club .
It can tell almost instantly if drugs are present - including cocaine , cannabis , heroin and ecstasy .
The device can show three possible results : green , amber or red .
We hope that over time the model can be developed and used by community partnerships in other towns and cities across Scotland
Det Supt Willie MacColl
Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency Customers who get a green reading are allowed entry to the pub , those who get amber are given a drug information pack and those who get red could be searched by police .
If drugs are found on that person they could be arrested and a report could be sent to the procurator fiscal .
Police said the device deters unwanted drug dealers .
Det Supt Willie MacColl , national drugs co-ordinator for the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency ( SCDEA ) , said : " This project offers an opportunity for collaborative working to implement an alternative intervention that will help change attitudes and reduce demand for controlled drugs .
" We hope that over time the model can be developed and used by community partnerships in other towns and cities across Scotland to reduce the harm caused by drugs . "
Ch Insp Innes Walker , of Grampian Police , said that as a result of the trial period in October " people had a greater confidence that they could enjoy a night out without fear of encountering drugs " .
The Itemiser is already being used in pubs in England where concerns have been raised about the possibility of customers getting a positive reading simply by touching a surface where there are traces of drugs .
But a spokeswoman for the SCDEA said the device was able to tell the difference between this type of contamination and drug use .

Dying to Get High : Marijuana as Medicine ( New York University Press , 2008 ) is an important and accessible book — not heavy on academic jargon , but rather lively and engaging , like a true detective novel — with a broad appeal to those interested in the medical potential of cannabis , an end to the drug war , and grass roots activism .
I asked the co-authors how working on the book changed them .
WENDY CHAPKIS : I certainly was one of those people who thought that ' medical marijuana ' was probably mostly a way for Americans to get around ridiculously punitive drug laws .
It seemed like a reasonable strategy to me .
But the very first time I walked into a WAMM [ WoMens Alliance for Medical Marijuana ] membership meeting , looked around the room and saw people who were ghostly white and frail , people in wheelchairs , people huddled in small groups talking about a WAMM member who needed round the clock care , I realized that medical marijuana was no ' ruse . '
These were very ill people .
And , as I started doing interviews , the stories of the medicinal properties of pot blew me away .
 I wasnt the only one surprised to discover that marijuana did in fact have therapeutic effects .
Many patients were equally astonished .
Like me , they had been recreational users who appreciated the pleasurable effects of marijuana and were suspicious of the claim that the herb was medicine .
Then they started chemotherapy , for example , found themselves fighting off non -stop nausea , took a hit and the nausea disappeared .
Or they had intolerable nerve pain from multiple sclerosis , AIDS , or post - polio syndrome , used some cannabis tincture and the pain quieted down .
It was funny how surprised we all were that it really worked .
 I think this shows how effective drug - war propaganda really is .
Even ( or maybe especially ) people who are very familiar with marijuana are prepared to believe that it doesnt really work as a medicine .
Of course , since the discovery of the cannabinoid receptor system in the body ( and the production of endogenous cannabinoids ) , scientists have n't been at all surprised at the medical properties of the plant — which I guess helps explain why the feds have been so reluctant to allow any scientific research .
 In any case , this research really transformed my understanding of the effects of cannabis — including enriching my understanding of the therapeutic effects of the so - called high . 
The chapter on the high is one of my favorites because I think even the medical marijuna movement tends to downplay the psychoactive properties of the drug .
" They talk a lot about relief of ocular pressure , anti-nausea properties and the effect of cannabis on AIDS - wasting and relief of neuropathic pain , but there is very little discussion of the ways in which the psychoactive effects contribute to a sense of wellness for those who are seriously ill .
And that is no small thing . 
RICHARD WEBB :  Working with the WAMM has , indeed , been a transformative experience .
I have learned a great deal , and formed some of the most cherished and important relationships of my lifetime , but perhaps the most profound change for me has been the development of a new awareness of the importance of compassion and forgiveness .
Two events epitomize the many experiences that led to this change .
 The Gay Pride festival in San Francisco has been one of WAMMs most successful annual fundraising events .
One year , I was working T - shirt sales , and when I turned my back for a moment , someone in the crowd stole a pile of shirts .
Angry at the perpetrators and embarrassed about my carelessness , I told Valerie Corral , WAMMs executive director , about it , and all she said was ,  Well , let 's hope they get a good price for them , because they must need the money very badly . 
Val 's forgiveness was like an epiphany , a moment I will never forget .
It was as if a lifetime of blame and resentment had been lifted from my heart , and I became suddenly aware of the deep suffering that drives some people to behave badly .
 When I began my research on WAMM , one of the first people I got close to was an HIV patient named John Taylor .
As a result of his illness , John was desperately poor and physically debilitated , but he retained a sense of humor and joie de vivre that made him a pleasure to be around .
We eventually became best friends , and when at last John 's struggle against the disease became futile , I turned my living room into a hospice facility and , with the assistance of many WAMM members — most of whom were trying to manage their own devastating ailments —
I was able to provide John with a safe and comfortable place to live out his final ten weeks .
 These experiences , and many others of a similar nature , have almost completely altered my view of the world , my sense of who I am , and my beliefs about what is most important in life . 

A 20 - year game of Telephone
If you pay any attention to the endless debates over intellectual property policy in the United States , you 'll hear two numbers invoked over and over again , like the stuttering chorus of some Philip Glass opera : 750,000 and $ 200 to $ 250 billion .
The first is the number of U.S. jobs supposedly lost to intellectual property theft ; the second is the annual dollar cost of IP infringement to the U.S. economy .
These statistics are brandished like a talisman each time Congress is asked to step up enforcement to protect the ever - beleaguered U.S. content industry .
And both , as far as an extended investigation by Ars Technica has been able to determine , are utterly bogus .
" I have said it thrice , " wrote Lewis Carroll in his poem The Hunting of the Snark , " what I tell you three times is true . "
And by that standard , the Pythagorean Theorem is but schoolyard gossip compared with our hoary figures .
As our colleagues at Wired noted earlier this week , the 750,000 jobs figure can be found cited by the U.S. Department of Commerce , Customs and Border Patrol , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , among others .
Both feature prominently on TheTrueCosts.org , an industry site devoted to trumpeting the harms of piracy .
They 're invoked by the deputy director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .
And , of course , they 're a staple of indignant press releases from the congressional sponsors of tough - on - piracy legislation .
By more conventional standards of empirical verification , however , the numbers fare less well .
Try to follow the thread of citations to their source , and you encounter a fractal tangle of recursive reference that resembles nothing so much as the children 's game known , in less - PC times , as " Chinese whispers , " and these days more often called " Telephone . "
Usually , the most respectable - sounding authority to cite for the numbers ( the FBI for the dollar amount , Customs for the jobs figure ) is also the most prevalent — but in each case , that authoritative " source " proves to be a mere waystation on a long and tortuous journey .
So what is the secret origin of these ubiquitous statistics ?
What doomed planet 's desperate alien statisticians rocketed them to Kansas ?
Ars did its best to find the fountainhead .
Here 's what we discovered .
Looking for lost jobs
First , the estimate of 750,000 jobs lost .
( Is that supposed to be per year ?
A cumulative total over some undefined span ?
Those who cite the figure seldom say . )
Customs is most often given as the source for this , and indeed , you can find press releases from as recently as 2002 giving that figure as a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol estimate .
Eureka !
But when we contacted CBP to determine how they had arrived at that imposing figure , we were informed that it was , in essence , a goof .
The figure , Customs assured us , came from somewhere else , and was mistakenly described as the agency 's own .
This should come as no great surprise : CBP is an enforcement agency , whereas calculating the total loss of jobs from IP infringement would require some terrifyingly complex counterfactual modeling by trained economists .
Similar claims have appeared in Customs releases dating back at least to 1993 , but a CBP spokesperson assured us that the agency has never been in the business of developing such estimates in - house .
With Customs a dead end , we dove into press archives , hoping to find the earliest public mention of the elusive 750,000 jobs number .
And we found it in — this is not a typo — 1986 .
Yes , back in the days when " Papa Don't Preach " and " You Give Love a Bad Name " topped the charts , The Christian Science Monitor quoted then - Commerce Secretary Malcom Baldridge , trumpeting Ronald Reagan 's own precursor to the recently passed PRO - IP bill .
Baldridge estimated the number of jobs lost to the counterfeiting of U.S. goods at " anywhere from 130,000 to 750,000 . "
Where did that preposterously broad range come from ?
As with the number of licks needed to denude a Tootsie Pop , the world may never know .
Ars submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department of Commerce this summer , hoping to uncover the basis of Baldridge 's claim — or any other Commerce Department estimates of job losses to piracy — but came up empty .
So whatever marvelous proof the late secretary discovered was not to be found in the margins of any document in the government 's vaults .
But no matter :
By 1987 , that Brobdignagian statistical span had been reduced , as far as the press were concerned , to " as many as 750,000 " jobs .
Subsequent reportage dropped the qualifier .
The 750,000 figure was still being bandied about this summer in support of the aforementioned PRO - IP bill .
Frank McGarahan died in hospital the day after the attack
The brother of a banker fatally injured while trying to help two people being assaulted said he paid the " ultimate price " for being a good citizen .
Frank McGarahan , 45 , chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth , died after suffering head injuries in the attack in Norwich , early on Sunday .
Norfolk Police have arrested three local men , aged in their early 20s , in connection with the death .
Tony McGarahan said his brother 's death was a " mindless murder " .
He said his family would " never truly recover " from the loss and added his brother " did what was natural to him to try and help someone because they needed help " .
" He would not and could not stand by and watch a defenceless young lad and his girlfriend , who were in a taxi queue after enjoying being out together , being mindlessly attacked by a large group of grown men , " Mr McGarahan said .
Strip club bouncer
" We will always be proud of Frank and we will never ever forget him .
" We will never understand how or why anyone could murder such a decent , caring and loving man . "
Mr McGarahan said his family 's immediate priority was to care for his brother 's wife and children .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
He urged anyone with information " however small and insignificant " to come forward .
Meanwhile , the arrested men are currently in custody in police stations across Norfolk and will be interviewed later .
Norfolk Police said Mr McGarahan , from Hertfordshire , had been spending an evening out with friends and family .
He witnessed a 35 - year - old homeless Lithuanian man , who was walking his dog , being attacked while he walked with his girlfriend , 45 , from Norfolk , police said .
Officers added that a bouncer from a nearby strip club , Darryl Lawton , had his jaw fractured after intervening in the fight , which involved Mr McGarahan , his brother and cousin .
Det Supt Chris Hobley said : " ( Mr McGarahan ) witnessed an assault while queuing for a taxi on Guildhall Hill , after which he sustained a fatal injury .
" Officers are reviewing CCTV footage from around the city centre area and following up a number of lines of inquiry . "
Barclays Wealth employs 7,700 staff in 20 countries and manages assets worth £ 133bn .

Suicide blasts kill 29 in Somalia
Powerful explosions including a car bomb hit government buildings in northern Somalia killing at least 29 people and leaving several wounded , officials and witnesses say .
According to CNN , most of the victims were in the Somaliland capital , Hargeisa , where the presidential palace , Ethiopian consulate and UN offices were targeted .
“ We are still counting the bodies , ” said Ismail Adani , a spokesman for the government of Somaliland .
He said at least 29 people died in those assaults — not including an unknown number of suicide bombers — and that the death toll could get higher .
Also Wednesday , suicide bombers attacked two intelligence facilities in the northern Somali region of Puntland .
The two suicide bombers and a security official died in the attack , and five other officials were wounded , said Muse Gelle Yusuf , governor of Somalia ’s northern port city of Bossaso .
The region is a hotbed of abductions and piracy .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks .
Government officials blamed a militant Islamist group called the Shabab , which the United States considers a terrorist organization .
Somalia has been without a functioning government since 1991 , when dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted .
The current government was formed in 2004 with the help of the United Nations , but has failed to tackle the growing violence or the country ’s poverty .
When is a coincidence too much of a coincidence to be one ?
So now Ohio 2004 is revving up again .
Old news ?
Not old enough .
So many lame answers while so much remains unresolved .
For those of us troubled by eight years of election Ping - Pong , the evolving investigation of Bush - squared longtime IT confidante Michael Connell is encouraging .
But do n't stop there .
And do n't stop in Ohio .
Cast a wider net .
A veritable den of hands - on players lingers only one degree of separation from Michael Connell and George W. Bush : Florida Governor Jeb Bush , Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris , Florida Secretary of State Sandra Mortham , and U.S. Representative Tom Feeney , former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives .
All have been integrally involved in election flimflam .
--
So when is a coincidence too much of a coincidence to be one ?
When does a convergence of like - minded players embroiled in skullduggery constitute conspiracy ?
--
Michael Connell :
Briefly , for those who missed Mark Crispen Miller 's Tell McCain to Fire Mike Connell article on OpEdNews and the Connell articles on BradBlog , Mike Connell has been at the scene of virtually every electoral scandal of the past decade , including running Florida computers during the 2000 election , and Ohio election computers during the 2004 election .
Connell has worked for the Bush political network since 1986 .
He built Jeb 's website ... and he 's currently working for John McCain . ( 1 )
--
But Connell 's not alone .
--
Jeb & George :
Jeb and George .
Jeb and Michael . Jeb and Katherine .
Jeb and Sandra . Jeb and Tom. Jeb and 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 .
Culpability by association , intent or manipulation .
In Florida at least , Jeb in his prime was the hub of all things elections .
His broad reach is illustrated in part by the actions of his friends and their own influence on elections .
More specific detail on Jeb is provided in the section titled Florida 's Governor Jeb Bush below .
--
Jeb & Sandra .
Florida Secretary of State Sandra Mortham :
Former Secretary of State Sandra Mortham was the ES&S lobbyist who convinced the Florida Association of Counties to endorse ES&S .
In exchange for the Association 's endorsement , ES&S paid the Association a fee each time ES&S won a county contract .
( Matthew Haggman , " Buyer ' Remorse . "
( 2 ) In the end , ES&S received orders totaling more than $ 70 million in taxpayer money from 12 counties , while the Florida Association of Counties received kickbacks of approximately $ 300,000 .
( 3 ) See more on ES&S below .
--
The Mortham factor is interesting , but not remarkable unless of course one considers Mortham 's relationship with Jeb Bush .
Mortham was Jeb Bush 's first - choice running mate in 1998 .
When selecting Mortham , Jeb said , " I wanted someone who was my friend , someone who could serve with distinction as governor ...
She is far and away the most qualified person to be part of this team and it is a team . ( 4 )
--
By January , Sandra Mortham withdrew over ethical and spending lapses . ( 5 )
--
Jeb & Tom. Governor Jeb Bush 's 1994 running mate , U.S. Rep Tom Feeney :
Republican Congressman Tom Feeney was Jeb 's running mate the first time Jeb ran for governor in 1994 and lost .
Then in 2000 , as speaker of the Florida House , Feeney was instrumental in leading the Legislature to seat George W. Bush as president while the election debacle was still playing out in the courts .

Mitch Mitchell , the iconic drummer who provided the explosive heartbeat of the Jimi Hendrix Experience on rock classics including " Voodoo Child ( Slight Return ) " and " Purple Haze , " was found dead early Wednesday in a Portland hotel room .
Mitchell , 61 , who pioneered a fusion style that allowed him and one of history 's greatest guitar players to feed off each other , died of natural causes , the Multnomah County medical examiner said .
He was found about 3 a.m. in his room at the Benson Hotel in downtown Portland .
Considered one of rock 's greatest drummers , Mitchell was behind the kit at Hendrix 's legendary sets at Woodstock , Monterey and the Isle of Wight .
Mitchell 's final performance was Friday night at Portland 's Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall .
It was the last stop on the West Coast leg of the Experience Hendrix tribute tour .
Looking pale and tired , he played only one song before the sold - out crowd , said Terry Currier , owner of the Music Millennium record shop .
" A friend who was waiting outside the Schnitz to get an autograph told me he saw a couple people helping Mitch walk into the auditorium that night , " Currier said .
" He did n't seem to be in great health . "
Born in England in 1947 , John " Mitch " Mitchell was a child actor who quickly moved on to music , becoming an accomplished jazz drummer before the age of 20 .
Eventually , he became Hendrix 's most important musical collaborator , said Jacob McMurray , senior curator at the Experience Music Project in Seattle , Hendrix 's boyhood home .
The museum 's centerpiece is the world 's largest collection of Jimi Hendrix artifacts and memorabilia , including the drum set Mitchell played at Woodstock in 1969 .
" Jimi was an amazing guitarist and he needed somebody behind the drum kit who could hold his own , " McMurray said .
" That was Mitch Mitchell . "
At 5 - foot - 5 , the wild - haired Mitchell was a small guy who played " lead drums , " combining meat - and - potatoes beats with rapid - fire jazz in the three - person group .
He was inducted into the Rock ' n ' Roll Hall of Fame as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1992 .
Hendrix 's manager treated both Mitchell and original bassist Noel Redding as paid employees , limiting their rights to future revenue .
In the 1970s , according to Eddie Kramer 's book " Hendrix : Setting the Record Straight , " Mitchell was forced to sell a prized Hendrix guitar to pay the bills .
" The bonds between Jimi and Mitch kept them together , " McMurray said .
Mitchell and Hendrix recorded several tracks on their own , including " Fire , " " Voodoo Child " and " Manic Depression , " before bringing in Redding to finish them , McMurray said .
Hendrix died after a drug overdose in 1970 .
Redding was 57 when he died in 2003 .
Bob Merlis , a publicist for the Experience Hendrix tour , said Mitchell obviously was n't feeling well during the last couple stops on the 17 - date tour .
" We thought it was the flu , " Merlis said .
Mitchell told Merlis he planned to stay in Portland for a few days to wind down from the tour before heading home to his wife , Dee , in England .
Sgt. Brian Schmautz , a Portland police spokesman , said an employee at the Benson called police after discovering Mitchell 's body .
Since police did n't suspect any foul play , Schmautz said , " we were n't involved beyond that . "
Tom Chappelle , a deputy medical examiner for Multnomah County , said Dr. Christopher Young conducted the autopsy on Mitchell 's body Wednesday afternoon .
" At this point , we 're still saying natural causes , " Chappelle said .
" Cliff wants to talk to ( Mitchell 's ) family first before releasing additional details . "
Merlis said Mitchell was a " really warm , enthusiastic guy who was a lot of fun .
He did n't hold back and liked to talk about Jimi " from their first meeting in a sleazy London club in 1966 to watching Hendrix light his guitar on fire at the Monterey Pop Festival a year later .
Judging from Mitchell 's MySpace page , most of his friends and fans had not heard about his death by late Wednesday .
The last post was from Sept. 27 .
On July 9 , a fan wished him happy birthday .
But at Trade Up Music in Southeast Portland , the instrument shop 's 27 - year - old drum specialist remembered Mitchell as a " mind - blowing " musician .
" He came along at a great time , " said Joey Ficken , who also plays in the band Sea Wolf .
" He came along when there were n't really rock guitarists and rock drummers , and all these styles of music came together .
People were seeing something they had never seen before . "
These days , drummers tend to stay in the background .
They really are n't like Mitchell any more , Ficken said .
" He was a star .
People still idolize him . "

I 'm a hopeless romantic and my one true love is food -- so when it betrays me , I am especially hurt .
On Monday I ambled into my local Whole Foods ( which is the equivalent of a candy addict going into a candy store or a porn addict into a porn store ) , eagerly surveyed its wonderful products , and chose some of the 365 Everyday bacon ( the store brand ) .
Unfortunately , I accidentally bought the low - sodium bacon , which I did n't realize until about twenty minutes ago .
I 'd opened the bacon the day I bought it and it seemed fine , but when I reopened the package today , it smelled kind of like ammonia and was browning around the sides .
Bacon , even if it's low sodium , should last a few weeks - that 's one of the Ten Food Commandments .
And this had only been three days !
I 'm a college student , though , and unless there 's enough mold on something to make it look like an active ecological society , I will not throw it out .
But that necessitated that I use ALL of the bacon today - about nine strips in a meal for one .
So If I die tonight from clogged arteries , blame 365 Everyday brand low - sodium bacon .

Khalil Meek , a longtime spokesman for a coalition of Holy Land Foundation supporters called Hungry for Justice , which includes national Muslim and civil rights groups , said supporters were “ devastated ” by the verdict .

“ We respect the jury ’s decision , but we disagree and we think the defendants are completely innocent , ” Mr. Meek said .
“ For the last two years we ’ve watched this trial unfold , and we have yet to see any evidence of a criminal act introduced to a jury .
This jury found that humanitarian aid is a crime . ”
He added , “ We intend to appeal the verdict , and we remain convinced that we will win . ”
The prosecutor , Barry Jonas , told jurors in closing arguments last week that they should not be deceived by the foundation ’s cover of humanitarian work , describing the charities it financed as terrorist recruitment centers that were part of a “ womb to the tomb ” cycle .
After the mistrial last year , critics said the government had offered a weak , complicated case and had failed to recognize that juries were not as quick to convict Muslim defendants accused of supporting terrorism as they had once been .
Prosecutors spent more time in the second trial explaining the complexities of the case and painting a clearer picture of the money trail .
They also dropped many of the original charges .
“ Today ’s verdicts are important milestones in America ’s efforts against financiers of terrorism , ” Patrick Rowan , assistant attorney general for national security , said in a statement .
Mr. Rowan added that the prosecution “ demonstrates our resolve to ensure that humanitarian relief efforts are not used as a mechanism to disguise and enable support for terrorist groups . ”
Nancy Hollander , a lawyer from Albuquerque who represented Mr. Abu-Baker , said the defendants would appeal based on a number of issues , including the anonymous testimony of an expert , which she said was a first .
“ Our clients were not even allowed to review their own statements because they were classified  statements that they made over the course of many years that the government wiretapped , ” Ms. Hollander said .
“ They were not allowed to go back and review them .
There were statements from alleged co-conspirators that included handwritten notes .
Nobody knew who wrote them ; nobody knew when they were written .
There are a plethora of issues . ”

Shining stars from America 's comedy universe gathered Monday in Washington to honor the late , great George Carlin with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor .
Jon Stewart , Denis Leary , Bill Maher , Joan Rivers , Lily Tomlin and more congregated at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to pay their respects and recall how Carlin shaped their careers and made hard work seem like nothing but laughs .
" For all his anti-establishment cred , he was a working man , " Stewart told the crowd , according to the Associated Press .
" He punched in .
He sat down and he wrote .
He respected what he did . "
Others did not :
The event was greeted by some protesters with signs reading " Carlin 's Going to Hell . "
For his part , Carlin would probably have been flattered by that .
After all , he thrived on commentary and confrontation , dissecting language , logic and hypocrisy better than nearly all his peers and followers .
His infamously insightful " Seven Words You Can't Say on Television " routine made it all the way to the Supreme Court .
And his sociopolitical salvos burned either side of the red - blue divide .
" On certain things you 'd call him a lefty .
On other things , you'd be surprised how conservative he might be , " his best friend and former manager Jerry Hamza told the AP .
" [ But he ] would have been humbly grateful " for the award , Hamza added .
Throughout his career [ Carlin ] was perceived as an outsider or maverick , [ but ] had a real desire to connect with other comedians .
He loved being in that club . "
Being compared to previous Mark Twain Prize - winners like Richard Pryor , Steve Martin , Billy Crystal and Lily Tomlin is one thing .
But being compared to Mark Twain is quite another , as the author was not only a master of language and satire , but a timeless chronicler of American society and its discontents .
His work has transcended time itself – no easy feat , and one that Tomlin and Crystal might have difficulty with down the road .
But I believe Carlin will not .
When it comes to the great subjects of the 20th century – war , media , advertising , racism , consumption , governance – and even the little ones – where you put all your stuff , bad drivers , fussy eaters – Carlin is almost unparalleled in his wit and critique .
He was an exceptional American , and a top - shelf satirist whose rants will live on through the 21st century .
Rest in peace , you cranky , brilliant bastard .

Created by students from the Upper Austria University of Applied Science for the Hexapod Robot competition that happens yearly , this dancing robot strutted its six legs , costumed with hat , sunglasses and Ali - G looking goat tee and used its metal joints to prove it has got rhythm .
It is no wonder it is the winner , for it is highly entertaining !
After you watch the Hexapod Robot presentation below , you could imagine what an entertaining competition this must have been .
I mean , this robot is dancing , moving its stuff , and if I did n’t know any better , would say it is probably having a hell of a good time ; almost as much of a good time as the Singing Robots seem to have .

I do n't usually take much notice of car ads on TV .
But this one had me leaping out of my chair .
Toyota , said the closing caption , is working towards making a car that will " clean the air " as it drives .
What could this mean ?
I knew they made the pioneering Prius hybrid car , which has among the lowest carbon dioxide emissions around .
But cleaning the air is a bit different .
Makes it sound like the more you drive the happier the planet will be .
It turns out that Toyota is not the only car - maker to have this magic trick up its sleeve .
BMW too .
At the Detroit Auto Show over the summer , BMW launched a hydrogen - fuelled " eco supercar that cleans the air as it drives " .
In research carried out by the prestigious Argonne National Laboratory in the US , its emissions were so low that they were " undetectable by standard emissions tests " , the company claims .
What 's this nonsense about ?
Well this is a classic case of highly selective use of statistics .
You see , what the world is mainly worried about in car emissions is the carbon dioxide — the stuff that is warming the planet .
Buy a Toyota and your emissions will range from 104g / km for a Prius up to 270g / km for a top - of - the - range Land Cruiser .
What the ad copywriters are talking about is not carbon dioxide , but carbon monoxide .
This is nasty stuff in large quantities , to be sure .
But it is n't warming the planet .
What BMW 's hydrogen car does " in tests " is emit gas through its tailpipe that contains less carbon monoxide than the surrounding air .
In fact , somewhere deep in the system the engine breaks down carbon monoxide .
Well done , guys .
But it is not cleaning the air in any sense that you or I might understand it .
Sure , hydrogen cars do n't emit much carbon dioxide either , but very large amounts are emitted where the hydrogen is made .
Is this greenwash ?
Well , not in the sense that you could be conned into buying a BMW hydrogen car under the impressions that the more you drove it the cleaner the atmosphere would be .
BMW has no plans for mass production of its hydrogen car .
It plans , apparently , to hand a few out to high - profile opinion formers .
So for now , all this is about trying to burnish the company 's image , rather than sell you anything specific .
That impression was reinforced when I finally got to the small print of what Toyota is saying about its own plans to clean the air .
They do n't actually have an atmosphere - cleaning car for sale either .
" We are , " the small print says , " moving forward toward our ultimate idea : a car that cleans the air as it drives .
Is this absurd ?
Maybe ... "
They said it .
But it 's obviously not too absurd to be put in rather large letters across our TV screens .
The better to convince us that Toyota are – in some vague , aspirational , even " absurd " sense — good for the planet .
Greenwash .
But why single out these two companies ?
Many car makers are finding new and ingenious ways to green the image of their products without actually breaking any advertising rules .
" Why does a 4x4 have to cost the earth ? " asks
Ford in the glossy ads for its new Kuga .
I do n't know , but the numbers bleeding off the top edge of the page reveal that the Kuga 's official CO2 emissions are 169g a kilometre – which is way above the 130g target being set by the European Union for an average car .
But at least Ford are doing better than Land Rover .
As one reader of this column observed of that company 's " Our Planet " campaign to persuade us to buy its vehicles : " If that is n't greenwash , I 'm a painted coconut . "
Land Rover 's claim to a " fragile Earth commitment " seems to boil down to the fact that " conservationists and environmentalists " drive them ( maybe so ) ; that the company is improving its technology ( who is n't ? ) ; that it has two wind turbines at its Dagenham factory ( good show ) ; and that it is investing in carbon dioxide offset projects ( which it is ) .
But the problem remains what comes out of the exhaust pipe .
The company boasts that since it was formed 60 years ago , " our vehicles have always had a unique relationship with Our Planet " .
Well yes , but with officially declared CO2 emissions that range from 194g to a staggering 376g per kilometre that " unique relationship " seems to be that they are among the most polluting vehicles on the planet .
Nothing to do with languages .
Sounds like a sailing term to me .
A rudder is the flat piece of material at the back of a boat which allows the captain to steer the boat .
Double means two .
And Dutch means coming from the Netherlands ( a country with a strong tradition in seafaring ) .
I 'm just guessing ( not being familiar with the context ) that it 's a rudder with two flat pieces of wood or fiberglass , or whatever they would be made of , and they are made in a Dutch fashion .

Banks making credit card loans have reached a point where they can lose less by forgiving part of the debt than seeing the consumer walk away entirely .
WASHINGTON 
To head off surging credit card defaults , banks and consumer groups are lobbying regulators to make it easier to forgive a portion of struggling consumers ' credit card debt .
The proposal — and the unusual partnership by two groups typically at odds with each other — underscores the severity of the economic downturn , and the fear that credit cards could provide the next shock to the financial system .
This year , delinquent credit card accounts hit a six - year high of 4.9 % .
Meanwhile , charge - offs — when banks give up on collecting debt — have been rising for about two years , hitting 5.47 % in the second quarter , the latest data available , according to the Federal Reserve .
Credit card and mortgage losses have dragged down banks ' earnings .
Banks are proposing that they forgive up to 40 % of the credit card debt owed by the most financially stressed consumers , who are close to bankruptcy .
These consumers would then get five years to pay off their remaining card debt , interest - free .
Banks would pilot this program with 50,000 consumers , in hopes of expanding it to tens of thousands of others .
Banks do n't need regulatory approval to forgive credit card debt .
But they want the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to waive a rule that requires them to book losses on forgiven debt the same year .
" Banks do n't need more losses right now , " says Scott Talbott , a senior vice president at the Financial Services Roundtable , which represents large banks .
In an Oct. 29 letter to the OCC , the Roundtable and the Consumer Federation of America , an advocacy group , said that the new program " would be in the best interest of consumers , lenders and the American economy — especially in the current climate . "
OCC spokesman Robert Garsson said the agency has received the letter and is reviewing it .
For banks , the benefit of such a program is that they'd be able to recover a portion of the debt owed , rather than possibly writing off the entire debt because the consumer can't pay .
It 's getting harder for banks to collect credit card debt , says David Robertson , publisher of industry newsletter , the Nilson Report .
In the next five years , the amount of credit card debt that banks wo n't be able to collect will grow 47 % to $ 340 billion , he says .

The Parrot Developer Summit last month was incredibly productive .
One of the biggest results was a roadmap for the next several years of releases , starting with the 1.0 production release in March 2009 .
Many of us on the project have been treating 1.0 as the perfect release where all features we could ever hope for are completed .
But the simple fact is , there will always be interesting new features to add to the project , and that 's a good thing .
The paradigm shift for the new release plan is to start treating 1.0 more like we already treat our regular monthly releases .
So , here 's the plan :
We 'll continue with our monthly development releases , which set a healthy pattern in the development cycle .
Starting with the 1.0 release next March , and every July and January after that , two releases a year will be stable releases .
The stable releases will be numbered X.0 and X.5 ( 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , etc ) , to set them apart from the development releases , where X.0 is the January release , and X.5 is the July half - year release .
The stable releases are the ones that will be packaged for distributions like Ubuntu , Debian , Red Hat , and SuSE , installation systems like Fink or MacPorts , and binary builds for various OS's .
Monthly releases will not be packaged , though critical bug and security fixes will be maintained in updated packages ( 1.0.1 , 1.0.2 , etc ) .
Most language developers will work from the stable releases so they do n't need to track the rapid pace of development in the main source repository or monthly development releases .
The stable releases will also set the pace of the deprecation cycle for development .
Parrot 's current deprecation cycle is one release ( one month ) , so any feature that 's marked as deprecated in one release is fair game to remove in the next release .
This policy has been healthy for cleaning out old cruft , but it 's also hard on the language developers .
Starting with 1.0 , the deprecation cycle will follow the stable releases instead of the monthly development releases , so any feature that 's marked as deprecated when , for example , the 1.5 release is shipped , can be removed from the 2.0 release , but will continue to be supported for the 6 months until the 2.0 release .
Each stable release has a particular focus that defines what features are critical for that release .
The focus for the 1.0 release is " a stable API for language developers " .
Parrot is n't a language , it 's a virtual machine and set of powerful tools for language implementors .
So , the first audience we have to address is those implementors , and 1.0 will provide them with a complete set of core subsystems and feature - rich compiler tools , with the guarantee that the interface will only change on the standard 6 month deprecation cycle .
1.0 also marks the point where we 're willing to support Parrot in production environments .
This does n't mean we expect a thousand companies to run out and ship Parrot - based products the next month .
A three - year adoption cycle is a fairly standard pattern in the industry , so that 's what we 're planning for .
The first year is the early adopters , the second year is initial production use , and the third year is more substantial production use .
The next few years of stable releases are planned around the ideas of the adoption cycle and deprecation cycle , and to make sure we always have a few interesting new features to look forward to in each release .
The focus of the 1.5 release is " integration , interoperation , and embedding " meeting the needs of the second largest group of early adopters .
The focus of 2.0 is " production users " , that is the little extra bit of spit and polish to make Parrot and its major language implementations appealing to the second - year production adopters .
2.5 is about " portability " , supporting more platforms , more languages , and the needs of a larger and more diverse user - base .
3.0 is about " independence " , removing the last traces of Perl and Python from the build and testing frameworks , and running everything on system - available build tools , on Parrot , or on a bootstrapped mini-parrot .
3.5 we call " green fields " , for ponies , unicorns , marshmallows , and a theme song by Brian Eno .
No , seriously , at that point our current vision for the core of Parrot is fully implemented , and we anticipate substantial production use .
Gradually over the three - year adoption cycle , the focus will shift from developing Parrot itself to developing interesting things with Parrot : applications , games , desktop extensions , teaching tools , research projects , domain - specific or experimental languages , installer frameworks for Linux distributions , lightweight dynamic language support on embedded devices , and a host of other uses for a next - generation open source virtual machine .
I can't wait to see where human imagination takes us .
Amphibian species have been facing a steep decline for decades , in large part because of a fungus , climate change , and environment disruption .
As many as one - third of the world ’s 6,300 amphibian species are threatened with extinction , and researchers fear their loss could wreak havoc on our ecosystem and food webs .
Here are landmark studies that have defined the problems and — we hope — will help humans to figure out how to save their froggy friends .
1 The long - term perspective In August 2008 two researchers at University of California at Berkeley published a meta- analysis titled “ Are we in the midst of the sixth mass extinction ? ”
The global assessment highlighted the threat of chytridiomycosis , an infectious , rapidly spreading disease caused by a waterborne fungus .
2 The seminal study The study “ Statusand Trends of Amphibian Declines and Extinctions Worldwide ” [ subscription required ] showed one - third of the world ’s 6,300 amphibian species are threatened with extinction ( compared with just 12 percent of all bird species and 23 percent of mammal species ) .
The authors concluded that scientists must begin captive breeding .
3 Problems with captive breeding A September 2008 study published in Current Biology said captive breeding program accidentally introduced the chytridfungus that causes chytridiomycosis into Mallorca in 1991 ; an endangered frog species was housed in the same room as a group of toads , and the frogs spread the chytrid fungus to the toads .
The fungus was not known at this time , so health screening of the toads did not reveal the problem .
4 Extinction rates According to a 2007 study in the Journal of Herpetology , amphibian species are becoming extinct 211 times faster than the “ normal extinction rate , ” the standard rate of extinction in history before humans became a primary contributing factor .
And if you count those species “ in imminent danger of extinction , ” that rate climbs to a whopping 45,474 times faster than normal .
5 The global - warming theory
It is unclear how the chytrid fungus spreads .
A 2006 study in Nature blamed global warming , for creating ideal conditions shifts temperatures to those more agreeable to the fungus ’ growth and reproduction — between 63° and 77°F .
But there were many outspoken skeptics of this claim ( see study # 6 ) .
6 Skeptics of the global - warming theory A March 2008
PLoS Biology
paper said there is “ no evidence to support ” the global - warming hypothesis .
Instead , researchers said , the pattern of the fungus ’ spread was typical of an emerging infectious disease ; they call their theory the “ spreading pathogen hypothesis . ”
The authors suggested governments and environmental agencies can help prevent the fungus ’ spread by regulating potential infection routes , such as the ornamental plant and aquarium wildlife trade .
7 Problems with insecticides October 2008 ’s Ecological Applications study suggests malathion , the most common insecticide in the U.S. , can devastate tadpole populations even at doses too small to kill individual tadpoles .
Researchers created simulated ponds in 300 - gallon outdoor tanks , placed tadpoles inside , and exposed the ponds to no malathion , a single moderately concentrated dose , or low concentrations in weekly doses similar to the exposure tadpoles experience in ( human- altered ) nature .
Even the small amounts of malathion set off a chain of events that caused a decline of tadpoles ’ primary food source : bottom - dwelling algae .
Consequently , half the tadpoles in the experiment did not reach maturity and would have died in nature .
8 Afungus - free country Oddly , none of the many known amphibian species in Madagascar have been driven to extinction ; the island also shows no signs of the chytrid fungus , according toa May 2008 PLoS Biology paper .
Because the amphibians in Madagascar are doing so well , the authors argue the region is one of the best places to focus future research efforts .
They hope to find out what helps amphibians in Madagascar thrive , as they suffer steep declines elsewhere .
9 Beating the fungus Introducing probiotic bacteria into the ecosystem could help lessen the effects of chytridiomycosis , according to research presented in June 2008 at the 108th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology .
The tests indicated that adding pedobacter , a bacterial species that occurs naturally on the skin of red - backed salamanders , to the skin of mountain yellow - legged frogs decreased chytrid ’s deadly effects .
10 Evolving more slowly than the environment A May 2007 study in BioScience attributed amphibians ’ decline to their inability to adapt to the current rapid rate of global change .
The authors noted the aforementioned pesticide pollution and chytrid infections , as well as habitat loss and UV - B light exposure that causes mutations in amphibian eggs .
Amphibians are particularly vulnerable because they have permeable skin , ability to live on both land and water , and eggs without shells .
Perhaps most detrimental is their complex life cycle , which makes evolution an even slower process .
Mesa police say an impaired driver triggered a crash early Saturday that killed a 16 - year - old girl and injured her 17 - year - old brother as they drove to a school - band event .
Manuel Contreras - Galdean , 32 , was arrested and booked into a Maricopa County jail on suspicion of manslaughter and aggravated assault .
Authorities also placed an immigration hold on him after it was determined that he was in the country illegally .
Police said Contreras - Galdean was at the wheel of a red Dodge Ram about 6:30 a.m. when he turned left in front of a Nissan Sentra carrying the teens .
Their collision occurred at Guadalupe and Sossaman roads , according to Sgt. Ed Wessing , a Mesa police spokesman .
The teenage girl suffered massive head trauma .
Her brother , the driver , had non-life - threatening injuries .
Police declined to identify the siblings , who were on their way to perform in the Gilbert Days Parade .
Band members and parents confirmed the pair were students at Highland High School .
Jay Thompson , whose daughter Lauren is a freshman in the band , said he and his wife , Francy , arrived at the school on Saturday morning to volunteer .
" There was just shock and grief and sadness . . . it was just horrible , " Thompson said .
" We just all cried and hugged . "
Band officials pulled out of the parade .
Mesa police said the girl died in the operating room .
Hayden Horsman , a freshman band member , said students were devastated .
" They were amazed that something could happen to somebody our age , " said Horsman , 14 .
John McCain 's statement in the debate that ACORN and the liberals are " on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history ... maybe destroying the fabric of democracy " is probably the most overwrought , ridiculous statement by a major - party nominee in living memory .
If you make a charge that serious , you better have something to back it up .
McCain has nothing .
Nada zero zilch .
There is no evidence of any attempt to rig or steal this election .
Just think about the scale of the effort it would take to do what McCain describes .
On a statewide level , you would need an army of thousands of co-conspirators willing and able to vote repeatedly and illegally just to have any hope whatsoever of altering the outcome , and according to the GOP fantasy , those thousands consist of homeless drunks and drunk addicts .
Yet out of this alleged conspiracy of thousands in which lowlife drunks and dopers play a large part , the GOP and its allies in the Justice Department and other governnment agencies can't find a single participant willing to admit to the conspiracy and cough up the truth ?
To rational people , that would suggest that no such conspiracy exists .
But rationality has nothing to do with it .

There 's something in the psyche of the GOP base that needs to believe they are victims of some ill - defined but clearly treacherous group plotting against them and the country .
How else can they explain the fact that they 're losing ?
It ca n't be because they have proved themselves incompetent at governance , or that they have lost touch with the reality of life in 21st century America .
There has to be some other reason , and if there is n't they 'll invent one .
In the 2006 cycle , that need was fulfilled by Moveon . org .
The rightwing blogs and punditocracy could n't utter a paragraph without weaving Moveon into their narrative somehow .
It was never quite clear how Moveon could possibly do all the nefarious things it was alleged to be doing , but that uncertainty made the right - wing fantasy all the more alluring .
This year , Moveon still exists - it 's still doing what it was doing before , yet the group is rarely if even mentioned .
That 's because ACORN has now been cast to replace it in the role of designated villain .
On Friday , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Ohio Republicans in their effort to try to challenge 200,000 voters .
Two hundred thousand !!
Republican officials fear the verdict of the American people .
They fear the wrath of those Americans drawn into political participation by anger at the direction that the GOP has tried to take their country .
And they are trying desperately , frantically , to try to prevent that verdict from being delivered .
Seventeen days to election day .
Sen . Specter : Telecom immunity is ' festering wound ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , says he is prepared to move forward with the confirmation of Barack Obama 's Attorney General nominee Eric Holder , who he hopes will help " reprofessionalize " the Justice Department .
Specter , who has been among the most vocal critics within President Bush 's party , criticized former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for politicizing the department .
The Pennsylvania Republican also criticized some of the president 's policies in the war on terror .
" This business of wiretapping is not in order in accordance with Constitutional rights and where you have the immunity granted to the telephone companies , " Specter told MSNBC 's Andrea Mitchell Wednesday .
" That is still a festering wound and some speculation as to whether that will be asserted by a new administration . "
Congress passed an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act this summer that included retroactive legal immunity for telecommunications companies that participated in the president 's warrantless surveillance of Americans .
Obama said he was against immunity but nonetheless supported the bill .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said the Senate will revisit the FISA update when it considers renewing the Patriot Act later next year .s

Harry Bubbins likes to plant things .
When his friend Bradley Will was shot dead covering antigovernment protests in Mexico nearly two years ago , he planted a tree in the South Bronx to honor the slain journalist .
This week , days after the Mexican government arrested two leftist protesters in connection with Mr. Will ’s murder , Mr. Bubbins is again planting things .
Himself , on a Midtown sidewalk .
In an admittedly extreme move to draw attention to what he — and numerous human rights groups — say is a cover - up by Mexican authorities , Mr. Bubbins is on a four - day hunger strike outside the Third Avenue office of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
He and Robert Jereski , a writer who also knew Mr. Will , are urging Senator Clinton to compel the Mexican authorities to thoroughly investigate the murder , as well as ask her to oppose a United States government initiative to send hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for drug enforcement efforts in Mexico and Central America .
A spokesman for Senator Clinton had not responded to a request for comment as of Thursday afternoon .
Next week will bring the second anniversary of Mr. Will ’s death .
His friends and supporters believe he taped the men who fatally shot him .
And Mexico ’s own National Commission on Human Rights — a government agency — has criticized and contradicted federal prosecutors who insisted last week that the fatal shots came from protesters at close range .
“ Until there is justice for Brad , and the other journalists who have died in Mexico , we should not send money to a government that violates people ’s rights , ” Mr. Bubbins said .
“ You saw the pictures .
These guys are out these on the loose .
They ’re not in jail . ”
The Committee to Protect Journalists — which has listed Mexico as among the most dangerous places for reporters — also views the recent arrests with skepticism .
“ From the various elements taken from the experts who analyzed the size of the wounds , ballistic evidence and other forensics , the shot could not have come from close range , ” said Carlos Lauria , the Americas program coordinator .
“ To say they did is insane .
The prosecutors did this without giving us their reasoning .
It is insane what they are doing . ”
Pedestrians along Third Avenue might think Mr. Bubbins is insane for camping out next to a parking meter by a loading zone .
They walk past , cellphones to their ears , carrying on one - sided conversations while striding past the quiet protest .
On Wednesday , Mr. Bubbins was wrapped in a blanket and leaning against a meter while Mr. Jereski engaged a young man in conversation .
Zool Zulkowitz , a fellow activist , handed out fliers to passers - by , walking alongside them while he recited quick facts about the case .
“ Hi , ” he said .
“ Our friend Brad Will was murdered in Mexico by Mexican paramilitaries .
We demand our government investigate . ”
Some waved him off .
Others took the flier and kept on walking .
One man tried to silence him with a glare and a threat that involved a coffee cup , incest and Mr. Zulkowitz ’s head .
But people have also stopped to talk to the protesters .
“ They might have walked by the first day , ” Mr. Bubbins said .
“ But then they see we ’re still here .
We tried to set up a meeting with Senator Clinton a couple of weeks ago , but nobody responded .
Now we ’re here .
Now we can meet right here . ”

Despite its looks , Buran was not a facsimile of the US shuttle Some 20 years ago , on 30 September 1988 , many readers of the Pravda newspaper - the official mouthpiece of the Soviet communist party - could not believe their eyes .
Published somewhat inconspicuously on the second page , there was a photo depicting the familiar shape of the US space shuttle , but with Soviet insignia on its wings .
Finally , years of rumours about a Soviet " copy " of the shuttle had been confirmed .
However , the official Soviet press was quick to point out that despite its superficial resemblance to the US counterpart , the Russian shuttle , dubbed Buran or " snowstorm " , was better and more capable .
Within days , the new ship got a chance to prove it .
On November 15 , 1988 , as snowy clouds and winds were swirling around Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan , the Buran orbiter , attached to its giant Energia rocket , thundered into the gloomy early morning sky .
They obliterated this crowning achievement of the Soviet space programme
Three hours and two orbits later , the 100 - tonne bird glided back to a flawless landing just a few miles from its launch pad .
Despite the kind of strong winds that would rule out any launch or landing attempt by the US space shuttle , Buran touched down just 3 m off the runway centreline .
And this planet - wide ballet was performed with its " pilots " safely on the ground .
Born of paranoia Buran 's pioneering mission was the culmination of an effort by more than 600 Soviet institutions which , since 1976 , had secretly laboured on this largest of Soviet space projects .
Upon the spacecraft 's triumphant landing , the Soviet newspapers promised a new era in space exploration .
Few could predict at the time that it would be Buran 's only mission .
Unlike Nasa , Soviet developers never had any grand illusions about replacing traditional rockets with a reusable space truck .
Instead , the Soviet shuttle was conceived primarily as a " symmetrical response " to the perceived military threat from America 's winged orbiters .
A fully assembled Energia rocket with the first flown Buran orbiter , in 2002
Years after a sceptical Pentagon had given up on the shuttle , even as a delivery truck for spy satellites , the Russian officials continued whispering to journalists that the US orbiter had a secret capability - to make an undetected " dive " into the Earth 's atmosphere and suddenly glide over Moscow dropping nuclear bombs .
Never mind that such a scenario was not supported by physics or by common sense .
Energia - Buran 's chief architect , Valentin Glushko , hardly tried to educate warmongers at the Politburo about the questionable merits of the re-usable orbiter as a weapon .
Glushko was one of the first generation of Soviet rocket pioneers , who were experimenting in the 1930s under the tutelage of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky - one of the " fathers " of spaceflight .
Like many of his contemporaries , he had little interest in designing weapons .
He did dream , however , about building a permanent base on the surface of the Moon .
Unfortunately , after losing the Moon race to America in 1969 , Soviet leaders had little appetite for another deep - space adventure .
The launch and test facility where the Energia rocket first took off in 1987 Still , Glushko probably hoped to exploit Cold War paranoia about the threat of the US shuttle as an opportunity to lay a detour road to the Moon , and possibly even to Mars .
Glushko carefully steered the Soviet shuttle project away from being a carbon copy of the American design , which could not be easily modified .
Instead , he proposed a winged orbiter along with a fully functional rocket which could carry any cargo - including lunar landers , orbital tugs and even pieces of a Martian expeditionary complex .
In the end , Kremlin bosses had committed to the monumental expense of money and human talent with only vague hopes that real tasks for the grandiose vehicle would emerge as it came online .
Instead , after long delays and cost overruns , the Buran appeared on the scene in the last act of the Cold War and amid a crumbling Soviet economy .
The Berlin Wall had come down just a year after its first flight , and the Soviet Defence Ministry was suddenly more preoccupied with resettling thousands of troops returning from Eastern Europe than with servicing orbital anti-missile platforms and deploying killer satellites in space .
The first stage of the Energia rocket inside Building 112 in Baikonur
The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 sealed the fate of the Energia - Buran system .
There was a flicker of hope for Buran 's giant booster - Energia - when Russia joined the effort to build the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Still unfinished today , after a decade of efforts and dozens of assembly flights , the ISS could have been hauled into orbit by only a few Energia boosters , had international partners adopted it into the program , say the rocket 's proponents .
In the mid-1990s , a flight - ready Buran orbiter , which made the historic trip in 1988 , had been mounted on the back of a fully assembled Energia rocket at Baikonur 's Building 112 .
This eye - popping display became a popular stop for journalists and foreign tourists , who periodically " invaded " Baikonur for high - profile launches .
To the untrained eye , the gargantuan rocket and its orbiter looked all but ready for a rollout to the launch pad .
Last resting place
In 2001 , this spectacle , combined with the optimistic and mis-translated comments of a Russian guide , had such a profound effect on one Western reporter that he filed a story claiming that the Energia - Buran programme was about to be re-started .
The article proved that a decade after its demise , the Buran had already become a legend .
However , if one looked closely in Building 112 it was possible to see water dripping from the high ceiling on a rainy day and accumulating on the floor , under the dead torsos of Energia rockets .
The keeper of the facility , who showed reporters around the building , said that he could hardly find money to send repair men to patch up the giant roof .
Rescue workers search the devastated hangar at Baikonur Eventually , a repair team , believed to include eight people , did make it to the roof , climbing on top of Building 112 on May 12 , 2002 .
According to eyewitnesses , at about 0920 local time , the entire structure shook violently , as if hit by an earthquake , and enormous pieces of debris plunged dozens of metres to the ground below .
They obliterated this crowning achievement of the Soviet space programme .
But the Energia - Buran programme did leave a lasting legacy .
The cavernous launch facilities at Baikonur and a state - of - the - art mission control centre in Korolev have continued serving the Russian space programme and its international partners .
The rocket technology developed for Energia - Buran has been put to use in other launchers .
A mighty RD - 170 engine , originally developed for the first stage of Energia , today powers the Ukrainian Zenit rocket .
This engine 's scaled - down descendants - the RD - 180 and RD - 190 - have been adopted for the US Atlas booster and Russia 's next - generation Angara rockets .
While the US space shuttle will soon share the fate of the Buran orbiter - as a museum exhibit - emerging plans for lunar exploration have revived concepts of super - heavy rockets , on both sides of the Atlantic .
If they are ever built , their creators will have to re-trace the path once made by Valentin Glushko and his colleagues .

Servicewomen are the most vulnerable in the Military , from the Army to the Air Force they have refused to take these violent acts against women seriously .
U.S. servicewomen today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire .
At some Veterans Affairs hospitals , over 40 percent of female patients report having been sexually assaulted during their service , and almost one - third are survivors of rape .
Now murder is on the rise on an Air Force Base in North Carolina .
“ My daughter ’s dream became a nightmare , ” sadly said Gloria Barrios , seven months after her daughter , US Air Force Senior Airman Blanca Luna , was murdered on Sheppard Air Force Base , Texas .
On March 7 , 2008 , Senior Airman Luna , 27 , was found dead in her room at the Sheppard Air Force Base Inn , an on - base lodging facility .
She had been stabbed in the back of the neck with a short knife .
Luna had four years prior military service and was killed three days prior to her graduation from Air Conditioning , Ventilation , and Heating course .
When she was notified of her daughter ’s death , she was handed a letter from Major General K.C. McClain , Commander of the Air Force Personnel Center , which stated that her daughter “ was found dead on 7 March 2008 at Sheppard Air Force Base , Texas , as the result of an apparent homicide . ”
When her body was returned to her family for burial , Barrios and other family members saw bruises on Blanca ’s face and wounds on her fingers as if she were defending herself .
One of the investigators later told Mrs. Barrios that Blanca had been killed in an “ assassin - like ” manner .
Friends say that she told them some in her unit “ had given her problems . ”
Retired Army Colonel
Ann Wright who ended her career in 2003 has become a spokeswoman on the issue of violence against women in the military and women who live near U.S. military bases .
She claims the military has failed to adequately investigate the deaths of a number of servicewomen despite reason to suspect they were raped and murdered .
On the same day Mrs. Barrios went to Sheppard Air Force Base , October 3 , 2008 , the US Army announced that a US Army woman sergeant had been killed near Fort Bragg , North Carolina by a stab wound in the neck .
Sergeant Christina Smith , 29 , was stabbed on September 30 , 2008 , allegedly by her US Army husband Sergeant Richard Smith who was accompanied by Private First Class Matthew Kvapil .
Smith was the fourth military woman murdered in North Carolina in the past 9 months .
“ The military has no sense of timely responsibility for keeping the family informed , ” says Wright .
“ They do n’t set up strong enough liaisons with the family .
Someone should be calling the family every week to say ‘ this is where we are in the investigation . ’
It really is a lack of professional responsibility in my opinion .
They ’re the big dog , the military , and these poor little families have little recourse unless they get a lawyer .
But most of these families do n’t have any money - that ’s often the reason the kids joined the military in the first place . ”
Wright says Luna ’s family is right to be suspicious .
All of this makes you wonder if there is someone in the chain of command that the Air Force is covering for .
Or is it that the “ killer ” may be a friend of the investigators looking into these violent crimes ?
So many questions and no real answers from the Air Force - too much violence against women is happening in all branches of the Military .
For these four women , so far , there has been no justice .
There should be an outcry of moral outrage of this inexcusable injustice …
LOS ANGELES — Honda surprised everyone here at the L.A. Auto
Show today when it rolled out a radical three - seat supercar concept vehicle that runs on hydrogen , a fuel fast becoming a footnote in automotive history .
Honda stands almost alone in clinging to the belief here at the auto show in so vocally proclaiming hydrogen is the fuel of the future , and the FC Sport that made its worldwide premiere today places the automaker firmly at the forefront of fuel cell vehicle design .
Although the FC is nothing more than a styling exercise that will almost certainly never see production , that slick bodywork is the only thing revolutionary about it .
All of the technology beneath the skin already exists in the FCX Clarity fuel cell sedan currently being leased to select customers in Southern California .
The Clarity raised the bar for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles when it appeared at last year ’s show , and Honda VP Dan Bonawitz says the company wants to show that alt fuels and zero-emissions motoring can " stir the soul . "
The car looks like nothing Honda ’s ever built before , which is exactly the point .
" People who love sports cars will still have a reason to love in a hydrogen - powered future , " Bonawitz said .
Honda turned loose the designers at its Advanced Design Studio and told them to make something amazing .
What they came up with , lead designer Jason Wilbur said , " speaks in our bold voice to our racing heritage and our love of building clean , efficient vehicles that are fun to drive . "
Wilbur told Wired.com that he and the rest of the design crew were n’t influenced by any other cars , but it ’s hard to look at the front end and not see the Bugatti Veryron or look at the side profile and not see a Lamborghini — hell , the FC Sport even has scissor doors like a Murcielago .
That back end is a mess , though .
Honda says the hexagonal shape was influenced by cellular structure , but to us it looks like a vision of the future circa 1958 .
The driver sits in the middle of the car , as in the McLaren F1 , while two passengers sit directly behind .
The fuel cell stack is behind the back seats , while the battery pack is kept low in the middle of the car and the electric motor is just before the rear axle .
Honda says most of the mass is kept between the axles to improve handling , but we ’ll have to take its word for it because the car does n’t actually run — it ’s basically a full - size model .
Good thing , too , because there ’s nowhere in downtown L.A. to fuel .

PRINCETON , NJ -- A mid-October USA Today / Gallup poll finds the Democrats leading the race to control the U.S. House of Representatives .
Gallup 's generic congressional ballot finds likely voters preferring the Democratic candidate in their district to the Republican by 51 % to 45 % , regardless of the likely voter model used .
These results represent an improved positioning for the Democratic Party compared to the previous reading on congressional voting intention , taken right after the Republican convention .
At that time , Republicans led 50 % to 45 % among likely voters using Gallup 's traditional likely voter model , which assesses likelihood to vote based on current voting intentions and past voting behavior .
But that was a temporary boost for the Republicans , and inconsistent with earlier polls that showed Democrats leading .
A second , " expanded " likely voter model , which assesses likelihood to vote based only on current voting intentions and would reflect increased turnout by groups that have not voted in past elections , also indicates a stronger showing for the Democrats compared with just after the GOP convention .
Using this model , Democrats currently lead 51 % to 45 % in congressional voting , as opposed to a 48 % to 47 % Republican advantage in early September .
Democrats led in an Aug. 21 - 23 poll conducted before both parties ' conventions took place .
The generic congressional ballot has proven to be an accurate predictor of the overall vote for the House of Representatives historically , and is correlated with the number of seats a party can expect to win .
These results indicate that if the election were held today , the Democratic Party would probably retain control of the House .
However , it is unclear whether the Democrats would be able to increase their majority much , since the current likely voter results are similar to Gallup 's 2006 House vote estimate of 51 % to 44 % and the actual vote for the House that year , 53 % to 45 % .
Party loyalty is high in congressional voting , with 95 % of Republicans saying they will vote for the Republican candidate in their district and 93 % of Democrats intending to vote for the Democrat .
Independents help swing the pendulum in the Democrats ' direction , preferring the Democratic candidate to the Republican by 49 % to 40 % .
In the post - GOP convention poll , independents were evenly divided in their vote , and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to exhibit party loyalty .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,201 registered voters , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 10 - 12 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of registered voters , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
For results based on the 825 survey respondents deemed most likely to vote according to the traditional Gallup likely voter model ( based on past voting behavior and current voting intention ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
For results based on the 1,030 survey respondents deemed most likely to vote according to the expanded Gallup likely voter model ( based on current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

San Francisco Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum has won the National League Cy Young Award , an honor given each year in baseball to the best pitcher .
Which is a pretty big deal , it seems .
Even though Lincecum did n't pitch in a pennant race , and managed to overcome the always " ever - present East Coast bias , " the Gaints ' baby - faced pitcher won the award .
Born June 15 , 1984 in Bellevue , Washington , Lincecum is a starting pitcher for the Giants .
His nicknames are " The Franchise " and " The Freak " .
While pitching for University of Washington , Timmy became the first player to be named both the Pac - 10 Freshman of the Year and the Pac - 10 Pitcher of the Year .
He is a Gemini and the second Giant ever to win the Cy Young Award .
Congratulations , Tim .
You , sir , make the Giants not totally suck .

There is more pressure on women to wear headscarves , the report says A report in Turkey has highlighted " very worrying " evidence of increased discrimination against secular Turks .
The study , called " Being Different in Turkey " , links this directly to the presence of the religious conservative AK Party in government .
It details widespread social pressure on non-devout Muslims to attend Friday prayers , fast during the month of Ramadan or wear a headscarf .
It was conducted by the Open Society Institute and Bosphorus University .
It suggests that a government policy of making appointments to local administrations on the basis of political and religious beliefs , rather than competence , is forcing non-devout Turks to change their habits in order to protect their business or their jobs .
The AK Party has its roots in Political Islam , but has always insisted its views have changed .
Last year , the party survived an attempt to close it down , as a threat to Turkey 's strict secular system .
Social pressure
The study documents what many secular Turks have complained about in the years since the AK Party came to power .
Based on interviews with almost 5,000 secular Turks , Alevites and Christians in 12 cities , it concludes that religious conservatism is flourishing , breeding increasing intolerance of those outside the Sunni Muslim majority .
It claims that the appointment of AK Party devotees to local administrations , schools and hospitals is changing the social atmosphere in Turkey in what it calls a very worrying way .
The report cites page upon page of examples : non-religious nurses put on permanent night shift ; landlords refusing to take female student tenants unless they wear a headscarf ; secular civil servants bypassed for promotion .
It talks of increased social pressure to attend Friday prayers and fast during Ramadan , and documents the difficulty in many cities of obtaining licences to sell alcohol .
The report 's authors accept that much of the Turkish heartland has always been socially conservative .
But they blame the AK Party for failing to promote tolerance for other groups ' rights and freedoms while in government .
Instead - the report says - the government 's practices have had quite the opposite effect .

Michelle Malkin was pleased to be on the list I wrote last week on ' 10 Republicans who should go away '
She writes :
Whoo - hoo : We 're Number Three !
… on a Huffington Post blogger ’s list of “ 10 Republicans Who Should Go Away . ”
I ’m a conservative , not a Republican .
But whatever .
We ’re Number Three !
And not going anywhere .
You 've got to love this about the crazy Right - they do relish combat ( although not when it 's real , of course ) .
The sad thing is , her fans think this is a two way race - their side versus our side , Left versus Right , Democrat versus Republican .
The thing is , I 'm not trying to compete with Michelle Malkin - she simply illustrates a point about the coporate media and relentless drive to dumb down the population .

Despite her overwhelming self confidence , there really is n't much too the conservative pundit .
Her knee jerk politics are fairly easy to sum up , and her grasp of economics is shockingly poor .
She wrote an article for TownHall.com blaming illegal immigrants for the economic crisis , and thinks people in desperate need of economic assistance are ' moochers and entitlement mongers ' .
Malkin likes to think of herself as an intellectual and does her best to write serious articles .
But 10th grade research skills and selective quoting does n't make her the female incarnation of William F. Buckley .

The article I wrote managed to offend literally thousands of people .
My inbox has been jammed with some hilarious emails .
I particularly liked this one :
Ben , in keeping with your list of insults against 10 Republicans who should go away , I figured I would hurl them right back at you .
Besides name calling , do you have any facts to back up any of your bullshit accusations ?
Hit me with it JRod , I 'm waiting .
I dont expect to hear back from you because deep down you know you 're more full of shit than the 10 GOP you 're bashing .
A sincere fuck you Ben Cohen !
I get so sick of you faggy liberal idiots .
I seemed to get a lot of emails like that , accusing me of not backing up my assertions .
The article contains multiple sources , all hyperlinked for convenience .
Conservatives may not have liked the sources , but they were there .
Libertarian ego maniac Neal Boortz was also upset , but mostly because he was n't the list :
And now , according to a moonbat , we have a list of 10 Republicans Who Should Go Away .
I guess they knew I was n't a Republican , that 's why I did n't make the
list .
Read the comments ... and then remember that these people accuse
conservatives of " hate speech . "
No Neal , you were n't on the list because of your strange Libertarianism , you were simply not interesting enough .
Publishing silly books about ' fair ' taxes ( supported by Sean Hannity - an immediate disqualification ) and warbling on about ' Big Government ' does n't put you up there with the big boys ( and girls ) .
Sorry Neal , you 'll have to work a bit harder to become a Malkin .
Zoo ’s Poo Could Fuel a New Toronto Biogas Facility
November 16th , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
The Toronto Zoo says their 5,000 animals produce enough dung to easily cover the costs of the proposed $ 13 million biogas - to - power facility within five years .
The plant would produce enough electricity for not only the zoo , but thousands of Toronto households .
Similar operations that convert farm animal and human waste into biogas are already in place across the world .
But where does a zoo come up with $ 13 million dollars ?[social_buttons ]
“ It ’s clean , green energy , pollution - free energy , and we hope we might actually be able to make a little bit of money out of it as well , ” said city councilor Glenn de Baeremaeker .
But the city ’s Budget Director says money for the plant probably wo n’t be available due to debt , despite the promised return on power .
Instead , the zoo is looking to an outside private financier for the project and still hoping to begin construction by next year .
In Texas , the Dallas Zoo dreamed of a biogas plant last year , but it as well has faced financial hurtles and it has yet to be built .

Or maybe that should be “ holey ” , as in full of holes .
The mayor of Batman , Turkey ( yes , there is such a place ) plans to sue Warner Brothers and Christopher Nolan ( director of “ The Dark Knight ” ) for use without permission of the city ’s name .
He claims to have evidence that the city was named prior to the 1939 debut of the DC Comic hero .
He also seems to think that the popular usage of the name has led to untold trauma for his constituents — including a high rate of female suicide , a string of unsolved murders , and difficulty registering businesses abroad .
I can see the merit of the latter claim —
“ You ’re from Batman , Turkey ? ” Yeah , right .
But come on , murder and suicide ??
“ I ’m so depressed because the Batman movie has made almost a billion dollars and we poor Kurds in the real Batman wo n’t see a dime of it .
So I think I ’ll kill myself . ”
That happens frequently , I ’m sure — and we need to stop this human tragedy by spreading some of that Hollywood moolah around southeastern Turkey .
Money always cures depression , after all .
According to Wikipedia , the name of the town has nothing to do with a chiropteran human , but is rather a shortening of Bati Raman — which they claim to be a mountain range , but also appears to be the name of a large oil field in the area .
The Batman River flows through this province as well .
This is not the first time this region has been embroiled over a debate concerning place names .
Back in 2001 , an earlier mayor of Batman wanted to rename certain streets in ways that upset the central Turkish government : Mahatma Ghandi Street , Democracy Avenue , and Human Rights Boulevard .
Because the region is mostly Kurdish , the Turkish provincial governor considered these names to be a subtle signpost towards revolution .
He got the court to not only slap down the new names , but also to rule that no Kurdish names could be used at all .
No wonder these citizens of Batman are more than a little name - defensive .
And now for something not completely different , here ’s a Turkish Batman and Robin :

I was having an interesting conversation with my BSD buddies on whether Ubuntu is suitable / not for servers and I did my usual bragging about the servers not needing to be rebooted .
I was then asked about kernel updates and a wish was expressed for an ability to update kernels without having to reboot the server .
This started tickling a few memory cells which had n’t yet been wiped out by various substances and / or old age so I went to my knowledge repository ( otherwise known as Google ) and dragged up some info .
I was pleased to find that things had progressed since I last looked at it and even better .
The current * buntu and Debian kernels are ready for it .
You are probably wondering what it is so before you bust your britches I will tell you .
It is called kexec and it is a method of changing Linux kernels without having to physically reboot the computer .
In other words changing a Linux kernel is just about as easy as stopping and starting a normal service .
There is one caveat .
This only works on x86 platforms .
Fine by me because I use x86 platforms 🙂
So I thought WTF ( just think Risky Business the movie ) and decided to give it a go .
I am now wondering why I did n’t try it before .
Installation was super simple .
Kexec is a two part beastie .
It consists of the kernel part which is patched into the vanilla kernel .
Debian and * buntu distributions already have that patched in .
Then there is the user part which is the kexec program .
This is installed simply by typing “ aptitude install kexec - tools ” .
Not too heavy , not too light , its just right .
After I installed kexec which took a grand total of thirty seconds I just had to give it a try .
First of all I tried it in a virtualbox session but virtualbox did n’t like that and just sat there spinning its wheels until I killed it .
So I decided to try it on my desktop .
I had several kernels installed on my system so I did a quick cat of my grub menu.lst to see them .
Here is an abridged output .
locutus@borgship :~# cat / boot / grub / menu.lst kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.24-21- generic root=UUID=xxx-xxx-xxx ro quiet splash initrd / boot / initrd.img-2.6.24-21-generic kernel /boot/ vmlinuz-2.6.24-20 - generic root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash initrd / boot / initrd.img-2.6.24-20 - generic
I only have two kernels listed here but there are more .
Using that information it was easy to set up the kernel to boot into .
First I had to load the kernel into memory by typing .
“ kexec -l boot / vmlinuz - 2.6.24-20- generic –append=root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet splash –initrd=/boot/initrd.img-2.6.24-20-generic ”
As you can see the info is copied straight from the grub menu .
Once the selected kernel is loaded into memory , which pretty much happens instantaneously , it is just a matter of activating that kernel .
This is done quite simply by typing “ kexec - e ”
The computer then acts as though it has rebooted but instead of taking a couple of minutes it only takes a few seconds .
This is because it does a warm boot instead of a cold boot like when your computer is physically rebooted .
Of course any open programs are closed and connections are cut just as though the computer has been physically rebooted but those services are restored in far less time than a normal reboot .
In fact to make sure of it I remotely connected into another computer and tried it out .
This computer is a web , file and chat server and I was connected via ssh .
I selected my kernel and did the kexec deed .
Sure enough I was cut off so I counted to ten and tried to reconnect , which I did .
Normally
If I do that I would have had to wait for about five minutes while the computer power cycles and comes back up .
So all in all it ( ie kexec ) is a great time saver and very useful tool if you like to play around with different kernels .
For mission critical machines which require more than five ball uptime I would say it is essential .
A reminder from the Republican mayor of San Diego :
If have a friend or family member in California , please take a few minutes this weekend to call them and ask them to vote No .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Sure , sounds pretty fair .
We would n’t want Wall Street to be held accountable for their global failure because then they might get mad .
It ’s much better for average Americans and the poor to do without medical care and die because they ’re simply not as productive as Wall Street .
The sooner everyone comes to appreciate how irrelevant they are compared to Wall Street and their friends in Congress who ignore the $ 70 billion bonus pool the better .
It ’s better to have TV drama for the nightly news than actual accountability .
The ailing economy is leading many Americans to skip doctor visits , skimp on their medicine , and put off mammograms , Pap smears and other tests .
And physicians worry the result will be sicker patients who need even more costly treatment in the long run .
“ I have to pretty much be very ill to go to the doctor , ” said Julie Shelley , a 49 - year - old office manager and mother of three from West Milton , Ohio .
“ I ’m probably at the age where I should have a checkup or physical .
I ’m not going to do it .
I am last on the list . ”
In Lombard , Ill. , Donald Hendricks lost his job over the summer at an event - planning company .
When two of his six children came down with a fever and sore throat several weeks ago , he could not afford the gas money to drive them to the doctor .
He gave them soup and soda instead , and they got better .
It ’s confusing .
The pale blue bank note that says 1,000,000 Zimbabwean dollars really means 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 .
Yes , that ’s 10 quintillion , taking into account the 13 zeros Zimbabwe ’s central bank has lopped off in the last couple of years to make the country ’s currency somewhat more manageable .
Every time they get out of hand , Zimbabwe ’s Reserve Bank scythes away 00000s .
The largest note , Z$ 100,000,000,000 , released in July and useless within weeks , looked so bizarre with all the zeros squeezed in that it became an instant collector ’s item .
Regardless , inflation is soaring so fast in Zimbabwe that it ’s hard to figure out what a Z$ 1 - million note is actually worth on a given day .

Somewhere between July ’s Z$ 100 - billion note and the more recent zero - reduced Z$ 1 - million note , it ’s easy to get mixed up .
Even more confusing are the wildly different exchange rates that depend on how you pay for purchases .
Zimbabweans chuckle when they see a foreigner bumbling with their currency .
They launch into long , looping explanations that leave you lassoed by the zeros , and more confused than when you started .
It ’s difficult to resist just holding up the Z$ 1,000,000 note and asking a reliable local , “ What ’s this worth ? ”
But they can get confused themselves .
To my surprise , when I tried it last month , my math - savvy friend no longer had the calculation in his head .
So he pulled up his cellphone calculator and tapped away .
“ Ech !
My cellphone can’t cope with all these zeros , ” he grumbled , while I stared at the bustling crowd on Robert Mugabe Street , wondering where they could be going , in an economy where nothing works .
Advertisement
Finally he had an answer : “ That ’s worth about 50 cents , a bit less than 50 cents . ”
So I used the blue notes for tips .
Fifty cents might not sound like much , but in early November , Z$ 1,000,000 was more than a week ’s pay for a police inspector .
After tipping car guards , parking men and waiters for several days , I checked the value again .
It turned out my friend had been mistaken ; the note had been worth about $ 4 , not 50 cents .
Zimbabwe ’s hyperinflation rate , the highest ever known , is officially more than 230 million percent , but some economists place it in the quadrillions .
It seems just a matter of time before Zimbabweans will be grappling with octillions , nonillions , decillions , duodecillions and more .

Just trying to explain the complications in the money system is , well , complicated .
Imagine this :
You go from the crowded , dusty streets of the capital , Harare , into a dimly lighted black market money changer ’s shop that masquerades as a video outlet .
Ask the dealer the rate for a U.S. dollar and he says “ 27 . ”
Twenty - seven what is not clear .
Ask him the rate for a South African rand , ( worth about 10 cents U.S. ) , and he still says “ 27 . ”
But this time the decimal point is in a different place .
You walk out with a handful of pale blue notes and little idea of what they ’re worth .
Advertisement
If all that is complicated , try this scenario from a couple of months back :
You ’re in a supermarket , and for the first time in months there ’s food there ( though it ’s too expensive for most Zimbabweans ) .
You calculate the cost of about 2 pounds of meat :
If you have a Zimbabwean bank account and pay with a debit card , it will cost about $ 10 U.S .
If you exchange American cash for enough Zimbabwean notes to buy the same unappetizing - looking slab of meat , you ’ll be out $ 1,000 U.S. because of a huge difference in the official exchange rate , which applies to electronic payments , and the rate on the black market .
It would seem easy enough to just pay by debit card , but nothing is easy here .
In most supermarkets , bank debit cards do n’t work , either because there ’s no power or the electronic transfer systems in banks are overloaded .
For the masses squashed together like upright sardines in queues outside banks , buying staples such as maize meal and cooking oil is a struggle .
They stand in line for hours to withdraw the maximum weekly limit of Z$ 100 million , about $ 10 U.S. on the black market these days , but not even enough for a loaf of bread .
( The withdrawal limit was just raised to Z$ 10 billion a week to enable people to buy food for Christmas .
The government also released a new Z$ 10 - billion note . )
Advertisement
Most people use their Z$ 100 million for bus fare to town .
It ’s a bizarre situation : People come to town to stand in line to get money that barely covers the cost of coming to town .
Crowds of 500 or more jostle outside banks in the heat .
Soldiers prowl , beating people with batons when fights break out .
One woman in a bank queue in suburban Avondale last month groused as a group of nurses shoved their way to the front .
“ The hospitals are closed and they ’re not even working , ” she shouted .
“ People are dying in the hospital and then those people want preference here . ”
Advertisement
As others joined in , a soldier stalked up , grim faced .
“ You ! ” he barked .
“ Just get in the queue and shut up !
Stop causing trouble here ! ”
So why stand in line if it ’s just for the bus fare ?
And then there ’s the 64 - quintillion dollar question : How do Zimbabweans survive ?
Mike , 20 , an apprentice with the state electrical company who would only give his first name , says his one motive for going to work is to steal .
Advertisement
“ We can go and fix a fault and when we fix the fault we just put the money in our pockets , ” said Mike , who has been in line at the bank for 2 1/ 2 hours .
“ That ’s how we are surviving . ”
Other Zimbabweans use their phones at work to track down hard - to - come - by necessities and do quick deals .
That ’s not the only complicated trick .
Ben , 28 , a used - car salesman , explains the art of “ burning ” money .
He has the air of a magician making a rabbit appear in a hat , only this time it ’s conjuring $ 1,000 out of $ 100 in U.S. currency in a day .
“ It ’s very easy and simple , ” said Ben , who also gave only his first name for fear of prosecution for profiteering .
In a nutshell , by shuffling money between the exchange rates -- one for cash and the other for bank transfers -- one can multiply a sum of U.S. dollars by tenfold or more .
Zimbabweans who are sent foreign funds by relatives abroad are generally in the best position to employ the strategy .
Advertisement
At one point the government banned bank transfers to try to eliminate “ burning , ” but it re-introduced them this month with stricter limits .
Ben made several long , patient explanations before I got the gist of “ burning , ” carefully writing down each convoluted twist .
But as soon as I got the trick , it seemed to vanish , like looking at a mirage .
It ’s confusing .

Meet Your Straw Man
First : Capitus Diminutio Maxima means the " The highest or most comprensive loss of status .
This occurred when a man 's condition was changed from one of freedom to one of bondage , when he became a slave .
It swept away with it all rights of citizenship and all family rights " .
Keep this in mind while watching the video .
This is must know information for the Free World .
NOTE : Some of the information within this site is content from U.S. sources .
As far as government and legal matters between Canada and U.S. , 90 % of the documentation is similar to each other .
Below is a short video and some general information that will educate you about " your " Strawman .
Meet Your Straw Man

TSUF 's intent is to be in strict compliance with the law .
As a child , you have had an imaginary friend .
You may be surprised to learn that evidence exists that you have had a make - believe twin from the time your mother and father permitted a Birth Certificate to be filed for you .
This make - believe friend is not real , but artificial .
It is a straw man , an artificial entity that has a name very similar to yours .
Here is a definition of straw man :
" A ' front ' ; a third party who is put up in name only to take part in a transaction .
Nominal party to a transaction ... "
[ Black 's Law Dictionary , 6th Edition ]
" The term is also used in commercial and property contexts when a transfer is made to a party , the straw man , simply for the purpose of retransferring to the transferor in order to accomplish some purpose not otherwise permitted . "
[ Barron's , 3rd Edition ]
So , in layman 's terms , what is a straw man ?
The straw man is an artificial person .
The straw man was created by law shortly after you were born via the registration of the application for your birth certificate .
The name for the straw man is your name in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS .
You will notice that the inscription on the birth certificate is your name in all - capital letters .
The English language has precise rules of grammar that make no provision for writing proper nouns in all - capital letters .
So , your name spelled with all - capital letters is a fictitious name .
Your straw man has a same - sounding name as your name , but is an artificial entity which exists only " by force of or in contemplation of law . "
The all - caps name is not your " true name " which consists of the given ( Christian ) name plus the surname ( family name ) , and appears with only initial letters capitalized .
The all - caps version of your name is a TRADE NAME , the name under which you " do business . "
We may also say that the straw man is a " person " according to the legal dictionary .
" Person .
1 . a human being .
2 . An entity ( such as a corporation ) that is recognized by law as having the rights and duties of a human beingâ ¦ " [ Blacks Law Dictionary , 7th Edition ]
.
The straw man may also be said to be an " artificial person " which is also defined in the legal dictionary .
" An entity , such as a corporation , created by law and given certain legal rights and duties of a human being ; a being , real or imaginary , who for the purpose of legal reasoning is treated more or less as a human being .
â 
Also termed fictitious person ; juristic person ; legal person ; moral person . "
[ Blacks Law Dictionary , 7th Edition ]
A straw man may also be thought of as a " legal fiction . "
" Legal fiction .
Assumption of fact made by court as basis for deciding a legal question .
A situation contrived by the law to permit a court to dispose of a matter â ¦ " [ Blackâs Law Dictionary 5th Edition ]
As we explore further , we must distinguish between the straw man ( an it or person ) , and the real , flesh and blood being ( human being ) which we will call a " man . " " Man " has a legal definition .
" A human being .
A person of the male sex .
A male of the human species above the age of puberty .
In the most extended sense the term includes not only the adult male sex of the human species , but women and children .
â ¦
In feudal law , a vassal ; a tenant or feudatory . "
[ Blacks Law Dictionary , 5th Edition ]
So we conclude that " man " is a term of nature .
But who created nature ?
Some would say God , others would say the Creator ( a term often used by the founder of our country ) , while others might hold a different view .
On the other hand , we see " person " as a term of the civil law .
Who is the creator of civil law ?
" Civil law â¦ a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power of a state â¦ the civil or municipal law of the Roman empire . "
[ Ballentineâs Law Dictionary , 3rd Edition ]
So kings , emperors or legislative bodies acting in a sovereign capacity are the " creators " of civil law .
When our government acts as a sovereign , it is acting outside it 's constitutional authority .
So we see that a man and a person are very different terms identifying very different things .
If you study Roman civil law , you will see that it originates and uses fictions of law â that is , concepts that are contrary to the natural order of things , and based upon presumptions that are untrue .
You will realize that this person recognized in the civil law is a fictional entity .
You will come to see the vast difference between man and person .
So the straw man is a person , a public name that is recognized in a civil society .
We 've mentioned " legal fiction " and " fiction of law " , so let 's see how these are defined .
" Fiction of law .
An assumption or supposition of law that something which is or may be false is true , or that a state of facts exists which has never really taken place .
An assumption , for purposes of justice , of a fact that does not or may not exist .
A rule of law which assumes as true , and will not allow to be disproved , something which is false , but not impossible . "
[ Blackâs Law Dictionary 5th Edition ]
This distinction between a man and a person is a difficult concept to grasp .
But a proper understanding of the relationship between the government , the man and the straw man is essential to gaining increased freedom .
While the concept of these relationships is very simple , there are some foundational principles that must be explored .
We have mentioned that the straw man is an artificial entity or person .
But there are several types of organizations or artificial entities .
There are corporation soles , aggregate corporations , municipal corporations , revocable living trusts ( sole ) , and unincorporated business organizations .
Many people use these entities for various reasons including maintaining personal control over their assets ; protection from lawsuits and judgments ; avoidance of probate ; avoidance of estate taxes ; reduction in tax liability ; and many other reasons .
We will look into the difference between a sole entity and an aggregate entity ; the construction of these entities and the results of that construction as it apply to the straw man .
In all organizations there are two basic operational positions : 1 ) the stock holder / owner / beneficiary ( we will call this the beneficiary position ) ; and 2 ) The officer / president / chairman / trustee ( we will call this the operational position ) .
A sole corporation , as defined by Blackâs Law Dictionary , is one consisting of one person only and his successors in some particular station , who are incorporated by law in order to give them some legal capacities and advantages , particularly that of perpetuity , which in their natural state as persons they could not have .
In a corporation sole , one person holds both operational positions of the organization .
A corporation sole may be established under legislative authority .
It is considered by statute a citizen of the government .
As such , the safe guards of the bill of rights do not extend to corporate soles .
The courts have warned that statutory licensed sole proprietorships are in a fact a government agency by definition of how they are created .
Most people who chose a sole organization do so because they maintain personal control over their assets .
An aggregate corporation such as corporations or business trusts , according to Black 's Law Dictionary , is composed of a number of individuals vested with corporate powers .
With an aggregate organization , different parties must hold the beneficiary and operational positions .
If the same party holds them , they are a sole organization .
Family members are always counted as one party , therefore would be a sole organization .
In an aggregate organization , the one who is in control is immune from damages or liabilities of the beneficiaries .
In an aggregate corporation , the holder of the first operative position controls the assets for the holder of the second operative position .
The control of the assets has been turned over to someone else 's control .
The founder of the wealthy Rockefeller family said one his secrets to wealth was to " own nothing , but control everything " .
In other words , always function from an aggregate relationship .
Do not own the straw man ; control the straw man .
If you are not the beneficiary / owner of the straw man you are not liable for his debts or obligations .
If you are in control , you have the highest lien hold interest on the straw man ; you must be paid before anyone else collects from the straw man , and you cannot go to jail for his misdoing .
A look at the structure of the straw man entity shows the ownership / control relationship , and which position it is best to hold .
Prior to the redemption process [ redemption is a term used among freedom loving people to describe the process of regaining control of your straw man ] , the man is considered both a beneficiary in the relationship and surety for the straw man .
After redemption , the man is no longer a beneficiary , and is no longer surety .
After redemption , the man is the controller and creditor with the highest lien hold interest in the straw man .
The man is now in an aggregate relationship with .
the straw man .
He does not own the straw man but he controls the straw man by the primary lien hold interest .
In this country , the power was granted to government by the people .
Power is granted to the government by the people individually - to create States , and by the people as a whole to create the National government .
Once the people decided individually to create States , they can only change the policy or law of the State as people collectively .
That is because they have agreed to become part of the public .
They are one person in a larger body of people that act collectively .
The people are in the State and National government at that same time .
The public government is an artificial entity .
The government is owned and controlled by the same people .
So the government is a sole organization , not an aggregate organization .
As long as a man is dealing publicly , he is in a sole relationship with the public .
The straw man , being artificial , lives in the artificial place called the public .
At the same time as people are acting collectively in the larger body of people called the State and National government , they maintain their ability to act individually on a private basis .
The people did not give up the rights they did not delegate to the government - they retained those rights .
Any man can contract privately as they see fit and government cannot interfere with the private contracts of men .
The straw man lives in the public side of government .
He is part of the public government , and functions under the laws of the public .
This is necessary and proper because the creator of an entity has the right to control it .
[ Personal edit from site owner :
The Straw Man could not have come into existence without your parent 's signature and your continuance of use of it .
Therefore it does not belong solely to the government and you could make a claim to it as the government never would . ]
Since the government created the straw man , it is only right that the straw man live under the rules of it 's creator .
But once the straw man has been redeemed , the government is no longer in control of the straw man .
He is now controlled by the man using his right to private contracts .
The man has left the public as a beneficiary in sole relationship to the straw man to live privately as creditor in an aggregate relationship with the straw man .
As far as this relationship is concerned , the straw man is privately controlled .
The straw man still exists as a public entity because that is the only world in which he has reality .
His relationship with the man is private .
The relationship with the man being is controlling because the man has a higher priority lien on the straw man than the government .
Now that we understand who the straw man is , it is appropriate to ask who benefits from the creation of the straw man ?
We will see that the straw man benefits the creator ( the government ) , any company that uses it and you .
The government began to benefit from the straw man in 1933 .
In the Article on the U.S. Bankruptcy , we 've already seen evidence that the United States went bankrupt in 1933 .
When this happened , the governors of all the states met to discuss what should be done .
The state governors made a " pledge " to the federal government , to fund the bankruptcy .
They pledged the assets and the energy of the people belonging to the state governments .
They would back the " government " and secure the national debt .
But there was one problem :
The states could only speak for the people in their public capacity .
They could not pledge private , living human beings or property .
So it was necessary to create a " bridge " between the living people and the creditors for the bankruptcy .
The answer was to create straw men to stand in the place of the people .
Now the only problem was devising a scheme whereby the people would agree to contract with the straw man as its surety .
When the governors made the pledge , they agreed to register the application form for the birth certificates of the people with the U.S. Department of Commerce .
The application form for the .
birth certificate is the security instrument ( collateral ) used to back the pledge .
The straw man , the legal fiction was created by using the name on the birth certificate and writing it in all capital letters , the designation for a legal fiction .
Then , because of the " pledge " , the people were determined to be the representative and surety for the legal fiction .
This is how they made us responsible to pay back the debt of the United States .
When the " government " or any corporation uses any process whatsoever , they are using it against the legal fiction , which they want the people to think is them .
But when a name is written in all capital letters , IT IS NOT the name of a real person !
It is the designation of a legal fiction - that is an entirely separate entity .
A living human cannot be a legal fiction , and a legal fiction cannot be a living human .
One is real or natural , the other is created by " law . "
Because the entire thing is based on paying the bankruptcy , the straw man is the debtor and the " government " is agent for the creditor , the international bankers who own the Federal Reserve .
Whenever a government agency ( such as a court ) determines liability , it is a liability of the legal straw man since everything is done in commerce .
The people are presumed , as evidenced by the pledge of their governors , to be the surety for the straw man and they must pay the liability .
Now let 's see how the straw man benefits others .
Our straw man though of as a " transmitting utility " which we define as âan agent solely utilized for the purpose of transmitting commercial activity for the benefit of the Secured Partyâ .
Government and big business have set up a system so that the only way a man can access the goods and services of the nation is through the straw man .
The straw man serves as a utility through which goods and services may be transmitted to you .
You are forced to interface with society through your straw man .
You will notice that the straw man 's name is used on virtually all public documents , including but not limited to : birth certificate , driverâs license , passport , Social Security card , bank account ( checks and statements ) , credit cards , the checks you receive from your employer , legal documents , any letter from the government entity at any level , etc .
You will discover that government agencies , banks and other corporations , courts and tax agencies deal with you exclusively through the straw man .
These organizations insist on dealing with you only via an all - caps version of your name in any and all key documents , contracts , accounts , and agreements with them .
One of the many " benefits " and services made available through your straw man is your Social Security Number ( SSN ) .
The SSN is a " public " number associated with a " public persona , " your straw man .
The SSN is a benefit because it allows you to open a bank account or to get a job .
A federal law was passed in 1994 that made it a requirement to give your SSN to get a driver 's license .
It would be difficult ( though not impossible ) to do any of these things without using the SSN .
All of these things , and many more , can be thought of as " benefits " granted to the straw man .
But these benefits come with a price .
It should be obvious that the straw man has not body , and that you benefit from the consumption / use of the goods and services made available through the straw man .
At this point , you probably do not hold title to your straw man ( the redemption process can correct this problem ) .
Since these things are true , it is also true that you are the one responsible for discharging the public liabilities associated with the " benefits " that you enjoy .
courtesy of your straw man .
These public liabilities include but are not limited to income tax , social security tax , plus any and all debts that the straw man incurs .
For further evidence that the straw man is not you , look at your personal checks .
Here is an example of a check .
Notice the two read arrows .
Their first arrow points to the all - caps name , Johnâs straw man .
You will not find your true name on your checks .
The second arrow points to the signature line that ends with the letters " MP " which stands for " micro- print " .
If you look carefully at the signature , you will notice that it is not a solid line .
The line is made up of some words and spaces that are repeated over and over again as shown here .
The next image shows a section of the signature line magnified 60 times .
You can clearly see that the words that make up the line are " AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE . "
( You can also read about security features on checks on the " Deluxe " site . )
.
The reason the signature line on personal checks is made up of the words " AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE " is because it is a physical impossibility for the account holder ( your straw man ) to sign the check .
Remember , your straw man has no hands with which to sign the check .
The banks know that every signature appearing on a personal check is the signature of the flesh - and - blood agent , the authorized representative , you .
However , the words are printed in micro-print to disguise the fact that you are the authorized representative rather than the principal on the account .
When you sign the check or any other document for the straw man , you are actually an accommodating party , i.e. surety , and therefore 100 % liable for everything the principal ( straw man ) is liable for .
Further proof that you are liable for the benefits you receive through your straw man .
Do not despair , there is a way out of this malaise .
There are a couple of elements to a strategy to gain freedom .
One element is to copyright your name ( both your true name , the all - caps version and all it's derivatives ) .
A second element is to use UCC filings to take control of your straw man ( a process that is often called redemption ) .
Names are nothing more than property .
No one is his TRADE NAME ( all - caps spelling of your name ) , nor is anyone his true name .
A name can be trademarked , service - marked , and copyrighted by the owner for the purpose of restricting others form unauthorized use and unjust enrichment at the expense of the owner .
If you are 18 or older , you , the flesh - and - blood man or woman , own your name and you may copyright it under the common law .
After copyrighting your name , no one will be able to use your name to enrich themselves without first gaining your agreement .
Let 's say a police officer pulled you over and wanted to give you a ticket .
You can warn the officer that he is using your copyrighted name for financial benefit and that is a violation of your copyright .
You should also inform him that to persist in the use of your copyrighted material without your permission carries an automatic penalty of $ 500,000 .
You have just formed a legally binding verbal contract with the officer .
If the officer then persists in using your name without permission , he has breached the contract .
You then have the right , under UCC article 9 , to default judgment against them using non-judicial proceedings to collect on the debt that he owes you .
This is a very powerful concept that can be used in dozens to hundreds of ways .
The copyright notices also establishes a private contract between you and your straw man whereby you offer services to the straw man ( e.g. signing documents for it ) in exchange for certain considerations .
You become the creditor over your straw man who becomes the debtor to you .
You can file a UCC financing statement to receive official , government acknowledgment of this private contract .
This UCC is a financing statement which creates an interest in property that secures payment / performance of an obligation by your straw man for the services you render to it .
This UCC filing establishes a seniority position of claim over other creditors who may make a claim based upon date and time of filing .
In this way , if any party ever attacks your straw manâs assets , you will have a superior claim on it .
For further study in your journey toward greater freedom , read about " The Exemption " and " Redemption " .
Take note : A response from Office of the Registrar General and a Toronto Star article that blantantly points out a fact .

Anti-discrimination groups and bar associations have joined 44 state legislators in calling on the California Supreme Court to overturn the anti-gay marriage initiative voters passed last week .
In letters to the court , the Anti-Defamation League and other groups sided with lawsuits that said Proposition 8 , which reinstated a ban on same - sex marriage , amounted to a sweeping revision of the state Constitution instead of a more limited amendment .
Constitutional revisions can be placed on the ballot only by a two - thirds vote of the Legislature .
Proposition 8 reached the ballot as a constitutional amendment after a signature campaign .
“ Proposition 8 threatens the permanent and abiding nature of the requirement that laws must apply equally to all -- the most basic principle of democratic government , ” said the letter from the Anti-Defamation League , Asian Law Caucus , Bet Tzedek Legal Services , Japanese American Citizens League and Public Counsel .

A letter from the Bar Assn. of San Francisco and other groups also urged the court to strike down the measure .
Also Wednesday , supporters of Proposition 8 said some financial contributors had heard from people saying they would boycott contributors ’ businesses .
It was unclear how widespread the threats were , but an latimes.com database listing contributors to both sides of Proposition 8 saw a jump in traffic Wednesday .
El Coyote , the well - known Mexican restaurant on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles , received calls threatening a boycott after it was reported that someone associated with the eatery contributed $ 100 to Yes on 8 .
The California Supreme Court has yet to take action on the lawsuits , which were filed the day after the election .

It 's hard to be in the business of selling gigabytes , as evidenced by the frequent rough patches in the memory market .
But the reason that things are so tough can be a bit counterintuitive because of the way that supply and demand interact with technological progress in this market .
Counterintuitive or not , the gigabytes business is especially hard in the face of a recession , as the latest round of earnings reports and projections from two flash memory makers makes clear .
Is there any hope on the horizon for the long - battered NAND flash sector , the part of the semiconductor market that provides storage for everything from iPods to digital cameras ?
Let 's look at brief look at both the market itself , and some recent developments in it .
Last week , Samsung 's earnings report revealed that the company 's net income was down 44 percent this past quarter , the steepest drop since 2003 .
This decline , which was in line with analysts ' gloomy expectations , came on the back of falling prices in both the NAND flash memory and LCD display markets .
Rival memory maker SanDisk also had a bad quarter .
Earnings fell 21 percent year - over - year due to the memory market supply glut , and the company 's stock tumbled after its earnings release because the losses were almost double what analysts were expecting .
What with the layoffs at the company and its plans to sell of 30 percent of its fab capacity to Toshiba — another major flash player — things are not looking good for SanDisk as it heads into a very challenging 2009 .
SanDisk 's losses led Samsung to give up on its long - standing attempt to acquire the company and , with it , the SanDisk - owned patents for X4 technology , which could dramatically improve flash memory densities .
The fact that this merger was scotched is huge news for the flash business , as there had been hope in some corners that the combined entity , which would control almost half of the global NAND market , could use its size to prop up prices ( undoubtedly raising antitrust concerns in the process ) .
But with the merger now out of the picture , the NAND market is left to rely on good old supply and demand to set prices , and the results wo n't be pretty .
NAND flash prices have already plunged 55 percent this year because of oversupply issues ( see below ) and , with 2009 looking increasingly grim for consumer spending , it 's unlikely that demand will reach the levels that were assumed during the massive flash memory production capacity build - out a few years back .
In short , Moore 's Law has been a double - edged sword for flash memory makers , as technological advances have left flash makers with an oversupply of gigabytes .
Selling gigabytes
You might think that Samsung and SanDisk make NAND flash memory modules ( among other things ) , and that the solution to a supply glut that drives prices down would be to for these two companies to make fewer modules .
But you 'd be mostly wrong on both counts .
Samsung sells gigabytes of semiconductor memory ; the memory modules that deliver those gigabytes are best thought of as units of cost ( on the production side ) or units of price ( on the consumption side ) .
So , when Moore 's Law increases the amount of memory ( i.e. product ) that a flash maker can ship in a single module ( i.e. , a unit of cost ) then it has done two things that are very wonderful , but also very dangerous and impossible to reverse : it has cut in half the cost of a gigabyte , and it has also doubled the supply of gigabytes .
This drastic cost reduction is wonderful in that consumers love cheaper storage , but the law of supply and demand operating in the gigabyte market makes this potentially dangerous for memory makers .
There is an aggregate global demand for gigabytes across all segments of the consumer and business markets where flash is used , and that demand may not increase at the same rate that the industry 's engineers are able to increase the company 's gigabyte output per unit cost .
So , if the world 's gigabyte demand — from consumer electronics to PCs to datacenters — does n't increase quickly enough , then technological advances in storage will lead to an oversupply of gigabytes from storage vendors .
When there 's an oversupply of gigabytes , the price of gigabytes plunges dramatically in response .
That is exactly what has happened in the past year and , in the face of the coming global downturn , that trend looks set to continue .
Because of their success in increasing the storage density of semiconductor memory , storage makers are currently left holding too many gigabytes to a market in which demand is slowing and may well contract .
In this respect , you might say that the storage makers are victims of their own success : they invented ways to make way too much of something ( gigabytes ) way too cheaply , and now they 're finding that there is n't enough demand to support sale prices that would let them maintain their profit margins .
And if you 're thinking that memory makers could just cut back production of DIMM modules , that does n't work either .
Semiconductor fabs are huge investments , and they lose money if they are n't operating at full capacity .
Typically , it 's better to let the market batter margins and keep selling product at reduced prices than to cut back on production in an attempt to boost margins .
This dynamic is precisely why Intel , Micron , and Hynix have all opted to close NAND flash fabs this year rather than see them operate at a loss .
Even before the hair - raising developments of the past two months , low consumer demand and low prices have n't been able to support the industry 's planned levels of flash production .
Sequoia Voting Systems , one of the top four voting machine vendors in the country , failed to print and deliver more than 18,000 absentee ballots to Denver County , Colorado , even though the company had assured officials the ballots were delivered , according to the Denver Post .
California - based Sequoia has a $ 742,000 contract with the county to print the ballots .
Sequoia had told officials it sent some 21,000 ballots to a Denver postal facility on October 16 , but postal officials said only about half that number arrived .
Officials learned ony over the weekend of October 25nd that Sequoia had failed to print and send the remaining ballots after voters started calling the election office complaining that their ballots had n't arrived in the mail .
Sequoia insisted that all of the ballots had been sent until election officials pressed the company to check its records .
The company finally acknowledged that some 11,000 ballots had not been shipped as stated .
Shortly thereafter , the number of missing ballots rose to 18,000 .
Sequoia sent the missing ballots last week , and Denver County voters have been told that they 're allowed to turn in their mail - in ballots in person at any polling location on Election Day .
At least one Colorado voter contacted Threat Level and said he'd been disenfranchised by the screw - up .
He said he 'd requested an absentee ballot two months ago because he travels often for work .
When nothing arrived after a month , he contacted officials , who told him they had no record of his request .
So he submitted a second request .
When the ballot still did n't arrive , he contacted the elections office but was told to be patient and wait another week .
The ballot finally arrived to his address on the 29th , but he's now out of state on business and can't get to the ballot to complete it in time before the election .
More than 193,000 mail - in ballots have been requested by Denver County voters , the Post reports .
By Tuesday of last week officials had received only 66,044 .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) ( Reuters )  Apple Inc is the target of a lawsuit that claims a technology the iPhone uses to surf the Web infringes on a patent filed by Los Angeles real estate developer Elliot Gottfurcht and two co-inventors .
The lawsuit was filed by EMG Technology LLC on Monday in the U.S. District Court in Tyler , Texas .
EMG was founded by Gottfurcht , is based in Los Angeles with an office in Tyler , and has just one employee .
The suit alleges that the technology the iPhone uses to navigate and display some websites designed for small phone screens infringes on a patent obtained last month by Gottfurcht and his co-inventors and assigned to EMG .
Apple spokeswoman Susan Lundgren declined to comment on the lawsuit , saying that the Cupertino , California - based company does not discuss pending litigation .
EMG has not considered suing companies such as HTC Corp , maker of the G1 Google phone , and Research in Motion Ltd , maker of the BlackBerry , which also produce devices that can display mobile websites , according to Gottfurcht 's lawyer Stanley Gibson , a partner with the Los Angeles law firm Jeffer , Mangels , Butler & Marmaro .
Mobile websites are essentially reformatted versions of ordinary websites , with their content manipulated to be easily viewed on tiny screens .
" We have n't looked at anything other than the iPhone , " Gibson told Reuters .
" That was the device that we looked at .
Obviously it 's very popular . "
Gibson was one of several attorneys who prosecuted a recent patent infringement case against Medtronic
Inc that resulted in a $ 570 million verdict for his clients , according to a statement issued by his law firm .

The ring is more interesting than it is often given credit for .
This post will tell you the isomorphism type of its group of units .
Why care about such a simple thing ?
Well first , the rings are universal , in the following sense .
If is any ring with unity , there exists a unique and injective homomorphism .
here is called the characteristic of .
It ’s easy to find this homomorphism : there is a natural map , and we factor out its kernel ( which is of the form , being a principal ideal domain ) .
So we should expect to come up anywhere that rings do ( though only applies to a single ring , and is disproportionately common ) .
Theorem :
If , where the product is over odd primes , the group of units can be written as a product of cyclic groups when and when .
In particular , the group of units is cyclic exactly when is a power of an odd prime , twice a power of an odd prime , or .
The rest of this post will prove this theorem .
First , the Chinese remainder theorem tells us that if factors into primes as , then .
So we only need to address the question when is a power of a prime .
What are the invertible elements in ?
If , then , so can not be invertible .
Those who are quick on the draw with the number theory will be able to quickly show that if does not divide , then is invertible in .
( the standard technique here is to note that and are relatively prime , so we can choose integers and such that )
Since there are elements divisible by , it follows that has units .
( notice that this , along with the Chinese remainder theorem , gives us a nice formula for Euler ’s phi function )
Proposition 1 : When is odd , the group of units of is a cyclic group of order .
Proof :
The case is actually the most difficult .
It is a special case of a theorem which says that a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of any field is cyclic .
For a proof of this case , see e.g. here .
( I will certainly discuss this topic in detail in a future post )
Suppose that is a generator for the group of units of .
Then the order of is divisible by , so it is of the form .
Then has order .
We claim that has order , from which it follows that has order .
What we really need to show here is that is divisible by but not .
But this is straightforward induction : if with not divisible by , then taking - th powers we see that .
Proposition 2 : If , the group of units of is the product of two cyclic groups , one of order , and one of order .
If , the group of units of is cyclic .
Proof
In fact , we will show that generates a cyclic group of order that does not contain , an element of order .
( there is nothing special about here — any choice that is will work )
We first show , by induction on , that , the case being clear .
For , the inductive hypothesis now tells us that , so there is some such that .
Squaring , we get .
Since is an element of order , this shows that generates a cyclic group of order .
So we just need to make sure that .
But a cyclic group can contain at most one element of order , and we have already shown .
The second statement in the proposition is easily verified .
Exercise : Prove the second sentence of the theorem !
( hint : for one direction , use the Chinese remainder theorem for cyclic groups , and for the other , count elements of order )

SO YOU WANNA WORK IN MOVIES ?
A response to people who ask : " How do I get into Movies ? "
By Oliver Stapleton BSC
My Credits
Jump to the Index ↓
So you have to ask yourself the question :
Am I Any Good at Anything ?
I 'm totally useless at everything ...
This is not necessarily a problem as some people working in the industry are totally useless .
Some years ago I was rude about various jobs , but then I realised there is no point in being offensive !
Some people who work on the floor , i.e. actually making the film , are totally useless but they usually do n't last very long , unless they are either very enthusiastic , very entertaining , very pretty or all three .
I 'm totally useless at everything but I am willing to learn ...
Now this is much better .
Unfortunately modern schooling means that most of us are never " first " .
So you may feel useless because people kept telling you from childhood that you could do better if you worked harder .
So you worked harder but never got to be first .
So then you got very pissed off , set fire to some things , smoked some joints and decided you were useless .
Many successful film people started life like this .
Film People are kind of outlaws anyway : it 's not a proper job .
So if you 've got bored of being bored , then working in film might just prove to you that you 're good at something , even if you can't figure out what it is .
Yet .
I 'm good with money ...
This is easy .
Films employ Accountants by the bucket load .
When there 's a few million dollars to control , or a few hundred million , the Accountant is a rather important figure .
He or she ( and it seems to be she quite a lot of the time ) does the same job that accountants do elsewhere but they can say " I 'm working with Meryl Streep at the moment " and stuff like that .
Accountants rarely see anyone connected with the film , unless they do n't pay them .
So if they see someone , they are usually angry .
This makes the job quite hard , as sometimes films run out money to pay people , then the crew turns quite ugly .
The producer or the director will make some kind of encouraging speech - " The money is definitely coming next week ... " that kind of thing .
When it does n't , the accountant is first in the firing line .
You may not want to be a movie accountant .
If you 're good at numbers , you could ignore that and do something more interesting - but do n't ask me what .
On the other hand , film accountants are usually pretty happy because they get really well paid !
Jump to the Index ↓
I like reading ...
Well this opens up a host of possibilities .
This might be the moment to confess that I am a Cinematographer , or Director of Photography , which sounds rather more grand .
This means that I only really know about what goes on when we shoot a film : what goes on before and after is not something I know much about but I can guess , and I hear stories .
Anyway , if you like reading then there are people who read , and get paid for it .
Oddly enough , they are called readers , and work for studios and producers who attract more scripts than they can read themselves .
There are some pretty amazing statistics for the number of scripts written versus the number of films made .
I do n't know what they are , but I know they are amazing .
This need not put you off being a reader however , as it means there are plenty of jobs for readers .
Now as you may have guessed , after you read a script you have to say something about it , so just being able to read does n't really get you the job - you have to be able to digest and regurgitate the material in marketspeak .
Marketspeak may or may not exist as a word , but what it means is that some Studios do n't really care whether you think the script is any good , they care if you think it might make money .
This might also mean that it is good .
There 's some really complicated system of analyzing scripts that is all entered into a computer which is supposed to say whether the script is going to be a hit .
It 's usually wrong , but sometimes isnt .
If the producer you work for actually is interested in good films , then you 're lucky .
And he or she might be able to converse with you at a higher level than marketspeak .
This might be a good moment to remind ourselves that films are many things , from shorts , docos , nature films etc to Titanic type films .
It 's important to realise that the words Film Industry are significant .
Film is an Industry , just like making cars , and on one level is rightly perceived as such by the major studios .
At the big end it is : Big Industry .
At the little end it may be pure art .
And some big films are Pure Art because someone decided they wanted to make the Big Meaningful Statement and they had the money to blow .
And they probably did blow it .
And some little films are pure industry because they are conceived , shot and designed to make money .
They sometimes do n't .
In between these things are most films , and most films have every combination of people working on them .
It is all started by the Writer .
Jump to the Index ↓
I like to write ...
Well this is good .
So do I , but I 'm not a Scriptwriter .
Scriptwriters kick - start the whole process .
Directors like to think that they are The Business , but the truth is that Scriptwriters should be right there on the Pedestal with them .
Directors get the media interest , because most Directors can talk , which is not a job requirement for a Scriptwriter .
Being able to tell " partial truths " is very important for publicity , so if you do n't think you can face the camera and say that you think the leading lady is an " Absolute Dream to work with " when you know that she is 9/10 ths SuperBitch , then do n't be a Director , ( .. or do n't do publicity ) .
But Writers can be any kind of personality , as they do n't have to appear in public .
And they do n't have to tell partial truths .
Writing film scripts is very different from writing novels or journalism or any other kind of writing .
This is because it 's not really writing .
It 's a PLAN .
Like an Architects Plan .
The dialogue is the only bit that really survives , and even that gets changed by the Director or the Actor or both .
So if you want to write and have what you write filmed exactly , then you have to Write and Direct .
Lots of people want to do this , but God made very few creatures who are able to do this .
This is because the personalities of Writers and Directors are so different : and even when such a person exists , usually one side of that person fails in the end .
Unless they are one of the few i.e .
A BRILLIANT ONE .
Anyway , back to writing scripts .
There are people who write and re-write scripts their whole lives , get paid bucketfuls of wonga ( money ) , and may never have had one of their scripts turned into a movie .
This is strange but true .
These people are usually rich when they are middle aged , and pissed off .
They only live in Hollywood ; other countries in the world do n't appear to support this species .
You could be one of these people if you like to read scripts , then go to meetings and say in a knowledgeable and forceful manner why it does n't work and then suggest better ideas which you , naturally , would write after your Agent has asked for a suitable 6 figure sum .
I guess the people who do this job started by writing original scripts , or adapting books and then got employed by Studios .
Most of them have degrees in English Literature .
Then there is writing scripts because YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY .
Now this is something else entirely .
I have had the good fortune to photograph a number of films where the Writer has something to say .
Sometimes the Writer may be a person of " First Order Originality " .
This phrase was coined by a friend of mine to define an Artist .
( Not an Actor ) .
The word Artist should be reserved for " A Person of First Order Originality " .
This means a person who HAS SOMETHING TO SAY and can say it in a way that has meaning for others .
This idea can be applied to any Art , but it does mean that the only true artist working on a film is the Writer , or a Writer / Director , or sometimes a Director working in close collaboration with a writer .
The rest of us are working to execute and contribute to THE IDEA .
So if you think you have something to say and want to say it on Film , you may be a Writer or a Writer / Director .
Kieslowski famously said , when asked why he stopped making films :
" I 've nothing left to say . "
If the rest of the World 's Directors were that honest , they 'd quit tomorrow .
There is some intelligent and sensible information now available ( 2015 ) HERE if you fancy being a Writer .

I 'm a good organiser ...
This is something that Producers do .
Well , some of them .
Stephen Frears once said to me that a Producer is someone who organises Airline Tickets .
I think he meant a Production Manager but I 'm not sure .
Producers are the top of the tree for people who work In the Office as opposed to On the Set or In the Studio .
Producers come in all shapes and sizes .
I used to just not like them in principle because I must have been influenced by all the bad things I read about them , as well as the fact they employed me , and naturally I resent authority figures .
Anyhow it turns out that now some producers are my friends and I not only like them but really admire them because they do something I could never do : persist through thick and thin for years on end believing in a film and getting it made .
This is very very hard as well as often financially very precarious .
This is because everyone thinks Producers are rich and whilst some of them are , many of them are not .
There are other kinds of Producers too : lying , cheating nasty people who snort coke and mercifully go to an early grave .
Try and avoid this kind .
If you want to work in the Production Office , you call the production ( get the number from a trade magazine like Hollywood Reporter ) and ask for the Production Manager .
The person who answers the phone is called a PA or Production Assistant and is doing the job that you want .
They wo n't put you through to the Production Manager who has better things to do than listen to another 18 year old asking for a job .
So he or she will tell you to send in a Resume , which is hard if you have n't done a job yet .
Blank sheets of paper do n't go down very well .
Now a very useful phrase to use here is Work Experience ( Intern in the USA ) - providing that you can pass for under 20 .
The word Work Experience might get you through to the Production Manager , because they do n't have to pay you .
So you can only do this , if you can support yourself in some other way .
But the Good News is that if you offer to work for free to GAIN EXPERIENCE , they might take you in , at least for awhile .
Once you are through the door then the sheer CHARM and ENTHUSIASM of your personality may make you so indispensable to the production that they hire you forever .
Or not .
Or you may fall in love with the Accountant .
The bad news is that when you finally get employed as a PA , you work ridiculous hours and get paid really , really badly .
And you have to use your own car .
A lot .
Here is a free guide on how to become a PA .
I interviewed a PA on the set of " Best of Me " in New Orleans ( 2014 ) .
Or you can just type " Film PA " into Google and you get ten zillion hits ... but then you discover most of the hits are advertising for sites than advertise jobs for PA 's ... or something like - ( 2013 ) " Poverty Row Productions Inc. is currently casting for our first feature film ! " ... the name of the company is probably a good indication of what you are in for ... ( I did n't make that up ! ) .
The other kind of Good Organiser is the Assistant Director ( the 1st AD ) .
To attain this lofty position you start as an On - Set Runner .
You apply for this by doing the same as above but phoning the 1st AD during pre-production .
He or She wo n't talk to you for the same reasons as above , but you can pull the same Work Experience trick , only On Set as opposed to In The Office .
The relationship between the First AD and the Director and Cinematographer is crucial to a good working situation on set .

I 'm a good actor ...
So am I ...
Or at least I thought I was until I went to Drama School and learnt that I was n't .
If you think you 're a good actor then you 've got yourself into a really tough place .
Actors spend most of their time being rejected and , after rejection , Unemployment .
" Withnail and I " was a hell of a Movie , but imagine actually being in that position .
Acting for film is very different to stage acting , and seems to require different talent .
I 'm still puzzled about what makes a Film Star as opposed to a Good Actor .
A Star is not necessarily a Good Actor , but sometimes is .
To become a Film Star or any kind of Actor , you have to have totally one hundred percent conviction that this is what you are , and want to be .
If you do n't have that , GET OUT NOW !
It 's the lousiest life in the world if you do n't make it .
And it 's sometimes pretty terrible if you do !
Film stars somehow make sense of the phrase " Born to It " .
If you just like doing some acting , and being around actors , then you might want to think about being a Casting Director , and doing a bit of stand - up at the local pub .

I want to Direct ...
Does n't everybody .
It 's the control thing , and the power .
All those people doing what you tell them .
Or maybe YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY .
Or maybe not .
You want a career , power , and glory .
The big question is : DO YOU SEE PICTURES IN YOUR HEAD ?
If not , forget about being a Film Director , or a Cinematographer .
Directors and Cinematographers can string pictures together in their head , like a Composer can " hear " music and then write it down .
Now some musicians ( like me ) tinkle about on an instrument until they work out a tune : this is not being a real musician .
Real Musicians hear music in their heads , then write it down , or play it .
The rest of us are just larking about , and a lot of fun it is too .
Some people say Directing is a vocation , like being a Priest or a Doctor .
It 's not remotely like being a Priest or a Doctor , but it may be a vocation , because no - one in their right mind would voluntarily go through the kind of hell that a Film Director has to go through .

Film Directors
Film Directors not only have to be able to visualize in their heads , but they also have to be able to deal with a lot of very demanding and very different types of people .
Occasionally someone like Karasawa or Hitchcock appear .
People like them are so brilliant that they clearly do n't live in the same world as us mere mortals .
And it is up to us to Protect and Preserve People like Them - the Brilliant Ones .
In the Good Old Days ( a phrase banned from my vocabulary , but I 'm allowed to write it ) , the Brilliant Ones were revered by society : Philosophers , Writers , Composers , and Artists .
Nowadays Film Directors of all kinds get the treatment , but most of them are not The Brilliant Ones , but are just Ordinary Mortals trying to get in the limelight and make a decent movie .
Good luck to them .
I do n't like working with Directors who do n't have anything to say , and are horrid to everybody because they perceive themselves as being important .
They do n't like working with me much either ( fortunately ) .
Some Directors are really nice people but not very good Directors , and some of them are really Brilliant but not very nice .
Occasionally you will find one who is really Brilliant and Really Nice .
Try and work with these !
The thing to remember if you aim to become a film director is that it is not necessary to behave badly ( unless you 're a Genius , in which case you can't help it . )
And also that the one person on the film set who does n't have to know anything technically is the Director .
He or She can have their heads completely immersed in the Script and the Actors and that 's all right by me .
Because that 's what we do - the Crew : we supply the technical expertise .
Actually , when I wear a free T - shirt that says CREW on a film , I can't work out whether the DP ( Director of Photography ) is really Crew or Management .
Anyhow , the DP , Operator ( maybe the same person ) and the Script Supervisor can work out how to shoot the film with the Director .
Directors who dictate everything are really boring to work with - especially when they are nasty .
If they are a Brilliant One people forgive them , but if they are just dull , then they do n't .
Directors have 6 phases of collaboration to make a movie .
This involves the following procedures , amongst a ton of other things .
Development
Collaboration with the Producer (s ) ( or themselves ) .
Collaboration with the Writer(s ) ( or themselves . )
Pre-Production & Shooting
Collaboration with the Production , Production Designer , Costume Designer & Make - Up ... Collaboration with the Cinematographer .
Post - Production
Collaboration with the Editor & Composer .
Collaboration with Marketing ( or not ! ) .
Unfortunately Development sometimes takes years and does n't get paid , so it 's a good idea to keep that Cafe Job during this period .
Pre-production is an exciting period because there arises the possibility that the film you 've been working on for years might actually be shot .
Shooting is even more exciting because it's the REAL THING , the PARTY .
Some directors hate shooting because of this .
They like to be holed up with the material and play with it in the peace and quiet of the cutting room .
Shooting is exciting because you get to see what the writer wrote on the screen .
You get to go on location , travel in Business Class , and stay for free in Nice Hotels ( sometimes . )
There is a really good study of Directors HERE .
Read this carefully and take notes if you want to be a Film Director !

I wanna work on the movie set but I do n't know which job ...
There is a lot of information in in the Q&A section specifically about CAREER .
Good Directors and Cinematographers , Production and Costume Designers , are people who do n't have a real choice .
They know by the time they are 30ish that that 's what they want to do .
They may not know before this , if they are in the " I'm Useless " category from previous life trauma .
It might be useful to describe what the other jobs are , to see if theres one there that grabs your fancy .
I 'm sticking to the US system here , as I find the UK system completely confusing .
The departments are alphabetical in case you think there is some significance in the order .

Agents
I used to hate Agents because they always struck me as everything that I despise in people : people who live off the talent of others .
Then I discovered I really like my own Agents so whilst I still feel the same about Agents in general , I find it hard to be nasty about them .
I worked with a young actor doing his first job a couple of years ago and asked him what percentage his Agent took .
" 10 % " he said , " but then the Business Manager gets 15 % also . "
Getting out my calculator I realised this added up to 25 % which I thought was outrageous for a young man doing his first job and probably not getting much for it anyway .
I asked him why he needed an Agent and a Business Manager and he shrugged and said that all actors had them .
So if you 're thinking about being an Actor , take this on board now !
Agents work in large corporations like ICM and William Morris and spend a lot of their time on the phone and doing lunch .
When you start out you will hear people saying " I need an Agent to get a job " and then " I ca n't get an Agent because I havent got a job . "
Agents wont talk to you when you 're nowhere and they wont stop talking to you when you 've arrived .
The best way to start work is to work with your mates : hopefully you all get successful together then you pick and choose your agent because they all want a part of you when your WOM ( Word of Mouth ) gets to be on the ascent .
As far as I am concerned , Agents do my deals ( and that 's a great relief to me ) but they do n't usually get me jobs .
During my months off in Deepest Darkest Devon they call me up to gossip which is nice .
My English
Agent does n't want me to publish this in case people think I 'm cynical and nasty ... ( I 'm not ) .
My American
Agent thinks its just funny .
Both of them would prefer it if I just stuck to Cinematography .

Animal Trainer
I left this job out for ten years for some reason : careless admission because not only is the job very important , but it can be done very very well and also very badly !
Many an actor has gone sailing past a mark because the horse did not stop , and horse trainers never tire of telling you that no actors can ride .
One guy told me that Clint Eastwood " is a lousy rider " - hard to believe !
There are companies that specialize in this work in most countries that have any kind of film work : if this interests you then go and see them .
Needless to say , you have to love animals - from Lions and Panthers to Scorpions and Rats .

Art Department
The Art Department works both on the set during the actual shooting process , and " prepares " the sets .
The jobs here are The Production Designer ( chief Honcho ) , then Art Directors ( they draw up the plans that he or she has visualised ) , Construction Managers who supervise the building of sets , Buyers who drive about renting or buying the props , then Propmen who actually control the props on set .
This is the only Art Department On Set job ( but see below ) , apart from someone called the Standby Painter .
People who do these jobs are often quite strange .
Particularly Stand By Painters , who are often very skilled painters who earn lots of money for the job but gain precious little job satisfaction as the job mostly consists of darkening down hotspots created by the lighting .
If you 're a good Artist , youd be better off aiming to be a Scenic Artist who paints the backdrops that are used outside windows etc .
It 's quite a lonely job because you 're not part of the Crew , but at least you get to paint some Really Big Pictures !
And the Good Ones get to be Very Well Paid !
Clarissa Shanadan left this is the guestbook a while back so I 've put it here :
I am a Production Designer in the US [ East Coast ! ] .
As the variety of PD that came up through the Art Department , I wanted to speak up about the world of being a Scenic Artist , as it still seems to be a rather mysterious position to some .
I was a Scenic Artist for many years , working on gigantic productions , as well as some smaller " good " ones .
Here 's a brief rundown of the structure of the department :
The Scenics work under the Charge Scenic , who corrals and purposes the whole department .
The Shopman or Industrial ( Union Category for this position ) is the person who runs the scenic shop and fulfills orders , keeps track of bedgets and , sometimes , cleans the brushes ... depends , of course , on who you are working for !
The other specified postion is the Camera Scenic , or Stanby Painter as you have noted .
This is inded the person who has to " tie in " anything that is " glaring " ... very often waiting for hours and then during a quick bathroom break gets screamed at over the walkie !
I never liked doing this ... but it 's a job that works well for a charming people - person with lightning quick reflexes and insane talent .
Back to the scenic crew ... they are the ones that do everything from painting new construction to look like decrepid burned - out buildings to creating backdrops to use for exteriors to match interiors built on stage .
Then there is re-producing paintings for film ... this is the real payoff - jobs like these .
Scenics have to know everything about materials , and they have to be able to amuse each other whilst rolling walls for days on end ... to make anything look like anything ...
On big Productions , these are Union positions ...
The Union is notoriously hard to get into and involves a lengthy exam .
All this said , provided you know your way round a paintbrush it 's a position that you can get into by trying out non-Union shops and the Work Experience Gag might get your foot in the door ...
If you 're a Really Really Good Artist , do n't work in films , or work in films for the money then use it for your Art .
Or become a Production Designer !
Production Designing is a fascinating job , and is what you get to be when you 've either climbed the Department ladder , or are a Brilliant One who comes in sideways , or goes to Film School .
Sometimes they trained as Architects .
Production Designers do the same job as the DP - a one - to - one thing with the Director - only it happens in early pre-production .
When the DP turns up , the emphasis turns to him or her , as the DPs arrival means : Were Actually Going to Shoot This Movie !
People think the " look " of a movie is in the hands of the Director and the Cinematographer but that 's not true .
It 's in the hands of four people : Director , DP , Production and Costume Designer .
( Oops , Make - Up too ! )
You can't photograph something that is nt there , no matter how you light it .
( But see The Future ) .
I also copied this from the guestbook :
Hi ,
I am a Set Dresser , I noticed that you did n't mention my line of work .
Most of the time " I pick things up and drop things off " .
This is the by far best part of my job .
I am also called upon to think on my feet .
I fix things , wire things , hang lights and over pack everything .
I have worked as a scenic and a construction utility on many productions , I was also a wife and mom for 23 years , they do n't call it the mother of invention for nothing .
My experiences comes in handy since we are constantly thinking outside of the box .
I was called upon to repair antique treadle sewing machines for a very large sweatshop scene on King Bolden .
We are filming in Wilmington , NC .
I made the mistake of admitting I can sew .
I am now apparently an expert on antique sewing machines , nice .
I am enthusiastic , a fast learner and apparently not hard to look at , as you mentioned advantageous to keeping my job for months at a time .
it is my belief that we have the best job of all the crews , unless of course the Head Set Dresser hires his tiny , inexperienced wife , then her problems become my problems .
If she can't do the job apparently it must be my fault because I am called upon to facilitate her , but her ineptitude is without bounds ... oops I was venting .
Oh did I mention set dressers have a lot of time to whine ... hehehe .
Fix it in production ...

So under the auspices of the Art Department come all sorts of people , and there may be a skill here you fancy .
Painters , Carpenters , Scenic Artists , Construction Foreman , Riggers ( Grips ) , etc...etc .
Here is a reasonable description of how to become a Set Decorator .
Here 's a good link to a site that gives more detail about Set Contruction jobs : Howstuffworks

Assistant Director
It would not be unreasonable to think that this department might be one you would enter if you thought you might direct some day .
Strangely enough , this is not usually the case - with some notable exceptions .
At the runner level , this job can be quite interesting for awhile , as the tasks you get to do are many and varied .
" Get me some Tea , get the Actor some tea , get someone else some tea and then ... get COFFEE ! "
That 's about it .
Well , apart from driving 30 miles to get a Starbucks Maciado for Mr Superstar , then putting up with being blamed for it being cold .
If you survive a couple of years of this , you get to be a Third which involves trying to get the actors out of their trailers which can take considerable skill , then a Second which means you get more involved with the schedule and spend more time on set , covering for the First when he / she has to go to the Dentist etc .
The First Assistant Director is probably the most under appreciated job on the set , and certainly in the wider industry .
In a world where you can just about get an Oscar for Craft Service , it is surprising there is no AD Oscar .
It could be because only those who work on the film know whether the AD did a good job - it 's quite impossible to tell from looking at a movie , unless you are one of those strange people who look at background action , which is set by the AD , mostly .
A good AD makes my life a lot more pleasant .
The worst ones are mostly English ( with notable exceptions as always ) .
That 's because there is a certain kind of Englishman who thinks anyone foreign is crap .
They shout a lot and think they are very important , which is very tedious .
A good AD makes everyone efficient by exerting quiet authority and competence , which makes everyone work well and enjoy making the movie .
The First AD is chosen by the Producer and Director , but the DP needs to be involved or at least aware of who it is , because if they do n't like each other it makes for a Bad Movie Experience ( which of course has nothing to do with the result being good or bad ) .
Remember that Making a Movie is a completely different thing from Watching a Movie .
I sometimes wonder if they are connected at all !
I have had a very good experience with a " new generation " English AD ( 2007 ) which I am happy to say has transformed my opinion of English AD's .
He did n't call anyone a nasty name and he and his team were a real delight to work with !
There is a fantastic piece of research HERE by Stephen Fellows about being an AD - looking at payscales etc and also some pithy comments made by working AD's .
His website is well worth subscribing to .

Casting Director
This strikes me as rather a good job , as the people who i've come across who do it seem to have lives .
In other words , they are not constantly on the road , working ridiculous hours and looking harassed .
Quite a lot of women do this job for some reason - maybe the above reason .
It involves reading the script and understanding which actor would be good for what role .
This is not as easy at it sounds as you have to ( a ) know every actor in the world and ( b ) know which one fits the role .
Once you 've worked that out you have to find out if they are interested / available / affordable etc .
You do all this in collaboration with the director and producer who naturally get the credit - or the grief - for the choices .
Curiously you can only offer a role to one actor at a time , so movies frequently get hung up waiting for an actor to accept or reject an offer : naturally they hang on as long as possible to reply , knowing that the Producer can't move on till they have .
I think this is completely ridiculous but what do I know .
So Casting Director I would rate as an OK job , as long as you do n't mind never being thanked and getting no public acknowledgement for your contribution .
You have to like eating .
A lot .
And often .

Catering
I forgot to put this in until a friend pointed out it was the most important department on the shoot .
I can't imagine people dream of being caterers when they are little , but maybe they do .
It 's a terrible job with absolutely no glamour attached in any shape or form .
The actors do n't usually talk to you as some hapless PA ( maybe YOU ) has to take their lunch to their zillion dollar pop-out ( that 's a trailer ) .
But then some actors do n't do this : they join the queue like ordinary mortals , call the caterer by their first names and ask politely what 's on the menu .
Then they come to the lunch tent - unless you 're in the UK where you are more likely standing by the side of the road with your lunch balanced on a traffic signal box ... then they sit with the crew i.e. us .
I like these people !
All I know about catering is that they get to the set very very early in the morning ( probably 5 am ) and never stop working for one moment in a hot cramped steamy hellhouse truck .
They do Breakfast in 5 languages , then Morning Tea , then Lunch for 1 pm which might be 4 pm and then Afternoon Tea .
Somehow these miraculous human beings remain cheerful and bright and often serve astonishingly good food in appalling conditions .
Naturally half the crew always hate the catering which shows that people have different tastes .
I salute you if you decide that Catering is your thing .
A gentleman in the Guestbook went on a rant about " crafty " .
In case you are English and do n't know what this means , it 's a strange American term for " Craft Services " which for some reason refers to a talented and skilled person who , in addition to the actual Caterer , provides " on set " food .
This can result in a minimum of 5 meals a day if you are not very careful , and might account for the size of American Film Crews .
In the UK we can't afford to employ such a person , so you get Tea and Coffee , with the occasional biscuit .

Composer
One of the crosses I have to bear is that Id rather be a Composer than a DP .
Unfortunately I 've only composed about 3 tunes in 50 years which wouldnt really pay the mortgage .
I am more jealous of Composers than any other person in film , because these people do n't need a hi- fi to hear music  what a gift !
Composing for film I would rate as qualifying for the word Artist , as Music for Film stands on it's own outside of the film , just as The Script does ( and everything else does n't ) .
You do n't need to think about being a Composer  you either are one or you are n't .
And do n't forget being a Composer is different to being a Musician , or mucking about on a Guitar .
Strangely enough , some Composers can't write music , but rely on others to do it for them from their ideas .
These people are more like Producers , and sometimes come from a DJ background .
If you look into the history of the great film composers , you will see that you have to have it " built - in " from birth , and then work very very hard to secure a career .
I had a Guestbook entry ( 2009 ) from Hannah Bernstein who said this :
I think you may have overlooked the position of " Music Editor " which I think is rather valuable in film .
While this job is often performed by Sound Editors in smaller features , larger pictures tend to designate a specific " Music Editor " ( and often multiple music editors ) to cut a composer ''s music to fit a film .
Often big name composers will have a designated music editor , much like a big name star will have a designated makeup artist .
Tom Newman works with Bill Bernstein ( my uncle ) , James Horner works with Dick Bernstein ( my father ) ...
I suppose perhaps it runs in families , like you say the prop department does .
I have yet to see .
Oh , another thing .
Sometimes big budget movies will have " temp dubs " where they 'll have the music editor score a movie with bits and pieces of collected other works that suit the film , so they can screen it before a composer has completed original music for the film .
It also can give the composer ideas for a film .
Hope that was illuminating to someone ... be forewarned though , if you 're thinking of breaking into this facet of the industry , prepare to spend a few years in what 's essentially an apprenticeship with a specific composer .
You 'll get paid assistant 's wages for learning a highly - skilled job , and probably have to deal with moody people and a lot of film politics ( everyone has an opinion about the music ... you have to do a lot of fancy footwork to both appease the director and not cut too much into the composer 's fancy score ) .
Oh , plus , there 's very , very few of these guys actually getting reliable work , what with the fact that it 's such a nuanced position .
Basically , find someone talented and ride that train , or you 'll be stuck in temp dubs forever .
You can see some illustrations of a studio recording in progress .

Costume Department
It 's not hard to imagine what they do .
If you 're handy with a sewing machine or like laundering sweaty famous peoples clothes or are a Brilliant Costume Designer , there 's a good job at the bottom of the " costume " ladder here .
The Costume Designer is working behind the scenes , with an assistant who is actually responsible for the day to day fitting and maintaining of the costumes .
Costume and Production Design is sometimes ( but rarely ) the same person .
If so , they are kinda busy and may not be able to take your " I 'm really handy with a knitting needle " type call .
Dating a sewing girl may be the answer , or if you 're not that way inclined , try the " I designed this dress myself " approach .
But only if it 's any good .
Costume Designers for film definitely can be " I Like This Job " type people , as it is very creative and influences strongly the overall look and colour of a picture .
Costume Designers on the whole are pretty obsessed , and know more about clothes from every country and every century than any human being has a right to know .
They usually come from some Art / Fashion background and are often good painters or musicians .
As you can guess , I do n't know much about Costume Design , and wear the clothes to prove it .
Here 's a clip with the fabulous Jenny Bevan .
Here is some of her advice :
Make lists .
While making lists of each character , what clothes they may need , how many doubles and specifics , you will have to re-read the script many times and so begin to understand the characters .
I think the answer to working with large teams of people successfully is to like them , appreciate them and tell them you appreciate them .
Very good note for fledgling Directors !

Editor
I would love to be a film editor ( if I ca n't be a Director or a Composer ) .
I spent a year cutting a film of my own once a long time ago .
It was absolutely fascinating !
But I could n't take being locked up in a room with monitors all over the place for weeks , months and years on end so it 's not for me really .
Editors are incredibly important to the film process as they can literally save a film from catastrophe .
They do n't get a lot of credit in Public but the industry really values a Brilliant Editor .
If you like putting images together on computer and playing with sound / image combinations then you may be on the road to being an Editor .
There are lots of very intellectual books written about film editing .
Good luck reading them .
Actually , there are a lot of intellectual articles written about film : this is n't one of them .
I have to love the editor who is cutting a film I shoot , because all my hard work winds up in his or her hands .
Occasionally an editor cuts a film against the way it is shot , which is a catastrophe and never works .
Mostly editors improve enormously what was shot in the first place by juxtaposing it in the right way and adding all sorts of ideas that were never thought of during the shooting .
It 's a fascinating job , but you have to like sitting down a lot , and persuading all sorts of people that your way is the right way .
The Sound Editor is also a crucial part of the editing process ( there 's an Oscar for this too ! ) .
All those sound effects that are added are sometimes very subtle and you 'd have to turn the picture off to hear them .
In this department all kinds of people contribute both in terms of recording effects for post - production use , and also skillfully blending the final music from the composer into the movie , so that it balances well with the dialogue and effects .
It can be a technically very complicated job ( lots of nobs and dials ! ) but also very rewarding if you like listening very very hard and are very smart .
Here are some illustrations of a studio recording in progress .

Key Grip and Grips
This title seems to baffle the public more than any other - along with Best Boy .
The Gaffer and the Key Grip both have a Best Boy , or should I say , employ a Best Boy .
Sometimes the Best Boy is a Girl but she 's still called the Best Boy .
Now that really de-mystifies it does n't it ?
Perhaps not .
The Best Boy is simply the next one down the line in Seniority from the Key Grip or the Gaffer and is usually responsible for the paper work and liaison with the Production Office .
They are n't either Boys or Girls but usually Real Men. do n't ask me where the title comes from , but all things lead back to the Old Days in the Studio , - so ask someone who was there .
A Key Grip said this :
The term Grip and Best Boy come from English theatre .
The " Grip " is a term for a bag of tricks .
So get the grip , or bag if tricks , became the guy with the bag of tricks .
" The Grip " .
And the Best Boy as the first assistant was the best boy Apprentice of sorts , to the gaffer doing lighting with limelight .
The Key Grip is the Chief Honcho of the Grips .
Grips , like it sounds , do stuff with their hands , and after a few rounds at the pub , occasionally use their feet .
Carpenters , Riggers , Stagehands ( UK ) are all Grips in the USA .
In the UK they are Carpenters , Riggers and Stagehands .
In the UK they do n't have an on - set boss , and are employed by the Construction Foreman who is not part of the on - set crew .
This is the daffiest system ever invented and causes a lot of grief .
In the USA all the people on set concerned with lighting the set either fall under the Key Grip or the Gaffer so everyone has a Leader .
This is a good thing .
Italy , Germany , France and Australia all have a kind of hybrid in - between system that is not as good as the USA but better than the UK .
Note that I am talking about structure here , not people .
Other DP 's love the UK system and hate the US system .
That 's life .
The Key Grip accompanies the Gaffer and the DP - and representatives from all the other departments on the Recce from the word " reconnaissance " or Scout from the word er ... " Scout " ... before the film commences .
This is where everyone finds out what is going on - sometimes .
The Key Grip makes all the notes about Camera stuff , Tracking , Cranes etc and the Gaffer makes the notes about the lights .
In the UK , the Gaffer is supposed to make notes about everything but can't because it 's too much work for one person .
In most countries other than the UK , The Key Grip owns a truck full of Grip type stuff .
These are things like Track , Speedrail ( an improvement on scaffolding ) , Nets ( for Lights ) , Reflectors , etc etc .
This is called a basic package and you hire the man and his package - as it were .
Then he has his Grips who often he will work with for years on end .
This team is thus very coherent both in terms of equipment and personnel .
In the UK , this type of equipment is rented from Rental Companies , as we do n't have Key Grips with gear .
We have a Dolly Grip who pushes the dolly , but usually they do n't own any equipment , and if they do it 's restricted to camera type equipment , as the Grip in the UK has nothing to do with lighting .
Because the Grip Gear is not privately owned in the UK , it 's usually not in as good condition , nor as up - to - date as the equivalent in the USA .
And it is " deployed " by Electricians , who usually do n't like handling large sail - like sheets of plastic that have a habit of taking off in the wind .
Nor do they have the necessary gear for holding them down , with the result that many more reflectors blow over in the UK than they do in the USA .
This would just be funny if it was n't dangerous and expensive .
There is a statistical study on this available at www.blowndown.com.
Mark Vargo , ASC , made this video about Grips ( 2013 ) .
It 's really good and explains the US system very well .
Despite what I say above , in the UK everything you see in his film takes place but is done by a mix of Electicians , Dolly Grips , Stagehands , Riggers and even the Standby painter gets involved sometimes .
Strangely it works just as well , and like all film crew everywhere people " lend a hand " if one is needed .
Some UK DP 's like the US Key Grip system and some do n't : like everything you get used to it and it works , just like the UK system , or the German system , or the Australian system etc .
" Sidenote " pointed out in my Guestbook ( 2009 ) that I do n't say much about Dolly Grips .
That was quite kind really , as I have n't said anything about Dolly Grips !
Oops ..
The job requires a delicate mixture of real physical strength combined with an almost intuitive understanding of what the actor is going to do .
Although the Dolly Grip is following pre-laid marks ( most of the time ) , there is a lot of interpretation that goes on during the shot when the Grip really knows what he is doing .
A good Dolly Grip not only makes the Operators life a joy , but also the focus pullers .
When the camera " lags " behind the actor and then " catches up " , this makes pulling the focus - a tough job in the first place - much harder .
This was why Camera Teams often stick together : Operator , Focus and Dolly Grip sometimes for a team that can go on for years .
" 24 " would be a good example of intense co-operation between these people : it is shot very fast with two cameras constantly on the move both on the Zoom and the Dolly .
This " style " has become very popular today and is seen in all kinds of thrillers as well as TV : I think it is called " Edgy " , or so it seems when Directors talk about it in Meetings .
A good sense of humour is almost a pre-requisite for a great Dolly Grip : it 's a tough job ...
One of the only people I ever fired was an Irish Dolly Grip .
This was because he was a flashy fella who rode a motorcyle and knew nothing about the job , but pretended he did .
If you 're a Dolly Grip , you can't fake it .

On - Set Dresser / Standby Art Director ( UK )
This is a post that happens on some movies and not on others .
It 's a position that is very helpful to the Production Designer as the On - Set Dresser looks after the " integrity " of the set .
A good one also keeps a constant eye on the frame , and makes helpful suggestions to the DP about alternative ideas for the dressing .
Some on the more anal ones make constant complaints about anything that is slightly out of continuity , like my teacup .
This job is often done by women , and it's an important and vital part of the framing , composition , colour and " integrity " of the set ... that 's why I love it when there is someone personable , interested and creative doing this job .
When a Production Designer wins an Oscar , the set - dresser shares this Gong which shows what an important job it is .
On a smaller movie the same person actually organises all the furniture etc and then takes care of it when you shoot .
On bigger films the chief honcho is not on set , but employs someone else to " look after " the set .

Lighting
The Gaffer runs the lighting crew , who are called Electricians ( UK ) or sometimes Lamp Operators ( " Lamp Ops " - US ) .
In the UK an Electrician has to actually be a qualified Electrician , whereas in the USA they do n't .
The Electricians in the UK are responsible for not only putting up the lights , but also any reflectors , nets etc associated with lights .
This is daft , and is sometimes slower than the US system .
But British is Best and so no one appears to be interested in changing the system .
There are an increasing number of women working in the USA as Electricians , especially on the East Coast .
They are really good , but have disadvantages in being shorter and less strong than men .
On the other hand they work really hard , and have boxes they can stand on .
Grips and Electricians on location are not far removed from when the cowboys rode into town in times gone by .
They work hard , play hard and are the worlds nicest people .
A famous Make - Up artist said to me once when I was talking to her about Male Actors : " Of course , they 're not Real Men. Real men are Grips and Electricians . "
Actors are highly paid , pampered and flattered .
Grips and Electricians are moderately paid , work long hours often in appalling conditions and rarely complain .
Real Men .
But then some actors are real men too , so they 're OK .

Lighting is an incredibly wonderful , complex , absorbing and creative part of film - making .
A Designer friend recently told me that film is " Nothing but Light and Shade ... " and in many ways that is exactly true .
Prior to around 2012 , lighting was solely in the hands of the Cinematographer because what we shot was mostly in the film the way we shot it .
Then a revolution took place and images had the potential to be highly manipulated in post - production - and not necessarily by the Cinematographer .
So suddenly Everyone could poke their finger into the image and change it , not just subtely but radically .
Then films like Avatar , Hugo and Gravity started winning Oscars for Cinematography and a fierce debate broke out as to whether the Oscar for Cinematography should be be split into two categories ...
Whether or not this happens is immaterial ... in the real world .
Cinematographers salaries have been in free - fall over the last 5 years and the power to " make the picture " is in the hands of a long chain of people - the Cinematographer is still the origin of that chain and this is important to remember .
In fact the challenge of " managing people " is now an even more important part of the Cinematographers job than it was - it is only by his or her influence that the modern Cinematographer can have some hope that their crafted image will survive the process without too much cropping , zooming , re-timing and all the other ways the picture can be changed in post .
I have had my first experience of a Studio telling me what Camera I should shoot the film with !
I find this quite offensive : I 'm sure those execs in the Studio would not appreciate it if I come into their office and suggest to them what kind of computer and software they should use !
Our shrinking patch of power needs sturdy defense at this point , and we need to remind such people that Cameras are What We Do and there is no - one out there who knows more about them than we do .
It 's interesting that Studio Execs do n't tell me to use Arri Lights , or Mole - Richardson Lights ... this is because lighting units are not something you have in your living room - but you might have a Canon 5D or a Red camera because it 's trendy & maybe you bought one for your son .
So they learn a little bit about cameras and suddenly they are experts ...
Do n't listen to these people - be charming and dazzle them with knowledge and they 'll soon shut up .
Maybe all that techno jargon will come in handy here : just start a few sentences with the word " 10 - Bit " and they 'll soon glaze over .
I 've found the word " reliability " quite useful here ... especially in relation to a certain camera ...
For a good overview of lighting units you could look at Mark Varga 's 2012 video about lights Let There Be Light .
There 's also a nice down - to - earth description of the Gaffer 's job written by Lee Walters .

Locations
This department is one of the hardest working and the least rewarded in the industry , During the pre-production phase they have to come up with a thousand folders full of pictures which the Production Designer then chooses from and takes the Director to see .
Getting the pictures involves extreme amounts of charm and ability to drive great distances for a very long time , with very little sleep .
Just when you think prep is over and it's time to relax , you become responsible for parking the 8 thousand equipment trucks and star trailers , as well as all the crew cars and anyone else who cares to drop in .
This means being on set hours before call ( when you get there ) and wrap ( when you leave ) .
Just in case you thought you could take a nap during the shooting day , the cameraman announces he or she needs a very large light on the balcony three stories up owned by some fella whose been yelling at you for half an hour to get the hell out of his neck of the woods .
This is where the charm comes in .
If you are mad enough to want to do this ( and plenty are ) , call the production office and ask for the location department .
Explain that you never sleep , do n't want any money , know the area intimately and own a Ferrari .
Who knows what might happen .

Make - Up and Hair
This sometimes is one job ( like at the BBC ) but usually separate on Big Features .
This is a job that you can actually train for outside of making films .
Successful " Star Attached " make - up and Hair people can make outrageous sums of money for some reason .
Probably because they make the ageing female star more comfortable and flatter her with " youthful " make up techniques .
Traditionally there is a kind of war between Make - Up and DP's - usually because the Make - Up People want every female to be lit with flat light near the camera to iron out the wrinkles , and the DP may be more interested in dramatic lighting .
Usually it 's the DP that gets fired , because the make - up people are " career dependent " on the Star , and they can whisper in their ear whilst they twiddle their hair .
Quite ordinary people do make - up and hair jobs in some quite fancy films .
It 's a good job providing you do n't mind getting up very early in the morning and working long hours - albeit with many breaks .
It 's quite mixed in gender - more so than any other department .
Some Make - Up
Chiefs are very fierce and often quite Brilliant at what they do .
And some of them should go back to doing manicures in a LA highstreet .
If the Make - Up and Hair is full of good humour , the actors are more likely to arrive on set in a good frame of mind : something I very much approve of .
But if they keep telling the actor / actress that " out there " is a bunch of no - goods hell - bent on making them ugly , then that makes my job a tad more difficult .
I 've only had a couple of nasty experiences with Make - Up people : as for the rest , I love them !
As a DP , it 's very important to form a good relationship with this department , as you can work together to make the Stars look as good as possible : a good Make - Up artist will always take kindly to you calling them over to point our some imperfection that could be helped with a judicious application of some very expensive product ...

Props Department
This falls under Art Department really , although some Prop Men think they are working only for themselves , and act like Security Men for the set .
These type of Propmen are basically a pain .
There are not a lot of Propwomen , but I wish there were .
On the other hand , a good enthusiastic witty and insane Propperson can liven up an otherwise dull shoot .
Especially if they are Scottish .
Props is often a family thing , so unless your great grandfather was a Propman , forget about it .
Or make one up .
You have to really like objects and knowing where they are : you may be a butterfly collector in your spare time .
Prop people are actually quite amazing : the attention to detail is extraordinary , and many an actor suddenly says " where 's that pen I used last week " and seconds later it appears on set ...
I do n't know how they do it .
This guy got creative and these cup holders are appearing on trendy Hollyood sets ... gotta do something in that downtime !
I just added some pictures to this section and noticed that all three have women in them !
So I guess times have changed ...

Publicity and Marketing
This is a very important element of making films , which can make or break the release of a film in terms of box office .
I 've shot a couple of really good films that no - one went to see because of inadequate marketing , as well as the reverse .
Someone should e-mail me with something about this department because I know so little about it .
There are people called EPK ( Electronic Press Kit ) who actually are humans ( I think ) who lurk about the set - usually on the day when you are shooting a close - up of a newspaper or a frog - then they are n't there the next day when you have 14 cameras and drain the Red Sea .
The hapless video cameraperson ( note the non-sexist terminology ) , endlessly rolls tape of people doing very mundane things - then when they try to photograph the Star they get shouted at .
They interview the important people - and some of the less important people but they do n't use that footage .
The " Making Of . .. " docos have become very popular on TV and DVD so Marketing people have more to aim for than they used to .
As a sidenote , 90 % of the newspapers , magazines , TV stations etc etc are owned by the same few giant companies ( who also own the film studios ) : if you work in this field you cannot , absolutely cannot tell the truth about anything .
Publicity and Truth are not on the same page : but if you are attracted to Marketing : Good Luck - someone has to do it .

Projectionist
A " very unhappy projectionist " called Stephen Lowe pointed out in my Guestbook ( Entry # 225 ) that I omitted his job ( 2009 ) and he is quite right : I did omit his job and I apologise for this .
Thousands of projectionists all over the world look after the increasingly complex projection equipment and whilst some of them do not seem to be paying much attention to the focus , others really do look after their machines and make the print or Digital Cinema look as good as possible .
So thanks Stephen , and I hope this entry will contribute towards making you a happier projectionist : and whilst I am at it : THANKS TO ALL PROJECTIONISTS EVERYWHERE WHO MAKE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES ON THE SCREENS !

Script Supervisor ( used to be " Continuity Girl " - UK )
For some reason a woman always does this job .
Perhaps because it's a kind of " keeping house " type job .
( Oops ! )
The script supervisor in the USA does a lot less work than the equivalent in the UK .
In the USA the script supervisor does n't appear to be responsible for continuity : this job is given to the relevant department - props for props , wardrobe for wardrobe etc .
In the UK , continuity is taken VERY SERIOUSLY by the Continuity Girl .
Some of them are the most annoying people that God has ever created .
Many times as the Actors get themselves revved up to some pinnacle of performance , the hard and bitter tones of the English Continuity Girl chime in with some irrelevant detail of continuity which as often as not is not even in the frame !
This drove Michael Winner to mutter the immortal line : Continuity is for Cissies !
People who watch movies for continuity mistakes clearly do n't enjoy watching movies .
Fortunately as the younger generation of UK Continuity girls take over , the old dingbats are retiring .
Many of them of course are absolutely lovely and very very good at their jobs and I shall miss them dearly .
And some of them ...
Well , enough said .
In the USA , the job has a different emphasis , as they do n't get involved in the Continuity of the different departments .
But this drives me bats as well , as No-one seems to Care !
So I find myself watching out for Continuity when I 'm doing a picture in the USA , which definitely is n't my job .
As far as my job is concerned , the most important contribution that the Script Supervisor makes is listing the shots we have decided to shoot , then reminding the Director and I about what we decided , as well as pointing out Eyeline blunders , and occasionally making brilliant suggestions that everyone else has missed .
Some do this really well and frequently save both the Director and me from terrible blunders .
It 's a good job to do for a while if you are a budding scriptwriter , because you work closely with the script and see at first hand the triumphs and failures of the written word being translated into film .
Just recently some second unit shooting was all rendered unusable because the production did n't want to pay for a Script Supervisor for the second unit , resulting in a whole slew of glaring continuity errors that could not be consigned to the " never mind " category .
Oct 2005 .
Just finished shooting The Hoax directed by Lasse Hallstrom .
The script supervisor ( the Really Excellent Mary Kelly ) took great delight in chuckling about my apparently bad attitude towards Script Supervisors as evidenced in this document .
In re-reading it , however , I feel no need for apologies or changing anything as it really amounts to the same thing as any other job in the business : there are people who do the jobs well and people who do them badly .
Mercifully , I mostly work with people who do them well !

Sound
People who record sound on pictures are often very eccentric .
This could be because the job requires a great deal of technical skill , an " artistic " vision , and a thick skin .
The latter requirement is very important because no one on the set really cares about sound .
This could be for a variety of reasons .
One would be that it can be re-done afterwards ( called ADR ) , another would be that it is regarded as secondary to the picture despite the fact that it is 50 % of the sensory input of Cinema .
Above all the microphone just does n't have the same " pull " as the lens - put a microphone in front of someone in a public place and you get a very different reaction to concentrating a lens on them .
People tend to go mute in subtly different ways when confronted by the camera or the microphone for some deeply mystifying reason .
The well known idea that the camera steals your soul applies just as well to microphones , albeit in a different way .
Yesterday ( well yesterday a couple of years ago ) we filmed a lot of love scenes ( for Birthday Girl ) and decided to do them without sound .
The set was " off- limits " to everyone except the Director , DP , Focus Puller and Make - Up .
This had a curiously liberating effect as all the razzmatazz of film technique was left outside the door .
We did n't call for quiet as we shot , so everyone in the studio just carried on talking while we shot these breathy love scenes .
This is how they shot before sound came along and people had to shut up during the takes .
What is interesting is the process is less reverential to the Actors , allowing it to be just one activity on the stage amongst many others .
So , over here we have a man sawing a piece of wood , over here the Producer and Production Manager discuss what is wrong with the Catering , and over here ( behind the wall ) the leading Actor and Actress are pretending to shag each other .
Mmmm ...
Anyhow , back to the Sound Department .
The Recordist is the Chief Honcho , followed by the Boom Swinger who wields the microphone on a long pole across the set ( and has long arms and big biceps ) , and on bigger pictures there is an Assistant who helps .
Good Sound Recordists are a great asset to a picture through their good humour and temperament .
When you are observing a film set and see someone standing behind the leading Actress with a hand up her skirt , this is only because they are placing a radio mike .
This job is often given to the " Dresser " if she is a woman .
Some Sound Recordists are permanently in a Bad Mood because they 've had a lifetime of abuse , mostly from Cameramen who think they are Gods Gift to the Universe .
If you put headphones on your head for 40 years you might feel a bit strange too .
A sound recordist called Will Masisak left a pretty funny rant in my Guestbook ( Jan 2008 ) which you might enjoy reading .
For some reason , when people on set who do all kinds of jobs are asked which department they would most like to be in , most of them say the Camera Department .
The Camera is the " focus " of cinema , so Sound always plays second fiddle .
And , anyway , you can fix it afterwards ( but ... 2010 ... times they are a ' changin' ) .
On the other hand , here 's everything there is to know about recording sound .
Another interesting essay about " sound design " .

Special Effects
This is a very interesting department that is often maligned ( special defects etc ) , but does require a wide ranging knowledge of all kinds of things from guns to building bridges to rigging explosions , flipping cars and , ( ugh ) making smoke .
It often is populated with really talented interesting people who make everyone feel very safe and when they press the button , something goes bang in just the way they said it would .
Occasionally , something goes bang in just the way they said it would n't and you have one less camera on the shoot and hopefully no injuries .
You have to be the kind of person who got given a tractor when you were three and immediately pulled it apart to see how it works .
There are very few ( any ? ) women working in this area , probably because women have more sense and do n't feel like pulling everything to pieces .
Like props , quite a lot of families work in special effects , and a good job they do .
If you 're interested in this department , drop by the effects lock - up ( the place they work ) and show the guys your latest radio controlled amphibious tractor / submarine that you built out of elastic bands and sticky tape .
You might find they like you .
If you can't figure out how to get past the gate at the studio there 's easy ways to do this .
Borrow a beaten - up old van , and put clothes on that you last used to decorate your house .
Put a pile of old paint brushes on the passenger seat and wave as you go past the security guard .
Find out the name of any of the productions shooting at the studio , and if they ask , quote the name and say you 're " helping the scenic " .
Good luck figuring out what that means .
The above was written in 2001 .
Nowadays ( 2007 ) it might not work anymore .
Now you have to wear a suit and look like an Executive .
Go to security and tell them you are visiting " The Bond " or whatever else big production is on the lot .
Find out what studio is making the picure .
When the security guard rings the PA ( remember this is the job you want ! ) , have him say it is " Jeff " from " Disney " ( substitute studio name ) .
There are so many executives visiting these days : the chances are you 'll be through !
Once through , change your clothes as Effects Guys do n't wear suits .
Further Update : ( 2009 ) .
Unfortunately all of the above is no longer true as the gates of every studio are now patrolled by armed guards with sub-machine guns .
In the USA you need a " drive - on " which means that someone needs to have pe-approved you to go through the hallowed gates .
At the gate they ask for " picture - id " and once they 've entered your entire life into their computer system they print out a series of permits - for the car , your case , your coat etc etc .
Then you deliver this permit to another guy with a sub - machine gun and , on a good day , they might let you in .
So maybe do n't try the old van thing : they might shoot you .

Stand In
Somehow I forgot about these important people until now ( 2014 ) .
On a small movie you they wont be able to afford stand - ins ... but they save a lot of time and a lot of trouble with Actors if you ask them to hang around whilst the lighting goes on .
It is a road to acting ( sort of ... )... but very few actually go from being Stand - Ins to getting roles , but it does happen .
They are supplied by the Casting Director and good ones make my life a lot better .
If the girls are too pretty the grips stop work to gaze at them , so choose wisely ... also if they look more beautiful than the " star " that can be a problem in more ways than one !

Stills Photography
Curiously I left this section out on the first go : curious because that is how I started in the business way back when in Cape Town .
A gentleman called Lightning Bear sent me an e-mail reminding me of my omission - so a thank you to him for taking me back to my own past .
This job is the most lonely on a film set , because you a department of 1 , and you are not making the film , unlike the rest of the crew .
You are , however , a vital and important contributor to the film , as publicity relies heavily on your work in promoting the film .
The problems for the stills person are :
You get in the way - to varying degrees .
Most actors treat you like dirt for some strange reason .
No matter how friendly you are , you still get treated like an outsider .
No -one who you are working with sees your work , and those who do see it are n't on the set so they have no idea what you went through to get the photos they so casually throw in the bin ( See Publicity above ) .
The good news is that if you have enough sense of yourself to get through a lifetime of abuse , they might give you a really big exhibition and a huge coffee table book full of your photos , although you may already be too weak to lift it !
This is definitely the hardest job in the industry to pull off without falling into a full - time depression .
I really respect still photographers .
I 've started putting some of my Photographs in a gallery on the web .

Studio Executives
The problem from myperspective is that very few of them actually know how to make a film , so discussion is limited to a few casual remarks about say ... the weather ?
No seriously , I do n't know anything about Studio Executives .
Bear in mind that we do n't really have Studio Executives in the UK because duh ... we do n't have any studios !
A Director or an Independent Producer will have a very different perspective on Executives from anyone else , because they have to deal with them on a creative level which can be quite frustrating .
Some Directors ( usually already famous ) refuse to deal with them at all .
Here 's a friend who is an Executive so I 'll let her give a first hand account ...
Here 's what I do .
Keep in mind that there are two kinds of " production executive " in a studio .
One is " creative " and I use that terms loosely , and the other is " physical production " which is what I do .
The " creative " exec , purchases properties on behalf of the studio - scripts , books , plays , articles , pitches , etc. and develops them , with a writer or two , into a script .
They will also attach the creative elements - writers , directors , lead actors to the project , with an eye towards getting it into good enough shape to get greenlit .
They read a lot of stuff , do a lot of meetings and go to a lot of lunches .
They 're generally fairly articulate and somewhat charming , but usually know very little about film or production .
Which is why most scripts suck .
Nobody knows what makes a hit , so these folks follows opinion polls , screening cards , etc. and make wild guesses about what the audience wants , usually disregarding a writers original vision .
They sit around inventing stuff for the writer to change , years will pass between drafts , and projects will be developed into the ground .
Writing by committee basically .
Once a project is deemed interesting , it will be sent down to someone like me .
I 'll hire a line producer to do a schedule and budget and then we 'll work on it to try to get it to a number that 's acceptable to the studio ( which is usually several millions of dollars less than it takes to actually make the movie ) .
For example , I 'll be given a script for a drama about a family - no stunts , no VFX , just straight talking heads .
I will be given a budget number of $ 15 million to make the movie .
Fair enough .
Unfortunately , in order for the movie to be worth the studios investment , we have to hire Jack Costs - a - lot which is $ 10 million in salary and $ 1 million in perks .
That leaves me $ 4 million to make the movie .
Not possible .
Nevertheless , I have to figure out some way of squeezing a production into that number .
Usually , there 's a lot of tugging and pulling and more often than not , the picture just does n't get made .
If , by some miracle , the budget is met and we go into production , then I 'll talk to the producer on a daily basis to make sure they 're OK schedule and budget - wise .
If they 're OK , then that 's all I do , check the numbers , etc. , talk to the producer - it 's actually kind of easy .
If they 're not doing so well , then I have to show up on set and help solve the problems .
Sometimes this is fun ; most times it 's not .
Luckily for you , dear reader , and my reputation with Executives , Gregor Jordan ( The Director I shot Buffalo Soldiers with in 2000 ) sent the following to me ( used with his permission ) .
Dear Oliver ,
Just read your article about the film business and was very impressed .
It was a good read apart from anything else .
I agreed with almost everything and was enlightened several times .
At the end of the article you invited comment so here is mine .
I hope it 's welcome .
The only thing I disagreed with was the description of Executives .
The one thing I 've noticed about all film executives is that they are film fanatics , often film school or Arts ( Majoring in Film Studies ) graduates .
These are people who are passionate about the history and art of film .
They are generally not practitioners but are somehow in awe of the people who do the actual work .
Sometimes they are misguided but generally that 's out of over enthusiasm .
If it 's out of incompetence then generally they do n't last .
It 's interesting when you look at bullfighting ; an essential part of that particular art ( if you can call it that ) is the aficionado i.e. the person who is an expert theorist or outsider who rates the matadors performance .
This is an essential part of the whole process .
In film , a skilled overseer is neither a producer or director but a creative and financial overseer who , when they are good , provide absolutely valuable feedback particularly during the final stages of scripting , the casting and the then the last stages of cutting ...
Peter Weir said the hardest thing about being successful is finding people who will give their honest opinion about your work .
It is so easy to surround oneself with " yes " men ...
I think one of the most important processes in the life of a film is in associating with good smart executives whose judgement you trust .
The relationship between director and executives is key .

Stunt Department
As more and more Making Of docos got shown on TV , the publics fascination with this department has grown .
Interviews with wizened old cowboys who bounced off horses firing guns , got trampled underfoot and speared by whooping Indians , have fired the imagination of TV viewers .
We used to kill more stuntmen than we do now , but it 's still a very dangerous job - hence the fascination .
The requirements to be a successful stunt person in todays world are pretty hefty in terms of what you need to know about - and you have to be very fit and athletic , apart from the obvious skills of Karate , Driving , Diving off Cliffs and High Buildings etc etc .
Most middle aged stunt people have either retired or become Coordinators - the chief honcho of this department .
They usually have trouble with metal detectors at airports .
With so much emphasis on action movies , a young person interested in this department has a potentially bright future - but go and hang out in the bars where stunt men go after work - just to check this is the life for you .
Stunts are a lot safer than they used to be , thanks to legislation , but there are still more accidents than there should be .
Curiously , in an industry obsessed with awards , there are very few ( any ? ) for Stunts .

Visual Effects
You can get an Oscar for this , and it is a fascinating and growing area of Film Making , so you would still be working if no films go on location in 50 years because it 's all done on the computer .
I 'm trying to get a pal to write for this section but they 're all too busy working .
The skills you need are high order graphic computer skills and a lot of patience : as well as the ability to draw painstaking frame - by - frame mattes around some actors wispy hair when they suddenly decide the monster should appear behind him instead of beside him .
The latest Star Wars ( 2002 ) shows what happens when you shoot digitally and then scale everyone into a group shot .
Each person 's face " artifacts " in a different way .
Very disturbing to me , but still makes a whole ton of money !
When I shot Casanova ( 2005 ) for Lasse Hallstrom there were 160 VFX shots in it , so times are changing .
I also did my first 4k DI ( Digital Intermediate ) on this film which I thoroughly enjoyed .
The Waterhorse ( 2007 ) became my real intro to VFX .
Lucky enough I worked with the Weta Digital team in New Zealand - the people who brought us Lord of the Rings and King Kong .
This was a real break for me : to learn from and collaborate with the likes of Joe Letteri was a real treat .
Creating " Crusoe " ( the Loch Ness Monster ) was a truly collaborative process with a terrific end result .
Again , it all comes down to PRE - VISUALISATION .
All the decisions we made at the beginning led to all the good stuff that 's in the film .
There are some pictures if you click the link at the top of the document .
I have just finished " timing " The Proposal ( 2009 ) .
This was shot in Boston but takes place in Alaska (! ) .
This is now " normal " for film - making .
You go and shoot where the tax breaks are strongest and if the landscape bears no resemblance to where the film is set , you just change the backgrounds in post - production .
This would have seemed insane just a few years ago , but now is common .
The " Alaska " we created bears some resemblance to the " Real Alaska " but the film is a Hollywood Romantic Comedy : it 's not a documentary .
The Visual Effects Company naturally had a lot of work to do replacing backgrounds .
These are now mostly shot on Digital Stills or a Red Camera if movement is required .
It was a huge amount of work and most of it quite successful .
However , whilst I love the scope and possibilities of Visual Effects work , there is still no substitute for planning it out properly in pre-production , and working out the best technical solutions for the particular film .
I went to Alaska for a week to shoot some second Unit : as it turns out I think it was a good decision not to go there with the main unit .
The weather was terrible and actually the Alaska we created is a much more magical place than the Alaska I visited !
Another experience that adds to my belief that there is nothing sacred in the world of film - making or photography : except to Get it Right !
The world of Visual Effects is the fastest growing , most important area of Big Budget film - making today .
It is essential to understand what is possible and what is not ...
DP's and Designers have to take on the fact that the Visual Effects Superviser may have the last word on what is on the screen if you do n't pay attention !
Mark Vargo has made an interesting video which gives a good idea of how you make that special shot for a bigger budget movie .
Here is an amazingly detailed and terrific account of the VFX work for Mad Max : Fury Road ( 2015 ) .
Of particular interest is the way the " before and after " photographs are laid out as well as some very topical comments from Andrew Jackson , the VFX supervisor .
This website is a fantastic free resource with real in - depth information about how things are done in the VFX world .
Here is an amusing account of working in the VFX industry .
The Director Robert Rodriguez is kind enough to share a huge amount of information on You Tube about how he executes his actions sequences quickly , safely and economically : Robert Rodriguez

Video Tap / Split Operator
There is a curious job available on Features which is recording the Video output of the film camera .
In days gone by , the Director had to Trust the Operator .
At the end of the shot the Director would turn to the Operator and say " How was it ? " and the Operator would say : " OK " , or " We need Another " or " I screwed up " , or whatever .
The point is the Operator was the only person who actually saw the shot through the camera , so he ( it was always he ) had a lot of power and input as to whether a shot was any good .
The old style " A " camera operators were not just commenting on framing and operation of the camera : there often was a tacit understanding between them and an actor .
If the Actor gave him the nod , the Operator would ask for another take saying there was a technical problem ( hair - in - the - gate etc ) .
And if the Director wanted another take but did n't want the Actor to know he or she gave a bad performance , the Operator would say " We need another for Focus " or some such thing .
This interesting 3 way event disappeared with the " Video Tap " coming into common use around 1984 .
In many ways this was a shame .
Directors now remain glued to the monitor and few of them look directly at the actors .
This strikes me as very strange as the Monitors are pretty low quality ( not any more ! 2014 ) and it's hard to see the subtleties of a performance .
Unfortunately some " modern " Directors are more interested in the framing of the shot than the performance , so they watch " the shot " on a tiny monitor to make sure it 's OK .
So the Operator 's opinion is often no longer required ... so " Check the Gate " is called from the " Monitor Tent " before the Operator is even asked what he thought .
Anyhow , the job of the " Video Split Operator " ( current 2009 terminology ) - for better or for worse - is operating that equipment .
It 's quite boring to some people because of it's mechanical nature : but if you 're interested in the process of making a film , it 's a golden opportunity to be at the heart of the action and you get to stand right next to Mr Big for months on end .
If Mr Big is an interesting individual it's a great job , but then ...
oh yeah , I forgot , it 's really badly paid because usually the Producers niece is doing it . ( 2005 )
... and , then again , ( 2009 ) it's now a pretty big deal with large equipment rental , a lot of computer power , sometimes editing equipment , and several tents for all the different groups of people who do n't want to have anything to do with each other .
This has now changed quite a bit ( 2014 ) : at least at the " high end " of film production and commercials .
It 's become a real job , together with sophisticated and fancy digital recording equipment that enables Directors who have no confidence in what they have shot to cut it together on set and make sure it cuts OK .
Great ... another way of slowing down the shoot !
Actually , when a good person does this job , it makes " life at the monitor " a lot more tolerable as he ( not many " She 's " in this department ! ) is able to whizz around everything you have shot at lightning speed and print out little pics of the frames which can be very handy for reference later in the shoot .
The " animatics " or pre-viz storyboards can also be played through this equipment and half - keyed on the monitor when lining up shots is important .
April 2015 .
With the more or less total takeover of Digital this job has become even more high - end and expensive than it was before .
There 's monitors everywhere and on many shoots there is the " Producers Tent " , then the " Directors Tent " ( usually with the Script Supervisor and DP ) .
Whilst this was already happening towards the end of the film days ( around 2012 ) , today 's sets have the additional " DIT " tent which is where DP 's go when they can't take it at the monitors any more !

Digital Imaging Technician ( DIT )
This post is now more or less manitory ( 2014 ) as most shooting is now done digitally .
For the DP choosing the right DIT is very important ...( sometimes literally called " Dit " but they like to be called " DeeEYEtees " as they find " Dit " insulting for some reason ... it means Digital Imaging Technician if you want to be pedantic . )
Because you are going to spend a lot of time in the black tent with this person you have to be comfortable being up - close - and - personal in a small , smelly hot black tent : so not only do you want to interview your DIT for technical brilliance but .. how are you going to get on when times are tough ?
The DIT has probably become the most important member of the camera team - in the sense that they can make - or - break your images for you and you are trusting them not only to tell you what is going on with exposure , focus etc but also with timing the output every night so that the editor and post - production people recieve images you are proud of .
In terms of day - to - day your 85 hour week will be made a lot less stressful if your DIT is not only technically brilliant and helpful but also has a good sense of humour when the system crashes ' cause lightning struck the tent or somesuchthing .
A number of ex-video split operators made their way into being DIT 's but be warned - the job is highly technical and demands a certain level of " geekiness " - especially when it comes to keeping up with the massive changes in cameras and workflow that happen every month .
If being au - fait with the technical side of the whole Digital Process is what you love , this could be a job for you ... and the easy way to learn it is to get a job as an intern or PA with the DIT or his or her company .
Chances are you spend a lot of time on the internet scouring esoteric post - production forums where the phrase " bit- rate " happens a lot and people debate the merits of 2K,4 K etc etc .
We old - time DP 's used to have our primary creative relationship with the timer at the LAB - now it is initially with the DIT and then with the Colourist at the DI suite .

Camera Department
If you 've noticed that this heading is out of alphabetical order , then that might tell you something about the kind of mind you have .
I 've put it last because it 's the only department I really know anything about .
This is called a department although in reality it is quite small .
It consists of a Trainee , Loader , Focus Puller , Operator , and Lighting Cameraman .
In the USA the same jobs are called Loader , 2nd Assistant , 1st Assistant , Operator and Director of Photography ( or DOP or DP ) .
The Intern or Trainee is just that - a learner .
In some countries this person drives the camera truck , but only in sensible places like Australia .
In the USA and the UK the truck driver drives the truck and then ... well ... hang out - usually in an unused Star Trailer playing poker or reading a bad newspaper .
Recently some UK truck drivers have started helping out on set and learning to Load the Camera - so that they are n't truck drivers till death .
I like this .
The LOADER loads the camera , oddly enough , with Film made by either Kodak or Fuji .
Agfa used to make film but gave up , which was a shame .
Now they only make film for Prints .
Loading may not sound like much of a job , but in actuality it is very important .
If the wrong film is in the camera , or if it gets loaded twice , or lost , or put in the wrong can , then the scene which corresponded to : Scene 56 - The Army advanced over the hill , the jets dropped their bombs , and the volcano erupted ... could be lost .
When this happens the Loader can become deeply unpopular very quickly .
Kubrick fired one loader I know on his first day of work for walking across the set holding a magazine upside down .
Not Kubricks first day of work - the Loaders .
This was a trifle harsh , but there is a right way to do the job , and the rules are there for a very good reason .
If you screw up the minimum cost is about $ 20,000 and the max any figure you might care to imagine .
So this job is important , as well as being the bottom rung of the ladder to becoming a DP .
There 's at least one loader in the UK who is over 50 years old so it shows you do n't have to move on .
The 1st AC ( or Focus Puller ) has one of the hardest jobs on the set .
And it 's one of those jobs that are never noticed until it is wrong .
Then you get an almighty bollocking , or you get fired .
If it 's my focus puller I usually laugh , because my Focus Pullers are absolutely Brilliant so they rarely make mistakes .
I only ever fired one guy , but he was n't a focus puller .
Focus
Pulling not only involves what it sounds like , but also the Focus Puller " runs " the department , in the sense of taking care of all the camera gear , and making sure that everything is tickety - boo .
I have my own camera , so it 's treated very well !
A focus puller relies heavily on the Operator to tell him if the shot is out of focus - after all only the operator is actually looking through the lens .
The Operator is a very different animal in the USA to the UK Operator .
And then again , many films in many countries are lit and operated by the DP , so it is n't a separate job .
In all unionised places , it 's looked at as " 2 jobs " for obvious reasons - more employment .
There 's a lot to say about Camera Operating , and this is n't the place to do it .
Operators often stick at the job and never move up to DP , as they like the job so much .
Ca n't blame them , as I like it too , and often operate my own films .
I look at being a DP as a two - part process , one Mental and one Physical .
The lighting requires you to stand or sit and point your finger at lights and talk to your Gaffer and Key Grip .
Not much physical activity here .
Operating means that your body is bent into all kinds of shapes , and made to endure the most uncomfortable positions for as many takes as it takes .
This can be quite physical .
Hand held work is very physical as the camera is quite heavy and you have to have good balance and strength to move a camera well .
I trained in Pa-Kua ( which is like Tai Chi ) to help with Hand Held work , as well as cause I fancied it .
I still do it now , 25 years later .
Steadicam is a device that means the Operator can move about with the camera , but it is steady .
The best Steadicam Operators achieve a level of steadiness , and exactness of composition that is virtually equivalent to a Dolly Shot .
The worst ones make you feel as though you are on a cross channel ferry in a winter storm .
I never learnt to use this device , as I never fancied it .
Anyway , it 's only for Tough Guys / Girls .
In the UK the tradition has been that the Operator sets up the Shots with the Director and the DP lights them .
This means that the DP is essentially a Lighting Cameraman i.e. a Cameraman who does the Lighting - and does n't do the set - ups .
This is changing as the new generation of DP 's find this less acceptable as many of them come from Film School or Documentaries , where they have Operated their own camera .
These people - and I include myself among them - find it hard not to be involved with the set -ups and so prefer either to operate themselves , or use an Operator who is comfortable with the notion that the DP is the Boss and will be happy to " execute the shot " that the DP and Director decide on .
This is the accepted method of work in the USA , which is why I find it much easier to work with US Operators than UK Operators .
But I still find the easiest Operator to work with is myself : keeps the talking to a minimum .
In the best situations , the DP , Operator and Director work in harmony - each contributing to the others ideas , and deciding to go with the best idea without " scoring points " for " your " idea being adopted .
Sometimes there is a lot of competition between any two of the three people , and then it is very tiring .
I get much less tired when I Operate and Light - which shows that the most tiring thing on a film set is Stress .
There is an article on Operators at the end of this piece : Some thoughts about Operators . ( 1989 ) .
I mostly still agree with what I thought back then .
I have , in fact , now stopped operating myself ( in 2004 ) , as I now find it a bit much .
Luckily I have worked with great guys ( and girls ) in the last couple of years , so my opinion of Operators in general is on the UP : especially with the now - normal " A " Camera / Steadicam combo which makes for a very versatile way of shooting .
People like Mike Proudfoot ( UK ) , Daniele Massaccesi ( Italy ) , Larry & Jim McConkey ( USA ) , Pete Cavaciutti ( UK ) , Peter Mccaffrey ( NZ ) etc make such an enormous contribution to a film that it is a shame to find their names in a rolling title when they should be listed along with the DP .
The Director of Photography is the Chief Honcho of the Camera Department .
In the past , the only way to get to this position was by going up the ladder .
This meant that most DP 's were over 40 in the UK and Hollywood , because it took that long to go up the ladder ...
A lot of gravity I guess .
But then Film Schools started in the 70's , and suddenly there were people in their twenties and thirties appearing and saying : I am a DP .
In the UK they were called Clapper Lighters : a jokey kind of insult .
The Camera Department in the form of the Union and the BSC took a very dim view indeed of Film School Graduates .
I do n't know if this was the case in the USA , but I would n't be surprised .
It 's very different now as there are so many well - known DP 's who went to film school .
The DP on a film sets the " tone " of the shoot .
If he takes a long time to light , and is grumpy and surly then the crew suffer because of it .
Some DP 's have really bad reputations with film crews because they are egocentric , surly , arrogant and over - paid .
These same people are occasionally a Brilliant One .
But more often than not , they just give the profession a bad name .
Because the DP is the only person on the set who has an idea of what the picture will look like , they have a kind of shaman - like power .
This is because the picture " disappears " into the camera , only to magically re-appear at Dailies ( Rushes ) the next day or next week if you 're working in Guatemala .
The DP will continue to exert this power until film is a completely digital process .
At this point the DP 's power will disappear , as the image will be completely subject to post - production manipulation by Editors and Producers and film stars .
His or Her power over the image will be gone , and the job with it .
This is why I feel lucky to have just got in my career before the door closes forever .
So long as there is Film in the camera , the DP has a job .
Once the film is a chip , the DP becomes a Videoperson , because his / her power over the image is lost .**
** Actually ( 2010 ) this is not really true and I am changing my mind ( slowly ! ) about the whole Digital Thing .
I still think it is much much harder for the DP to retain control when shooting on Digital , but it is possible .
In a sense the " dilution " of our control over the image is now as much about post - production as it is about the format that you shoot on .
Perhaps the same kind of strong personality that makes for a good DP is just the same as it always was : the difference is that now you need to allow 2 weeks to supervise the Digital Intermediate ( DI for short ) , and make sure that you do ...!
This is the hard part as you might not be available and also a Producer or Director might want to do it themselves ... or even the Editor .
Like all things in the modern world , it 's sort of the same but ... more complicated !
It is worth describing exactly what a DP does , as few people outside of the Industry seem to understand this .
The word Director of Photography is really a title conferred only on Cinematographers who photograph Feature Films , as distinct from Television Films and Documentaries .
There are arguments about this , but essentially the role is different , not so much between TV and Features , but very much between fiction and any other kind of film making .
This is because Fiction Filmmaking is Drama , Storytelling ...
A Movie .
A DP 's first requirement is to understand Drama .
Understand that his or her job is to tell the story in Pictures .
This is n't as simple as it sounds .
Every day at 7.30 AM
I go into the Studio or on to a location and bleary eyed Actors and the Director turn up on set with their scripts , and try to make sense of Scene 128 on Page 54 .
Yesterday was some other scene from some other page that was before or after the scene we are currently doing .
It 's like a jigsaw puzzle , except that the pieces have n't been cut , but you know which bit of the picture has to go on it .
The shape of the piece is what you decide , and as you continue to make the film , the shape of other pieces gets to be more restricted , because some of the pieces that you are joining it to have already been cut .
Fortunately , the Editor can take a hacksaw to the whole thing and recut stuff if you got it wrong .
But the truth is that if the Script is wrong , or if the Actors do n't get it , or if you shoot it badly , then no amount of tinkering is ever going to fix it .
If the script is right in the first place , and you have the right Director and Actors , then the film seems to shoot itself - like playing the jazz piano and becoming unaware of what you are playing .
There seems to be no " right way " of making a film .
Nor does the on - set atmosphere necessarily reflect anything about what the film will be like to watch .
Bad atmosphere on the set can lead to wonderful movies and vice - versa and everything in between .
Celluloid just has a life of its own that only starts when the projector rolls .
When the actors and the Camera are doing the right thing , there 's a thread between them and the camera that sucks the audience into the experience .
Altman talks about Real Cinema , meaning that Celluloid delivers a Real Cinematic Experience which is Not Artificial - unlike Remote Cameras , Digital Effects etc .
He wo n't use mechanically operated cameras as he maintains that it distances the audience .
I 've noticed an increase in Critics reviews talking about " digital effects " in a generally negative way .
The reason why I find it hard to let go the " set - up " i.e. the choice of lens and camera angle , is that I see Lighting as intimately connected with Framing .
Composition is often set before the shot is lit : but the way it is lit can have a profound effect on the composition - meaning that after lighting a shot it may be necessary to alter it in a subtle way to accommodate the change of balance because of the light .
Sometimes I 'll alter a shot to accommodate a lighting unit that I know is crucial because of the angle of the light in relation to the actor .
When I 'm operating myself , this process requires no discussion , but is internal : I just say , Let 's change this Mark ( where the camera is positioned at a particular point on the Dance Floor ) and that 's the end of it .
With an Operator it 's a discussion : hopefully short !
And if I give myself a hard time with a lamp that is very close to the edge of frame that 's my problem .
Operators often request that you move a light out just that bit further - " for safety " .
This can make the difference between the light doing its job well and doing it OK .
At this particular moment ( June 99 ) I 'm having a rather interesting experience on Birthday Girl , shooting the Russian Dialogue sequences .
It has really underlined how the process of deciding how to light and shoot a scene is completely dependent on understanding the nature of the scene .
When Nicole Kidman rehearses a scene in Russian I find myself completely at a loss as to how to shoot it , because I do n't know what she 's talking about !
So I ask the actors to play it once in English then it all falls into place - but Jez Butterworth ( the Director ) does n't like it because the actors fall out of character when they play it in English !
The cinematographer is the person on set who has to translate the Actors performance into pictures , and understand what is the right shot with all its elements of movement , size and lighting .
There 's always a shot that 's the right shot for that moment in the film : the trick is finding it .
I seem to find it by allowing the rehearsed scene to flow as a series of pictures in my head : and if that does n't happen I 'll work with the Director until it does .
There 's nothing very mysterious about lighting .
An old time Hollywood Cameraman was asked how he lit the set and he said :
You put a light up and turn it on .
If you like it , you leave it .
If you do n't , you move it .
I like this approach because it undercuts a lot of rubbish that gets talked about lighting .
It 's possible to read all kinds of intellectual symbolism into approaches to lighting , but I can't do that because I 'm not an intellectual .
( Someone once described an intellectual as : " Someone educated beyond his own intelligence " ) .
The only approach that makes sense to me is to become completely absorbed in the Story in Pre-Production , talk to the Director about Films or Paintings or Novels or Music or the Script , talk to the Production and Costume Designer , forget about any work you may have don

By R. D. Bradshaw
Some people over the years have had some familiarity with the work of the famous Russian physiologist and experimental psychologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov ( 1849-1936 ) , who won a Nobel Prize for his work on conditional reflexes and behaviorism .
Pavlov did much experimental work on dogs .
For example , he conducted experiments by feeding a dog ( rewarded ) when a bell sounded .
The dog became attuned to these stimuli and would jump up and down and with flowing saliva when the bell rang .
The same dog was trained by Pavlov to express fear and terror by having him in a room with a light on .
When the light went off , a man would enter the room and beat the dog ferociously .
The dog became so attuned to these stimuli that when the lights went off the dog would immediately run to the corner of the room and whine in a great state of fear and panic .
In a unique reaction , the exact same dog would enter a state of confusion and crisis when the bell rang and the light went off at the same time .
The dog would freeze up and quiver and shake , not knowing what to do -- whether to salivate , expecting food , or to cower in the corner of the room , expecting to be beat .
The early Soviet ruler Vladimir Lenin became fascinated with the work of Pavlov .
Reportedly , Lenin undertook the task of using these methods of behavior alteration upon people .
Evidently , through the years , Lenin and his successors refined and fine tooled the work of Pavlov to a scientific level .
General Ben Partin
This backdrop brings up the work in the 1990s of Retired Air Force Brigadier General Ben Partin who cited Pavlo and his dog experiments in explaining what was happening to the American people in the 1990s as a result of some alleged terrorists incidents �like the bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb 26 , 1993 , and the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 .
In writings , and in oral presentations , General Partin had some interesting comments about these so - called terrorists � attacks in the 1990s .
His words carry some weight and consideration because he does have some credentials to back up his reputation of being an explosives expert .
For example , he was extensively involved in Air Force research and development on weapons and weapon systems and their application and effect on various targets .
Specifically , he was the project manager on the US Air Force�s Maverick Missile System with its optical laser and imaging infrared guidance , as well as a number of other highly sophisticated bomb and attack systems .
Without going into the specifics , Partin believed that both the Oklahoma City bombing and the World Trade Center bombing involved incidents wherein the US government deliberately lied to the American people about what had happened .
Suffice to say , the official spin reports did not impress Partin who opted for other explanations to understand truth .
I mention this backdrop on both Pavlov and Partin because the General skillfully tied the public reactions from the American people to the work of Pavlov .
In the case of the Oklahoma City bombing , Ben Partin became immensely impressed with the fact that the approved story from Washington and the controlled media simply did not add up to the facts he could ascertain on the ground in Oklahoma City .
Accordingly , the general made a detailed analysis of the bombing and fired it off to all members of Congress , part of the media and other interested people .
His intense effort to try to get an impartial and independent investigation into the OC bombing ultimately failed .
But he did do much work on the issue and created a certain amount of interest .
Eventually , one of the television networks in Los Angeles decided to do a program on the OC bombing .
Apparently , the network focused its one hour special into an effort merely to sell the approved government position .
But in order to generate a little interest and appear impartial , the network decided to allow an opponent of the approved explanation to actually appear on its program .
Partin was selected to make an appearance .
The general went to LA and was filmed when offering some comments , in opposition to the approved pitch and spin .
Actually , the general made several points .
But when the film editors went to work on his words , they were edited down to just a few remarks ( this is the normal way the television people operate -- they interview a person for an hour and then edit his remarks down to a couple of minutes ) .
When the program was shown , the program host took the unusual step of even denigrating Partin after Partin�s few comments .
The host said that Partin was a military man and was not a qualified engineer .
Therefore , he could not know and understand the construction aspects of the building which made it collapse as it did .
As Partin pointed out , this was a total lie .
He was both an engineer and a military man .
He had two engineering degrees and much of his military work was in the field of research and development .
Thus , the TV program host merely added a few remarks which effectively killed the comments made by Partin .
The way this thing worked out is the way that the news is fed to the American public .
There is a lot of truth out there ( mixed with some lies and deception ) which anyone with a capacity to think can receive , evaluate and understand to some extent .
Yet , there are often alternative sources of contrary news which likewise can be very revealing .
So while Joe Six Pack and Sally Soap Opera may have some true facts and information , they are rendered ineffective in trying to use that information by some lies , deception and spin from Washington and the controlled media .
Thence , Joe and Sally sort of become like Pavlov�s dog when it was subjected to both the ringing of the bell and the turning off of the light at the same time .
Just as the dog freezes up in confusion , the average American freezes up upon the receipt of some true information along with some lies and deception ?
Most people end up in a daze of sorts , not knowing what truth is and what is not and what to do about the confusing situation .
Once people are thrust into this state of confusion , they end up by doing nothing .
They rationalize that they don�t know what the truth is and back off and do nothing one way or the other .
Thus , the typical John Doe is immensely unable to handle the conflicting information that is coming to him from different directions .
He cannot distinguish or differentiate the difference between the truth and lies .
Much of the problem ultimately surfaces because man usually lacks the time or he will not take the time to thoroughly investigate the matter to determine what the truth is .
In other words , his apathy and indifference won�t allow a sufficient investigation to determine what the truth is .
In the case of Partin�s appearance on the TV program , he was allowed to briefly offer some comments in a couple of minutes .
Of course , the program had forty - five minutes of the officially approved spin position .
Then to top it all off , the program host intervened to completely repudiate any validity to Partin�s words .
A person watching this presentation would end up in a state of confusion ( yet , with a little work and effort , coupled with some IQ , a person could come to an ultimate understanding of the truth ) .
Although the general did not dwell on the work of Lenin in using the Pavlov approach , that clearly was implied .
Thus , it seems that Lenin understood that if a man was cast into a role of confusion and being frozen up in uncertainty , he would end up doing nothing .
Apparently , this methodology became a key part of the leftist�s efforts to spread their thinking around the globe over the last 100 years .
The leftists and liberals with the controlled media work in just enough lies and deception into their spin of the news to leave the average John Doe in a state of confusion and uncertainty ( and especially when a person is subsequently exposed to some alternative news sources with more plausible and logical explanations of the truth in a matter ) .
In this frozen , zombiized state , the average person will end up doing nothing .
He will become apathetic and indifferent and unable or unwilling to distinguish between the truth and lies .
He ends up in a state of confusion like Pavlo�s dog when the bell rang and lights went out at the same time .
In mentioning these so - called terrorist attacks in the 1990s , numerous people besides Partin had similar or related experiences in trying to get a fair and unbiased investigation into the alleged terrorist attacks .
In the case of the OC bombing , I must mention here the work of Oklahoma House of Representative member Charles Key .
Mr. Key was never satisfied with the official government spin that a loner named Timothy McVeigh used some fertilizer to literally rip the OC federal building apart .
Key compiled evidence that the official spin was nothing but a pack of lies .
So what did the spin meisters then do ?
Well , they trotted out Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating , a former FBI agent , to completely repudiate the words of Key , Partin and others who questioned the official report of what had happened .
With one set of evidence from Key , Partin and others , versus another set of so - called evidence from Oklahoma Governor Keating , the public was left in a quandary on what was the truth .
And just like Pavlov�s dog , most Americans simply threw up their hands in confusion and concluded that they didn�t know and / or couldn�t know what the truth was .
Yet , as noted above , if the typical American would have been willing to spend some time in researching the facts and putting them together with a little IQ , at least above the idiot level , he could know what the truth was about the so - called terrorist attacks in the 1990s ( as well as the 9/11 thing in Sep 2001 ) .
The Present Situation Strangely enough , this state of confusion and uncertainty emanating from the 1990s and 2001 continues today in almost any setting addressing the question of financial market manipulation and control as cited in this series on the Goldsmiths and in other writings and publications by other authors .
What happens is that a number of writers , including me , have brought forth convincing evidence that the financial markets are grossly manipulated and controlled .
While I attribute this skullduggery to the fat cat plutocrats , and while other writers may define the source of the problem differently , the truth remains that there is substantial evidence of gross market manipulation .
Once some conclusive evidence is forthcoming from some source , it seems like that inevitably the manipulators trot out one of their colleagues to write an article disproving the market manipulations and instead attributing the events cited as being accidental and chance occurrences in a free market .
They like to use the words leverage and correction to justify and support their position .
Once the typical market follower is exposed to these contrary views , it leaves the follower in a state of confusion and quandary on what is the truth .
Such a confused person can only stand and shake his head in uncertainty , as was the case with Pavlov�s dog .
In short , most people in the public domain don�t know and / or can�t or won�t take the time to understand what the truth is on the financial markets .
Yes , there is a solution , as suggested above .
The person really interested in truth can put forth some effort and work into study and analysis , plus a little common sense , and eventually put two and two together , and come to some correct conclusions .
But the problem that we face is that the typical person is simply not going to exhibit that amount of energy and effort to know the truth .
Inevitably , they will end up confused and uncertain as in the case of Pavlov�s dog .
Plato
This discussion on people who can�t or won�t spend the time to learn truth and who persist in ignorance and confusion brings up the famous homosexual / bisexual pervert Plato and some of his platonic philosophy ( which , with Socrates , completely dominates the Western world today and especially as it was modified and put over in the prevailing Sabbatian motion , as discussed in the Goldsmiths , Part V ) .
Plato observed that the people in a society could be classified into one of three categories .
First , there are the doers .
These are the very few people who are initiators of action to get things done .
Next , there are the watchers ( who are greater in numbers than the doers , but yet are small in numbers ) , who sit on the sidelines to critique , criticize or applaud the actions of the doers .
Finally , there is everybody else ( which is the bulk of the population ) .
As Milan Martin says in his presentations on Lucifer�s Children , this everybody else includes people who don�t do anything and don�t care about anything , one way or the other .
It is this third category of people which dominates our Western Christian civilization .
In short , they don�t care whether school keeps or not .
They are locked in apathy and don�t care .
For men , their focus is often on a weekly sports game ; and for women it is frequently some daily soap opera or Oprah .
So when a good doer work like GATA arrives on the scene ( to point out the manipulation of the gold market ) , it meets a world of apathy , indifference and don�t care -- beyond the few watchers who watch what GATA does .

Every now and then , appropriate reactions are noticed , and we must thank Ms. Coleman and her colleagues for acting this way to remedy what we believe was an error in judgment .
Thank you !
And thank you , Greg Rochon …!
" When such events occur , we are reminded that first , we are all Americans .
And that our shared American ideals will always transcend political partisanship , " Laura Bush is saying in her totally awesome address to the Republican Convention and to the nation , while her husband , Leader of the Free World , consults with the frontline Gulf coast folks who are fighting tooth and nail with our own Mother Nature .
Then the Convention moves on to messages from the Governors in the states threatened by the fury of Hurricane Gustav .
ALL Republican .
Compare this with the glitz and glamour and empty rhetoric of the Democratic Convention last week .
A good time to be a Republican .
" Sarah is electrifying our party , " Mitt is telling a Fox News anchor , asserting he 's not interested in a cabinet post .
His father had been there and done that , says he , and the bureaucratic pushback was stultifying .
Then there 's the matter of Sarah Barracuda 's eldest child 's delicate condition .
Words of wisdom from an imail conversation this evening :
She : I 'm still breathless over Bristol 's pregnancy .
I think this is going to swing OUR way , BIG TIME … real people with real problems , out in the open , dealing with them .
We : Yes .
Especially because of the horrific thing Obama said about a baby 's being a punishment were one of his daughters to conceive " out of wedlock . "
In fact , this just in from my favorite satirist .
She : AWESOME !!
The contrast is stark .
I like this comment from a Lucianne reader : " If McCain can get the votes of all the women who were pregnant at their weddings , it 'll be a landslide ! "
" As John has been saying for the last few days , this is a time when we take off our Republican hats and put on our American hats .
To help , we ask you to go to causegreater.com and contribute , " says Cindy McCain , sharing the podium with the current First Lady early evening at the Republican Convention .
They 're reminding us of the women of an earlier generation .
Their men are off at the front , fighting the good fight even as their helpmeets keep the homefires burning .
You go , girls !
Strong women beside strong men .
The land of the free and the home of the brave still stand .
Update : Instalanche !
We can never get enough .
Update II : NROs Byron

And McCain’s . "
Head of McCain evangelical outreach Marlys Popma explains :
“ There has n’t been one evangelical family that has n’t gone through some sort of situation .
Many of us are in this movement because of something that has happened in our lives . ”

Update IV : How cool is THIS ?
Milblogger Timmer of The Daily Brief tosses us a lovely link , and savors Sarah Barracuda 's energizing effect on some of his favorite " smart , funny , successful in what they ’ve chosen to do , women " of the blogosphere :
I think the lefties are going to be VERY sorry that they pissed off the working Moms of this country .
They not only went after her family , they questioned whether or not she could be a good mom and do the Vice President thing at the same time .
Big mistake .
Huge honking blunder .
And they still do n't know what hit them .
Update V : Venomous Kate links : " Finally , a candidate who gets what my life ’s about . "
A plant enthusiast has shaken the horticultural world after successfully growing dozens of bananas in a British domestic property for what is believed to be the first time .
Mike Hillard , 64 , bought three musa japonica plants two years ago to provide shade at his energy - efficient home , Tranquility , in Stroud , Gloucestershire .
But despite being told they would not bear fruit , the property development managing director can now gaze up at 16ft ( five metres ) of growth bearing more than 70 bananas .
Mr Hillard , who has grown plants since he was 11 , was surprised when the plants flowered and and stunned when they then produced four " hands " of fruit , each holding about 18 bananas .
He called the Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) who said the news was so rare he " should get down on the prayer mat " .
The RHS has told him is the only person in Britain known to grow bananas in the home .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The bananas bloomed in his hi-tech solar room , which stays between 10C and 16C above outside temperature all year , and is just warm enough for the east Asian crop to grow healthily .
Now Mr Hillard intends to fry them up in a tasty curry .
He said : " This has all been done by the English sunshine in my solar room , which provides my house with an oxygen - rich atmosphere .
It has been called the most energy - efficient house in the world .
I was surprised when they flowered because I was told , ' Oh they 'll never grow fruit ' .
Now they are growing into a forest , and I 've got seven babies .
I asked the Royal Horticultural Society and they told me to get down on my prayer mat because they had been trying for years to get theirs to bear fruit .
Mine have grown to four or five inches and they are edible .
" Perhaps there is a Lord somewhere who has done it too but I do n't know where he is .
It looks like a giant beehive and the trunk is full of water .
You would call it a palm .
The leaves grow about 5.5 m up , nearly touching the roof . "
He said that he would be cooking the bananas in a slap - up meal despite the RHS 's warnings that the fruit will taste odd .
He said : " I love bananas and will probably cook them like a plantain ; they will be very nice fried with rice . "
Mr Hillard says he is " taking on " the scientific community 's findings about global warming , saying the problem is much more advanced than accepted wisdom suggests .
Leigh Hunt , the Royal Horticultural Society 's principal horticultural adviser , confirmed that Mr Hillard was probably the first British grower to achieve the feat in a house .
He said : " This is likely because he was growing musa basjoo [ the Japanese banana ] , a species that was n't grown very often in the UK until the fashion for tropical gardens came in .
" So while it has been perfectly possible to flower musa basjoo in tropical glasshouses , such as at Kew , but it has been unlikely for amateurs to grow it because they were n't sold very often and gardeners had little interest in growing them because they required mollycoddling during the winter [ they are not fully hardy ] .
" Unfortunately , the fruits that musa basjoo produce are unpalatable , mainly because they contain seed .
Ripening may not happen as the low light levels of a British winter are not conducive for good growth .
Commercial bananas do n't contain seeds because they are generally the seedless variety , dwarf Cavendish . "
Mr Hillard , a pioneering environmental architect , designed Tranquility as a four - bedroom " eco-house " made of Cotswold stone , which has total annual energy costs of less than £ 150 a year .
The former naval officer wrote his first environmental paper aged just 18 and has written several books addressing environmental issues , including climate change , food and poverty .
Heating the house last year cost just £ 60 and he uses rainwater for showering and washing up .
Last month , Graham and Daphne Bath , from Hampshire , revealed that a banana tree they had been growing in their garden for the past nine years had borne fruit for the first time .
This image of the northern polar region of Saturn shows both the aurora and underlying atmosphere , seen at two different wavelengths of infrared light as captured by NASA 's Cassini spacecraft .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Saturn has its own unique brand of aurora that lights up the polar cap , unlike any other planetary aurora known in our solar system .
This odd aurora revealed itself to one of the infrared instruments on NASA 's Cassini spacecraft .
" We 've never seen an aurora like this elsewhere , " said Tom Stallard , a scientist working with Cassini data at the University of Leicester , England .
Stallard is lead author of a paper that appears in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Nature .
" It 's not just a ring of auroras like those we 've seen at Jupiter or Earth .
This aurora covers an enormous area across the pole .
Our current ideas on what forms Saturn 's aurora predict that this region should be empty , so finding such a bright aurora here is a fantastic surprise . "
Auroras are caused by charged particles streaming along the magnetic field lines of a planet into its atmosphere .
Particles from the sun cause Earth 's auroras .
Many , but not all , of the auroras at Jupiter and Saturn are caused by particles trapped within the magnetic environments of those planets .
Jupiter 's main auroral ring , caused by interactions internal to Jupiter 's magnetic environment , is constant in size .
Saturn 's main aurora , which is caused by the solar wind , changes size dramatically as the wind varies .
The newly observed aurora at Saturn , however , does n't fit into either category .
" Saturn 's unique auroral features are telling us there is something special and unforeseen about this planet 's magnetosphere and the way it interacts with the solar wind and the planet 's atmosphere , " said Nick Achilleos , Cassini scientist on the Cassini magnetometer team at the University College London .
" Trying to explain its origin will no doubt lead us to physics which uniquely operates in the environment of Saturn . "
The new infrared aurora appears in a region hidden from NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , which has provided views of Saturn 's ultraviolet aurora .
Cassini observed it when the spacecraft flew near Saturn 's polar region .
In infrared light , the aurora sometimes fills the region from around 82 degrees north all the way over the pole .
This new aurora is also constantly changing , even disappearing within a 45 minute - period .

As you see in the article “ Implementing High Availability with HSRP “ , it is quite simple configure Hot Standby Router Protocol .
Some cases require a custom configuration , using priority , track , preempt etc…and these are :
The standby preempt interface configuration command allows the router to become the active router when its priority is higher than all other HSRP - configured routers in this Hot Standby group .
The configurations of both routers include this command so that each router can be the standby router for the other router .
If you do not use the standby preempt command in the configuration for a router , that router cannot become the active router .
interface configuration command allows the router to become the active router when its priority is higher than all other HSRP - configured routers in this Hot Standby group .
The configurations of both routers include this command so that each router can be the standby router for the other router .
If you do not use the standby preempt command in the configuration for a router , that router cannot become the active router .
The standby priority interface configuration command sets the router ’s HSRP priority ( the default priority is 100 ) .
interface configuration command sets the router ’s HSRP priority ( the default priority is 100 ) .
The standby timers interface configuration command sets the interval in seconds between hello messages ( called the hello time ) to five seconds and sets the duration in seconds that a router waits before it declares the active router to be down ( called the hold time ) to eight seconds .
( The defaults are three and 10 seconds , respectively . )
If you decide to modify the default values , you must configure each router to use the same hello time and hold time .

( The defaults are three and 10 seconds , respectively . )
If you decide to modify the default values , you must configure each router to use the same hello time and hold time .
The standby track command allows you to specify another interface on the router for the HSRP process to monitor in order to alter the HSRP priority for a given group .
If the line protocol of the specified interface goes down , the HSRP priority is reduced .
This means that another HSRP router with higher priority can become the active router if that router has standby preempt enabled .
command allows you to specify another interface on the router for the HSRP process to monitor in order to alter the HSRP priority for a given group .
If the line protocol of the specified interface goes down , the HSRP priority is reduced .
This means that another HSRP router with higher priority can become the active router if that router has standby preempt enabled .
The standby authentication interface configuration command establishes an authentication string whose value is an unencrypted eight - character string that is incorporated in each HSRP multicast message .
This command is optional .
If you choose to use it , each HSRP - configured router in the group should use the same string so that each router can authenticate the source of the HSRP messages that it receives .
Suppose to have this physical configuration :
Partial configuration of Ciscozine_1 layer3 switch :
Ciscozine_1 # ip routing interface FastEthernet0/0 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface FastEthernet0/ 1 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface FastEthernet0 / 2 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface FastEthernet0/ 3 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface Vlan101 ip address 172.16.101.2 255.255.255.0 standby 1 ip 172.16.101.1 standby 1 priority 150 standby 1 preempt standby 1 track FastEthernet0/3 55 standby 1 authentication C3s_101 no shutdown interface Vlan102 ip address 172.16.102.2 255.255.255.0 standby 2 ip 172.16.102.1 standby 2 preempt standby 2 track FastEthernet0/3 standby 2 authentication C3s_102 no shutdown interface Vlan103 ip address 172.16.103.2 255.255.255.0 standby 3 ip 172.16.103.1 standby 3 priority 150 standby 3 preempt standby 3 track FastEthernet0/3 50 standby 3 authentication C3s_103 no shutdown
Partial configuration of Ciscozine_2 layer3 switch :
Ciscozine_2 # ip routing interface FastEthernet0/0 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface FastEthernet0/ 1 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface FastEthernet0 / 2 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface FastEthernet0/ 3 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk interface Vlan101 ip address 172.16.101.3 255.255.255.0 standby 1 ip 172.16.101.1 standby 1 preempt standby 1 track FastEthernet0/3 standby 1 authentication C3s_101 no shutdown interface Vlan102 ip address 172.16.102.3 255.255.255.0 standby 2 ip 172.16.102.1 standby 2 priority 150 standby 2 preempt standby 2 track FastEthernet0/3 60 standby 2 authentication C3s_102 no shutdown interface Vlan103 ip address 172.16.103.3 255.255.255.0 standby 3 ip 172.16.103.1 standby 3 preempt standby 3 track FastEthernet0/ 3 standby 3 authentication C3s_103 no shutdown
The commands
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1 q switchport mode trunk enable the dot1 q trunk between the switches .
The command
ip routing enable the routing on the layer3 switches .
Ciscozine_1 layer3 switch is the primary device for VLAN 101 and VLAN 103 and the backup device for VLAN 102 ; Ciscozine_2 layer3 switch is the primary device for VLAN 102 and the backup device for VLAN101 and VLAN 103 .
This type of configuration permits to balance the network load .
If there is a failure of FastEthernet 0/3 on the primary device , the backup device will be the new primary device , unless FastEthernet 0/3 on the backup device has also failed or the FastEthernet0 / 3 on the primary device will active again .
This behaviour is drawn below .
If Ciscozine_1 FastEthernet0/3 is down , the Ciscozine_2 will be the active router for VLAN 101 and VLAN 103 .
If the Ciscozine _1 FastEthernet0/3 and Ciscozine_2 FastEthernet0/3 are down , the active router for VLAN 101 and VLAN 103 will be Ciscozine_1 .
Now look at this configuration :
Ciscozine_1 Ciscozine_2 interface Vlan103 interface Vlan103 ip address 172.16.103.2 255.255.255.0 ip address 172.16.103.3 255.255.255.0 standby 3 ip 172.16.103.1 1 standby 3 ip 172.16.103.1 standby 3 priority 150 2 standby 3 preempt 3 standby 3 preempt standby 3 track FastEthernet0/3 50 4 standby 3 track FastEthernet0/3 standby 3 authentication Cés_103 5 standby 3 authentication Cés_103
In this instance :
the standby ip address is 172.16.103.1
the HSRP prefers the router with higher priority and , if it is equal , it prefers the highter IP address .
Ciscozine_1 is the active router because it has a priority of 150 while Ciscozine_2 has default priority of 100 .
bofh switches have preempt to become the active router when its priority is higher than all other HSRP - configured routers in this Hot Standby group .
Interface tracking enables the priority of a standby group router to be automatically adjusted based on the availability of that router ’s interfaces .
When a tracked interface becomes unavailable , the HSRP priority of the router is decreased .
When properly configured , the HSRP tracking feature ensures that a router with an unavailable key interface relinquishes the active router role .
If the Ciscozine _1 FastEthernet0/ 3 is down , the HSRP priority is decremented of 50 and so the priority will be 100 ( 150 - 50 ) .
Bofh router will be a HSRP priority of 100 and then the Ciscozine _2 will be the active router because it has the higher ip address .
If the Ciscozine _2 FastEthernet 0/3 will be down , the priority of Ciscozine_2 will be decremented of 10 ( default value ) and so the priority will be 90 ( 100 - 10 ) .
Then the active router will be Ciscozine_1 again !
the authentication key is C3s_103 and it is sent in clear text .
Remember that from the IOS release 12.3 ( 2 ) T it is possible send the hashed key using MD5 .
Similar behavior is applied to VLAN 101 and VLAN 102 .
Police said emergency service workers were called to Tathra wharf about 8.10 pm and pulled the children , father and man out of the water all unconscious .
The father could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead at the scene , while his two children were taken by ambulance to Bega Hospital in a critical condition , but died shortly after .
The 37 - year - old fisherman was revived by paramedics despite spending a lengthy period of time in the water and was taken to hospital .
A spokeswoman for Bega Hospital said he was treated for superficial injuries .
He was discharged at 12.30 am today .
Local man A staff member at Kalaru Automotive , who did not wish to be named , said the man who had died was a local Kalaru man who worked in Bega .
" In a small community like this word travels fast .
When they told me who it was I was shocked .
" I did n't know him very well - used to say ' G ' day ' ... he had a couple of young kids and fiancee , and lived down the road .
" He 'd been a local and lived here all his life .
" Most people know him , he worked in Bega and lived out here in Kalaru - it 's just very hard to believe something like this could happen . "
He said the small community was still reeling from a murder - suicide in the Pericoe Valley in June , in which Gary Bell killed himself and his three children , Bon , 18 months , Maddie , 5 and Jack , 7 .
" Some of the things that have happened here in the last few years ... you wonder why they happen , " he said .
Fishing trip
It is understood the father was fishing with his two children on the wharf , located at the end of Wharf Road at the southern end of Tathra beach .
The editor of the Bega District News , Steve Strevens , arrived a short time later .
" The older child may have toppled [ the pram ] over , it ended up in the water and the father jumped in to help , " he said .
" A tourist also fishing at the other end of the wharf heard the splash and jumped in to help . "
He said the other tourist , a woman in her 50s , phoned triple - 0 and local emergency crews assembled at the nearby Tathra Surf Life Saving Club to get to the victims .
A crew from the surf club set out in an inflatable rescue boat , while two surf lifesavers jumped into the water from the wharf despite the hazardous conditions .
Mr Strevens said after they pulled the bodies from the ocean , surf club members and ambulance crew from nearby Bega and Bermagui worked to resuscitate the four people well into the night .
" They were there for a substantial amount of time , " he said .
" They were worked on extensively by the paramedics and then transferred to the hospital .
The ambulances would have left at about 9.45 pm . "
Before the children died , an ambulance spokesman said the " two children were in cardiac arrest and resuscitation continued all the way to Bega Hospital " .
' It 's so awful '
The tragedy had already gripped the small community , said Quyen Nguyen from the local bakery , Tathra Bakehaus Swiss .
" It 's so awful , a lot of customers are talking about , " she said .
" It 's so shocking .
I feel so sad for the young boys ... I 've got young kids .
" One or two people who 've come in here said they know them , that they are local people .
If they are young people I 'd have seen them , a lot of people come into this bakery . "
Ms Nguyen could not understand why anyone would have been at the wharf at night , saying conditions had been dangerous since the afternoon .
" A customer who came in here said she went there about 5 pm and said it was really windy . "
However , another resident who wished to be known only as Jake - from Tathra Beach and Bike - said the wharf was popular at all times .
" It was a cold and choppy , but there 's always someone out there fishing , or just having a look , " he said .
Although the incident is not being treated as suspicious , police are calling for any witnesses to contact Batemans Bay police station or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 , as they prepare a report for the coroner .

Palin vs. Wooten : Palin wins another round
November 11 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
cue Wicked Witch of the West cackle and music :
The Alaska state trooper who was the subject of harsh allegations by Gov. Sarah Palin was taken off patrols recently for his own safety , after her comments allegedly prompted a series of threatening phone calls , KIMO - TV in Anchorage reported Friday . [… ]
Wooten is now working a desk job , KIMO reported .
The troopers ’ union has expressed concern because the new position means he can no longer earn overtime pay .
From the Anchorage Daily News on November 8 , 2008 , just in case you were ever under the impression that Palin was concerned with her sister ’s safety :
In her sworn testimony to Petumenos , Palin said she did n’t know that Todd had been talking to Monegan about Wooten in early 2007 .
She testified that she told her husband early in her administration to stop talking to her about Wooten because she was sick of hearing about him .
And from the Anchorage Daily News , on October 12 , 2008 , just in case you were wondering where you ever would have gotten the impression that Palin thought Wooten was dangerous :
Palin said she appreciated the chance to address what she called “ Tasergate , ” a reference to an earlier finding in a state trooper investigation that determined her ex-brother - in - law used a Taser on his 11 - year - old stepson , among other issues .
…
Neither she nor Todd had anything to apologize for , the governor said .
“ Todd did what anyone would have done given this state trooper ’s very , very troubling behavior and his dangerous threats against our family , ” Palin said Saturday .

The success of the BBC iPlayer is proof that the corporation is right to bet its future on the internet , its director of future media and technology , Erik Huggers , said yesterday .
Huggers also announced that the online TV catch - up service has served 248 m items of content since it launched officially on Christmas Day last year .
Speaking at Screen Digest 's conference on the future of online media distribution , Huggers set out his priorities for the development of the BBC 's digital services .
He said the iPlayer should be opened up internationally , that bbc.co.uk needs to introduce more social media and that the corporation is working to develop industry standards so that content can be developed more easily for a range of different devices .
" The internet is , by definition , a global medium , yet today we are artificially blocking international access to the iPlayer .
That 's a problem , in my mind , and a big challenge for the industry , " Huggers added .
" I know that bbc.co.uk is the third biggest web property in the country , yet every time I go there I feel completely alone .
Instinctively , I know there are other people on the site so the idea is connecting audiences with programming and with each other , embracing that big theme of social media . "
Huggers , who was appointed to to head the BBC 's digital activities in July , replacing Ashley Highfield , said that the iPlayer is in a constant software development process more like that of a technology firm , with new features and functionality added every week .
By the end of the year , the service will offer a download manager for all operating systems , and has already introduced " series stacking " so that users can save an entire series .
The priority is to make the iPlayer available on as many digital platforms as economically possible , said Huggers .
The iPlayer service available through Virgin Media 's cable service alone served 49 m videos since June .
PC users still account for the vast majority of iPlayer viewers with 85 % of the audience , with Nintendo Wii and Linux both accounting for 1 % , according to Huggers .
He said the popularity of the iPhone and iPod Touch had taken the BBC future media and technology team by surprise .
Apple Mac users now account for one in 10 iPlayer viewers , while iPhone and iPod Touch owners account for a further 3 % .
" The situations we 're seeing are interesting - mum and dad are watching linear TV in the living room but kids are watching in a different way ... on the iPhone , iPod Touch or laptop , " Huggers added .
EastEnders , which pulls in an average of 18.9 million TV viewers each month on BBC1 and BBC3 , attracts 457,000 viewers on the iPlayer .
CBBC digital channel programme MI High has a far higher proportion of viewership on the iPlayer : it has a TV audience of 145,000 , while 30,000 watch on the iPlayer .
Huggers insisted that the online audience did not cannibalise the TV audience .
He noted that the iPlayer is popular during office hours through the day but , as viewership peaks in the evening around 9 pm , heavy usage typically continues for an hour longer than TV viewing .
" That 's a fabulous opportunity to extend or hold on to prime - time users for an extra hour , " Huggers said .
The BBC 's user data shows the iPlayer is used by a range of ages .
Huggers said that 15 - to 34 - year - olds account for 37 % of viewers and 35 - to 54 - year - olds account for 43 % .
A further 21 % of users are aged 55 or over and Huggers credited the iPlayer 's popularity to it being easy to use .
" Having seen all this and understanding more about the success of the service , the sort of users , when they watch it and what they watch , I think the BBC is absolutely betting on the internet protocol in a way where it's not just the distribution side of what the internet enables , " he said .
" We are completely re-engineering the way in which we make fantastic programming . "

Arizona Public Service Co. plans to buy 100 megawatts of electricity beginning next year from the High Lonesome Wind Ranch being built 55 miles southwest of Albuquerque , the company said .
The purchase will give APS 190 megawatts of wind capacity .
That is enough electricity for about 47,500 houses in APS territory , when the wind is blowing at both the power plants .
The other 90 megawatts of wind energy under contract to APS also come from New Mexico .
The High Lonesome will be owned by a subsidiary of Edison International and is being developed by Foresight Wind Energy LLC , according to APS .
APS does not usually disclose the price of electricity it acquires through contracts , but officials said the cost from High Lonesome was " competitive . "
" We believe we have gotten a very good deal for our customers , " spokesman Steven Gotfried said .

What about George W. Bush ?
In San Francisco , “ W ” may soon stand for “ wastewater . ”
On Tuesday , voters will consider commemorating the 43rd president ’s legacy in a less than exalted way : renaming the city ’s Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant as the George W. Bush Sewage Plant .
In a city where only 9 percent of voters are registered Republicans , organizers of the tongue - in - cheek idea had little trouble gathering 12,000 signatures to put Proposition R on the ballot .
“ People were lining up to sign it , ” said Brian McConnell , a phone systems designer who hatched the idea last year in a Mission District bar with friends .
“ One way to look at a sewage plant is in terms of its contents — what we got stuck with — the Iraq war , a $ 10 trillion debt and a huge mess that needs to be cleaned up . ”
The measure needs only a simple majority to pass .
In a brand of civics you wo n’t see as part of festivities in say , Lubbock , Texas , the Yes on R news conference at City Hall on Election Night will be hosted by a drag queen named “ Peaches Christ . ”
And as part of the official ballot arguments , supporters offered a haiku :
Need Bush memor’l ?
Sewage plant available
How appropriate
Needless to say , the city ’s beleaguered Republicans are not embracing the methane memorial .
“ I do n’t think it is funny .
It ’s a waste of time .
It ’s a waste of money , ” said San Francisco Republican Party Chairman Howard Epstein .
“ It ’s disrespectful to the office .
Are we going to name a brothel in Nevada after Bill Clinton ?
If you do n’t like George Bush , OK , you do n’t like him .
But this has gone too far . ”
City leaders say if the measure passes , it will cost about $ 50,000 to put up new signs and change all the stationery and letterhead .
At first , managers of the city - owned plant said the election was disrespectful to the hardworking employees of the plant .
But then their union , the SEIU , endorsed it .
The fecal fracas has gained worldwide attention .
“ I just do n’t think it dignifies a response , ” said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino in June when asked about the president ’s position .
Supporters plan to commemorate Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 with a synchronized flush of hundreds of thousands of San Francisco toilets , an action that would send a flood of water toward the plant , as Bush leaves the throne of power .
In recent weeks , they have asked San Francisco shop owners to tape posters in their windows that feature a picture of Bush emerging from a toilet , Alfred E. Neuman - like , with the words : “ Help put the # 1 guy on the # 2 building . ”
McConnell says if the sewage plant — which sits along Ocean Beach near San Francisco Zoo and treats 17 million gallons of effluent a day — is renamed , it will become a tourist attraction and a fitting memorial for the man he considers the worst president in history .
“ The contents of the facility represent the quality of what we got in the last eight years , ” he said .

The names are chosen for ease during radio communications
The not - so - secret code names used by the US Secret Service for the president - elect and his family have been published .
Barack Obama is called Renegade , while his wife Michelle is Renaissance , and their daughters Rosebud and Radiance .
They will replace Trailblazer ( President George W Bush ) and his wife Tempo in the White House on 20 January .
The names are chosen to be easily pronounced and understood when agents use radio communications .
A list of names starting with R was drawn up by the White House Communications Agency , a branch of the military that serves the White House and Secret Service .
SECRET SERVICE CODE NAMES
Renegade : Barack Obama , President - elect Renaissance : Michelle Obama , president - elect 's wife Radiance : Malia Obama , president - elect 's daughter Rosebud : Sasha Obama , president - elect 's daughter Trailblazer : George W Bush , President Tempo : Laura Bush , First Lady Rawhide : Ronald Reagan , ex-President Smurfette : Kareena Gore , ex-vice - president 's daughter
When 19 - year - old Karenna Gore 's father became vice - president in 1993 she had to choose her own name .
In 1997 , she wrote : " Ever since four years ago , when I was put on the spot and told ' two syllables ' and ' It has to start with an s , ' I have been cringing in the back seat when identified as ' Smurfette ' . "
Al Gore frequently told people his code name was Al Gore because he was so boring .
However , the Washington Post reported that he was initially called Sawhorse but eventually became Sundance for unknown reasons .
Vice - President - elect Joe Biden is known as Celtic .
The outgoing president retains his code name as he and his family will continue to have Secret Service protection .
" There 's nothing top secret about them , " Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren told Associated Press .
" It has no operational security significance any more because of encrypted communication capabilities . "
The code names have " nothing to do with security " and more to do with ease in radio communication for those agents whispering into microphones up their sleeves .
The defeated Republican presidential candidate John McCain , a senator from Arizona , is Phoenix , while his wife Cindy is Parasol .
His running mate , Sarah Palin , was Denali - the name of national park in her home state of Alaska , and the natural gas pipeline project there .
Her husband , Todd , the North Slope oil worker , was Driller .
Previous code names have included : Passkey for President Gerald Ford ; Rawhide for President Ronald Reagan ; Deacon for President Jimmy Carter ; and Angler for Vice - President Dick Cheney .

After much anticipation from a room full of reporters and other curiosity - seekers , Sarah Palin this morning took four questions from reporters in a press conference that lasted 11 minutes .
Actually , taking away Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's opening statement , the session lasted under 10 minutes .
Palin was on stage with 13 other Republican governors — all men — who received zero attention from the assembled crowd .
After the third question , an RGA aide tried to end the session but Perry interjected and allowed for a fourth question .
Palin sought to deflect attention from herself and talk about the governors as a group , but all the questions centered on her past and future .

Sate your afternoon sugar cravings with a dead - easy chocolate cake recipe that only requires hot chocolate mix , flour , an egg , cooking spray , and oil ( all stuff you 've got in your pantry anyway ) .
Grab the biggest microwavable coffee mug you 've got in your cupboard , and cover the inside with cooking spray .
Mix up four tablespoons of flour and nine tablespoons of hot chocolate mix , then throw in three tablespoons of water , three tablespoons of oil and one egg .
Once it 's thoroughly mixed into an even batter , microwave the whole shebang for three minutes on high .
Watch how high it rises from the cup in the video below :
Click to view
When you hear that BEEEP of completion , you 'll have yourself a piping hot , single - serving cake in a cup .
In the name of research ( ahem ) , I gave this a try myself this afternoon , and the result was — well , not the best cake I 've ever had .
Actually , it was kind of gross .
The texture much less cake -y than one would expect and much more gummy than you 'd ever want .
I also made the mistake of using some fancy - pants hot chocolate mix from Jacques Torres back in Brooklyn that clearly was n't meant to be microwaved with an egg .
That said , I 'm going to give this a try once I get ahold of some plain old Swiss Miss and see what happens — the result was indeed instant , hot , chocolate cake , and even the worst chocolate cake is better than no chocolate cake .

" Adult bullies target their victims in many of the same way children who bully do .
While many people think that bullying only occurs amongst children , it can also happen in the workplace among adults . "
The quote above is directly from Stop a Bully - Characteristics of Adult Bully Targets .
It is what I have been experiencing these last two months , when my little boy and I became victims to a neighbor bully .
Characteristics of Bullies
Intimidation
Power domination
Controlling and manipulating
Physically aggressive behavior
Think they are the center of the universe
Pick on vulnerable people
Characteristics of Victims
Loner
Socially isolated
Physically small or weak
Different race , or ethnicity
Quiet , polite , and keep to oneself
My son introduced her son as neighbor
My son did n't invite her son to his birthday party
My son did n't look at her son when he has to run in the house to take a pee
I 'm a bad mother for not making my son share his friends with her son
I did n't teach my son the right thing to do because I allow him to choose who he wants at his birthday party
I have nothing to do , so I should hang out with her everyday
At some stage you or somebody you know will struggle with a clogged kitchen sink drain that is too hard to fix with a drain cleaner .
Before you get all panicky and crazy with your drain situation , here are some tips can possibly help you get the clog all worked out .
Of course , nothing beats the services of a reliable Baltimore kitchen plumbing professional .
They are the people whom you should call if none of the tips and tricks below worked for you .
Their expertise is going to help you go through any tough situation .
1 . Use a plunger .
Invest in a good plunger if you do n’t have one yet .
The best plunger can get many clogs removed .
Many sink plungers sell no more than $ 10 .
You may buy them at your favorite hardware store or online , whichever you prefer .
2. Unclog the other sink .
Many kitchen sinks are dual so before you work on the one that ’s clogged , try plunging the drain that ’s not unclogged .
Do it together with the use of a wet rug .
That should clear up some air space for the actual unclogging work .
If you do n’t have a dual kitchen sink , you can skip this step .
3 . Fill the clogged sink with a small amount of water .
Once you ’re ready to use the plunger on the sink , fill it with a small amount of water .
Remember that it ’s the moving up motion that gets the drain unclogged and not the downward motion so pay more attention to it .
Use the plunger several times until you notice that the water is coming down much faster .
The repeated plunging action should free up the paper and food products that are stuck inside the pipes .
4 . Use a wire or coat hanger to snake out the clog .
If the plunger fails to do the trick , a wire snake fashioned from a coat hanger may do the trick .
Use pliers to bend a tiny hook on the end of the hanger .
Insert the hanger into the sink .
Move it in an up and down motion in the attempt to dislodge food items that are stuck inside the pipe .
In places where the plunger failed , this technique is known to work .
But be careful not to use this trick on garbage disposal or it will lead to major issues .
5 . Use a plumber ’s snake .
If all else fails , then you ’ll really need to find a real plumber ’s snake to do the job .
Using a plumber ’s snake will also minimize the possibility of it getting the clog farther down .
A drain snake can also be bought from a hardware store .
If in case using the plumber ’s snake still can’t solve the issue , you ’ll have to remove the trap so you can reach the tougher spot .
When using a plumber ’s snake , be sure that you are wearing rubber gloves .
You ’ll also need a bucket under the trap to catch dirty water leaking out .
If you have all of these in place , then you can start using the plumber ’s snake and solve the problem .

Guaranteed not to contain zombies , pirates or virtual alcohol , here are 20 Facebook apps you can actually use
Had your fill of zombies and pirates ?
Despair when you 're given another egg to hatch or offered a fish for your virtual tank ?
You 're not alone .
Thoroughly fed up of crap Facebook apps , we searched long and hard to find useful tools and productive programs - and we found twenty .
These are all applications worth adding to your profile .
Calendars and editing tools , blog feeds and mobile updates - there 's not a super poke or secret crush among them .
If you know of any more , tell us about them in the comments section .
1. fbCal
Facebook lacks a true calendar application .
It stores your friend 's birthdays and there 's an events section - but you can't subscribe to this data or plug it into other sources .
To fill the gap , give fbCal a whirl .
It collates Facebook 's birthday and event data , then creates iCalendar format feeds from it that can be read by Outlook , Google Calendar and Apple 's iCal - enabling you to share the data with your favourite desktop ( or online ) calendar .
2. 30 Boxes Calendar
Need a more flexible calendar app ?
Then sign up for an account at 30 Boxes .
This Google Calendar clone is free , easy to use and has a fast track sign - up process that 'll have you creating calendars in minutes .
You 'll be prompted to add Facebook integration when you configure the service for first use .
If you 're a Google Calendar user , export your data using Calgoo Calendar and upload it to 30 Boxes .
3. Twitter
You already know Twitter - it 's the microblogging web tool that gives you 140 words to tell the world what you 're doing .
Like Marmite , people either love it or hate it .
If you 're a hater , then Facebook integration might change your mind .
This app sends
Twitter updates direct to your Facebook status - enabling you to synchronise the two and update from Twitter.com , your mobile phone or using one of the many Twitter clients available .
4. Flixster Movies
At first sight , Flixster Movies looks like another of those nagging apps that are always prompting you to take part in lame quizzes .
And it is .
But , it also enables you to rate and review films you 've seen , then compare your ratings with folks on your friends list .
It 's a great social tool and a fine way to find out whether it's worth visiting the cinema to watch that big new blockbuster , or if it 's better to wait for the DVD .
5. Cities I 've Visited
One of Facebook 's top applications is " Where I 've Been " , a tool that lets you place pins in a map of the world , ticking off destinations you 've travelled to .
It 's great , but we prefer Cities I 've Visited from TripAdvisor , an application that does the same job using the MultiMap API .
It lets you share data with other friends who have the app installed and is a brilliant way to boast about your travels , or recommend places to your mates .
6. Picnik
Facebook lacks any significant , built in image - editing tools - so Picnik is a must have if you 're a regular user of Facebook 's photo albums .
Picknik is an online picture editing service , enabling you to crop , rotate , resize , colour correct and filter your images in your browser .
The Facebook version gives you direct access to all the images upload to your profile , enabling you to do all of the above without leaving the site .
7. Scrabble Worldwide
There are two official versions of Scrabble on Facebook - one for the US and Canada and one for the rest of the world .
There used to be a third , monumentally popular version called Scrabulous , forced to shut up shop by US Scrabble owners Hasbro .
Undeterred , the developers launched a second word game application within months called Wordscraper .
The official Scrabble looks the business , but many players prefer Wordscraper 's simple interface .
Why not try them both ?
Alleged gangland boss Yaakov Alperon , one of Israel 's most wanted men , was killed by a car bomb in Tel Aviv on Monday , highlighting public fears of rising crime .
Mr Alperon , 54 , was being hunted by police as the head of one of some half a dozen Israeli criminal clans .
A bomb believed to have been set off by remote control exploded shortly after he drove off in a rental car from a Tel Aviv court where his son had been indicted for extortion and assault .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
Mr Alperon was a colourful figure with a brutal reputation that earned him local comparisons with Italian mafia figures .
He was a scion of Egyptian immigrants , and had a long list of enemies and rivals .
Police voiced fears of retribution , reflecting how gangland - style violence on Israeli streets now sometimes rivals concerns over conflict with the Palestinians .
Eight Israelis have been killed in mafia - style executions in recent years .
" A very serious incident took place today , the consequences of which are very clear .
We will draw the appropriate operational lessons , " Tel Aviv police chief Ilan Franco said .
Israeli media said police suspected a bomb had been planted while the vehicle was parked near the courthouse , and that a parking attendant had been detained for questioning .
Two passers - by including a 13 - year - old boy were lightly injured by the blast , which was originally wrongly reported by an emergency service as a bus bomb .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Foreclosure activity in October rose 25 percent from a year earlier , although filings in California fell by double - digit percentage points for the second consecutive month due to a state law slowing the foreclosure process , according to a monthly report by RealtyTrac .
Foreclosure filings -- default notices , auction sales notices and bank repossessions -- rose by 5 percent from September to 279,561 in October , according to Irvine , California - based research firm RealtyTrac .
That means one in every 452 U.S. housing units received a foreclosure filing in October , the firm said in its report released on Thursday .
The California law , which requires lenders to contact homeowners and explore options to avoid foreclosure before initiating the process , took effect in early September and drove the state ’s foreclosure activity rates down , at a pace of 31.6 percent from August to September and 18 percent from September to October .
But in September , the California law helped drive the national foreclosure rate down , something that did not happen in October .
“ Foreclosure activity in other places rose significantly enough to offset the drop in California , ” said RealtyTrac Senior Vice President Rick Sharga .
Years of lending to risky , or “ subprime ” borrowers that fueled the housing boom has created an unprecedented number of foreclosures due to the inability of many of those borrowers to pay their mortgages , particularly as interest rates reset and as plunging home values nationwide increasingly render properties worth less than the mortgage .
The numbers might also be showing the effects of the economic downturn , Sharga said .
If they do not yet , they will soon .
“ An economic downturn is traditionally a precursor to foreclosures , even in a normal foreclosure cycle , ” Sharga said .
“ This is not a normal foreclosure cycle by any means . ”

Moreover , California ’s law will likely not prevent most of the state ’s homes which are teetering on the brink of foreclosure from falling off the cliff , Sharga said .
Previous experience with similar laws in Maryland and Massachusetts attests to such laws ’ inability to make a material difference .
“ For most homeowners , these laws just delay the inevitable , ” he said .
HELP FROM FANNIE , FREDDIE ON THE WAY ?
The markets that once lead the housing boom topped the foreclosure list in September .
Nevada posted the nation ’s highest foreclosure rate for the 22nd consecutive month in October , with one in every 74 housing units , or 14,483 , receiving a foreclosure filing during the month -- more than six times the national average .
Arizona registered the second - highest state foreclosure rate .
Filings were reported on 17,507 Arizona properties , an increase of 35 percent from the previous month and 176 percent from October 2007 .
In Florida , one of every 157 units received a filing during October , the nation ’s third - highest state rate .
A total of 54,324 Florida properties received a foreclosure filing during the month , an increase of 13 percent from the previous month and nearly 80 percent from last year .
However , the government unveiled a plan on Tuesday which , unlike California ’s law , could permanently reduce the number of foreclosures , Sharga said .
Homeowners facing foreclosure who are spending more than 38 percent of their income on mortgage payments could have monthly payments reduced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two largest U.S. mortgage finance companies .
“ The good news is that there are programs and facilities in place that could actually have a material effect of stemming the tide of foreclosures , but as always the devil is in the details , ” Sharga said , adding that he does not expect to see that effect until late in the first quarter of 2009 .
RealtyTrac counts foreclosures by compiling the total number of properties with at least one foreclosure filing reported during the month .
If more than one foreclosure document is filed against a property , Realty Trac counts only the most recent filing .
McCain heads to Georgia to stump for once -' reprehensible ' Chambliss Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator and recent presidential candidate John McCain ( R - AZ ) has changed his tune on Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R - GA ) since McCain personally spoke out in condemnation of a 2002 ad against Chambliss ' then - opponent , former Sen. Max Cleland .
" I 'd never seen anything like that ad , " said Sen. McCain , himself a Vietnam veteran and prisoner of war , in July 2003 .
" Putting pictures of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden next to the picture of a man who left three limbs on the battlefield .
It 's worse than disgraceful .
It 's reprehensible . "
" In advance of the Georgia runoff , McCain will campaign tomorrow for Saxby Chambliss , because the word ' reprehensible ' may start with the letters ' R , E , P ' ... but so does ' Republican , ' " said MSNBC's Keith Olbermann Wednesday night .
The television spot on behalf of the Chambliss campaign accused Cleland , a triple amputee and Vietnam veteran , of lacking the " courage to lead " for not backing all of President Bush 's Homeland Security amendments .
It showed pictures of Cleland after those of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
The ad , as posted to YouTube , appears below :
McCain will be in Georgia on Thursday to stump for Chambliss as he fights against Democratic contender Jim Martin for his seat in a runoff election to be decided on December 2 .
A web - only ad has been posted by the DSCC to remind voters of McCain 's 2003 statement :
The Washington Post 's Chris Cillizza opined to Olbermann on Wednesday night that McCain does n't necessarily feel as though he owes Chambliss , who endorsed him for president in February .
" My guess , Keith , is that McCain views himself , and is viewed because he was the Republican nominee for president , as a party leader . "

Claudia Castillo is the first person to receive a windpipe transplant made partly from her own cells ( Image : University of Barcelona )
A Colombian woman has become the world ’s first recipient of windpipe tissue constructed from a combination of donated tissue and her own cells .
Stem cells harvested from the woman ’s bone marrow were used to populate a stripped - down section of windpipe received from a donor , which was then transplanted into her body in June .
“ Surgeons can now start to see and understand the very real potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients , ” says Martin Birchall , professor of surgery at the University of Bristol , UK , and a member of the team which constructed the windpipe tissue .
“ We believe this success has proved that we are on the verge of a new age in surgical care . ”

Tuberculosis damage
Claudia Castillo , the 30 - year - old patient , had suffered a collapse of the tracheal branch of her windpipe leading to her left lung following a severe tuberculosis infection .
Left barely able to breathe , the decision was taken in March to attempt the windpipe reconstruction .
Spanish doctors started the process by taking a 7 - centimetre section of windpipe from a deceased donor .
Researchers at the University of Padua , Italy , led by Maria Teresa Conconi , then used detergent and enzymes to purge the donated windpipe of all the donor ’s cells .
After six weeks , all that was left was a solid scaffold of connective tissue .
Meanwhile , Birchall and his colleagues in Bristol took the stem cells from the patient ’s bone marrow and coaxed them in the lab into developing into the cartilage cells that normally coat windpipes .
Finally , the patient ’s cells were coated onto the donated tracheal scaffold over four days in a special bioreactor built at the Polytechnic of Milan in Italy .
No rejection
The patient received the finished organ in June at the Hospital Clinic , Barcelona , where surgeon Paolo Macchiarini replaced Castillo ’s damaged trachea with the newly constructed tissue .
Now , five months later , the patient is fit and well , and there have been no signs yet that her body is rejecting the graft .
The construction of the windpipe is the second organ produced outside the body using stem cells or cells from the patient ’s own body .
In 2006 , Anthony Atalaat Wake Forest University Medical School in Winston - Salem , North Carolina , revealed that his team had fitted seven children with bladders reconstructed from their own tissue .

A common pattern we hear on the Internet in regard to privacy or security is " I have nothing to hide " - no one will want to target me because they 'll gain nothing from doing so .
Today let me tell you a story that shows why this is not true .
A few years ago , I was using the same easy - to - remember password ( which was only 6 - letters long ) on most of the sites I had accounts on .
One day , I received an email from Freshmeat .
net asking me if the fact that I had changed the description in the record of Freecell Solver there to " Freecell Solver is a useless 100 % ANSI program that automatically solves games of Freecell " , indicated that it was not worthy of inclusion there .
This surprised me because I naturally did n't modify it like that nor intended to .
After talking with the admins of Freshmeat , I realised that someone logged in to my account , and submitted the malicious update for inclusion .
They ended up giving me his IP , which was in Israel 's Netvision ISP ( while I 'm subscribed to a different ISP ) .
Now , this change was pretty innocent , but naturally , now that he knew my shared password , the possibilities for him were endless .
As a result , I went on a concentrated spree of changing that password to new , different ones in all the accounts I created on the Net with it .
I made a smarter use of my password manager and eventually discovered the auto - remember - passwords feature of browsers such as Firefox and Konqueror , and solutions such as OpenID .
There 's no good excuse to compromise on security .
Do you have a bank account and access it online ?
If you 're not careful enough , a malicious attacker installing spyware on your PC might empty it .
So you say to yourself : " What does he have to gain from me ?
I only have $ 10,000 there . " .
Maybe you do , but if he empties hundred or thousands of accounts like that by writing a robot , he 'll become rich , so he is n't likely to not to target you .
And some people are keen on doing random vandalism with your online presence , like the one I mentioned , who may have also been trolling my blogs .
Therefore , make sure you 're as safe as possible .
This incident was all I needed to become more careful , and I hope you now realise that , as well .
A really eye - popping report from Ben Smith :
" He is black " was the first thing Kenny Perdue , the state 's AFL - CIO president , said .
" The gentleman that 's in the White House and John McCain they 're white men .
And I 'm absolutely ashamed of what George W. Bush has done to this country . "
The president of the United Mine Workers , Cecil Roberts , spoke after Perdue in a parking lot set in the flat plateau below the remains of a strip - mined mountain .
" I 'd rather have a black friend than a white enemy , " he said .
State Democratic Party Chairman Nick Casey spoke too .
Casey , 57 , grew up Irish Catholic in Charleston , and he said the bus was following John F. Kennedy 's bus route in the 1960 Democratic primary .
" There 's a lot of people out there think you 're a bunch of inbred , redneck racists , " he told a couple dozen people wearing union hats and jackets .
" They say you wo n't vote for a man who 's black . "
" The rest of the country thought when Kennedy ran we were a bunch of ignorant , inbred religious bigots , " he said .
" They were wrong , and we made Kennedy president . "
We want to hear what you think about this article .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
What 's the big major economic worry today ?
Japan , come on down !
You 're the next contestant on The Price Is n't Right !
The yen has surged 13 % against the dollar so far this month , even as the dollar has strengthened against the euro .
But a stronger yen is wreaking havoc on the world markets as its feeds more global recession fears .
Japan 's Nikkei fell to a 26 - year low Monday , helping to drag down stocks in Europe and the United States .
The Dow finished about 2.5 % lower while the S&P 500 fell more than 3 % .
The yen 's rise against the dollar is a big cause for concern , feeding on itself because of what is known as the carry trade .
Investors often borrow yen to buy other higher - risk investments .
But when those investments fall in value , investors have to sell them and rush back into the yen to cover their positions .
Since Japan is such a big exporter of goods , a more robust yen hurts profits for Japanese firms as sales from abroad get translated back into yen .
And that 's on top of the financial pain caused by weakening global demand .
So the more that the yen climbs , the worse Japan 's stock market will probably do , which tends to cause a ripple effect on European and U.S. exchanges .
" The Nikkei is heavily influenced by the manufacturers and exporters , and those are the companies that are going to get hit by the appreciation of the yen .
This is very bad news for Japan , " said Chris Probyn , chief economist with State Street Global Advisors .
To that end , electronics giant Sony ( SNE ) , which will report its third - quarter results on Wednesday , warned last Thursday that profits would be lower than forecasts , mainly due to the resurgent yen and expectations of weak sales of TVs , cameras and other electronics gadgets .
Toyota Motor ( TM ) is also starting to feel the pinch from a weakening global economy and stronger yen .
The automaker announced Monday that worldwide sales fell 4 % in the third quarter , the company 's first third - quarter sales drop since 2001 .
And even Japanese financial firms , which were largely thought to be holding up better than many of their U.S. and European rivals , are starting to feel the strain of the credit crunch .
Mitsubishi UFJ announced Monday that it planned to sell up to $ 10.6 billion in common and preferred stock , news that sent shares of Mitsubishi's ( MTU ) U.S. - listed stock plunging nearly 14 % .
Mitsubishi finalized a deal earlier this month to buy a 21 % stake in Wall Street icon Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) for $ 9 billion and also paid $ 3.5 billion last month to take complete control of the San Francisco - based bank UnionBanCal ( UB ) .
None of this is good news for the rest of the world .
" The best indicator of the future at the moment is the value of the yen .
If it stabilizes , we are likely to be okay and the markets will recover , " wrote Dick Bove , an influential bank analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann in a report Monday .
As such , financial leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial countries , or G - 7 , issued a statement Monday morning to express concerns about the yen 's rise .
Japan is a member of the G - 7 .
" We reaffirm our shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system , " the G - 7 officials said .
" We are concerned about the recent excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen and its possible adverse implications for economic and financial stability . "
The statement came amidst talks that the Bank of Japan and other developed nations are considering some sort of intervention to slow the yen 's rally .
The Bank of Japan could sell yen and buy dollars for example .
It 's possible that such an action could take place in the next few days .
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates by a half - percentage point at the end of a two - day meeting on Wednesday .
" People are trying to come to grips with just how bad the economic slowdown will be .
The information is drearier and drearier every day , " said Thomas Girard , co-portfolio manager for the MainStay Income Manager Fund .
" The economy is weak and the Fed has acknowledged .
So it has cover to lower interest rates and we think it should bring them to 1 % . "
There is some speculation that central banks in Europe could also lower rates as well .
If that happens , investors may , at least temporarily , be willing to put money back in riskier securities , such as stocks .
And that could help stall the yen 's climb .
" If every other major country lowers their rates aggressively , that would help because the yen would no longer stand out as having the lowest short - term rates , " Girard said .
Still , he added that intervention may not be enough to stop the yen , since so many hedge funds and other big investors still have positions to unwind related to the carry trade .
" Until that process completes itself , the yen is likely to continue to strengthen , " he said .
But a stronger yen is n't completely negative for the U.S. Kurt Karl , chief U.S. economist with Swiss Re , notes that a weaker dollar vs. the yen could boost exports to Japan by making U.S. goods more attractively priced .
" This is not bad news for the U.S. in terms of its competitive environment versus Japan , " he said .
Of course , if the stronger yen leads to more pain for the major Japanese exporters , one would think that would hurt Japan 's economy and consumers severely as well .
And a substantially weakened Japanese economy could be troubling for the U.S. , since Japan is the nation 's fourth - largest export market behind Canada , Mexico and China .
So until the yen starts to stabilize , Karl predicts more short - term volatility in the markets ahead .
" The movement of currencies over the last few months has been remarkably interesting in terms of how far it 's gone so quickly .
And in the past , you do have huge disruptions in stock prices when these strong currency moves are underway , " he said .

The Apple Tax is a popular term for people who believe Macs are overpriced .
It 's usually screamed at the top of lungs ( or the blog - commenter equivalent ) , but it 's rarely been dissected .
The truth about the Apple Tax is straightforward on one level - you will pay more for the same specs on a Mac - and surprisingly complicated on another .
It definitely exists , but it 's not a flat tax .
Even avoiding build quality and OS differences by looking only at Apple products , a Mac 's price tag is justified in some configurations while in others , it 's downright punitive .
If you 're a PC user thinking about switching , or just a Mac user looking to upgrade , our comprehensive look at the Apple Tax is for you .
It 's what you really get for what you pay .

In the case of Macs vs PCs , you could argue that customer support , the Leopard OS and design elements such as the new unibody construction and glass trackpads are what make up the Apple Tax .
The only problem with this logic is that , when you compare Apple computers alone with no PCs in sight , the tax still swings wildly .

Here we 've compiled for you two massive tables of raw specs .
One covering the lower - end MacBook , new and old , and its best PC equivalents ; the other covering MacBook Pros in the same manner .
Each is organized by price , lowest to highest , in order to show value tradeoffs .
While they 're broken into two charts for readability , really you can think of them as just one - prices and capabilities of the MacBook line bleed into those of the MacBook Pro now more than ever before .
Just because they 're easy to read , does n't mean they 're easy to read , though .

MacBook and MacBook Pro Dual Review Before Tuesday , there was no way a MacBook and a MacBook Pro could appear in a single review .

As you can see , in a purely spec-based , part - to - dollar fight , PCs win .
HP 's dv3500t handily beats the new cheap MacBook in specs - same Intel chip , more RAM , discrete graphics for over $ 100 less .
Similarly , HP 's dv5t essentially matches for the high - end MacBook Pro 's specs for $ 1,000 less , and you can add Blu-ray playback and a 400GB hard drive - features not available on the Pro-and still save more than $ 600 .
Asus 's m50V stacks up similarly for an even lower base .
Advertisement
Interestingly , Dell fares pretty poorly in comparisons .
Pricing is n't terrible , but the chipsets used to get the prices are last - gen ; we 're still waiting for Dell to join the Centrino 2 party .
The end result is that the XPS M1330 is neck - in - neck in performance with the new cheap MacBook - Nvidia says the integrated GeForce 9400 M performs comparably to the older discrete 8400M GS - with a similar price .
Same situation on the XPS M1530 , which gets handily trounced , spec-wise , by Asus and HPs in the same price bracket .
The point worth making is that PCs are not generically of better value - it varies from brand to brand .
But what you save may cost more later in less measurable things like durability , or even customer support .
When it comes to Macs alone , here 's how specs and prices stack up - surprisingly , this where the Apple Tax reveals itself to the be most sinister and disconcerting .
Two things make looking at Apple 's lineup right now extremely messy - the beefed - up specs ( and price ) of the new MacBooks against the Pros , and the end - of - life last - generation notebooks that are currently available at steep discounts .
Advertisement
Strictly speaking , the best value right now are the last - gen MacBook Pros - they 're so cheap they essentially negate the Apple tax , and destroy the new ones in performance - to - dollar ratio .
The older , discounted black MacBook is also a decent alternative to the new " cheap " MacBook model .
Advertisement
The real takeaway is that Apple 's lower - end $ 1,000 models appear to be shitty value propositions .
The performance gap between the cheapie white MacBook ( available for $ 150 less at Amazon ) and the new $ 1300 MacBook is significant .
Thanks to the faster RAM and graphics upgrade , it 's dumb to pay Apple $ 1000 instead of getting the new one .
But its 2GHz processor is not exceptionally fast and it lacks a backlit keyboard , so there 's an even more compelling case to step up to the $ 1600 model , especially when you consider the hard drive bump alone is $ 100 .
Like the bottle of wine second from the bottom of a wine list , that $ 1,300 appears to hold a slightly larger profit margin than its more expensive ilk .
Advertisement
The MacBook Pro situation is worse , especially when you factor in the oh - so - viable option of a $ 1700 last - gen MBP delivering the same basic performance as the current $ 2500 model .
But even when you consider the $ 2000 config against the $ 2500 one , the pricier one holds more value : Double the RAM , video memory , L2 cache and more storage / speed .
It 's almost dumb to get the $ 2000 one .
Except for the fact you 're now talking about a $ 2500 computer .
The real takeaway about the Apple Tax is that it 's regressive - that is , lower - priced models get hit harder .
It 's like a tax break for the rich , cuz it almost always makes more sense to buy the higher - end product , especially given that build quality , customer support and warranties are all equal here .
This is especially galling now , since being able to configure a cheaper model with what you really need - just the better graphics card , for instance - matters more than ever in this crappy ass economy .
Correction :
The previous - gen MacBook on Amazon has a combo drive ; the current - gen white MacBook on Apple 's site has an 8 x Super Drive .
It 's hard to believe , I know , but the McCain campaign seems intent on delving further and further into the gutter in its desperate attempt to tar Barack Obama with something - anything - that will undermine the trust he 's earned from voters for the past two years .
The most recent episode involves a full - court press in speeches and interviews by both candidates and their surrogates to inspire yet another McCarthyite panic , this one among Jews ( especially those in Florida , no doubt ) .
To review , five years ago Barack Obama spoke at the same dinner as Rashid Khalidi , a noted scholar and current professor at Columbia University .
There were some harsh things said by others at the dinner , but not by Khalidi or Obama .
Obama " called for finding common ground " in his remarks and said that his commitment to Israel 's security is " nonnegotiable " , according to the Los Angeles Times , which wrote an extensive account of the dinner six months ago .
The reporter , Peter Wallsten , based that story on a videotape of the dinner , which was provided to him by a source on the condition that it not be released .
Now right - wingers are demanding that the tape be released .
" A major news organisation is intentionally suppressing information that could provide a clearer link between Barack Obama and Rashid Khalidi , " said McCain campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb .
" The election is one week away , and it 's unfortunate that the press so obviously favours Barack Obama that this campaign must publicly request that the Los Angeles Times do its job - make information public . "
Sarah Palin , on the stump in Ohio on Wednesday , said : " Among other things , Israel was described there as the perpetrator of terrorism rather than the victim .
What we do n't know is how Barack Obama responded to these slurs on a country that he professes to support . "
( Note : professes to support ) .
McCain , sans any evidence whatsoever , claims that , hey , maybe William Ayers was there too .
He told Larry King on Wednesday : " I still think , you know , we 're watching now , a major newspaper has a tape that apparently has Mr William Ayers in it .
I do n't know if it does or not .
That 's the allegation .
But that newspaper and their parent , the Tribune Company , and the Obama campaign refuse to release that .
Should n't the American people know about that ?
At least they should have full information . "
There 's even a protest outside the LA Times .
This pathetic effort should , in a normal world , be laughed off the airwaves and news pages .
First and most importantly , Khalidi is not someone that anyone should be ashamed to know .
He is a noted and well - respected Palestinian scholar .
Michael Hudson , director of the Centre for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown , describes Khalidi as pre-eminent in his field , a courageous scholar and public figure .
John McCain apparently thought so too at one point , since the International Republican Institute , with McCain at the helm , gave Khalidi's Centre for Palestine Research and Studies a $ 448,000 grant in the late 1990s .
No concrete offence of Khalidi's has actually been alleged , so far as I 'm aware , except that he once served as spokesman for the PLO , which Khalidi denies .
Still , McCain made this stunning comparison on Wednesday : " If there was a tape of John McCain in a neo - Nazi outfit , I think the treatment of the issue would be slightly different , " he said in an interview with Hispanic radio stations .
This modern - day McCarthyism seems to rely much more on the fact that Rashid Khalidi's name is Rashid Khalidi than any concrete allegations of wrongdoing .
And the haphazard insinuation that maybe Ayers was there too is a transparent attempt to bait the Times into releasing the tape .
The McCain people must know that a journalist cannot and will not burn a source .
" The Los Angeles Times did not publish the videotape because it was provided to us by a confidential source who did so on the condition that we not release it , " said the newspaper 's editor , Russ Stanton .
" The Times keeps its promises to sources . "
Perhaps Sarah Palin is actually ignorant enough about journalism to believe the foolish charge she utters when complaining : " It must be nice for a candidate to have major news organisations looking out for their best interests like that .
Politicians would love to have a pet newspaper of their very own . "
But surely Goldfarb , who left the Weekly Standard to join McCain 's campaign , knows better , and is playing the dim bulb for purely political purposes .
( All this will no doubt keep him in good standing with his colleagues at the Standard , alas . )
Sadly , the media has been more than happy to provide that noise .
" Sen John McCain … continued to criticize the radical professors with whom Sen Barack Obama … has associations , " explained ABC's Jake Tapper , simply assuming that Khalidi fit this description without any apparent familiarity with his work .
" McCain attacked Obama for associating with both William Ayers and Rashid Khalidi on CNN's Larry King Live tonight . "
In King 's conversation with McCain , he too , bought into the crazy notion that the LA Times was somehow suppressing the news that the newspaper , alone , had reported .
Last night on CNN , Anderson Cooper summed up the MSM attitude perfectly : " McCain and Palin are making a big deal about this Palestinian - American professor .
We do n't take sides on this programme .
We just want the facts , so we asked Tom Foreman to look into this guy and allegations of a relationship with Obama and McCain . "
A long package ensued .
The only sensible perspective provided by CNN last night was this , from Dana Bash : " When I asked the McCain aide why they are just now bringing up a six - month - old article about a dinner five years ago , the aide was strikingly candid .
He said - quote - ' Because Obama may be one week away from being elected president . ' "
Really , one shudders for the fate of the free world when one considers the combination of stupidity , tastelessness , bigotry and outright idiocy that lies at the centre of this appeal .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Chiu
Hei-chun spent 50 years washing dishes at a roadside stall in Hong Kong only to lose his life savings when Lehman Brothers went belly up .
“ I saved it ( HK$ 520,000 ) bit by bit .
It was meant for my wife and I , for our medical bills and our coffins after we die so we wo n’t have to bother our children , ” the 72 - year - old said .
“ HK $ 20,000 of that belongs to my wife and she has n’t been talking to me .
I used to get 4 hours ’ sleep a night , but I have n’t even been getting an hour a night after this happened . ”
The global financial meltdown has hit not only pockets .
Greater numbers of people are suffering from insomnia , anxiety and depression and psychiatrists say suicide rates may creep up .
“ There is a lot of insomnia , depression and anxiety .
More people are depressed with the money they have lost , worried about the security of their jobs and the financial situation of their families , ” said Dominic Lee , a psychiatrist in Hong Kong who counts investment bankers among his patients .
Experts say the situation will get much worse when the impact seeps down further and people with fewer savings than investment bankers begin to lose their jobs as companies cut back due to an expected credit crunch .
“ If people start losing their jobs and unemployment rates rise , it would be even more serious , ” said Paul Yip , director of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Center for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong .
“ People who are unemployed are six to 30 times more likely to kill themselves , ” he said .
In Japan , the number of suicides leapt to 32,863 in 1998 , compared with 24,391 in 1997 -- a development blamed on a rising tide of bankruptcies after Japan ’s economic bubble burst .
It has stayed over 30,000 a year since then .
Studies have shown suicide in Japan is strongly linked to unemployment .
SUICIDE , DISEASE
Suicide figures in Hong Kong rose 50 percent from 12 per every 100,000 people in 1997 , when the Asian financial crisis hit , to 18 per 100,000 in 2003 , the year of the SARS epidemic .
“ The worst is yet to come .
People committed suicide in the past after constant harassment by debt collectors .
We have n’t seen that , but when the credit crunch in the consumer market happens , we will see an increase in suicide rates , ” Lee said .
Physical well - being is also an area of concern .
“ There is a lot of evidence that stress and depression can affect physical health .
Stress can affect a lot of conditions like asthma , stroke and cardiovascular disease .
They are more connected than we tend to believe , ” Lee said .
In Hong Kong , the government set up round - the - clock crisis hotlines for those with “ emotional and family problems ” this week .
Calls are answered by social workers and face - to - face counseling will be provided if needed .
At least 43,700 people in Hong Kong are known to have paid HK $ 20.2 billion ( US $ 2.6 billion ) for Lehman - related products .
Of these , 33,600 paid HK $ 11.9 billion for minibonds .
Chiu used to keep his money in fixed deposits but he bought Lehman products three years ago after a bank staff member assured him it was safe .
“ I told the staff I knew nothing and that I was putting full trust in her , ” the old man said .
Asked about the financial situation , Sayoko Yamamoto , a 59 - year - old company employee in Japan said : “ People will be worried about their old age , and it ’s really hard to find a way of dealing with these problems yourself . ”
“ There are a lot of reasons to worry and I think many people really do n’t know what to do . ”
A new Irish film claims that climate change guru Al Gore is an alarmist and that those who think they are saving the planet are only hurting the poor
IF THE ADVANCE publicity is anything to go by , Not Evil Just Wrong will do for Al Gore what Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/11 did for George W Bush .
" This is the film Al Gore and Hollywood do n't want you to see , " declares the website for the latest work by film - makers Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer .
The site even features a big picture of Gore , with his lips in the photograph seemingly digitally enhanced to make them look like Heath Ledger 's Joker from the latest Batman film .
The website goes on to say that their latest film - which takes on what are described as global warming alarmists - is " the most controversial documentary of the year " .
Indeed , it could very well be the most controversial .
And Al Gore and Hollywood may well not want you to see it .
And in that respect , Gore and co are actually succeeding for the moment .
Because there is no completed film .
Not yet anyway .
McElhinney and McAleer have raised almost $ 1 million ( €799,000 ) but need a total of $ 4.5 m ( €3.6 m ) to allow for a full cinema release .
They say they were acutely disappointed at being turned down for funding by the Irish Film Board , especially its conclusion that it was " repetitive and creatively thin " .
Instead , they have gone onto the internet hoping to solicit donations in the style of Barack Obama .
The finished product will be around 90 minutes long .
Both film - makers rebut the Film Board 's criticism by pointing out that a near - complete version of the film has been chosen in the audience category at the Amsterdam Film Festival later this month .
However , for now , there is no finished product .
And that creates a bit of a difficulty .
The merits of the case put forward in the film can only be judged - for now - on a short trailer and on the spirited arguments put forward by its two creators , and not on the work itself .
McElhinney and McAleer , who are a married couple , are former journalists .
McElhinney broke the Tristan Dowse story and the questionable money - making industry that had grown up around adoptions abroad .
McAleer is a former journalist with the Sunday Times and the Financial Times , who worked as a correspondent in Bucharest for a number of years .
THIS IS NOT the first time they have courted controversy .
An earlier documentary , Mine Your Own Business , contended that the actions of environmentalists were destroying communities and lives in developing countries .
A screening in the US was picketed by environmental groups .
And the documentary was also criticised because it was 70 per cent funded by Gabriel Resources , the Canadian mining company that wanted to develop an open pit gold mine in an impoverished village in Romania .
This surely compromised the editorial objectivity of the film .
On the contrary , McAleer says .
He points out that it is stated clearly in the first five minutes of the film where the funding came from .
He also asserts that the funder had no editorial control and only saw the film after completion .
But why fund it then ?
" They saw what I had written [ about the village ] in the Financial Times and saw that I was representing it in a fair way .
Also they had a good story to tell .
They were the only people who could save this village from being destroyed by environmentalists . "
The latest work , when it appears , will tackle the same subject but on a far more ambitious - and provocative - scale .
They will set out to prove the true cost of what they call " global warming hysteria " , which they claim damages the lives of vulnerable people .
Shooting took place in Ireland , Uganda , China , England , France and the US .
The film , as outlined by both , explores three strands .
The first looks at previous " scares " , namely the widespread ban on the use of the anti-malaria pesticide DDT , because of its effect on the environment .
The ban was highly controversial because there was evidence that its absence actually increased the incidence of malaria in poorer countries .
Both describe the ban as appalling and a disgrace , putting the lives of birds and wildlife ahead of human beings who died from disease - carrying mosquitoes .
The second strand explores what they contend are " flaws " in the climate change argument .
It is clear that the biggest " flaw " from their perspective has a name and it is Al Gore .
" We look at the bigger errors that are in An Inconvenient Truth , " says McElhinney , who asserts that scientists are not settled on climate change , and there is not incontrovertible evidence that it is happening .
It 's not possible to gainsay the film .
But you wonder does the logic follow all the way through .
Gore still believes in a ban on DDT , says McElhinney , arguing that this compromises his views on climate change .
Not necessarily .
They also explore nine " flaws " in Gore 's film , established by the High Court in Britain during a civil case .
Their major contentions include criticism of the famous inverted hockey stick graph which purported to show constant emissions for many centuries and big increases in CO2 emissions since 1900 .
That model completely neglected medieval warming ( proven ) and the little ice age from the 16th century to 1850 ( also proven ) , they argue .
IN BRIEF , THEIR other main assertions are : there has been no global warming since 1995 ; the polar bear population is not under threat from climate change but from human hunters ; they also say that the Arctic and Greenland glaciers have been receding since 1850 , long before the invention of SUVs ; and , finally , that the UN's International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) takes issue with Al Gore 's contention that sea levels will rise by 20ft ( more like 19 inches , says the IPCC ) .
None of these arguments are new .
It is the view of critics of global warming that the Earth 's climate is still recovering from the Little Ice Age after it ended around 1850 .
A quick Google of any of the above issues does point to potential flaws ( ie too much reliance on modelling , projecting and extrapolation ) but the problem is that the contrary argument often teeters on a rickety foundation .
The third strand is McAleer 's argument that the measures proposed to tackle climate change will cause crisis and chaos .
The world would collapse without fossil fuel , he says .
" The cure could be worse than the disease . "
He is particularly scathing of Al Gore 's call for a total ban on fossil fuels in a decade , which would be a disaster , leading to millions of people being driven into poverty .
The views are certainly contrarian .
But there are some eminent scientists among the contributors , including Dr Syun - Ichi Akasofu , former director of the International Arctic Research Centre and Prof Richard Lindzen , an atmospheric physicist from MIT , both of whom are sceptics .
The authority of all the arguments will be severely tested .
One is mindful of Martin Durkin 's controversial The Great Global Warming Swindle for Channel 4 that set about debunking global warming as an overstated theory .
The film was criticised by the UK TV regulator ( Ofcom ) for inaccuracies , and the Ofcom decision gave Durkin 's critics a field day in attacking the credibility of his film .
Do McElhinney and McAleer themselves reject climate change , reject the need to cut down on our dependency on oil ?
" The idea that CO2 causes climate change or causes global warming - let 's keep it clear - is not settled , " says McElhinney .
" The idea of dramatically altering the way we live would be a mistake until more information has been gathered . "
Both believe that there is no panic , and that the world has 300 years ( until coal is exhausted ) to come up with alternative sources of energy .
They are right about one thing - it will be very controversial .
Their arguments will be unremittingly scrutinised , leaving only two possible outcomes : the film will debunk and expose , or be itself debunked and exposed .
A new experiment may have found the first direct evidence of dark matter particles , a discovery that could begin to unravel one of the biggest mysteries in physics .
Theorists believe that dark matter , made up of of weakly - interacting massive particles , composes 23 percent of the universe , but no one has ever directly detected one of these WIMPs .
Now , physicists have announced they 've spotted electrons with just about the amount of energy they would have expected to be made by a particular kind of WIMP entering the visible world .
John Wefel of Louisiana State University and colleagues report in Nature Wednesday that they could have detected " Kaluza - Klein " electron - positron pairs resulting from the annihilation of these WIMPS .
The KK particles are predicted by multiple - dimension theories of the universe and have long - been a leading candidate as the substance of dark matter .
The new discovery then , if confirmed , would provide evidence that the fabric of space - time has many " compact " dimensions beyond the four that humans perceive .
" If the Kaluza–Klein annihilation explanation proves to be correct , this will necessitate a fuller investigation of such multidimensional spaces , with potentially important implications for our understanding of the Universe , " the authors conclude .
Dozens of teams are working to understand the invisible dark matter and dark energy that when combined astrophysicists believe make up 95 percent of the universe .
Most of the evidence for the dark stuff 's existence comes through indirect observations : as physicist Myungkook James Jee put it last year , " We ca n't see a wind , but we can see it blow . "
So , the first direct detection of dark matter would be a landmark discovery .
Wefel 's team sent a balloon carrying the " ATIC " particle detector aloft over Antarctica , where it measured the telltale charges and energies of electrons .
But the new detection is n't a sure indication of the existence of KK
particles .
Harvard astrophysicist Yousaf Butt argued that other astronomical objects could explain the creation of these high - energy electrons , in an editorial that accompanied the original paper .
The leftovers from supernovas , spinning pulsars , or microquasars could all be responsible for the observations , or things could get even stranger .
" And let ’s not forget that a completely new type of astrophysical object could also produce the detected electron excess ; after all , pulsars were discovered only in 1967 , and until 1992 we were blissfully unaware of microquasars , " he wrote .
Further experiments seem likely to reveal the true source of this cosmic electron anomaly .
With longer observation times or better detectors , scientists should be able to puzzle out whether the spectral signature of the detected electrons fits the dark matter thesis .

Did you know that the Empire State Building was a built in a race between Chrysler and General Motors on who could build the taller building ?
Or that when the Sydney Opera House design was selected , the technology to build it had n't existed yet ?
Here are the origins of 5 of the world 's most iconic buildings : Empire State Building
Building the Empire State Building , by Lewis Hine ( 1930 ) : " Old - timer , -- keeping up with the boys .
Many structural workers are above middle - age . "
The Chrysler building can be seen in the background .
As it turns out , New York City 's most recognizable landmark was born out of a rivalry between two American car companies .
At the height of the Great Depression , nobody dealing in large , expensive , luxury objects was doing very good business .
So , rather than settle their differences in the marketplace , the CEOs of General Motors and Chrysler opted to see who could build a taller building in downtown Manhattan .
( We 're sure this made perfect sense at the time . )
Walter Chrysler , as you 've probably guessed , had the Chrysler Building built as his avatar .
John Jakob Raskob , the founder of General Motors , opted to join forces with the owners of DuPont Chemicals not just to build the world 's tallest building , but also to build it as fast as humanly possible .
They broke ground in March of 1930 and , using a force of 3,000 workers , were able to have the entire 102 - story buildings finished and opened to the public just a year and two months later .
Arguably , you could say that General Motors won that round .
The White House
Earliest known daguerrotype of the White House , taken by John Plumbe ( 1846 ) George Washington got the shaft .
Sure , he got to be our nation 's first president , got to work with urban planner Pierre L'Enfant on the design for Washington , D.C. , and got to be part of the committee that chose the winner of the 1792 " Design Your New Leader 's House " contest ( architect James Hoban , who won $ 500 for his troubles ) - but , despite all that , the man never got to enjoy the fruits of his labor .
The White House was n't completed until 1800 , just in time for Washington to step down and the newly elected President John Adams to move in .
Unfair .
In all honesty , however , living in the White House has n't always been an exercise in luxury .
When the Adamses moved in there were n't any amenities like the swimming pool , bowling alley , and movie theater that grace the current mansion .
In fact , there was n't even running water .
Servants had to carry the president 's H2O in buckets from a spring five blocks away .
Worse , the building was still somewhat under construction , so the " yard " was essentially a pile of dirt and mud ; the lamps had n't been hung yet , forcing the Adamses to get by with randomly placed candles ; and much of the interior finishings had yet to be installed - including the main staircases !
For a while , the Adamses and their guests had to climb upstairs via temporary wooden steps and platforms .
Things got a little better over the years , but when your home repair and improvement budget has to be allocated by Congress , it 's hardly a surprise that your house is bound to end up falling apart .
By the time the Trumans had settled in , in the late 1940s , things had gotten so bad that some politicians had suggested tearing the building down and starting from scratch .
In fact , according to legend , the president decided that the White House officially needed a major renovation when he found his bathtub was sinking into the floor .
Between 1948 and 1952 , the White House went through a major , " This Old House " style overhaul .
As a result , President Truman and his family spent most of their term living across the street .

How 's this for an audacious construction plan : when architect Jorn Utzon 's won a contest to design a new opera house in Sydney , Australia , in 1957 , there was no existing building technology capable of bringing his plan to life .
Seriously .
Out of the 300 + designs the government of New South Wales had to choose from , they picked the one that literally could n't be built .
Now , this might seem like a good reason to scrap the idea , but the plucky Australian government opted to move forward , charging Utzon with finding a way to get his series of soaring roofs off the drawing board and into Sydney .
That part alone took Utzon and a team of engineers more than four years to solve .
But the building 's troubles were n't over .
Given that builders were performing what amounted to an engineering miracle , the costs associated with the construction quickly skyrocketed .
After Utzon figured out how to make his sail roof work , a large portion of the building - already completed - had to be rebuilt to support the ceiling .
In 1966 , the government of New South Wales briefly discussed pulling the plug on the project altogether , rather than deal with a bill that was spiraling out of control .
Luckily , someone came up with the bright idea of letting the People fund the construction .
Not through a tax , mind you , but by lottery .
The Opera House Lottery eventually collected the equivalent of more than $ 101 million U.S. dollars from a series of 496 individual lottery contests - coming extremely close to recouping the building 's entire cost .
Unfortunately , relationships proved more difficult to repair than pocket books .
The working partnership between Jorn Utzon and the New South Wales government became increasingly strained over the years .
In 1966 , when the politicians threatened to bail , Utzon called their bluff - quitting on his own building .
The task of completing the job - which took another seven years - fell on the shoulder of different architects .
Eiffel Tower
Photos of Eiffel Tower Construction ( Image : L’histoire de la tour Eiffel et sa construction , vues par son architecte , un album publié en 1900 ) Believe it or not , the Eiffel Tower was originally supposed to be in Barcelona .
But thinking the thing would end up looking like an eyesore , the city rejected Gustave Eiffel 's plans , and he was forced to repitch the project elsewhere .
Luckily , Eiffel found a home for his idea in Paris , where the Tower could serve as the main archway for the 1889 International Exposition .
Amazingly , the Tower did n't exactly go over well with the Parisians , either .
The enormous iron structure was immediately belittled by critics , and one especially harsh reviewer referred to the thing as a " metal asparagus . "
Truth be told , the Eiffel Tower was n't supposed to stay up for very long .
In fact , it was offered for sale as scrap and was spared only because it proved useful to the French army .
( they found that its 984 - foot height worked nicely as a communications tower . )
Thankfully , however , Gustave Eiffel 's terrible , horrible , no good , very bad structure has managed to endure ; the structure received its 200 millionth visitor in 2002 , and has become one of the world 's most recognizable man-made landmarks the world over .

Legend has it that once the construction of the Taj Mahal was complete ( c. 1648 ) , the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had his architect blinded .
Apparently , the Shah wanted to ensure that the designer could never again create a structure was beautiful as the tomb he'd built for his wife Mumtaz .
Just to be on the safe side , though , Shah Jahan also cut off the architect 's hands .

Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet
WASHINGTON -- NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander has ceased communications after operating for more than five months .
As anticipated , seasonal decline in sunshine at the robot 's arctic landing site is not providing enough sunlight for the solar arrays to collect the power necessary to charge batteries that operate the lander 's instruments .
Mission engineers last received a signal from the lander on Nov. 2 .
Phoenix , in addition to shorter daylight , has encountered a dustier sky , more clouds and colder temperatures as the northern Mars summer approaches autumn .
The mission exceeded its planned operational life of three months to conduct and return science data .
The project team will be listening carefully during the next few weeks to hear if Phoenix revives and phones home .
However , engineers now believe that is unlikely because of the worsening weather conditions on Mars .
While the spacecraft 's work has ended , the analysis of data from the instruments is in its earliest stages .
" Phoenix has given us some surprises , and I 'm confident we will be pulling more gems from this trove of data for years to come , " said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
Launched Aug. 4 , 2007 , Phoenix landed May 25 , 2008 , farther north than any previous spacecraft to land on the Martian surface .
The lander dug , scooped , baked , sniffed and tasted the Red Planet 's soil .
Among early results , it verified the presence of water - ice in the Martian subsurface , which NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter first detected remotely in 2002 .
Phoenix 's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth .
" Phoenix not only met the tremendous challenge of landing safely , it accomplished scientific investigations on 149 of its 152 Martian days as a result of dedicated work by a talented team , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
Phoenix 's preliminary science accomplishments advance the goal of studying whether the Martian arctic environment has ever been favorable for microbes .
Additional findings include documenting a mildly alkaline soil environment unlike any found by earlier Mars missions ; finding small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life ; discovering perchlorate salt , which has implications for ice and soil properties ; and finding calcium carbonate , a marker of effects of liquid water .
Phoenix findings also support the goal of learning the history of water on Mars .
These findings include excavating soil above the ice table , revealing at least two distinct types of ice deposits ; observing snow descending from clouds ; providing a mission - long weather record , with data on temperature , pressure , humidity and wind ; observations of haze , clouds , frost and whirlwinds ; and coordinating with NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to perform simultaneous ground and orbital observations of Martian weather .
" Phoenix provided an important step to spur the hope that we can show Mars was once habitable and possibly supported life , " said Doug McCuistion , director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" Phoenix was supported by orbiting NASA spacecraft providing communications relay while producing their own fascinating science .
With the upcoming launch of the Mars Science Laboratory , the Mars Program never sleeps .
" The University of Arizona leads the Phoenix mission with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin Corporation in Denver .
International contributions came from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus in Denmark ; the Max Planck Institute in Germany ; the Finnish Meteorological Institute ; and Imperial College of London .

OK ... this one looked funnier in my head at 3 in the morning .
27 December 1837 Revolutions are never sudden .
Not one man , nor many men , in a few years or generations , suffice to regulate events , and dispose mankind for the revolutionary movement .
The hero is but the crowning stone of the pyramid — the keystone of the arch .
Who was Romulus or Remus , Hengist or Horsa , that we should attribute to them Rome or England ?
They are famous or infamous because the progress of events has chosen to make them its stepping - stones .
But we would know where the avalanche commenced , or the hollow in the rock whence springs the Amazon .
The most important is apt to be some silent and unobtrusive fact in history .
In 449 three Saxon cyules arrived on the British coast — “ Three scipen gode comen mid than flode , three hundred cnihten ” —
The pirate of the British coast was no more the founder of a state than the scourge of the German shore .
14 March 1838
Every proverb in the newspapers originally stood for a truth .
Thus the proverb that man was made for society , so long as it was not allowed to conflict with another important truth , deceived no one ; but , now that the same words have come to stand for another thing , it may be a for a lie , we are obliged , in order to preserve its significance , to write it anew , so that properly it will read , Society was made for man . …
The mass never comes up to the standard of its best member , but on the contrary degrades itself to a level with the lowest .
As the reformers say , it is a levelling down , not up .
Hence the mass is only another name for the mob .
The inhabitants of the earth assembled in one place would constitute the greatest mob .
The mob is spoken of as an insane and blinded animal ; magistrates say it must be humored ; they apprehend it may incline this way or that , as villagers dread an inundation , not knowing whose land may be flooded , nor how many bridges carried away .
…
In obedience to an instinct of their nature men have pitched their cabins and planted corn and potatoes within speaking distance of one another , and so formed towns and villages , but they have not associated , they have only assembled , and society has signified only a convention of men .
December 1839
Men have made war from a deeper instinct than peace .
War is but the compelling of peace .
When the world is declared under martial law , every Esau retakes his birthright , and what there is in him does not fail to appear .
He wipes off all old scores and commences a new account .
The world is interested to know how any soul will demean itself in so novel a position .
But when war too , like commerce and husbandry , gets to be a routine , and men go about it as indented apprentices , the hero degenerates into a marine , and the standing army into a standing jest .
No pains are spared to do honor to the brave soldier .
All guilds and corporations are taxed to provide him with fit harness and equipment .
His coat must be red as the sunset , or blue as the heavens .
Gold or silver , pinchbeck or copper , solid or superficial , mark him for fortune ’s favorite .
The skill of a city enchases and tempers his sword - blade ; the Tyrian dye confounds him with emperors and kings .
Wherever he goes , music precedes and prepares the way for him .
His life is a holiday , and the contagion of his example unhinges the universe .
The world puts by work and comes out to stare .
He is the one only man .
He recognizes no time - honored casts and conventions , no fixtures but transfixtures , no governments at length settled on a permanent basis .
One tap of the drum sets the political and moral harmonies all ajar .
His ethics may well bear comparison with the priest ’s .
He may rally , charge , retreat in an orderly manner , but never flee nor flinch .
( The soldier is the degenerate hero , as the priest is the degenerate saint ; and the soldier and the priest are related as the hero and saint .
The one ’s virtue is bravery , the other ’s bravery virtue .
Mankind still pay to the soldier the honors due only to the hero .
They delight to do him honor .
He is adorned with silver and gold and the colors of the rainbow , invested with outward splendor ; music is for him especially , and his life is a holiday . )
12 February 1840
The ring - leader of the mob will soonest be admitted into the councils of state .
14 May 1840
War is the sympathy of concussion .
We would fain rub one against another .
Its rub may be friction merely , but it would rather be titillation .
We discover in the quietest scenes how faithfully war has copied the moods of peace .
Men do not peep into heaven but they see embattled hosts there .
Milton ’s heaven was a camp .
When the sun bursts through the morning fog I seem to hear the din of war louder than when his chariot thundered on the plains of Troy .
Every man is a warrior when he aspires .
He marches on his post .
The soldier is the practical idealist ; he has no sympathy with matter , he revels in the annihilation of it .
So do we all at times .
When a freshet destroys the works of man , or a fire consumes them , or a Lisbon earthquake shakes them down , our sympathy with persons is swallowed up in a wider sympathy with the universe .
A crash is apt to grate agreeably on our ears .
30 June 1840 I have a deep sympathy with war , it so apes the gait and bearing of the soul .
4 July 1840 4 o’clock , A.M. The Townsend Light Infantry encamped last night in my neighbor ’s inclosure .
The night still breathes slumberously over field and wood , when a few soldiers gather about one tent in the twilight , and their band plays an old Scotch air , with bugle and drum and fife attempered to the season .
It seems like the morning hymn of creation .
The first sounds of the awakening camp , mingled with the chastened strains which so sweetly salute the dawn , impress me as the morning prayer of an army .
And now the morning gun fires .
The soldier awakening to creation and awakening it .
I am sure none are cowards now .
These strains are the roving dreams which steal from tent to tent , and break forth into distinct melody .
They are the soldier ’s morning thought .
Each man awakes himself with lofty emotions , and would do some heroic deed .
You need preach no homily to him ; he is the stuff they are made of .
The whole course of our lives should be analogous to one day of the soldier ’s .
His Genius seems to whisper in his ear what demeanor is befitting , and in his bravery and his march he yields a blind and partial obedience .
30 July 1840
No fresher tints than this morning ’s witnessed the valor of Hector and Idomeneus , and some such evening as this the Greek fleet came to anchor in the bay of Aulis ; but alas ; it is not to us the eve of a ten years ’ war , but of a sixty years ’ idleness and defeat .
Our peace is proclaimed by the rust on our swords , and our inability to draw them from their scabbards —
She does not so much work as to keep these swords bright and sharp .
Let not ours be such nonresistance as the chaff that rides before the gale .
31 July 1840
The very dogs that sullenly bay the moon from farm yards o’ these nights , evince more heroism than is tamely barked forth in all the civil exhortations and war sermons of the age .
Our actions should make the stars forget their sphere music , and chant an elegiac strain — that heroism should have departed out of their ranks , and gone over to humanity .
If want of patriotism be objected to us , because we hold ourselves aloof from the din of politics , I know of no better answer than that of Anaxagoras to those who in like case reproached him with indifference to his country because he had withdrawn from it , and devoted himself to the search after truth —
“ On the contrary , ” he replied pointing to the heavens , “ I esteem it infinitely . ”
My country is free — my country ’tis of thee sweet land of liberty to thee I sing .
July / August 1840
The brave man is the elder son of creation , who steps buoyantly into his inheritance , while the coward , who is the younger , waits patiently till he decease .
He is that sixth champion against Thebes , whom , when the proud devices of the rest have been recorded , the poet describes as “ bearing a full - orbed shield of solid brass . ”
“ But there was no device upon its circle ,
For not to seem just but to be is his wish . ” …
Our task is not such a piece of day labor that a [ man ] must be thinking what he shall do next for a livelihood , but such that as it began in endeavor , so it will end only when nothing in heaven or on earth , remains to be endeavored .
Of such sort then be our crusade , that , while it inclines chiefly to the heartiness and activity of war , rather than the insincerity and sloth of peace , it may set an example to both of calmness and energy ; we will be as unconcerned for victory as careless of defeat , not seeking to lengthen our term of service , nor to cut it short by a reprieve , but earnestly applying ourselves to the campaign before us .
Nor let our warfare be a boorish and uncourteous one , but a higher courtesy attend its higher chivalry , though not to the slackening of its sterner duties and severer discipline — that so our camp may be a palaestra for the exercise of the dormant energies of men .
Methink I hear the clarion sound , and the clang of corselet and buckler from many a silent hamlet of the soul .
The morning gun has long since sounded , and we are not yet at our posts .
The age is resigned .
Everywhere it sounds a retreat , and the word has gone forth to fall back on innocence .
Christianity only hopes .
It has hung its harp on the willow and cannot sing a song in a strange land .
It has dreamed a sad dream and does not yet welcome the morning with joy .
…
Let us hear no more of peace at present —
There is more of it in fiercest war than any Amiens or Utrecht ever compounded .
We have need to be as sturdy pioneers still as Miles Standish or Church .
We are to follow on another trail , perhaps , but one as convenient for ambushes , and with not so much as a moccasin print to guide us .
What if the Indians are exterminated ?
Do not savages as grim defile down into the clearing to - day ?
The danger is that we be exterminated .
12 August 1840
A brave soul will make these peaceful times dangerous — and dangerous times peaceful . …
When with pale cheek and sunken eye I sang
Unto the slumbering world at midnights hour ,
How it no more resounded with war ’s clang ,
And virtue was decayed in Peace ’s bower ;
How in these days no hero was abroad ,
But puny men , afraid of war ’s alarms ,
Stood forth to fight the battles of their Lord ,
Who scarce could stand beneath a hero ’s arms ;
A faint , reproachful , reassuring strain ,
From some harp ’s strings touched by unskilful hands
Brought back the days of chivalry again ,
And the surrounding fields made holy lands .
A bustling camp and an embattled host
Extending far on either hand I saw ,
For I alone had slumbered at my post ,
Dreaming of peace when all around was war .
13 August 1840
We do not avoid evil by hurry - skurry and fleetness in extenso , but by rising above or diving below its plane .
As the worm escapes drought and frost , by boring a few inches deeper , but the grasshopper is overtaken and destroyed —
By our suppleness and speed we only fly before an evil , by the height or depth of our characters we avoid it .
19 August 1840 Sir Thomas
Overbury , who says that Raleigh followed the sherriff out of court “ with admirable erection , but yet in such a sort as became a man condemned , ” has a share in that exploit by his discernment .
We admire equally him who could do the deed , and him could see it done .
21 August 1840
The humane society will not make the hunter despicable so soon as the butcher nor the grouse shooter so soon as he who kills sparrows —
I feel great respect for the English deer stalker on reading that “ ‘ His muscles must be of marble , and his sinews of steel . ’
He must not only ‘ run like the antelope , and breathe like the trade wind ; ’ but he must be able ‘ to run in a stooping position with a grey - hound pace , having his back parallel to the ground , and his face within an inch of it for miles together . ’
He must have a taste for running , like an eel through sand , ventre à terre , and he should be accomplished in ‘ skilfully squeezing his clothes after this operation , to make all comfortable . ’ ”
21 September 1840
In the old Chinese book which the French call “ L’ Invariable Milieu ” occurs this sentence — “ L’ordre ètablie par le ciel s’appelle nature ; ce qui est conforme à la nature s’appelle loi ; l’etablissement de la loi s’appelle instruction . ”
God ’s order is nature — man ’s order is law — and the establishment of law is the subject of instruction .
25 September 1840 Defeat is heaven ’s success .
He can not be said to succeed to whom the world shows any favor .
In fact it is the hero ’s point d’appui , which by offering resistance to his action enables him to act at all .
At each step he spurns the world .
He vaults the higher in proportion as he employs the greater resistance of the earth .
It is fatal when an elevation has been gained by too wide a concession — retaining no point of resistance , for then the hero like the aeronaut , must float at the mercy of the winds — or cannot sail for calmer weather , nor steer himself for want of waves to his rudder .
When we rise to the step above , we tread hardest on the step below .
4 October 1840 Every countryman and dairymaid knows that the coats of the fourth stomach of the calf will curdle milk — and what particular mushroom is a safe and nutritious diet .
You can not go into any field or wood but it will seem as if every stone had been turned , and the bark on every tree ripped up .
Surely men are busy and knowing enough after their fashion .
One would suppose that he who had counted the eyes of a fly and the nerves of a caterpillar , must have learned the whole duty of man in his youth .
But alas , it is easier to make a white rose black , or pears grow on an apple tree , than to do one ’s duty for five minutes .
It is vastly easier to discover than to see when the cover is off .
11 October 1840
It is always easy to infringe the law — but the Bedouin of the desert find it impossible to resist public opinion .
The traveller Stevens had the following conversation with a Bedouin of Mount Sinai .
“ I asked him who governed them ; he stretched himself up and answered in one word , ‘ God . ’
I asked him if they paid tribute to the pasha ; and his answer was , ‘ No , we take tribute from him . ’
I asked him how .
‘ We plunder his caravans . ’
Desirous to understand my exact position with the sheik of Akaba , under his promise of protection , I asked him if they were governed by their sheik ; to which he answered , ‘ No , we govern him . ’ ”
25 October 1840
To yield bravely is infinitely harder than to resist bravely .
In the one course our sin assists us to be brave , in the other our virtue is alone .
True bravery has no ally yet all things are with it .
18 December 1840 I find Gibbon to have been less a man and more of a student that I had anticipated — I had supposed him a person of more genius with as much learning , more an enthusiast than a pedant , better fitted to influence an active and practical people like the English , than to lead in a German School .
He had very little greatness .
His Roman History , by his own confession , was undertaken from no higher motive than the love of fame .
In his religious views he did not differ nobly from mankind , but rather apologized and conformed .
He was ambitious and vain .
It was a quite paltry ambition that inspired his first Essay — his observations on the Ænead , and the Decline and Fall — and vanity inspired his memoirs of his own life .
In his letters he was more literary than social , they are moments grudgingly given to his friends , whom he kept in pay to inform him how that world went on from which he had retired .
I hear him smack his lips at the prospect of a pipe of wine to be sent from England to Lausanne .
There is not recorded of him , that I know , a single reckless and heroic action , which would have been worth a thousand histories .
That would have been to Rise and Stand .
He withdrew into retirement in Switzerland , not to perfect his culture , but be more at leisure to build up a reputation undisturbed .
He respected and courted the doctors and learned , not the learning .
I think of him only as the laborious ambitious student who wrote the Decline & Fall , during those 56 years — which after all it does not concern me to read .
25 December 1840
The character of Washington has after all been undervalued , simply because not valued correctly .
He was a proper Puritan hero .
It is his erectness and persistency which attract me .
A few simple deeds with a dignified silence for background and that is all .
He never fluctuated , nor lingered , nor stooped , nor swerved , but was nobly silent and assured .
He was not the darling of the people , as no man of integrity can ever be , but was as much respected as loved .
His instructions to his steward — his refusal of a crown — his interviews with his officers at the termination of the war — his thoughts after his retirement , as expressed in a letter to La Fayette — his remarks to another correspondent on his being chosen president — his last words to Congress — and the unparalleled respect which his most distinguished contemporaries — as Fox and Erskine , expressed for him — are refreshing to read in these unheroic days .
His behavior in the field and in council , and his dignified and contented withdrawal to private life — were great .
He could advance and he could withdraw .
But we are not sorry he is dead .
The bike just goes poof
Dad ran off with Liz Taylor , Cary Grant lectured me about drugs , George Lucas ruined my life :
The extraordinary autobiography of CARRIE FISHER
Galaxy goddess : Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in 1983's Star Wars : Return Of The Jedi
I am truly a product of Hollywood in - breeding .
When two celebrities mate , someone like me is the result .
I was born on October 21 , 1956 in Burbank , California .
My father , Eddie Fisher , was a famous singer .
My mother , Debbie Reynolds , was a movie star .
Her best - known role was in Singin ' In The Rain .
In the Fifties , my parents were known as ' America 's sweethearts ' .
Their pictures graced the covers of all the newspapers .
They were the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston of their day .
When I was born , my mother was given an anaesthetic because they did n't have epidurals in those days .
Consequently , she was unconscious .
Now , my mother is a beautiful woman - she 's beautiful today in her 70s , so at 24 she looked like a Christmas morning .
All the doctors were buzzing round her pretty head , saying : ' Oh , look at Debbie Reynolds asleep - how pretty . '
And my father , upon seeing me start to arrive , fainted .
So all the nurses ran over saying : ' Oh look , there 's Eddie Fisher , the crooner , on the ground .
Let 's go look at him .'
So when I arrived I was virtually unattended .
And I have been trying to make up for that fact ever since .
My parents had this incredibly vital relationship with an audience , like muscle with blood .
This was the main competition I had for my parents ' attention , an audience .
Mom and Dad were great friends with Elizabeth Taylor and her husband Mike Todd .
Mike died in a plane crash in 1958 , when I was two , and my dad flew to Elizabeth 's side , making his way slowly to her front .
He first dried her eyes with his handkerchief , then he consoled her with flowers , and he ultimately consoled her by sleeping with her .
This made marriage to my mother awkward , so he was gone within the week .
If Mom and Dad were Jennifer and Brad , then Elizabeth Taylor was Angelina Jolie .
I saw more of Dad on television than in real life .
He later wrote his autobiography , Been There , Done That - well , he called it an autobiography , but I thought of it more as a novel .
I like to call it Been There , Done Them , because it really was just about the women he'd slept with and how the sex was and what their bodies were like ( so it is a feelgood read ) .
But after I read it , I wanted to get my DNA fumigated .
Anyway , Dad 's absence meant my younger brother Todd and I were brought up by our mother in our modern house , which I called ' the Embassy ' because it looked less like a house than a place you would get your passport stamped .
It had things most normal houses did n't have , such as eight little pink refrigerators and three pools ... you know , in case two broke .
There was also my mother 's closet - which I always thought of as the Church Of Latter - Day Debbie because it was the magical place that she entered as my mom and emerged as Debbie Reynolds .
There was a certain hush , a smell of Albolene cream and White Shoulders perfume .
It was quiet and dark .
Huge , like an enormous room , with an entrance and an exit , it was lined on each side by clothes of every kind : gowns , trousers , blouses , shoes and hat boxes .
There was a long , shimmery , white chest of drawers where she kept her underwear and bras and slips and stockings all neatly folded up and smelling of perfumed sachets .
My mother 's closet was n't off - limits , but it was very much hers , therefore Todd and I valued it .
It was prized because of how highly we prized our mother .
She was often away , and when we missed her we could go into her closet and put our faces into her clothes and inhale the powdery , flowery scent of her .
Hair - brained idea : Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia - complete with the bizarre coiffure dreamed up by George Lucas - in 1977 's Star Wars : A New Hope
When my mother was at home at weekends , we stayed with her as much as possible , which frequently meant we watched her dress and make herself up .
Next to her closet there was a huge bathroom with magenta marble and mirrors everywhere .
She 'd twirl her hair up into pincurls that she 'd use to pull her face tighter , then she 'd put on her make - up base with a sponge .
Then she applied eye make - up and false lashes , so she did n't need mascara , but there was lots of eyeliner .
Next came lipstick and rouge and powder - great puffs of glittering clouds of powder , followed by hair , which was a big deal , getting the wig on right .
Then came the earrings , then she 'd step into her clothes , and then came her stockings and her tiny shoes .
When she was finished , her Debbie Reynolds movie - star accent got stronger , her posture got better and she looked incredibly beautiful .
Undressing was also a process my brother and I observed .
First we'd watch as she removed her make - up with a wash cloth , then she'd have a bubble bath .
Debbie Reynolds would slowly return to being our mother .
The coach was once more a pumpkin , the footmen went back to being mice .
We loved to be with her when she resumed her role as our mother .
She was so beautiful , and I dreamed of looking like her one day .
I think it was when I was ten that I realised with profound certainty that I would not be , and was in no way now , the beauty that my mother was .
I was a clumsy - looking and intensely awkward , insecure girl .
I decided then that I 'd better develop something else - if I was n't going to be pretty , maybe I could be funny or smart .
When Mom was at home , she did a lot of sleeping because she worked so hard , so Todd and I wanted as much of her company as we could get .
I slept on the rug on the floor next to her bed , and my brother slept on the couch near the window .
In the morning when Todd and I got up , we would creep out of her room so we would n't wake her .
It was complicated to go out in public with my mother because she was so famous .
She belonged to the world .
It was like being in a parade .
' Oh my God , ' people would say to her , ' I loved you in Molly Brown . '
Or : ' I saw you in Vegas . '
So it was not like having private - time with Mom .
And I did n't like sharing her .
The first time I took drugs was when I was 13 .
My family had a holiday house in Palm Springs , about two hours from Beverly Hills , where I grew up .
Periodically , my mother used to rent the Palm Springs house out to some people who , after one of their stays , left behind a bag of marijuana .
Three 's a crowd : Eddie Fisher left his wife Debbie Reynolds , right , for Elizabeth Taylor in 1958
My mother came to me and said : ' Dear , I thought instead of you smoking pot where you might get caught and get in trouble - I thought you and I might experiment with it together . '
At the time , and let 's face it - even now - I could n't imagine anything weirder .
But my mother got swept back up in the whirlwind of her life and forgot about the idea .
Once it became obvious our proposed experiment had slipped her mind , I snuck into her underwear drawer and stole the pot , subsequently experimenting my brains out in my tree house .
I must have enjoyed it because I ended up experimenting with marijuana for the next six years until it suddenly turned on me .
Where at the onset it was all giggles and floating in a friendly haze , it suddenly became creepy , dark and scary .
I needed to find a replacement drug .
This was when I was about 19 , while I was filming Star Wars .
So , after carefully casting about for a substitute substance , I finally settled on hallucinogens and painkillers .
You know how they say that religion is the opiate of the masses ?
Well , I took masses of opiates religiously .
At a certain point in my early 20s , my mother started to worry about my obviously ever - increasing drug ingestion .
So she ended up doing what any concerned parent would do .
She called Cary Grant .
In the Sixties , Mr Grant famously did a course of LSD while under a doctor 's supervision .
So my concerned and caring mother told him that her daughter had a problem with acid and asked him to call me .
Asking a fellow star to intervene in my life seemed normal to my mother .
Some years later , I was in London en route to my mother 's wedding to Richard Hamlett , her third husband ( I do n't like to miss any of my parents ' weddings ) .
She called me at my hotel , and when I did n't answer she became concerned .
So she let the phone ring and ring - until finally she panicked .
She knew I was in the room so , in her mind , probably the only reason I was n't answering the phone was that I had overdosed .
So she did what any normal concerned mother might do when troubled about her daughter 's well - being .
She called Ava Gardner .
And she asked Ava to make sure I was not dead .
Anyway , I loved Mr Grant .
He was probably the only famous person I was ever really in awe of .
He had it all - an easy - going class , quiet confidence , wit - all in this beyond - handsome package .
So when the phone rang and a familiar voice informed me that he was Cary Grant - even a Cary Grant who was going to give me a ' just say no ' drug lecture - well , initially I was tongue - tied .
Mother 's helper : Cary Grant gave Carrie drugs advice at Debbie Reynolds ' request
But then we began discussing my LSD ' addiction ' , and after a freakishly short time I found myself chatting gaily .
I think I finally convinced him I did n't have an acid problem ( which , for the most part , was true ) .
What I did have was an opiate problem .
When our hour - long chat was up , I bade Mr Grant a grateful goodbye , told all my friends , and end of story .
Or so I thought .
A few years later my father was at Princess Grace 's funeral in Monaco .
My father had never met the woman , but had his own reasons for going .
Publicity .
So he was at the funeral of one of the few beautiful women of his generation he had n't slept with when he spied Mr Grant .
Something clicked in his brain , the dim recollection of a story he'd only recently been told .
What was it again ?
Oh yeah - something to do with his first - born daughter .
He walked up to my hero and said the first thing that popped into his head , something along the lines of : ' My daughter Carrie is addicted to acid , and I 'm very worried .
Would you mind maybe having a talk with her ? '
Poor Mr Grant gets back from the funeral and in due course calls me again to discuss my drug problem .
If I was embarrassed the first time he called me , this time I was humiliated .
I explained to Mr Grant , after thanking him , that my mother would probably be in a much better position to determine whether or not I was tripping my brain out on a daily basis than my father , with whom I 'd spent , on average , one day a year .
Anyway , Mr Grant and I talked for more than an hour .
It was great .
I immediately bought him a bottle of wine from his birth year , which was something like 1907 , and then he called me again to thank me .
And in that final phone call , I believe he told me : ' I do n't even like wine . '
We 're talking about no less than three calls from Cary Grant .
The guy was practically stalking me .
A few months later , I was at a charity event and found myself just a few feet away from him .
Was I intimidated ?
Yes .
With my heart pounding in my ears , I tapped him on the back , withdrawing my hand immediately as if I burned my finger .
Whereupon Mr Grant turned , and I started backing away from him .
' Hi. I 'm Debbie Reynolds 's daughter .
We talked on the phone ?
I just wanted to say hi . '
' Oh , hello , yes .
How are you ? '
I was still backing away .
' Oh , I 'm fine , ' I whispered .
'
Everything 's great !
Bye !'
And I fled .
In 1986 while I was in Australia doing some terrible film , they announced on the radio that Mr Grant had died .
And I remember getting this pain - the kind you get when you experience a body blow .
When I accidentally took a drug overdose , I frightened myself and threw myself into 12 - step group recovery .
I still attend meetings every week .
I 've had about four or five slips since I first started going to support groups at the age of 28 .
I live next door to my mom now .
She is still a little eccentric .
Whenever she calls she says : ' Hello , dear , this is your mother , Debbie . '
( As opposed to my mother Vladimir or Jean - Jacques . )
My brother and I talk this way to each other now : ' Hello dear , this is your brother , Todd . '
Another example of her eccentricity : she suggested several times that I should have a child with her last husband , Richard , because ' it would have nice eyes ' .
It had n't occurred to her this might be odd .
I think she just thought , you know , my womb was free and we 're family .
A consequence of being the child of celebrities is that ' real life ' is this other thing - we were always trying to determine what was going on in this distant , incomprehensible place .
' Surreal life ' would have been a more appropriate description .
After my second husband , Bryan Lourd , left me , I was invited to go to a psychiatric hospital , and you do n't want to be rude , so you go .
My diagnosis was manic depression - today they call it bipolar disorder .
In many situations you can hardly tell there 's anything wrong with me - I just have too much personality for one person and not quite enough for two .
Periodically , I do explode .
Over time , the explosions have become smaller and the recovery time faster .
The symptoms are sexual promiscuity , excessive spending and substance abuse ( I know - that 's a fantastic weekend in Vegas for some people ) .
Once , in 1997 , I stayed awake for six days when doctors removed my medication after two prescriptions interacted badly .
I wound up psychotic .
I thought everything on television was about me .
I was admitted to the lockdown ward of the Cedars - Sinai hospital in Los Angeles .
When I spoke about my mental illness publicly , I won great acclaim .
I waited my entire life to get an award for something , anything ( OK , fine , not acting , but what about a tiny little award for writing ?
Nope ) , I now get awards for being mentally ill .
I 'm actually in the Abnormal Psychology textbook .
My family is so proud .
When I heard I was in it , I was told it was with a photo .
But it 's not like anyone called me and said : ' Have you got a snapshot of yourself looking depressed or manic ? ' so for years I wondered , what picture ?
Recently I found it .
Anyone who'd wear a hairstyle like that has to be nuts !
Right ?
Lifelong impact : Carrie with Star Wars director George Lucas and co-star Harrison Ford at a 2002 awards ceremony
George gave me this idiotic hairstyle .
I was terrified I 'd be fired , so I said : ' I love it . '
Yeah , right .
George Lucas ruined my life .
And I mean that in the nicest possible way .
Even now , many years later , people are still asking me if I knew Star Wars was going to be that big a hit .
Yes , of course I knew .
We all knew .
The only one who did n't was the director , George Lucas .
We kept it from him because we wanted to see what his face looked like when it changed expression .
Not only was he virtually expressionless in those days , but he also hardly talked at all .
His only two directions in the first film were ' faster ' and ' more intense ' .
Shortly after I arrived , he gave me this unbelievably idiotic hairstyle .
He said in his little voice : ' Well , what do you think of it ? '
I was terrified I was going to be fired for being too fat , so I said : ' I love it . '
Yeah , right .
When I got this great job to end all jobs , which truly I never thought I would get because there were all these other beautiful girls who were up for the part - Amy Irving , Jodie Foster , Teri Nunn - they told me I had to lose 10lb .
I weighed about 105 lb at the time but carried about 50 of those in my face .
So you know what a good idea would be ?
Give me a hairstyle that further widens my already wide face .
Remember the white dress I wore all through that film ?
George came up to me the first day of filming , took one look at the dress and said : ' You ca n't wear a bra under that dress . '
' OK , I 'll bite , ' I said .
' Why ? '
And he said : ' Because ... there 's no underwear in space . '
He said it with such conviction .
Like he had been to space and looked around and he did n't see any bras or panties anywhere .
He explained .
' You go into space and you become weightless .
Then your body expands but your bra does n't , so you get strangled by your own underwear . '
I think that this would make for a fantastic obituary .
I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go , I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight , strangled by my own bra .
Instead of a bra , what do you think I wore for support , intergalactically ?
Gaffer tape .
I used to think there should have been a contest at the end of the day for who in the crew would get to help remove the tape .
George is a sadist .
But despite having to wear a metal bikini , being chained to a giant slug ( Jabba the Hutt ) and often being about to die , I kept coming back for more .
Why , you might ask .
Well , George is a visionary , right ?
The man has transported audiences the world over and has provided Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford and myself with enough fan mail - and even a small , merry band of stalkers - to keep us entertained for the rest of our lives .
And do n't forget , George was the man who made me into a little doll .
A doll that one of my exes could stick pins into whenever he was annoyed with me ( I found it in a drawer ) .
He also made me into a shampoo bottle where people could twist off my head and pour liquid out of my neck .
Paging Dr Freud !
And then there was a soap with the slogan : ' Lather up with Leia and you 'll feel like a Princess yourself . '
The nice people at Burger King made me into a watch .
And I 'm a little stumpy Lego thing .
And now there 's even a stamp , which is totally cool .
Among George 's many possessions , he owns my likeness , so that every time I look in the mirror I have to send him a couple of bucks .
That 's partly why he 's so rich .
Fraught : Paul Simon wrote about his difficult marriage to Carrie in his songs
Paul Simon and I had a fight - for 12 years
Let 's recap : Eddie and Debbie have me .
I grow up , sort of , and I marry Paul Simon .
Now Paul is a short , Jewish singer .
Eddie Fisher is a short , Jewish singer .
My mother makes a blueprint , and I follow it to the letter .
Paul and I dated for six years , were married for two , divorced for one , and then we dated again .
We were together for more than 12 years ( off and on ) and we travelled a lot .
The last place we went to was the Amazon , which I recommend if you like mosquitoes .
When we got back , Paul wrote an album called The Rhythm Of The Saints - and on this album is the last song he ever wrote about me - and it's called She Moves On ( an ironic title ) .
Anyway , one of the lyrics of the song goes like this : ' She is like a top / She can not stop . '
So yeah , he knew me .
But the lyric I really wanted to tell you about was this : ' And I 'm afraid that I 'll be taken / Abandoned and forsaken / In her cold coffee eyes ...'
Yep , I 'm a bitch .
Poor Paul .
He had to put up with a lot .
I was good for material , but when it came to day - to - day living , I was more than he could take .
We once had a fight ( on our honeymoon ) where I said : ' Not only do I not like you , I do n't like you personally ! '
We tried to keep the argument going after that but we were laughing too hard .
Once , when I was flying to Los Angeles , we 'd been fighting all morning , so Paul drove me to the airport to get rid of me faster .
As I was about to get on the plane , I said : ' You 'll feel bad if I crash . '
And he shrugged and said : ' Maybe not . '
Todd was shot - and I had to hide the gun
When I was about 16 and my brother Todd was about 14 , my mother took a part in a musical in New York , so we moved there for a year .
I was out one evening when someone told me my mother was on the phone .
' I'm at the hospital with your brother , ' she said .
' He shot himself in the leg with a blank . '
' What ? '
I said .
' He 'll be fine , ' she continued .
' He 's in surgery now .
Anyway , the police are here and they want to come to the house to examine the gun .
' I need you to get to the house before them to let them in , but also I need you to hide all the guns and bullets and - what else ...
Oh yes !
I need you to flush your brother 's marijuana down the lavatory . '
Who knew we had bullets and guns in the house ?
They were my stepfather 's show guns that he wore in some Christmas parade years back , but we were suddenly more like a mafia family than a showbusiness one .
So I rushed home and hid the guns and bullets and flushed an enormous plastic bag filled with pot .
It was Saturday night and you would think that this would n't be a particularly slow night for crime in New York .
But you would n't know it looking at our living room because we had five policemen milling around , asking my mother pertinent questions such as : ' Did you know John Wayne ?
What kind of guy was he ? '
Finally they told us they had established the gun could discharge live ammo , so my mother was in possession of an unlicensed firearm and had to go to the police station .
We got home just before 6 am and there was a knock at the door .
Mom went to see who it was and came back laughing .
' It was a couple of reporters , ' she said .
' They heard Todd had been shot in the leg and they wanted to know if I had done it for publicity for the show .
I so badly wanted to tell them , " Yes , and now I can only do one more Broadway musical because I only have one child left to shoot for publicity . " '

Mammoths are already dead for centuries , and most of their remains are being found in the deep frozen soil of Siberian regions .
Just some of them are used for scientific research , thousands more are being used by locals for carving .
The whole carving art has been formed for many years of finding those mammoth remains .
They do n’t have ivory but plenty of this prehistoric material so it has become good substitute for the carving craft .

The incredible territorial fight between two raging hippo bulls
Exploding out of the water with ferocious rage these giant male hippos cast a frightening sight as they fight over a water hole in South Africa .
Captured by professional guide and wildlife photographer Hendrik Fehsenfeld , in South Africa 's Ngala Private Game Reserve in September , this amazing sequence of photographs show just why these one ton animals should never be crossed .
' This was the first time I had witnessed a hippo fight , so close and personal , ' said Fehsenfeld , 40 .
The one tonne animals reveal their strength in their ferocious fight
' I was giving a tour to some guests on the game viewing vehicle and we were in a sort of stunned disbelief .
' I approached with caution as aggression may divert towards the vehicle .
' When it became clear that these bulls were oblivious to our presence I crept in to get these amazing shots . '
' Looking at the photographs it seems that the bulls are of different ages , ' he said .
' This can be seen by examining the condition of the teeth , in particular , the incisors and canines .
The challenger appeared to be the younger of the two . '
The two male hippos were fighting over territory in a diminishing waterhole
Fehsenfeld , who has been a guide for seven years , explained that the violent encounter was the result of a territorial battle during the notoriously difficult dry season when water is scarce .
' There are many factors that play into the eruption of a serious fight ; the two most common factors being territory and mating rights .
' Dominant hippo bulls do have territories which they will defend .
This flight erupted when this younger bull arrived at the water - hole already occupied by the older bull , thus trespassing and ignoring him as the territory holder .
' This is equivalent of a direct challenge . '
For the safety of his group , Fehsenfeld only watched the encounter for a few minutes , but returned the following day to see who had claimed the territory .
The splash of blood in the water as the terrifying creatures fight to the death
' The next morning the old bull was gone .
I and tracker Norman found his tracks leaving the water - hole with a blood trail , ' he recalled .
' We followed it until the vegetation got very thick - it 's not wise to follow an injured animal into thick vegetation .
' So maybe he recovered , maybe he found an unoccupied water - hole .
Maybe he lay down in the soothing shade and drifted off .
There was no increase in vulture or hyena activity in the area , so perhaps he made it !'
As FOX News tries to link Obama to all sorts of ridiculous things , Jonathan Alter makes a good point with KO .
ALTER : [ Y ]ou remember the Keating Five scandal that he was a part of , which , by the way , it 's crazy but there 's been very little about it in the press in the last few weeks .
And McCain thinks he 's getting a hard time , he 's really getting a free ride on the fact that he was in the middle of the last great financial scandal in our country .
But his reaction to that , you would have thought , would have been more regulation of the financial services industry .
Instead he moved forward on campaign finance reform after being caught in that scandal , but did nothing - nothing - to try to prevent another savings and loan crisis from happening down the road .
He was missing in action when it came to even learning the basic lessons of a scandal that he said taught him all kinds of things that he would never forget .
Does n't the media believe this is a relevant story being that we 're in a huge economic meltdown ?
Can you imagine the media scrutiny if a Democratic politician had been linked to this scandal and ran for President ?
A new movie called Third Term will be released soon which goes into detail about the whole Keating5 --- John McCain connection .
Please read this post ( with video ) if you missed it and then start demanding that the media cover McCain 's past connection to the Keating 5 scandal and and see if the American people want him to lead them out of the economic chaos we 're facing today ...
It was the biggest S&L scandal in American history at that time ...
NARRATION : All of this corporate influence should remind you a bit of a previous tale in the McCain saga , his involvement with the Keating 5 .
Charles Keating was a sort of mentor of John McCain , donating vast sums of money to his senate campaigns .
DAVID DONNELLY : Charles Keating helped out Senator McCain a lot in the early part of his career .
… Senator McCain was the closest of any of the Keating Five to Charles Keating .
NARRATION : But Keating was in trouble .
His company , Lincoln Savings and Loan , was making a lot of risky investments , and the government was investigating .
ANDREA MITCHELL : Keating raised $ 1.3 million for them .
They challenged regulators who were investigating his operations .
NARRATION : So Keating called some of his old pals in the Senate to put a little pressure on the government regulator and get them off his back .
McCain accepted .
NARRATION : Lincoln collapsed , leading to a bailout of $ 2.8 billion in taxpayer money .
Keating went to prison for four years .
McCain was only chastised on the Senate floor .
DAVID DONNELLY : … people who lost life savings through the scandal .
There were , people who… pensioners who lost their money because those savings and loans went belly - up .
Unprecedented numbers : over 36 % of the total 2004 vote .
And a very heavy black turnout .
I really do n't think we have fully absorbed what a massive - and I mean massive - black turnout could do in this election .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

It is impossible to walk through the produce sections of the commissaries on base without seeing bellies or newborns in car seats .
“ Overseas , our soldiers concentrate on their mission , ” said Tom McCollum , the public affairs officer for Fort Bragg , which occupies the north and west sides of Fayetteville .
“ But they ca n’t wait to get back home . ”
At Dads 101 , a class for new and soon - to - be fathers that helps ease the transition from soldier to caretaker , attendance has doubled .
Maternity - size Army combat uniforms in the digitized , sand - patterned camouflage used in Iraq and Afghanistan are on backorder at the base clothing sales store .
And in anticipation of growing demand for home visits and other family services , the base ’s New Parents Support Program has increased its staff from 5 to 19 .
Baby furniture is selling so quickly at the Target on Skibo Road , a few miles southeast of the base , that pregnant women are despairing when they cannot find matching cribs , dressers and changing tables .
“ They ’ll be , like , ‘ I just called and y’all said you had it , ’ " said Tyneisha McRae , a clerk working the night shift , when the infant department gets restocked .
The store opens at 8 a.m. , she said , “ and most of the time , we ’re sold out by 8:30 or 9 . ”
Lisa Olivares , a manager at CCE Headgear Plus , a kiosk at the mall that offers custom embroidery , has been inundated with requests to stitch unit crests and nicknames onto baby onesies , polka - dot bonnets and camouflage diaper bags .
“ It ’s all I do , ” she said .
Soldiers have noticed the boom among their ranks .
“ Four females in my unit have had babies , ” said Staff Sgt. Bill McSwain , as he held his own new daughter , Gabrielle , in his lap in the waiting room of the Ob - Gyn clinic at Womack .
Doctors , nurses and midwives at the clinic were among the first to feel the impact of the surge , as demand for prenatal appointments began to overwhelm the staff members at the beginning of the summer .
As women poured in to the facility , which now has pastel streamers with hearts dangling from its windows , the medicine cabinets began running low on progesterone , used to treat early labor .
With only 11 beds , Womack ’s labor and delivery unit quickly filled up and administrators capped the patient load at 260 deliveries a month  but soon exceeded that number .
Nearly 300 babies were born in August , and 261 in September .
As we speak the heavyweights of the Republican Party are meeting to discuss how to recover from the debacle ( for the Republicans that is ) that was to 2008 election .
Their goal will be to figure out how they can win national elections again .
I wonder if they will even consider the advice of Ron Paul .
Certainly , they would do well to do so , because I think that absent the newsletter scandal and a couple of other skeletons in his closet Ron Paul could have won the election for the Republicans .
Obama did not win the election .
The Republicans lost it .
Their entire election strategy consisted of trying to scare people away from voting for Obama .
Why did n’t they present a plan or vision of their own that was more comprehensive than the fatuous “ Country First ” slogan ?
Because they did have a plan and it was one that they knew voters did not want .
What voters wanted
There were three major things concerning voters : the economy , the war , and corruption .
1 ) The economy .
The corporatist or steroidal mercantilist policies of the Republican party is collapsing .
Most people do n’t understand why , but recognize that they are being squeezed by rising prices and by falling income .
They want someone to fix it .
2 ) The war .
Most people think the war was mismanaged .
Badly .
They are not pacifists , unfortunately .
Rather , they want someone who is n’t going to reclessly plunge into wars , to try to incite them unecessarily .
3 ) Corruption : Everybody has heard of the “ Bridge to Nowhere ” and the “ Abramof Scandal ” .
They remember “ Heckuva Job Brownie ” ‘s contribution to the Katrina devastation .
They rightly perceive the last 8 years to have been remarkably filled with cronyism and government giveaways to people with pull .
They want that to stop .
What the Republicans Offered :
1 ) The economy : More cronyism !
But with lip service to free markets !
And McCain saying that one moment he did n’t know what he was doing , then grandstanding to get the bailout passed and failing , then complaining about the Democrats and ….
In the end , the Republican message was that the problems were caused by Democrats and that the Republicans would somehow do a good job .
Hardly reassuring , especially coming from a political party that had controlled both and arguably all three branches of the federal government for much of the past decade .
2 ) The war : More war .
Against Russia !
Iran !
China even !
When a presidential candidate gets up and announces that the U.S. will send the sons of voters to places they never heard of to fight in a long - running war that they were unaware of , they are not reassured .
3 ) Corruption : Nothing other than platitudes about opposition to earmarks .
Oh and desperate attempts to point to Democrats who are corrupt .
Look over there !
No not at us , over there !
What Ron Paul Offered :
1 ) The economy : I recently read an editorial in a financial magazine that said something to the effect that only two schools of economics had come out of the crisis looking good , the Austrians and the Marxists .
Whereas the Marxists have long been discredited economically ( Lenin ’s attempts to do away with trade in the early days of the Bolshevik revolution and the debacle that resulted stand in mute testimony of how wrong they are ) , the Austrians have not .
Many of their predictions – about how Bretton Woods would collapse , the coming of the Great Depression , the current financial crisis have come true , precisely as they predicted .
Ron Paul is closely identified with the Austrian school .
He understands the theories .
He can speak about them authoritatively .
Long before any other national Republican politician , Ron Paul had been warning of the current financial crisis .
his policy prescriptions , emphasizing reducing spending and cutting taxes , reducing the financial burdens p;laced on people by government would probably have resonated with a substantial portion of the electorate .
His specific , concrete policy statements , far less unfeasible than those of his competitors would have given voters something positive to consider .
2 ) The war : Ron Paul ’s position of bringing troops home from overseas and cutting military spending would have made him many powerful enemies .
However , as the consistent anti-war Republican , he would have been in a very favorable position to Obama who is quite the interventionist when it comes to causes that are politically attractive .
Ron Paul could credibly promise to end the mismanagement of the war .
3 ) Corruption : Ron Paul ’s vision of the Federal Government would be a far less corrupt one .
How many parasites can be supported by a government that sticks to a few enumerated powers ?
When the farmer stops pouring slop into the trough , the pigs stop lining up to eat .
A positive message rather than a negative one
Ron Paul had a positive message , a set of policy proposals that were a road map as to how he wanted to proceed forward .
McCain has no such thing .
All he could hope for was that enough people did n’t want Obama to propel him into victory .
Of course , people who found the status quo unacceptable held their noses and voted for Obama .
An outsider like Ron Paul who credibly promoted limited government and free markets , whose consistently stood his ground even when it placed him in opposition to his party , would have given many people who hated the status quo but did n’t like Obama ’s proposals , a reason to vote Republican .
I do n’t think Ron Paul himself could have won the election – the newsletter scandal would have sunk him – however , someone credibly advancing his agenda could have .
And , if they want to be anything more than a regional party limited to the band connecting Northern Louisiana to Kentucky , they would do well to consider that fact .

Saturday 1st November 2008
Guy Ritchie has cancelled Madonna ’s order for tens of thousands of pounds worth of special Kabbalah water to fill their swimming pool .
It ’s always uncomfortable when we have to humour someone close to us in the name of avoiding conflict .
Right now in Thames Valley University , for example , entire science departments must be feeling slightly embarrassed about their degrees in quackery .
Because despite the refusal of all universities to openly disclose what they teach on these – uniquely their ideas must be shielded from critical appraisal – the leaks keep coming , and Professor David Colquhoun of UCL continues to archive the comedy on his website .
This latest batch of course notes from TVU sound more like religious evangelism than science .
“ Students and practitioners alike are frequently subject to negative expressions and even frank hostility from relatives … it is therefore best to be forewarned that your adherence to ‘ alternative ’ principles will be tested in these ways . ”
They talk about magical fields that cannot be detected by instruments , as if this were a personality flaw on the part of physicists , and so on .
This is not an isolated incident .
The Centre for Nutrition Education and Lifestyle Management is headed by someone from Patrick Holford ‘s Institute for Optimum Nutrition .
You might be surprised to discover that there is a university BSc degree available from an institution where the front cover of the prospectus reads : “ Caring for and Nurturing our future Evolution through the successful support of our genetic code ” , but there it is , validated by Middlesex University .
What they offer is in fact a mixture of nutritionism and a self help method called “ Neurolinguistic Programming ” , which developed in the 1970s out of the New Age movement .
The University of Westminster have consistently failed to offer me or Colquhoun meaningful information about their degree courses .
The University of Central Lancashire has turned down ( several times ) a request from David Colquhoun under the Freedom of Information Act to see the teaching materials used on their homeopathy BSc .
But we do have – via David – an authentic leaked exam paper from the University of Westminster Homeopathy BSc degree course finals , asking questions about miasma .
Miasmatic theory originated in the Middle Ages and lasted until the middle of the 19th century , when diseases like cholera and plague were believed to be spread by foul air , known as miasmas .
John
Snow showed in 1854 that cholera was spread through contaminated water – nothing to do with “ miasmas ” – and Robert Koch discovered the micro organism that causes the disease in 1883 .
If you know someone with cholera then do try and get hold of a sample of their watery diarrhoea , you should be able to see Vibrio cholerae under a £ 14.99 microscope from Argos , if you borrow some stain from a friendly microbiologist .
Make sure you wash your hands afterwards , and do n’t bite your fingernails during the experiment .
In fact , the story that science can tell about cholera is well characterised and fiendishly fascinating .
If you swallow some cholera bacteria , they shut down to pass through your murderously acidic stomach , and then , when they detect ( from the changed chemical environment ) that they are in your small intestine , they start producing curly whip - like tails .
These rotate to propel the bacteria through the pasty mucus that lines your small intestine , and up against the intestinal wall , where they can thrive .
Once here , they again respond to their changed chemical surroundings , and stop producing the tails , and instead , start producing cholera toxin .
This toxin pulls chloride ions across the bowel wall , and so water is drawn across with them , by osmosis , from your blood supply and into the passageway of your small intestine .
This happens on a massive scale : your small intestine is suddenly full of water , which flies out of your arse at a phenomenal rate , carrying the multiplying and thriving new generations of Vibrio cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water and so on to the next host , chillingly , perhaps your brother , perhaps your girlfriend – unless proper sanitation measures are in place .
Meanwhile , as this water flies out of you , dehydration rapidly begins to set in , and the only thing you can do to save your life is make sure you consume – almost continuously – the right mixture of dilute salt water and sugar , to replace the blood ’s water and salts lost in the diarrhoea .
And fascinatingly , the single most successful evidence - based medical treatment in the history of humankind is something you ’ve probably never heard of : the WHO rehydration recipe , used to treat people with diarrhoea , which has saved 3 million lives a year for the past two decades .
In fact , diarrhoea kills more young children around the world than malaria , AIDS and TB combined .
You can fix yourself a pair of pints in your own kitchen following this deliberately memorable recipe : simply stir one level teaspoon of salt , and eight level teaspoons of sugar , into one litre ( 5 cupfuls ) of drinkable water .
Then sit back on your balcony , toast the fact that you do n’t really have cholera , and savour the flavour of a drink that saves one child ’s life every 11 seconds .
Imagine being a part of inventing that .
If I was going to teach anything on a science degree , it would n’t be miasma , and it would n’t be a secret .
Important Note :
In the article above , I failed to distinguish satisfactorily between the fantastical miasmatic theory of disease in the middle ages and the fantastical miasmatic theory of disease as meant by some homeopaths , two equally fantastical theories ( note ) about the causes of disease .
This will make the homeopaths fizz like a bag of wasps .
Now this distinction may , to you , feel a bit like those mediaeval philosophers ’ heated debates about the number of angels that can fit on the head of a pin , but we must respect the belief systems of others , and more than that , accuracy is important .
I ’ve already let the Readers ’ Editor know about this important error and will keep you updated on the progress of my complaint about my own work .
I would like to point out an interview with Marc Faber , one of my favorite market analysts .
He is pretty entertaining , really .
Marc Faber is a hard money , old school investor who thinks that the U.S. government is going to reflate in order to avoid depression and that means gold is more valuable .
But , for those of you who do n’t know economic history , the fact is that this has been tried before , in the Great Depression in the 1930s and the result was that the government had to confiscate Americans ’ gold .
It was Executive Order 6102 signed on 5 April 1933 right after Franklin Roosevelt came to office and it forbade all Americans from owning physical gold assets .
Quoting Wikipedia :
It required all persons to deliver on or before May 1 , 1933 all gold coin , gold bullion , and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve .
Under the Trading With the Enemy Act of October 6 , 1917 , as amended on March 9 , 1933 , violation of Executive Order 6102 was punishable by fine up to $ 10,000 ( $ 166,640 if adjusted for inflation as of 2008 ) or up to ten years in prison , or both .
Because of this forced immediate sale of gold to the Federal Reserve at the government set price of $ 20.67 per ounce , this Executive Order is often referred to as the Gold Confiscation of 1933 .
Shortly after this forced sale , the price of gold from the treasury for international transactions was raised to $ 35 an ounce ; the U.S. government thereby devalued the U.S. dollar by 41 % .
Order 6102 specifically exempted " customary use in industry , profession or art " –a provision that covered artists , jewelers , dentists , and electricians among others .
The order further permitted any person to own up to $ 100 in gold coins ( a face value equivalent to five troy ounces of Gold ) .
Nevertheless , anecdotal accounts later related that many persons who possessed large amounts of gold simply ignored the order and hid their gold until the Order ceased to be in effect .
Faber seems to think the government could confiscate your gold again very soon .
Take a look at what he has to say below .
Oh , and Executive Order 6102 was not repealed until 1974 , 41 years later .

Update Jul 2010 : It seems the US government is now moving to document all gold sales in the United States .

Paste bin websites allow you to share short text snippets , usually code .
They are enormously popular on IRC channels where dumping many lines at once into an ongoing chat ( " flooding " ) is considered uncouth .
Paste sites take that text out of the channel and onto the web .
Paste bins allow you to drop off your chunk of text or code and save it with a unique URL .
You can then share that URL with others , so they can view the text you saved .
Pasting sites typically offer a number of enhancement features .
Standard options include syntax highlighting for various programming languages , encryption for private pastes , searches for public pastes ( these coding solutions while programming ) , and free subdomains for shared projects .
For years , I 've been using several old standbys , namely the pastebin and pastie implementations , which are hosted at numerous websites .
My favorite pastebin site is pastebin.ca , which adds numerous features on top of the standard pastebin.com distribution .
Recently , though , irc friends have been pointing me towards github .
So I finally bit the bullet and checked out github 's " Gist " pasting system .
Sure enough , Gist takes pasting into the next generation .
Like other paste sites , Gist allows you to drop off text and share URLs .
You can use syntax highlighting and set your pastes as private or public .
But unlike my regular paste sites ,
Gist thinks about pasting like github thinks about code repositories .
With Gist , pastes are not static .
You can edit them , both online and off .
You and others can fork your pastes , making each text snippet its own versionable project .
I 'm told that you can even push back changes that you edited after downloading , although I have not tried this yet myself .
You need to establish an github account to use Gist .
This took all of five seconds and involves nothing more than choosing a user name and a password .
Once logged in , I could instantly view all my pastes with a single click on my user name .
At this time , Gist does not offer built - in search which is a shame .
You can , however , unofficially use Google .
Search with your - search - term site : http://gist.github.com/gists.
This is , at best , a lame workaround .
I hope that github enables searching some time soon ; making users log in may be one way to protect against spambots trolling the site .
If you 're in a diggish " what 's new " mood , github provides a recent gists list .
Now that I 've discovered gist , will I be going back to pastie and pastebin ?
Probably not for a while .
I 'll probably keep using the simplest member of the paste bin family : tinypaste .
This zero-option one - paste solution comes in handy when you really do n't want to think about all the flexibility that sites like github offer .
Here 's a quick rundown of some of the many available paste sites :
Watches have always been a symbol of success .
In days of old it was the select few who held positions of esteem in society , who would proudly wear a pocket watch on its beautiful chain .
The wrist watch has however overtaken the pocket watch in popularity , though a pocket watch makes a statement all of its own .
As the world progresses , the watch has become more commonplace and is mass produced .
But then there are watches , and there are watches !
A watch is a timepiece that is made to be worn on a person .
The term now usually refers to a wristwatch , which is worn on the wrist with a strap or bracelet .
In addition to the time , modern watches often display the day , date , month and year , and electronic watches may have many other functions .
Icedtime.com features one of the biggest online collections of men's diamond watches .
Lyme disease entered American consciousness in 1975 , when a cluster of cases turned up around Old Lyme , Connecticut .
Thirty - plus years later , it 's still on the rise in the United States .
New research shows that the pathogen responsible for the ailment , which produces arthritis and neurological symptoms , originated overseas , millennia ago .
Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi , which live in small and medium - size mammals and are transmitted to humans via tick bites .
Little known stateside is that it's the most common tick - borne disease in Europe , as it is in the U.S. ; two other species of Borrelia are implicated there , though , along with B. burgdorferi .
To probe the U.S. pathogen 's origins , Gabriele Margos of the University of Bath in England and sixteen colleagues compared DNA samples from B. burgdorferi collected across the U.S. and Europe .
Contrary to earlier studies that located our B. burgdorferi's origins in the New World , the research concluded that the pathogen originally came from Europe .
The team studied eight " housekeeping " genes , which are involved in cell maintenance and evolve slowly .
As such , their variation is thought to yield more reliable insights than that of less conservative genes studied by others .
The team thinks the pathogen has resided quietly in North America for millions of years , only recently coming into sufficient contact with humans to warrant the medical community 's attention .
( PNAS )
In selecting his erstwhile opponent , Hillary Rodham Clinton , to be secretary of State , Barack Obama has gone boldly where no recent president has gone before .
Unlike the lawyers , academics and generals who have dominated the office since World War II , Clinton combines substance and essential qualities for the job with celebrity and a political constituency .
For those who followed the 2008 Democratic primary campaign , this appointment might seem head - scratchingly incongruous .
Was n’t it Clinton who impugned Obama ’s readiness to be commander in chief with her now - infamous ad about a 3 a.m. call to the White House ?
Will she now insist on being patched in to that call ?
Apparently not .
Both Clinton and Obama insist that , partly as a result of her tireless campaigning for him in the general election , they have made their peace and then some .
It ’s also true that their foreign policy differences were exaggerated in the fun -house mirror of the primary campaign .
Like Obama , Clinton is willing to engage this country ’s adversaries afresh , but without foreclosing military action when necessary to defend U.S. interests .
Not even her detractors would deny that Clinton is smart , well - versed in foreign and defense issues and single - minded in pursuing her goals .
Her perseverance even after Obama seemed almost certain of victory augurs well for her ability to press for diplomatic breakthroughs -- in the Arab - Israeli conflict , for example -- when persistence seems futile .
So too does her renown as a first lady turned senator turned diplomat .
A canny and charismatic secretary of State can be useful , however , only if allies and adversaries see her as the president ’s absolute alter ego .
As James A. Baker III , President George H.W. Bush ’s secretary of State , observed , a foreign leader “ can see daylight between a president and his secretary of State from a thousand miles away . ”
Such gaps are less likely when the secretary is n’t a political luminary .
That may explain why the last politician of Clinton ’s stature to serve as secretary of State was James Byrnes ( 1945 - 1947 ) , a former U.S. senator and Supreme Court justice who had angled for the Democratic vice presidential nomination in 1944 .
( Christian Herter , a former governor of Massachusetts , served under President Eisenhower . )
Although history suggests it is difficult for rivals to collaborate on foreign policy , Clinton may be particularly well - suited for the challenge .
Her high profile could help energize U.S. foreign policy while her background as a lawyer serves her in tough negotiations .
She has proved to be flexible and pragmatic , as has Obama .
His appointment of Clinton , whatever its complexities , shows the president - elect ’s sense of confidence in her and in the administration they now will share .
[ darcs-users ] [ ANNOUNCE ] darcs - fast - export
Hi , I 'm happy to announce a small project I recently stated to work on .
It 's a darcs backend for fast importers .
This means that it allows you to export patches / commits from a darcs repo and import to any version control system where a fast importer is implemented .
Current features : - According to its name , it tries to be really fast , even for large repos .
- Independent .
It has been tested with git fast - import , hg fastimport and bzr fast - import .
( Let me know if you know other fast - importers ! ) -
It supports both ( darcs1 and darcs2 ) darcs repo formats .
-
It supports incremental conversions .
More info on the homepage : http://vmiklos.hu/project/darcs-fast-export/
Including a list of alternatives , where I try to compare them to darcs - fast - export .
Any feedback or comment is appreciated .
I 'm not on the bazaar and the mercurial list , so there please CC me .
Thanks .

Gosh .
Poor old George Bush .
He 's having a rough time , is n't he ?
He has the worst presidential approval ratings in US history .
Under his stalwart leadership , the country has taken an economic , social and emotional nosedive .
His own party attempts to distance themselves from him on a daily basis .
And to top it all off , can you believe that nobody wants to buy his memoirs ?
To add insult to injury , publishers are courting his wife with fervour , each clamouring for the opportunity to bid on her memoirs .
It has to burn at least a little , right ?
I do n't really understand why people are n't interested .
I 'm assuming that watching Bush attempt to justify the myriad interesting choices he 's made – all of which fall somewhere in the range of " irresponsible " to " deadly " to " Were you asleep ? " – holds the same sickeningly captivating appeal as watching a car crash .
Still , other readers might be interested in seeing just what new and grammatically impossible bastardisations of the English language Bush could spew forth next .
It seems intriguing to be afforded the opportunity to see into the mind of a man who felt compelled to lie ( poorly ) about his favourite book from childhood .
Granted , I certainly would n't pay for the privilege , but that 's why we have such an efficacious library system , no ?
Presidential autobiographies are certainly nothing new , of course .
Just ask former president Bill Clinton – although if he does n't answer you right away , you should n't take it personally .
He 's probably really busy counting the $ 30 m he earned from the sales of his books .
Not to be outdone , Hillary also penned her memoirs , earning herself $ 8 m in the process .
Both of Mr Bush 's parents successfully authored books – his mother wrote a memoir while his father contributed to a book on foreign policy – as did Ronald and Nancy Reagan before them .
I believe even a few White House pets have managed to find buyers for their stories .
So what gives ?
It 's not like it would be an especially lengthy memoir .
Nobody ever called him prolix .
Maybe there just are n't enough publishing houses available right now .
As it turns out , lots of book deals are in the works .
Sarah Palin is one of the hottest literary tickets in town , according to recent reports .
She has been offered multi-million dollar contracts in exchange for her books , movies , television appearances , and more .
During her brief but superhuman skyrocket to fame , she speedily and successfully built up a constituency of people who found her lack of experience and confusing down - home values system refreshing and full of promise .
Not surprisingly , she also has the attention of the " liberal left " , who are fascinated that a woman whose main debating skills consist of ill - timed winks and tired cliches was almost one heart attack away from running our country .
She 's terribly fascinating either way .
I 'll admit it – I would definitely get my name on the library waiting list for a chance to pore over Palin 's innermost thoughts .
( Interestingly enough , Palin 's doppelganger , Tina Fey , has also been asked to put forth a literary masterpiece .
Presumably , she 'd discuss things other than her now - famous " I can see Russian from my house ! " though that would probably sell well enough on its own . )
It seems that publishers just do n't think the public cares to hear or see any more of Bush right now , nor will they be ready to receive him next year .
Or the year after that , or the one after that .
Although Bush has compared himself to Harry Truman ( in that Bush will be leaving office hugely unpopular , as Truman did in the 50s ) , one must remember that it was several decades before we allowed for a successful biography of Truman and his time as president .
Nobody was willing to hear it before then .
Bush could just be a little too eager to explain himself , or perhaps rewrite history so that it plays out on paper the way it does in his mind .
It is 90 years since the Armistice which brought World War One to an end .
The BBC's Robert Hall has been to the main sites of battle in France and Belgium to see what signs remain of the conflict , and how one of the bloodiest periods of modern history is commemorated .

The Bible , but not as you know it
By Stephen Tomkins
The Illuminated Bible is not dissimilar to a copy of ID or Wallpaper *
Most people think of the Bible as a densely printed book with no pictures , but a version of the scripture that resembles a glossy coffee table magazine aims to change that .
It 's part of a wave of radical presentations of the Bible , including a manga version and a Lego gospel .
But how do Christians feel about these attempts to spread the word ?
It 's the kind of magazine you might find in a doctor 's waiting room next to Cosmopolitan or Reader 's Digest .
On the front is a pale face heavy with mascara .
A flick through throws up striking images : urban flooding , a Nigerian abattoir , a girl eating noodles , a pooch in a limo .
It 's only when and if you get round to reading the text that the incongruity strikes you : " Go and sell all you have and give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . "
What kind of problem page is this ?
BIBLE VERSION HISTORY 382 : Jerome commissioned to tackle Latin Vulgate translation 1382 : Wyclif 's Bible , translations of Vulgate scripture into Middle English start to appear 1455 : Gutenberg prints Bible using movable type 1522 : Martin Luther translates New Testament into German 1526 : Tyndale 's English New Testament printed Bible Illuminated is the latest attempt to bring the Bible into the modern world .
In the format of a 300 - page glossy magazine , it contains the whole text of the New Testament in a popular translation , with no chapter or verse numbers .
The images are by turns beautiful , violent , oblique and provocative - much like the book itself .
The text " She will have a son , and you will name him Jesus " is illustrated with a veiled Muslim .
One verse has a photo of a pair of knickers draped over high - heeled shoes , sending you back to the passage to find out what it 's really about .
The person behind this remarketing of holy writings is Dag Soederberg , a Swedish businessman .
And contrary to expectations , he is not a Christian hoping to convert anyone .
" I 'm not on a mission from God , " he explains .
" I 'm not particularly religious .
I 'm not telling anyone they should believe . "
The Archbishop of Canterbury is intrigued by the Manga Bible

What he sees in the Bible is a profitable chance for people to look again at their world .
" We are all affected by it , " he says .
" Morals are based on it , rightly or wrongly , government , laws .
I 'm saying to people : this is your history , read it .
" It 's the most sold book in the world , but the least known .
I want to take it off the shelves and put it on the coffee table . "
It 's the kind of thing that might provoke tuts and headshaking in the pews , one imagines .
" Some people will feel it 's dumbing down , " says David Ashford of the Bible Society , an organisation that exists to " make the Bible heard " .
" How can it be the Bible when it 's got Angelina Jolie in it ? "
The Brick Testament is not exactly reverent ( picture courtesy of www.thebricktestament.com)
He , however , welcomes it with open arms .
" You have to understand that what we think of as the traditional serious - looking leather - bound Bible is actually a relatively new format .
In the Middle Ages , picture books - with people in contemporary dress - were the way most people read the Bible .
" At first the Bible was a collection of scrolls , then illustrated handwritten volumes .
When printing was invented they were produced in Latin with pictures .
Later they were published in plain closely printed text , in the common language , to get them into as many people 's hands as cheaply as possible . "
So , ironically , Soederberg 's attempt to popularise the Bible by getting away from its traditional format is exactly what the people who created that format were doing .
If you 're looking for an alternative way into the Bible , there 's no shortage of versions to choose from .
Here are some of the more unusual : 1 . The Jesus Loves Porn Stars Bible The Jesus Loves Porn Stars Bible is part of a wider campaign
Enlarge Image
This arresting title is the work of the XXXChurch , an organisation that on the one hand helps people addicted to porn , while on the other hand taking the gospel into the porn industry .
They print this Bible to give out free at porn shows and industry conventions , distributing over 15,000 in 2007 .
2 . The Manga Bible The British Christian Ajin - bayo Akinsiku , known as Siku , tells the whole story in the form of a graphic novel .
Cain says to Abel , " Whassup , bro ? "
Noah loads animals onto the ark , saying , " That 's 11,344 animals ?
Arggh !
I 've lost count again .
I 'm going to have to start from scratch ! "
Christ strides out of the desert like a Marvel superhero .
It skimps on some of the less bloodthirsty episodes like the sermon on the mount , but Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is a fan , liking the way it conveys " the shock and freshness of the Bible " .
3 . The Bible in Cockney Former archbishop George Carey gave a thumbs up to the Cockney Bible
The rhyming slang version of the Bible was written by Mike Coles , an RE teacher in Stepney , and started life as stories he told to his classes .
In it , Jesus feeds " five thousand geezers " with " five loaves of Uncle Fred and two Lillian Gish " .
The Lord 's Prayer morphs from " For thine is the kingdom , the power and the glory " to " You 're the Boss , God , and will be for ever , innit ? "
This one got the seal of approval of Rowan Williams 's predecessor George Carey , who grew up in London 's East End , so must have known what he was rabbit and porking about .
4 . The Brick Testament
This less - than - reverent online version by Brendan Powell Smith tells stories from the Bible using Lego .
It started life in 2001 with stories from Genesis and today contains 391 stories with 4,214 illustrations .
Though it is sometimes satirical or tongue - in - cheek , it is often used by churches and Sunday schools , and it's one of the versions that the Bible Society has welcomed as connecting people with the Bible in a new way .
5 . Inspired By The Bible Experience The Bible Experience is one for the iPod generation And for the iPod generation , you can get the whole thing on your MP3 player , read and performed by a Hollywood cast , including Forest Whitaker as Moses , Cuba Gooding Jr as Jonah , and a possibly typecast Samuel L Jackson as God .
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this new wave of Bibles is how sympathetic the church is to people messing about with its sacred scriptures , whether in wording or binding , no doubt reasoning that there can be some good in anything that gets people hearing its stories .
But how successful these versions are at doing that is another question .
The makers of the Bible Illuminated claim it has increased sales of Bibles by 50 % in Sweden - though we are not told over what timescale .
A version that could achieve such figures in the UK would be one of the most surprising Bibles yet .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I 'm sorry Sharon , Croydon thinks it is sacrilege .
I 'm a Methodist preacher and am very happy for the Bible to be presented in any way that enhances interest and understanding .
I think God has a sense of humour , too .
John Bedigan , North Shields , England I 'm from Turkey .
I wish they would do the same for the Koran , make it more friendly and easy to read with lots of photos .
Ayse Sarici , Tekirdag , Turkey
As I 'm an artist as well as a Christian , I like them .
One of our Sunday school kids has a manga bible .
I 've also bought a version of the Graphic bible .
People are more likely to read a glossy magazine format , than something too wordy .
As long as general doctrine is n't compromised .
Lydia Helene Irving , Wallasey Absolutely ridiculous !
Just another way for people to cash in on a religion !

Well , there 's a planetful of literature out there debunking the Bible , so why not have the other side of the story set out in a contemporary and " hip " way ?
Next thing might be adverts on the sides of buses !

All this about alternative ( and * ahem * not entirely reverent ) translations , and no mention of the LOLCat bible ?
This is a wiki - based project to translate the bible into the internet dialect LOLCat .
Although it is being produced for humorous purposes , it means that people are trying long and hard to understand passages in order to translate them in the most appropriate way possible .

Will Samuel L Jackson be doing ads for Big Kahuna Burger next ?
Joshua Davies , Cardiff Soederberg 's attempt is clearly not altruistic , a businessman looking for his slice .
Hence the easy triviality of his and other versions mentioned .
It hardly matters to the Church , they do n't believe half of what the Bible teaches .
Did n't the main character of the Bible teach : " you received free , give free " ?
Charles , Helsinki , Finland I love these alternative presentations - it 's just like what Jesus did , He went into the countryside and told people the Good News by using their language and culturally appropriate stories , these new examples are our culture 's ways of expression , so in my opinion it is doing what Jesus said ' God and preach the Gospel to all nations . '
M T , Cambridge , UK The Bible is such a lively book !
Of course there is nothing wrong with ' translating ' the Bible for different sub-cultures ... this is after all what Christians have always done .
It is just now we can add a glossy finish :o)
No matter how you present it in the end and to who the message is still the same and will never change ; its always relevant !
Andrew C , Newport
If it gets the good news out to people , and those people give their lives to Christ , then I am all for it .
Those that believed are command to preach the gospel to all of creation , and I am sure God allows them to use their creativity to do so .
Logie Urquhart , Cambridge
Once again people make a mockery of Christianity .
None of the old religions - Islamic , Jewish , Hindu , etc - have ever changed their " good books " in any way , shape or form to " modernise " .
This is why Christianity will always be a joke and the other religions something serious and strong .
The old faiths would never stand for anything like this to happen .
It is sacrilege !

Reconstructing the structure of the world - wide music scene with Last.fm
Inspired by the Internet mapping efforts of the Opte Project , I decided to investigate how does the network of musicians look like .
Those ugly hairballs below are the results .
Okay , they do not look as nice as the Internet maps , but the tree - like structure of the Internet must have helped a lot to create those fancy maps .
There 's a menu up there .
Check out the rest of this website if you are interested in technical details or if you want to waste a lot of time .
Otherwise , just read on .
Basically : this is a graph representation of the similarity relationships derived from the database of Last.fm .
The circles ( vertices ) on the left hand side figure are bands , musicians , composers , whatever you will find in the Music section of the site .
Lines ( edges ) connect similar artists .
In order not to make the whole thing an ugly hairball ( well ... it is still an ugly hairball , but not as ugly as it could be ) , only a subset of all existing connections are displayed .
Last.fm quantifies artist similarities in a scale of 100 points - I dropped connections below 80 , mostly because the degree distribution follows a nice power law at this cutoff level .
Edges are colored according to their centrality in the network , from white to dark gray in a nice logarithmical gradient ( the visualisation with black background use a different palette from black through red and yellow to white ) .
Insignificant edges are more transparent than significant ones .
Vertex sizes vary according to the popularity of the artists .
It is not very surprising that the largest vertices are not those that were the most influential in the history of music ;)
Vertex colors correspond to musical genres , identified by tags attached to the artists by the users of Last . fm - so do n't blame me if an artist is seemingly miscategorised :)
Rock is red , metal is dark grey , electronic is orange , hip - hop and rap is blue , jazz is yellow , reggae and ska is magenta , classical music is cyan , country , folk and world music is brown , pop is green .
Light grey vertices are unclassified .
See the technical details if you are interested in how the categorisation was done .
The right hand side figure is almost the same , but the edges are not drawn and musicians are represented by small coloured dust particles where the area of the particle is proportional to the popularity of the given artist .
Although every single dust cloud should be circular , the inhomogenous density of the vertices give rise to that pattern you see - like some paint splatted on the wall .
Actually , it looks better on black background .
There are many variants of these figures available for download .
There is also an interactive map - just type the name of your favourite band and see where it is in the graph .
Notable mentions
Civil rights activists have delivered a potentially fatal blow to one of America 's largest Ku Klux Klan groups with a legal victory that is likely to bankrupt its leader .
A jury in Kentucky awarded $ 2.5 m ( £ 1.7 m ) in damages against the Imperial Klans of America after hearing testimony from a Hispanic teenager who recalled being kicked in the head by white supremacists wearing steel - capped boots .
The award is significant because it includes a $ 1 m personal judgment against Ron Edwards , the group 's self - styled Imperial Wizard , who was not present during the assault but who was held responsible for the actions of his followers .
" It shows that those who promote hate and violence will be held accountable and made to pay a steep price , " said Morris Dees , the founder and chief trial attorney of the Southern Poverty Law Centre , ( SPLC ) , which brought the case .
" We look forward to collecting every dime that we can for our client and to putting the Imperial Klans of America out of business . "
The court heard that Jordan Gruver , 16 , suffered a fractured arm , broken jaw and shattered teeth in the assault by Jarred Hensley and other skinhead Klansmen , who threw whisky in his face and kicked him to the ground during a recruitment drive at a county fair .
Edwards , whose group has 16 chapters in eight states , according to the SPLC , testified that his members wore boots with red laces because " that means someone shed blood for their race " .
He appeared in court with several tattoos visible , including one stating : " Fuck SPLC " .
To settle the judgment Edwards will almost certainly have to forfeit his 15 - acre compound in Dawson Springs , Kentucky , used in the past for fundraising concerts and anti-Hispanic rallies .
" Mr Edwards hates a lot of things , but one thing he loves is money , " said Richard Cohen , president of the SPLC , who said his staff suffered death threats during the three - day trial .
" There will be hangers - on who see him as a persecuted figure , but most people will see him as trouble and not want to get involved . "
Rick Ross , founder of a New Jersey - based institute that monitors cults and race - hate groups in the US , said the policy of pursuing Klan leaders was like " putting a stake through their heart " .
He added : " Going after a group 's money and assets cuts directly into their lifeblood .
How can you carry on with no means to continue ?
You 're also discouraging people from stepping up to become the next leader .
Who wants to take that job when the last one ... went bankrupt ? "
It 's a mystery that has got British law enforcement officials and others across the planet scratching their heads .
Put bluntly , enough heroin to supply the world 's demand for years has simply disappeared .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) describes the situation as " a time bomb for public health and global security " .
This week 's Map of the Week comes courtesy of the UNODC .
It shows their latest estimate of opium production in Afghanistan - another bumper year .
A crop of 7,700 tonnes will produce around 1,100 tonnes of heroin - it basically works on a 7:1 ratio .
The mystery is that the global demand for heroin is less than half that .
In other words , Afghanistan only needs to produce 3,500 tonnes to satisfy every known heroin user on the planet .
Look at the graph , though .
For the past three years , production has been running at almost twice the level of global demand .
The numbers just do n't add up .
There are two credible theories .
Theory 1 : A large and undocumented market has opened up in countries which do n't want to admit the problem .
Russia has long been in denial over the scale of its heroin problem and the same may be true in emerging drug markets like Iran , Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan .
The Iranians are certainly increasingly anxious about the opium fields on their doorstep .
Border guards and police have been involved in deadly shoot - outs with smugglers with experts suggesting that there are now a million heroin users in Iran .
But the over - supply is so great that it is hard to conceive of it all disappearing in to the blood - streams of new addicts in Tehran and Ashgabat .
Theory 2 : Vast quantities of heroin and morphine are being stockpiled .
Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UNODC is convinced that is the only explanation .
In a recent bulletin he issues an urgent order : ' Find the missing opium . '
" As a priority , intelligence services need to examine who holds this surplus , where it may go , and for what purpose " he says .
" We know little about these stockpiles of drugs , besides that they are not in the hands of farmers . "
Further credibility is given to the stockpiling theory in that ' farm - gate ' prices for opium remain pretty stable at about $ 70 per kilo .
So where are the thousands of tonnes of drugs that the UNODC describe as a " time bomb " ?
Well a clue , perhaps , comes from a senior law enforcement official who told me that British undercover teams in Afghanistan are reporting seizures of " enormous quantities of precursors " .
Precursors are the chemicals required to turn base opium into heroin .
The intelligence suggests that , rather than export opium to established drug laboratories in , for example , eastern Turkey , smugglers are processing the crop in Afghanistan .
The likelihood is that vast quantities of heroin are being warehoused somewhere close to the fields where the opium grows .
But there is another mystery surrounding the heroin market at the moment .
If the international drug cartels are so awash with product that they are prepared to risk hiding billions of dollars worth , why are there shortages on some British streets ?
That is the peculiar state of affairs revealed in Drugscope 's recent trends survey .
" Some areas are experiencing outright shortages or shortages of good quality heroin .
The quality of street heroin had dropped in 12 of the 20 town and cities surveyed , with five areas - Penzance , Cardiff , north London , Luton and Birmingham - noticing a shortage of the drug on the streets " the report says .
The field - work , conducted in July and August , finds shortages had typically been in place for two months - a longer stretch than is usual in a market well known for its peaks and troughs .
The Serious Organised Crime Agency ( SOCA ) believes the heroin shortage in some parts of the country could have been sparked by a rise in the price of UK wholesale heroin .
" Current intelligence suggests that some criminal groups are having difficulty getting hold of what they perceive to be good quality heroin . "
One theory is that smugglers are using new routes , increasingly distributing heroin through East Africa .
The switch in tactics may have led to a temporary pause in supply which is being felt in the UK .
But very few would claim the shortages are the result of police activity .
The Drugscope survey concludes that " street level drug enforcement had little long - term impact on illegal drug markets . "
At best , operations only disrupt the flow of drugs for a few days or weeks and merely displace drug use and drug dealing for a short time .
One serious anxiety is that the economic downturn will herald a new wave of drug misuse .
The recession in the 80s coincided with the British heroin epidemic .
In the US it was crack cocaine .
It is not just that people turn to drugs to blot out the misery of a downturn .
If the crisis pushes up unemployment , it is likely that , deprived of a legitimate way to make a living , some may turn to an illegitimate source .
Perhaps a global downturn is what the drug cartels , with their huge stockpiles of heroin , have been waiting for .
Update : 16:10
Since posting this article the Serious Organised Crime Agency has been in touch .
SOCA has a number of undercover operatives in southern Afghanistan .
They tell me this : " Whilst the cultivation and production of opium in Afghanistan is in decline , intelligence suggests there is considerable stockpiling of narcotics by Afghan criminal networks in order to control prices in the growing markets in Russia , China and within the local region . "
I also understand that Nato 's top operations commander is calling for more aggressive tactics against the opium trade in Afghanistan .
US General John Craddock will tell Defence Ministers gathering in Budapest that troops should focus on " high - end " targets like drug dealers and laboratories .
Some Nato ministers , however , are concerned that any crackdown would prompt a violent backlash against allied troops .
In 1980 , science fiction writer and editor Ben Bova told a group of women writers , “ Neither as writers nor as readers have you raised the level of science fiction a notch .
Women have written a lot of books about dragons and unicorns , but damned few about future worlds in which adult problems are addressed . ”
It ’s no wonder that female science fiction authors have disguised their gender in order to have their work taken seriously .
We have a list of women who used male and androgynous pseudonyms to compete in the male - dominated field of speculative fiction .
James Tiptree Jr. Given Name : Alice “ Alli ” Sheldon Works : Numerous short stories , including “ The Girl Who Was Plugged In ” and “ Houston , Houston , Do You Read ? ” James Tiptree Jr. was an elusive figure , giving only one interview in “ his ” career , which was condcted by mail .
He had a post office box and his own back account , but no one had ever met him in person .
In 1976 , they learned why : Tiptree was actually Alice Bradley , a one - time CIA agent who had adopted the Tiptree pseudonym while finishing her doctorate in psychology .
Bradley said that when she started writing science fiction , she wanted to create a persona who would be sufficiently removed from her previous writing – which had focused largely on women and the nature of girlhood – and she wanted to submit her stories with a name that no editor would remember rejecting .
She took the name “ Tiptree ” from a jam jar and the name “ James ” because male names were more common in science fiction than female ones .
When Tiptree was revealed as a woman , it caused quite a stir among the science fiction community .
Tiptree ’s followers recognized the name as a pseudonym , but Bradley ’s frequent travels and intelligence background led many to believe he was a high - ranking government official , but few had considered he might be a woman .
Sheldon would later say that she was “ ashamed ” of taking a male pseudonym because she had taken the easy path into the male - dominated field .

CJ Cherryh Given Name : Carolyn Janice Cherry Works :
Over 60 novels and short story collections , including Downbelow Station , Cyteen , and Cuckoo ’s Egg. Carolyn Cherry submitted her first two novels , Gate of Ivrel and Brothers of Earth to DAW Books in 1975 .
Donald Wollheim , DAW ’s founder , purchased both manuscripts , but , for marketability , suggested she go with a different name .
The initials CJ disguised the fact that she was a woman and adding an “ h ” to her last name made it look less like a romance novelist ’s .
Vernon Lee Given Name : Violet Paget Works : Several ghost stories , notably “ Oke of Okehurst : or the Phantom Lover ” Vernon Lee wrote not only supernatural fiction , but also papers the theory of philosopher and aesthetics , subjects women were not considered intellectually suited for .
Lee herself once said , “ I do n’t care that Vernon Lee should be known to be myself or any other young woman , as I am sure no one reads a woman ’s writings on art , history or aesthetics with anything but mitigated contempt . ”
But she quickly became known as one of the premiere scholars in aesthetics and her fiction continues to be republished today .
Paul Ash ( well ) Given Name : Pauline Ashwell Works : “ Invasion from Venus , ” “ The Winds of a Bat , ” The short story “ Invasion from Venus ” appeared in Yankee Science Fiction in 1942 under the name “ Paul Ashwell . ”
But the real author was a fourteen year - old girl by the name of Pauline Ashwell .
John W. Campbell would eventually publish “ Unwillingly to School , ” Pauline ’s “ debut ” ( now under her real name ) in Analog magazine in 1958 .
She would continue to publish stories from time to time under the truncated name “ Paul Ash , ” including the Nebula - nominated “ Wings of a Bat . ”
In the 1990s , Ashwell would publish two novels , Unwillingly to Earth and Project Farcry .

CL Moore Given Name : Catherine Lucille Moore Works : Numerous short stories , including “ The Code ” “ Promised Land , ” and “ Heir Apparent ” Although claims that CL Moore tried to conceal her gender are in dispute , Astounding editor and fellow scifi writer Frederik Pohl once said that Moore “ felt a need to tinker with ” her name to appeal to her overwhelmingly male readers .
It apparently worked , as in 1936 , Moore received a letter of admiration from science fiction writer Henry Kuttner , who believed Moore was a man .
They married in 1940 .
The pair would go on to collaborate on many short stories , signing each work with a single pseudonym – one that was invariably male .
L. Taylor Hansen Given Name : Lucile Taylor Hansen Works : A handful of short stories and 57 science articles in Amazing Stories from 1941 - 1949 .
L. Taylor Hansen , who was better known for her science articles than her fiction , did n’t merely attempt to obscure her gender ; she denied it entirely .
Hansen once titled a letter in Amazing “ L. Taylor Hansen Defends Himself ” and once included a photo of a man with one of her stories , claiming it was a photo of herself .

Tarpé Mills Given Name : June Mills Works : Miss Fury Comic book artist June Mills dropped her first name in favor of her more gender ambiguous middle name when she started making action comics .
She created Miss Fury , one of the early female action characters in comics , and the first created by a woman .
When Miss Fury proved a commercial success , she could n’t hide her gender from interviewers , who realized that the comic creator was not only a woman , but bore a close resemblance to her character .

Andre Norton Given Name : Alice Norton Works :
Over 300 titles , including Star Born , Merlin ’s Mirror , and Star Man ’s Son Alice Mary Norton went beyond pseudonym to increase her marketability .
The year she published her first short story , she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton , figuring the male name would fit better with the boys her were her primary market .
Over the years , she also published under the names Andrew North and Allen Weston .
Murray Constantine Given Name : Katharine Burdekin Works : The Devil , Poor Devil , Proud Man , Swastika Night , and Venus in Scorpio Katharine Burdekin ’s novels dealt primarily with fascist dystopias , and as her work grew more critical of fascism , she adopted a pseudonym to protect her family in the event of a German invasion of England .
But her choice of a male pseudonym was likely linked to her feminist approach to the subject , and she frequently linked fascism to a “ cult of masculinity ” and “ reduction of women . ”
Although the feminist overtones led many critics to believe that Constantine was a woman writing under a pseudonym , it was n’t until two decades after her death that a scholar identified Constantine as Burdekin .

JK Rowling Given Name : Joanne Rowling Works : The Harry Potter Series
These days , people will wait in line hours to purchase something from Ms. Joanne Rowling .
But when she first submitted her tale of a boy wizard to Bloomsbury , the publisher suggested that she use two initials instead of her first name , so as not to turn off the young boys ( Rowling does n’t actually have a middle name , and took the K for her grandmother , Kathleen ) .
If children care that the creator of Hogwarts is a woman , it certainly does n’t show .
A new study could explain why " daddy " and " mommy " are often a baby 's first words – the human brain may be hard - wired to recognize certain repetition patterns .
Using the latest optical brain imaging techniques , University of British Columbia post - doctoral fellow Judit Gervain and a team of researchers from Italy and Chile documented brain activities of 22 newborns ( 2 - 3 days old ) when exposed to recordings of made - up words .
The researchers mixed words that end in repeating syllables – such as " mubaba " and " penana " – with words without repetition – such as " mubage " and " penaku . "
They found increased brain activities in the temporal and left frontal areas of the newborns ' brain whenever the repetitious words were played .
Words with non-adjacent repetitions ( " bamuba " or " napena " ) elicited no distinctive responses from the brain .
The study is published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences online Early Edition .
" It 's probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their ' child words ' – baby and daddy in English , papa in Italian and tata ( grandpa ) in Hungarian , for example , " says Gervain from UBC Dept. of Psychology 's Infant Studies Centre .
Scientists have studied how older children and adults acquire grammatical structures .
This is one of the first studies on a newborn infant 's innate ability to decipher structural patterns in language .
" The language centre of most right - handed adults is located on the left side of the brain , " says Gervain .
" This is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently . "
" The brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not ' learn ' how to process language during development , but rather , they are specialized – at least in part – to process language from the start . "

Mark Cuban Charged with Insider Trading
Dallas Mavericks ownerhas been charged with insider trading in a complaint filed in federal district court in Dallas by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
Cuban allegedly violated various federal securites laws when he sold 600,000 shares of Canadian internet search engine Mamma.com Inc. in 2004 , based on information that had n’t been made public about an impending stock offering .
The SEC complaint alleges that Mamma.com invited Cuban to participate in the stock offering after he agreed to keep the information confidential .
Cuban knew the offering would be conducted at a discount to prevailing market price and would dilute holdings of existing shareholders , the complaint claims .
Cuban , told his broker to sell his entire stake in Mamma.com within hours of learning of the plan , avoiding a loss of more than $ 750,000 , the SEC claims .
The billionaire entrepreneur , who made his fortune in the software industry , bought the Mavericks in 2000 .
In 2007 he was a contestant on the 5th season of the ABC Show Dancing with the Stars ( view video ) .
Cuban has not responded to the allegations .

The world ’s central bankers are gathering this week at the IMF - World Bank conference in Washington DC and are expected to grease the skids for the creation of a machinery of world economic governance under the pretext of preventing a repeat of the financial crisis , a global economic policeman to patrol a de-facto financial dictatorship .
Bilderberg member and recently appointed UK Business Secretary Peter Mandelson ( pictured above ) argued last week that new global solutions are needed because “ the machinery of global economic governance barely exists ” , adding : “ It is time for a Bretton Woods for this century , ” reports the Telegraph , noting that “ Opinion is now hardening around the case for a new global architecture to enforce rules that ensure lessons are learnt . ”
This followed the proposal to create a new EU body to regulate banks across the entire European financial market .
Top EU officials , including economy commissioner Joaquin Almunia , have stated that the EU should have greater powers to regulate and intervene in the operations of financial institutions across Europe .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Influential media giants like the Wall Street Journal are pushing a “ new world order ” to solve the crisis , while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a “ a new global financial order ” to supersede the institutions created after World War II .
The elite are up to their old tricks again , after all , a leopard never changes its spots .
They created the problem of wildly irresponsible fractional reserve banking , the debt bubble and the credit crunch by ceaselessly inflating the money supply and now they are going to offer their solution to the crisis – the further centralization of global economic power into fewer hands .
Appointing the former CEO of Goldman Sachs to oversee the bailout and ensure the bankers divvy up the spoils of the greatest stick - up heist in history amongst themselves was not enough for these fascists – they want to go full board and exploit the crisis they caused to advance the stuttering agenda for world government that has been in the works for the best part of 100 years at least .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers who genetically engineered “ marathon mice ” that could run for hours have found two pills that can mimic the effects -- and they have already developed a test for the drugs in case athletes try to cheat with them .
The fitness studio in the spa area of the " Balance Resort " hotel is pictured in the village of Stegersbach , in the Austrian province of Styria , May 15 , 2008 .

The drugs reproduce many of the biological benefits of exercise , helping cells burn fat better and boosting endurance , said Ronald Evans , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California .
One of the pills may some day help people enhance their exercise or training , while the other might be more suited for couch potatoes who need to kick - start themselves , Evans and colleagues reported on Thursday in the journal Cell .
“ If you like exercise , you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck , ” Evans said in a statement .
“ If you do n’t like exercise , you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill . ”
In 2004 , Evans and his colleagues genetically engineered mice by tweaking a gene called PPAR - delta , a master regulator of different genes .
Gene - engineered mice could run twice as far as normal mice and stayed lean even when fed a high - fat diet .
The next step was to find a drug that might mimic these effects .
Evans tested a compound called GW1516 , one of a family of compounds that researchers are looking at as obesity and diabetes drugs .
But even though it affected the genes of the mice , it did not affect their metabolism .
“ There was no change at all in running performance .
Nothing -- not even a percent , ” Evans said in a statement .
MIMICKING LIFE
Then the researchers thought about what happens in real life .
“ If you ’re out of shape -- and most of us are -- and you want to change , you have to do some exercise .
The way we reprogram muscle in adults is by training . ”
So they trained the mice while some were on the drug and others were not .
All the mice became more athletic but those given GW1516 ran 68 percent longer than those that had only done the exercise training .
“ The dramatic effect of the drug was stunning , ” Evans said .
But that does not help people who might have muscle - wasting diseases , fatigue , or who are too overweight to exercise .
They went back to see if there was a different way to affect PPAR - delta .
One compound that is well understood already is AMP - activate protein kinase or AMPK , “ a master regulator of cellular and organismal metabolism ” , they wrote .
“ We think AMPK activity is the secret to allowing PPAR - delta drugs to work , ” Evans said .
A drug called AICAR mimics AMP , Evans said , “ so muscle thinks it ’s burning fat . ”
Mice given AICAR ran 44 percent longer than untreated animals , the researchers found .
“ This is a drug that is like pharmacological exercise , ” Evans says .
“ After four weeks of receiving the drug , the mice were behaving as if they ’d been exercised . ”
Treated mice could outrun mice given traditional exercise training , Evans said .
“ Almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise , ” Evans said .
“ For this group of people , if there was a way to mimic exercise , it would make the quality of exercise that they do much more efficient . ”
The pills are only available experimentally now and Evans is not working with any drug company .
But GW1516 has a relatively simple chemical structure and can be synthesized easily , Evans said .
His team created a mass spectrometry test to detect the two drugs and their metabolic by - products in the blood or urine .
They are working with the World Anti-Doping Agency to develop the test , perhaps in time to retroactively test 2008 Olympic athletes .
By Papernas ( National Liberation Party of Unity , Indonesia )
December 18 , 2008 -- About 1000 thugs sent by PT Arara Abadi and directly led by 500 police , under Riau regional police commander Alex Mandalika , unsparingly attacked , destroyed and burned houses using napalm bombs in Suluk Bongkal village , Riau Province , Indonesia .
A two - year - old girl died in the attack .
The attackers said the villagers were newcomers who must be evicted .
They were also falsely accused of having ilegally cleared state - owned forest .
According to our information , Suluk Bongkal village has been legally acknowledged in the state map made after the Dutch cooperated with the Siak kingdom ( around 1940 ) , and in 1959 ( after independence ) the area was designated as customary rights forest ( for Sakal tribe ) ; Suluk Bongkal was included in it .
Suluk Bongkal villagers have lived peacefully with the other citizens and surrounding tribes .
This peaceful livelihood stopped when the forestry ministry in 1996 that gave management rights for industrial farming to PT Arara Abadi .
Since then , the company has tried to evict the villagers by using terror , thuggery and armed violence .
The company and the villagers have been in constant conflict , with the local government and the police often taking the side of the company in oppressing the citizens .
To evict the residents of Suluk Bongkal village , who hold the legal customary land ownership , PT Arara Abadi sent hundreds of police and thugs to herd them by force , while two helicopters burned their abandoned houses .
In a few minutes , 700 houses were in flame .
Heavy machinery was brought in after to clear the rubble and level the ground .
Dozens of peasants , members of the Riau Peasant Union ( STR ) , including a left - wing legislative candidate ( Antony Fitra ) in the 2009 election , were arrested .
The police and thugs are still hunting down peasants and activists .
The incident has been suppressed by the Indonesian media .
This film documents PT Arara Abadi 's militia attack on Mandi Angin village , Riau Province , on July 2 and 17 , 2008 .
It is a hundred years since the peasant community first settled in Suluk Bongkal .
Hundreds of peasant families have lived in Suluk Bongkal area for a hundred years .
In 1991 , government issued land certificates for each village .
In 1996 , Arara Abadi corporation , a company that supplies raw materials to Indah Kiat Pulp and Paper , Sinar Mas Group ( one of the largest business conglomerates in Indonesia ) , was given the rights to control the land .
Since that day , Arara Abadi not only has control over the Suluk Bongkal area , but also 100,000 hectares of land in Riau Province , making peasants landless .
In mid-2007 , the peasants affiliated to the Riau Peasent Union ( STR ) and succeed in reclaiming the land .
Since then , 800 people have been living in that reclaimed area of Suluk Bongkal .
The latest incident began when police tried to arrest Riza Zuhelmy , STR chairperson , and the masses tried to protect their leader .
Police sent in other troops to manage the situation and arrested 10 peasants .
Unable to control the situation , helicopters flew over and dropped a napalm bomb on the peasants ' settlement .
Police troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the peasants .
The situation turned into panic .
Hundreds of peasants were arrested .
A child aged two years , six months in fear into the jungle .
She was later found dead , having fallen into a well .
After the peasants had been dispersed , bulldozers came to clear the ruins , and soon after hired thugs occupied the land .
The Riau Peasent Union filed a land dispute case between people and Arara Abadi corporation with the provincial administration in 2007 .
On May 15 , 2007 , the ministry of forestry said that people who had been living there before 1996 ( the year of the Arara Abadi land concession ) may stay and the area should be excluded from concession area .
Jhony Nelsen Simanjutak from the National Commission of Human Rights found indications of human rights violations in relation to the conflict between the people and Arara Abadi in three subdistricts .
The commission is now asking for information from 100 victims .

LMND National Executive condemns police burning of 700 citizens ' houses in Bengkalis , Riau
By National Students ' League for Democracy ( LMND )
December 19 , 2008 -- On Thursday ( 18/12/08 ) , two helicopters flew in circle and used napalm , the kind used by the US troops in Vietnam , against farmers ' settlement in Dusun Solok Bongkal , Beringin Village , Sub-District Pinggir , Bengkalis , Riau .
In seconds , about 700 citizens ' houses were burnt down , along with the farming lands , productive tools , and furniture that could not be saved by their owners .
Furthermore , about a thousand thugs and five hundreds armed police personnel were deployed to evict the citizens .
Police opened fire not only to scare the citizens , but also aimed at them , so that two citizens were shot .
Ironically , a toddler named Fitri ( 2 y.o. ) was so frightened that she fell into a well and died .
During the incident , about 200 citizens were arrested and detained at Mandau Police station , and about 400 more are hiding in the forest of Kampung Dalam , while surrounded by hundreds of police and thugs who hunt them like outlaws .
Apparently , the Indonesian Police cooperation with the US military results in the former 's use of napalm in a scorched earth against people 's houses .
This inhuman and brutal act was carried out by the state apparatus , that is the The Police of the Republic of Indonesia , whose shoelaces were bought by money from the people .
In the meantime , the police and a thousand of thugs evicted citizens without carrying any court 's order , only an order ( obviously with bribes ) by a company , PT Arara Abadi .
How can police serve the Law , if they easily ignore the Law to please big businesses ?
According to the permit given by the government , PT Arara Abadi only holds management right , instead of ownership right , of the forest in the location .
But in the development , PT Arara Abadi claimed ownership of the land , while the government turned a blind eye ; therefore the affiliate of Sinar Mas Group has tried to evict the citizens many times , including sending thugs to do it .
In reality , the five thousand hectares of land is under the settlers ' customary / indigenous right ( tanah ulayat ) , which historically has been recorded in formal documents ; the majority of citizens own the proves of ownership of that land .
It is an unwritten law in this country that the government will always serve big businesses , and its apparatus ( the Police and the Court ) will be the protector aka uniformed thugs of their corporations .
Similar incidents have happened for a long period of time in almost the entire country , but there has been no will by the parliament ( DPR ) or any other institution to investigate them .
With the incident in Bengkalis , Riau , we affirm that anti-thug campaign being promoted by the new Police Chief is simply a lie .
It is impossible to eradicate thuggery ( premanisme ) if it is so closely attached to the existing police institution .
Police 's slogan " the protector , nurturer , at the service of the society " has been translated into a number of acts of violences against the civilians .
The people do not see the Police as their protector but instead the enemy that violate their political and democratic rights , as well as their right to live .
Therefore , the National Executives of the National Students ' League for Democracy ( EN - LMND ) declared
1 . To condemn the Indonesian Police ( POLRI ) that have committed acts of violence through the use of napalm to burn down settlements , shot and arrested hundreds of Bongkal Suluk citizens .
We demand that the Police Chief shows his consistency in fighting thuggery and improves the image of the Indonesian Police by dismissing , bringing to court and imposing severe punishment to all his personnel involved in the incident ;
2 . To demand the national Police Chief to dismiss Riau Regional Police Chief and bring Alex Mandalika - Riau Police Reskrim - to the Human Rights Court for leading the act of violence .
3. Freeze PT Arara Abadi activities by cancelling its business permit , and arresting and bringing to court the company 's management ; Revoke the Ministry of Forestry Decision Letter ( SK no.743/Kpts-II/1996 )
4. Return the entire land that belongs to Suluk Bongkal Citizens ' customary rights ; rehabilitate their houses and provide compensation to all losses of their productive tools and farming lands .
5 . Release without any condition 200 detained activists and citizens ;
6. Demand that the National Human Right Commission ( Komnas HAM ) conducted field investigation on the gross violation of Human Rights carried out by the Police and PT Arara Abadi ;

WHY do we  along with 75 other countries  alternate between standard time and daylight time ?
Although many people believe it has an agricultural provenance , daylight time has always been a policy meant to save energy .
As Benjamin Franklin argued , if people moved up their summer schedules by an hour , they could live by “ sunshine rather than candles ” in the evenings .
Energy conservation was the motivation for daylight time during World Wars I and II and the oil embargo of the 1970s , and it remains so today  even though there has been little scientific evidence to suggest daylight time actually helps us cut back on electricity use .
Recently , however , we were able to conduct a study in Indiana , where daylight time was instituted statewide only in 2006 .
Before that year , daylight time was in effect in just a handful of counties .
This change of policy offered a unique , natural experiment to measure the overall effect on residential electricity consumption .
We could compare the amount of energy used by households in the late - adopting counties during the two years before they switched to daylight time with the amounts they used during the year afterward  while using counties that always practiced daylight time as a control group .
We found that daylight time caused a 1 percent overall increase in residential electricity use , though the effect varied from month to month .
The greatest increase occurred in late summer and early fall , when electricity use rose by 2 percent to 4 percent .
The Segway Scooter has always been a beautiful vehicle design that was just fun to look at .
Even before its growing popularity , you cannot deny the desire you had to ride a Segway Scooter when you encountered one on the street , saw it on TV , or heard about it from friends .
We may try to resist its beauty or geeky factor , but the Segway has stolen our hearts and is slowly increasing its use .
What is it that makes us long for the Segway Scooter ?
Is it looks alone ? is it the portability ?
is it the wonderful Segway Tours that sometimes pass us on the streets ?
or is it just because it is different ?
Whatever the reason truly is , in the end , Segway is a really cool vehicle that I would love to have .
The following is a list of 11 Really Cool Segway Scooter Concepts and Designs created for a brand , as a project or has been modified from one form to another .
So next time you run across another Segway Tour or actually get a chance to ride one , which new Segway Scooter design or concept would you pick ?
1. Segway Robot RMP
This Segway Robot RMP design looks like its been taken from a futuristic Science Fiction movie .
Its tough wheels and base could probably carry more than just one person and could be used to haul things around .
In addition , this vehicle concept video in the link also presents an ability for a really practical parallel parking method : simply drive sideways into the spot .
Wow , that could be really convenient .
2. The Segway Centaur
The Segway Centaur is a concept design by the maker that is made with four wheels but envisions a safe ride on all four or only two .
MSU explained that a simple thumb throttle right beneath the handlebars will determine if the Segway can maneuver forwards or backwards , popping a wheelie would not be a hazardous ritual and just like the original , a forward movement will begin your ride .
3. Noah High Performance Personal Vehicle
The Noah , designed by Andrei FranÃ§a , may have been a Segway influenced concept .
Without a pedal , buttons , or levers , the Noah will react to the driver ’s movements .
Although it looks like a unicycle , it does have two wheels that are placed together .
Along with your personal trust of correct gestures and huge wheels , Noah will provide a cool looking vehicle .
4. Mall Segways
It has been more than a few times that I have been approached by a Segway at the mall .
Although it sounds like a cool gathering , it could be a little scary , and Thingermejig helps illustrate .
Here you are minding your own business and instead of the survey people creeping up slowly , the Segway driving employees ride quickly ( when walking in the mall , the Segways seem a lot faster ) into your circle and begin shoving coupons in your hands .
That could definitely be considered invading my personal space .
5. Segway At Work
This combination from the Daily Weird combines the working man with a Segway look .
Instead of moving boxes using the backroom Dolly ( no pun intended ) , stand proudly upon it as you would in a Segway one day .
6. TV Segway
This awesome Segway mod has a High Definition Television ( HDTV ) on its regular model .
As great as it is to have a TV in place , I could also see it as the pimped out model for the employees above .
Now , instead of just coupons , they could drive towards you with a commercial and theme song playing .
7. In Car Design Segway
Have you ever went driving and wished you had your Segway with you ?
IGN has previously mentioned a wonderful collaboration between GM Europe and Segway .
As they and historyman4 show in the pictures , instead of carrying your bicycles on the roof or in the back when going for a weekend drive , you can haul your segway in an efficient trunk .
This Car concept aims to show us a place where Segway is used so often we would actually need a place for it in our cars .
Is that amazing or insane ?
8. Ferrari Segway
We are all aware of the name Ferrari and its connection to vehicles , so when it stamps an approval on a new Segway design , there probably is something we need to look at .
The Ferrari Segway design is a beautiful modification of the PTi2 model .
It does n’t perform like a true Ferrari in speed , but its beautiful red finish and logo make it a great concept .
The $ 12,000 price tag ?
That is a different story .
9. Offroad Segway
This Heavy Duty Offroad Segway definitely looks like the one who can finally take us offroad .
Loupiote ( Old Skool ) found this Segway with massive wheels at the Burning Man .
Those rugged wheels alone raise my trust in this ground vehicle .
10 . Wheelchair Segway
This Segway mod has been made such as the use of a wheelchair .
First of all , instead of standing you are at a sitting position .
A Fresh Creation goes on to explain of the hand brake provided , which allows the Segway to stand still .
It also has a folding handle to ease carrying it and offloading it from an actual automobile .
This great video below presents the Wheelchair Segway in action .
11 . Pimp My Segway
Pimp My Ride meets Segway !
Yakpimp has designed this Segway for a game called Project Salmonella .
It sports a large speaker out front when riding in your neighborhood , the flashy ( yet cheesy ) flare , but did you take a look at those rims ?
I can definitely see a kid cut a finger or two on those things .
I am certain there are many more unbelievable designs , concepts , drawings , and creations which were inspired by the true Segway product .
If you know of any , please share them with us below .
In May , I posted about
tariffs on hangers from China
, enacted to protect the only remaining domestic supply of hangers , M&B Hangers in Leeds , Alabama , and to " punish " Chinese manufacturers for " dumping . "
Economist Frank Stephenson now reports in
The Freeman
that hanger tariffs are responsible for doubling the price of hangers from $ 28 to $ 56 per box over the last year , which will cost each dry cleaner $ 4,000 or more per year .
Bottom Line :
If you thought your dry cleaning bills were high in the past , well " hang on , " because as surely as night follows day , higher hanger prices will be passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher dry cleaning prices .
Tariffs , which are simply taxes on Americans buying imported goods , ultimately " punish " U.S. consumers and firms with higher prices more than they " punish " China .
Further , Stephenson cites
this analysis
that divides the total cost of the hanger tariff to U.S. dry cleaners ( $ 4,000 x 30,000 dry cleaners = $ 120 million year ) , by the number of potential domestic jobs saved ( 564 jobs ) in the U.S. hanger industry , indicating that each American job saved costs us about $ 212,765 per year .
Since the typical full - time worker in this sector earns about $ 30,000 per year , it would be cheaper for the U.S. to eliminate the tariff , purchase cheaper hangers from China , let the domestic industry die , and pay each American hanger worker $ 30,000 per year to retire .
Like thousands of other examples , trade protection of inefficient American producers always imposes much higher costs to the country ( measured in higher prices and jobs lost ) than it generates in benefits ( measured in jobs saved ) .
And it 's usually not even close , it 's typically $ 2 in cost per $ 1 of benefits , or 2 lost jobs per job saved , when Americans are " punished " with trade protection .
Suzuki Swift Cup is on the second year and it will take place in 2009 in Britain .
Interesting in this competition is that pilots will be able to participate in all the races , only Suzuki Swift Sport Cup and the transport and technical support throughout the competition will be ensured throughout the Suzuki .
The competition has 6 circuits , and will continue with 5 more rounds in the MSA British Rally Championship .

Border Patrol agents are stepping up surprise inspections on domestic trains , buses and ferries , nabbing illegal immigrants far from the border .
In Vermont , Washington , Louisiana , New York and elsewhere , the agents , who have the authority to search any mode of transportation within 100 miles of the border , are working routes that do n't cross into Canada or Mexico .
Most checks are at bus and train stations and ferry terminals .
" The first line of defense is on the immediate border , " says Joe Giuliano , deputy chief in the patrol 's Blaine , Wash . , sector , which includes Alaska and Oregon .
" We have to have a second line of defense . "
In February , agents began checking passengers taking the ferry between Washington 's San Juan Islands and the terminal in Anacortes , Wash .
So far , Giuliano says , they have caught 59 illegal immigrants , two with criminal records , and eight U.S. citizens , most on drug violations .
The patrol started ferry checks after hiring more agents , he says .
" To be honest , it 's something we should have done for a long time , " he says .
" We were so short on resources . "
Immigrant and civil liberties advocates argue that the agents focus more on certain passengers based on skin color and accent .
" They will see a white person and ask , Where were you born ? '
Then they will see a person of color and ask , Do you have ID ? ' " says Caroline Kim with the Detainment Task Force in Syracuse , which provides bail for some detained immigrants and helps them through the legal process .
The Border Patrol says it does not engage in racial profiling .
Giuliano believes the inspections deter illegal immigrants and may be scaring off potential terrorists .
" They never know when we 're going to show up and what form we 're going to take , " he says .
In the agency 's Buffalo sector , which has about 400 miles of border , agents had arrested 1,786 illegal immigrants through transportation checks by the end of August , 11 months into the fiscal year , compared with 1,299 in all of last year , spokesman A.J. Price says .
Agents in the New Orleans sector , which covers seven states , have arrested 1,754 illegal immigrants on buses through Sept. 18 .
That 's a 32 percent increase overall of the last fiscal year , says assistant chief Ronny Kastner .
Japan 's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has announced his resignation during a news conference at his official residence .
The surprise announcement means the 72 - year - old is resigning less than a year after he took office .
His government has suffered chronic unpopularity .
Lost pension records , a controversial healthcare scheme and a sliding economy have added to his woes .
Mr Fukuda has also been frustrated by the upper house of parliament , which is controlled by the opposition .
" If we are to prioritise the people 's livelihoods , there cannot be a political vacuum from political bargaining , or a lapse in policies , " said Mr Fukuda .
He told the hastily convened news conference that a new team was needed to implement his party 's policies .
Low ratings
Mr Fukuda did not say when his resignation would take effect , adding that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party would hold an internal election to choose his successor .
" I believe there will be an election for the party leader , " he said .
" The leader will be appointed as the prime minister . "
Taro Aso is a former foreign minister and front - runner to succeed Mr Fukuda
Japan 's next general election must be held no later than September 2009 .
Last month , Mr Fukuda instigated a major cabinet reshuffle in which one of his main political rivals , Taro Aso , assumed the key role of secretary general .
The move was seen as a last - ditch attempt to shore up Mr Fukuda 's government and boost its flagging popularity , but it failed to impact low cabinet approval ratings , which had been below 30 % for several months .
Mr Aso , 67 , went from being foreign minister to becoming party secretary general under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in August 2007 .
However , following Mr Abe 's resignation , he left the post and lost the LDP leadership contest to Mr Fukuda soon afterwards .
Known for his conservative views , he has advocated a tough line towards North Korea and rejects changing the law to allow women to ascend the throne .
He is also seen as a charismatic figure who is known to love Japanese manga cartoons .

FYI : Mormon temple protest
by Jeremy Hooper
We hear there is some intense protesting currently going on at the Westwood Mormon Temple in Los Angeles , CA .
Some are already calling this a new Stonewall .
Watch raw video :
[ Alright , we 're pulling the video feed now .
However , you can still watch archived video form yesterday 's protest here : NewsRaw LIVE [ KNBC ]
Oh , and also :
Send a message to the Mormon Church , whose members raised more than $ 15 million to fund the deceitful advertising campaign for Proposition 8 , the initiative that takes away the right to marry for same sex couples in California !
Invalidate Prop 8
** UPDATE , 11/7 : Andy
Towle has some coverage :
Your thoughts
True the Mormon Church bankrolled Prop. 8 - But where are the protest of the 70 % of African - Americans and Catholics who voted for this .
I 'm following this story on other gay blogs but with the exception of a few namely Pam's House Blend no one seems to be addressing the fact that one of the largest group of US citizens who 've experienced first hand the harsh reality of a society that has discriminated against them voted for discrimination to be written into the CA Constitution !
Where is the outrage ?
Posted by : Alonzo | Nov 6 , 2008 5:38:27 PM
I think its deplorable that you were behind this .
I am a straight woman and I fully support everyone 's right to marry whomever they please .
That 15 million would have served a much better good feeding the hungry or homeless .
Or helping out in Darfur .
I am totally disgusted by your actions .
How dare you try to deny someone their constitutional right ?
Posted by : Trish | Nov 6 , 2008 5:46:29 PM
I no sooner clicked send on my email to a friend in which I stated that it 's time we start hitting back , and hard .
I mentioned that I saw a few calls on different blogs for protests and marches , even on Washington .
So then I click over here to see what is up , and this is the first story I see !
I 'd love to see the march continue , 24 hours / day even while services are going on .

Uhm Trish -- you realize this is a gay activism site , right ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Nov 6 , 2008 6:09:49 PM
Just an FYI - the temples are closed on sundays and mondays - Dec 7th all LDS Churches have testimony meeting were anyone can get up and say anything they like to the congregation ( this is at their Church / Ward building not the temples )

Looks like it 's getting a little out of hand .
No surprise there .
It only takes a couple of people out of the thousand or so present to get carried away .
Couple of arrests , noone hurt .
By the weekend , conservative websites will be taking the arrests as proof that all gay people are uncontrollably violent .

Trish might be using the phrase ' you were behind this ' to address any mormons who might happen on this site ...?

1 . This Prop was voted in because of our cultural homophobia , not some specific groups homophobia .
2 . There are not enough black or Hispanic voters in CA to be " responsible " for Prop 8 passin .
3 . People are outraged that fear and hate have won over reason and the foundations of the CA Constitution which regards equality as a right for everyone .
Let 's not add racism and other prejudices to this issue .
Posted by : Mariah | Nov 6 , 2008 8:59:25 PM
Mariah , I do n't think it 's a prejudice or racism to point out that there was a very high African - American turnout at the polls in support of Obama .
This is a good thing .
However , we must also recognize that many of those African - Americans are Christian and are know to be anti-gay .
It stands to reason that while many of them may have voted for Obama , it 's very likely they also voted in support of Prop 8 .
Can we think of this as analyzing the demographics of the vote instead of racial profiling ?
Afterall , we could be accused of ageism as well , when we talk about the number of sr. citizens who voted yes on Prop 8 .
Posted by : keltic | Nov 6 , 2008 10:10:35 PM
Mariah , racial prejiduce is not being added , at least not by most of us .
Every poll shows the homophobia in the black community .
Now that Obama is president - elect , they 've lost their last excuse not to confront their own bigotry , something we 're going to make them do .
The morman church supplied almost fifty percent of the funds out of its own coffers .
When you count the mormons who donated their own money at the command of their leaders , that figure is well over fifty percent .
Society 's homophobia bears a large part of the blame , but for providing so much of the funding , the Mormons are well deserving of our rage .
Those cultists will rue the day they tried to take control of our lives .
Posted by : RainbowPhoenix | Nov 6 , 2008 11:03:36 PM
ENOUGH with the BLACK thing ... NOT , NOT , NOT ... happening ...
CA is only 8 % black , even if 100 % were registered and voted and voted for PROP 8 they DID NOT in any way affect this outcome ... Just how many MORMONS are black ????
Come on .
Good cause folks ... lets get to it .
Jeremy do not cancel your plans yet .
We should get some sense from the Court how long they will take to decide on the new cases soon .
Ummmm ... do not know about Trish ... how did she get so mixed up ... ah well it is late .
Remember BE CAREFUL who you HATE ( H8 ) ... it could someone you LOVE .
Posted by : LOrion | Nov 6 , 2008 11:04:55 PM
Denying the fact that the majority of the black demographic voted for Prop.
8 is n't a great idea either .
It 's ironic that they 're voting for something that draws a chilling civil rights parallel to interracial marriage .
We can't point the finger and ' blame the blacks ' either , that 'd be racism .
It 's not their race that caused them to vote on Prop.
8 , it was their religion .
Honestly , I have not heard of a single atheist / agnostic voting for Prop .
8 . Its very existence relies on religious beliefs .
And currently in the newscast , some caller named ' Eric ' called in equating gay marriage to pedophilia and relating it to Satan and the number 666 somehow ... fuck , religion is a seriously disturbing mental disorder .
Posted by : asdsfas | Nov 6 , 2008 11:12:22 PM
Again ... all read the voting results .
86 % of all frequent CHURCH goers voted for the Prop ... that is PROTESTANT churches mostly as only 60 % of Catholics voted for it .
83 % of those who attend church infrequently voted AGAINST the PROP .
It was a religious vote NOT a racial one ( only 60 % of blacks voted for it ) ... 75 % of those under 29 voted against it .... so time will tell .
HERE IS THE CARD the LA Gay and Lesbisn center is sending out to the leader of the Mormon Church , in your name , if you make a donation to fight H8 of $ 5 or more : Dear President Monson :
A donation has been made in your name by L XXX XXX to “ invalidateprop8.org ” to overturn California 's Proposition 8 and restore fundamental civil rights to all citizens of California .
The money will be donated to legal organizations fighting the case and to support grass - roots activities in support of full marriage equality .
Although we decry the reprehensible role the Church of Latter Day Saints leadership played in denying all Californians equal rights under the law , we are pleased a donation has been made on your behalf in the effort to overturn the discrimination your church members helped enshrine in the California Constitution .
Given that throughout its history the Mormon Church has been subjected to bigotry , we hope you appreciate the donation in your name to fight religious bigotry here in California .
It was purely RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY that did this .
Any gay or gay friend that stays in one of these churches especially in the closet , is hurtiing themselves and all they love by doing so .. I do not believe even a benevolent God would forgive you for doing so .
Find an accepting denomination to join .. there are many , many out there .
Posted by : LOrion | Nov 7 , 2008 12:22:56 AM
African Americans comprise 6 % of the population in California .
Please lay off with the blaming ! teh blacks ! for Prop 8 passing .
It was a state - wide culture of homophobia led by lots and lots of nice whitey white people that passed that fucking prop .
Posted by : anneMarie | Nov 7 , 2008 1:51:47 AM
People vote according to THEIR special interests .
NO official funds from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints were made to support Prop .
8 . Private donations may have been made by members of the " Mormon " Church , however private citizens of the United Stats of America are permitted to donate to whatever cause they deem fit .
The gays are an extremely wealthy community , owning businesses , running large corporations , the majority of which dont have children of their own to have to pay for .
Why dont the gays raise their own millions and unite their pocket books ?
Posted by : Veritas | Nov 7 , 2008 3:19:56 AM
Uh , yeah Veritas , that 's great , way to ignore the fact that the president of their church basically told members to vote Yes .
Psst .
We had more money in and we still lost .
The problem is the existence of the stupidity that is religion .
Posted by : afd | Nov 7 , 2008 8:53:49 AM
To clarify , it 's not racist to discuss homophobia in minority groups .
It 's racist to BLAME said groups for Prop 8 passing when they do n't make up enough of the voters to have done so .
What I 'm seeing is a lot of blame and not enough real discussion .
Is homophobia within minority groups an important discussion ?
Yes .
But it 's actually separate from the larger issue of our collective homophobia as a country .
It 's a systemic problem .
Calling out minority groups or even religious groups for it is not going to get anyone anywhere .
It 's just divisive .
And it completely ignores the larger problem .
Which is that we as a country still have a long way to go in terms of combating homophobia .
Look , Prop 8 succeeded for any number of reasons .
Blame is about as helpful as writing angry posts on the internet .
We need to take responsibility , we need to work at changing minds , and we need to get ready for a long fight .
Civil Rights took a long time ... hopefully this wo n't take as long .
But we wo n't get anywhere if we focus on only one part of the bigger issue .
Posted by : Mariah | Nov 7 , 2008 1:44:07 PM
Mariah ,
You are absolutely right .
I have read a number of sites and the reactions to Prop 8 passing and the biggest problem we have is the fact that minority communities do n't have any reason to respect us .
We as a community need to do outreach in the " hoods and barrios " as one commenter put it to remind people that we are here .
We also need to address and deal with some of the racism in the gay community and work with our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters of color .
Racial minorities voted against us because they do n't " know " any gay people .
We need to help them see that there are people in their communities that are affected by this amendment .

I am an ex-mormon who had a rather heated debate with my sister last week on the topic of whether the church tells their members how to vote .
She says that the church does not pressure anyone to do anything .
I made the point that 99.9 % of members probably vote the same way , but I am curious : Can churches donate money to elections and candidates ?
The church takes 10 percent of their members income as tithing .
Can they use that money for political causes
Is there actual proof of the church sending out a memo asking or advising people to contribute ?
Are there rules about rich , non-profit churches who do n't pay taxes , interfering in the political process ?
My wife and I voted against the proposition and were sad to see it succeed ( even our kids saw through the BS ) , but it is equally disturbing that the " majority " can end up being people outside of California who have no business putting their noses into California politics .

I think this election may raise awareness of how much outsider money is used to influence local ( state ) issues .
Perhaps there should be a limit to how much out of state groups can contribute to any intiatives , propositions etc .
How would say , people in Colorado feel if a group from Georgia engaged in influence peddling on a local issue , one that does n't directly affect Georgians ?
States need to excerise the right to keep others from meddling in their business .

this is just an extension of their history , the 1857 murder of innocent women and children by mormons , the mountain meadows massacre .
I wonder why they were banned from political offices in early , Idaho , .... oh , yeah , it was their record of trying to take of politically and running non mormons out !!!!!

Look at this .
Yes on 8 reported $ 36,754,585.00
No reported $ 79,860,023.00 " No " had much more money ... so this is n't about $... it is about a certain group trying to infringe beliefs on others .
Religious groups consider marriage between a man and woman sacred since way back ... you know ... Adam & Eve. Homosexuals should stop trying to force people to accept their lifestyle .
You see , as christians , muslims , jewish ... we can not do this as it would be defying God 's request / warning to obstain from homosexuality .
So , you see , it is a deep conviction between the person and God .

Not only will people continue to support their religious doctrine , they will fight for it and have for may centuries .
Next will be a HUGE GIGANTIC BOYCOTT of all businesses / corp that contributed to NO on 8 .
EXAMPLES :
APPLE - $ 100,000
PGE 250,000
CA teachers union - 1 million Wow , CA TEachers are really worried about their schools ... giving all that $ instead of using it for deprived students .
PGE could 've given $ to seniors that will do without heat this winter , and APPLE ?
WTH !
I will never buy an APPLE product again .

One more thing .
BIG DEAL so your GAY .
Do you want a trophy ?
People are sick and tired of the media shoving GAYNESS down viewers throats like homosexuals are all heros .
If someone wants to be gay then be gay and leave the rest of the people ALONE .
Do n't try to change religious doctrine that was set by GOD .
People did not set the moral standards .... God did ... sorry , but that is the way it goes .
I 'm done ranting for now !
Posted by : Robin | Nov 8 , 2008 6:50:08 AM
Oh , Robin .
You 're a perfect example of what we 're up against : aggressive , bullying , unable to see the difference between personal religious faith and civil liberties , working from a place that says gay people want something " special , " etc. Seriously -- your comments sound like they came from a " pro-family " caricature of our own creation .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Nov 8 , 2008 8:46:37 AM
G - A-Y ,
Thank you for saying that I am a perfect example of what " you " are up against .
Yes , I 'm happy to be agressive when needs be .
" BULLY ? "
That seems a bit far fetched ... I simply gave my firm opinion and stated some financial facts supported with the link to " ELECTION TRACK " .
Yes , my comments do sound like they are pro-family because that is exactly the kind of person that I am and I am not ashamed to claim that .
Are you " anti-family " ?
Civil VS religious ?
Yes , I thouroughly understand the difference .
Marriage is a religious ceremony and is a sacred institution to join a man & woman & God .
I 'm glad that millions of people agree with me and voted that way ( twice ) .
I never said that a person could not be homosexual .
That is an individuals choice to follow that road .
But , to many faiths , same gender marriage is a mockery of a sacred institution .
Why are homosexuals not happy with current civil rights that homosexuals already hold ?
Must they mock God to be happy ?
Posted by : Robin | Nov 8 , 2008 9:34:12 AM
" Civil VS religious ?
Yes , I thouroughly understand the difference . "
No dear , you do not .
But here , I 'll give you an assignment : ( 1 ) Go have a religious ceremonial marriage without getting a civil license .
( 2 ) Go get a civil license without having an ancillary religious ceremony ( which is always an option ) .
See which choice will allow you to obtain the rights and benefits of marriage .
Then , with what you 've learned , try to understand that it is the latter concept for which gay activists are fighting .
Churches will always be free to deny any couple that they want !!
Nobody is trying to rob you of your religious freedom .
In fact , it 's enraging that your side thinks we CARE so much about the religious ceremonies in which folks choose to engage .
How arrogant .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Nov 8 , 2008 10:03:56 AM
I have no need for your assignment .
I am already married .
I had no problem getting a license or getting a minister to perform the religous promises .
I guess the problem your having is that you are same gender and I married the heterosexual way .
However odd , you mentioned your rage towards faithful people that simply want to protect their relgious ceremony of marriage , even calling them arrogant .
You see it is not really that arrogant to desire legal protection .
If homosexuals had been granted same - gender marriage ... then it would highly threaten many faiths that would refuse to perform such same - gender joinings .
In this litigious world many would purposely ask priests / ministers / rabbis / clerics to marry them and upon refusal would most likely sue the congregation and possibly the entire denomination .
Kind of like the ole " slip - n - fall " lawsuit .
The same goes with business owners that might have deep conviction to avoid supporting this same - gender marriage ..../ they could be sued for refusing to make a wedding cake etc .
Infact , everyone has heard of the current lawsuits regarding gay rights .
I myself have been victim of this .
I was forced to hire a less qualified homosexual just to avoid a lawsuit .
This lesbian took total advantage of the company crying " gay rights " for every part of the job she did not want to do , she was a very poor performer and could not be fired ... because you guessed it ... gay rights .
So you see buesiness owners may feel that there is nearly always some element of manipulation or legal ramifications of being involved with homosexuals .
Nobody wants their chaples , mosques , synagogues , temples etc defiled by performing an act that they believe God forbids .
Which , by the way , the title of this forum is " FYI , Mormon temple protest " I have not heard of any protest at Baptist , Methodist , Seik , Hindu , Luthern , Catholic , Bahai , Islamic , Jewish , Greek Orthodox , Four Square , Presbyterian , Amish , Quaker , Menonite , Budhist , Masonic , Anglican , Evangelical , Seventh Day Adventist buildings .
Why do the Mormons get so much attention ?
What about the rest of us ?
Posted by : Robin | Nov 8 , 2008 10:58:39 AM
Jeff Roth ,
Your comment about a massacre interested me .
I decided to check that out further .
Well , here is the story I understood : Evidently , the U.S. govt had declared war on the mormons and had issued an order to send some troops to Utah to again try to get rid of the mormons .
At this time , Utah was not part of the US .
The mormons had sought refuge and settled there because they were run out of the U.S. by mobs that murdered many church leaders and members , raped women and stole developed properties , homes and and beautiful temples .
Very sad story and an embarrssment to the US history .
Anyway , when a particular group of southern mormons found out about the troops coming they were hyped up to defend themselves and gained confidence with the local native americans to help them fight .
Then a large & wealthy wagon train came through the territory bragging about how they had the gun that killed their prophet J. Smith and that they were gonna do the same to Brigham Young .
The wagon train was mad because the mormons would not give them grain for their cattle .
( although they did sell grain for human consumption )
The mormons were trying to conserve .... not knowing how this war with the US was going to go .
Anyway , a small group of mormon men decided to kill the people on the wagon train ( except the younger children ) .
It seems that they thought history would repeat itself and this wagon train would do the same thing and take their property and temples again and join up with the U.S. in the fight .
A very sad thing .
They considered it an act of war and massacered the people .
However , the leaders of the church did not condone this attack and the man seemingly in charge received the death penalty .
Sad story .
Especially sad when the entire church might be judged merely upon the horrible acts of a few rengades in the 1800's .
I say perhaps people should look at all the good that this mormon church does today .
www.lds.org/humanitarianservices
I think many religions have a part of history that is a scar on their souls .
What matters is the people NOW and how they do good for others .
Infact , I bet most religions will readily help any person in need .... gay or straight , without regards to race or age ... however , when they try to protect sanctity in mariiage ... suddenly they are the people from hell .

Madeleine Pickens , wife of the eccentric billionaire tycoon T. Boone Pickens , wants to ride to the rescue of a beleaguered national icon .
The wild horses that have been an emblem of the wide - open American
West for centuries more recently became a major headache for the federal government , which routinely removes some of the horses from 1o Western states to prevent overpopulation and protect grazing land .
But as the Bureau of Land Management 's ( BLM ) holding facilities grew crowded , federal officials gingerly announced that they were considering a euthanasia program to cull the herds at their facilities and contain costs .
Pickens , a racehorse breeder and lifelong animal lover , said she was horrified when she learned about the problem .
" There 's got to be a way to bypass [ the BLM ] -- why does it have to be Washington to solve the problem ? " said Pickens , who , along with her husband , airlifted 800 cats and dogs stranded by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and brought them to California for adoption [ Washington Post ] .
Pickens approached BLM officials and suggested an alternative :
She would buy 1 million acres of rangeland somewhere in the West , and convert it into a permanent retirement home for the roughly 30,000 homeless and unwanted horses .
Pickens says she envisions a refuge that 's open to the public , where tourists could sleep in log cabins or tepees to get a taste of the frontier experience .
" You should n’t be coming to this country to see Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck , ” she said .
“ We are more than that .
We are a country that was formed on horseback and we should enjoy it , not slaughter it ” [ Dallas Morning News ] .
The wild horses and burros would be sterilized , Pickens said , so they would n't contribute further to the overpopulation problem , and additional animals rounded up by the BLM could gradually be brought in to the refuge .
About 33,000 horses still make their homes on the range , but the BLM hopes to bring that number down to about 27,000 .
Tom Gorey , a bureau spokesman , said the agency welcomes her offer .
“ Right now we could n’t be more pleased with her interest and we hope that materializes so that we can get many of these horses out of holding , ” he said [ Dallas Morning News ] .

Colin Powell Meet the Press Obama Endorsement VIDEO
, retired U.S. Army General and Secretary of State from 2001 - 2005 made an announcement today on Meet the Press that has startled some and pleased others .
The Republican has endorsedfor President .
Citing a 25 year relationship with his friend John McCain , Powell lays out his reasons for throwing his support to a Democrat .
One factor appears to be McCain 's choice of Sarah Palin as his VP pick .
Check out the video below .
Mesh WiFi firm Meraki released an addition to its hardware family of routers today with a wall - plug adapter ( $ 179 ) .
The Meraki Wall Plug , which features a hole to screw the unit to an outlet , complements the existing Indoor ( $ 149 ) and Outdoor ( $ 199 ) nodes .
Meraki's hardware includes access to ( and requires use of ) a hosted back - end management console .
The Wall Plug is part of Meraki's push for apartment buildings and complexes ( multiple dwelling units or MDUs , in real - estate parlance ) .
The company said it will offer a $ 5,000 bundle aimed at MDUs that will cover 100 to 150 apartments or other units .
The company also said that their long - awaited Meraki Solar would ship December 4 .
A worldwide run on solar power equipment when oil prices spiked increased the price of the panel required for the unit .
The price of the Solar model runs from $ 749 for a bring - your - own - panel model up to $ 1,499 for areas with shorter days or less light .
Company cofounder Sanjit Biswas said that Meraki also decided to change the battery type after receiving feedback from beta users , which is part of what led to the 1 - year delay .
In winter or monsoon season , the beta product " would run out of juice in a couple of days with no sun . "
Customers said that they needed guaranteed 24 - hour performance , and Meraki switched from sealed lead - acid to lithium iron - phosphate for greater capacity .
Biswas said this dropped the weight , too , which reduces shipping costs for the many remote areas that the Solar unit has been tested in and will likely be used .
Meraki Solar is available with different
panel options , including bring your own
Biswas said that Solar was used in a lot of places the firm did n't expect–anywhere that power was n't available , such as parks , but also where even though an electrical outlet would be installed , there were ancillary costs .
Some customers would say , Biswas noted , " A union electrician is going to cost me a couple of thousand dollars . "
He said that many Meraki customers were " choosing to do Wi-Fi because it was a relatively low - impact amenity to offer , " so the higher initial price of Solar was easily canceled out by lower installation and recurring costs .
Biswas said that Meraki continues to extend its market into areas it did n't predict , such as small enterprises : firms of 50 to 200 employees that cover large areas , such as doctors ' offices or shopping malls , and that outsource their information technology services .
" That 's a surprise for us : it 's not just about public access , sometimes it 's just about plain Wi -Fi access , even internally , " Biswas said .
The centralized management console is a plus for this segment because Meraki customers can manage accounts and operations themselves after a system is set up , or use an integrator for remote help .
Biswas noted that the console and hardware now support enterprise features , including WPA2 Enterprise ( 802.1X plus WPA2 ) , quality of service ( for VoIP and streaming ) , and multiple SSIDs ( for running several virtual networks with different access privileges ) .
The system has scaled to manage thousands of devices on a single network , as well .
Meraki sticks a pin worldwide on where networks are operating .
Meraki highlighted a customer installation in Chile , which they only found out about after the network lit up on their map showing active installations .
In Lebu , a fishing village 300 km from Santiago , residents had no real Internet access , although there was both a satellite feed and an E1 ( similar to a T1 ) leased line .
A local integrator lit up the town for about $ 20,000 in less than a week , and the network now has over 1,000 regular users .
Biswas said , " They 're using all the same sites that you and I would use . "
The city is n't charging for service , because it found " the collection costs would be too high , " Biswas said .
He noted , " We 've seen this model replicated elsewhere in Latin America , " where a feed is spread throughout a town , taking residents from no Internet access to low - end broadband .
( Meraki allows bandwidth shaping for shared access . )

Obama ’s first move as President - elect is a good one
While I ’m sure there are still millions of Republicans throughout the country mourning John McCain ’s electoral shortcomings , there is another group within the Party that realizes that you have to suck it up and move on .
Even though some might not like it , the fact of the matter is that Barack Obama is going to be the next President of the United States .
It would be too easy for me to just sit back and attack the prospects of an Obama presidency , so instead of being another talking head , I figure that for the time being , I ’ll just call things as I see them .
If you ’re a frequent reader of this blog , you know first hand that I do n’t subscribe to Party talking points .
With that , it brings me no dissatisfaction to praise President - elect Obama in his selection of Congressman Rahm Emanuel as White House Chief of Staff .
Despite that fact that Rahm Emanuel and I disagree on many issues , I think that he brings a point - of - view that will be healthy for setting the tone of the Obama Administration .
Yes , I ’m sure you think I ’m crazy right about now .
However one of the biggest doubts that people have about Barack Obama is whether or not he ’ll be able to make the right decision should the United States , or one of our allies face significant conflict .
For those of you who know about Rahm Emanuel , odds are you also know that he comes from a very devout Jewish family ( he ’s Orthodox ) and is one of the most ardent supporters of Israel in the United States Congress .
In fact , during the Gulf War , Congressman Emanuel even volunteered to serve with the Israel Defense Forces .
I think it ’s extremely symbolic for a candidate who was attacked for allegedly being Muslim and anti-Israel , to make a modern - Orthodox and openly pro-Israel Congressman the first pick of his Administration .
Furthermore , let ’s not forget that in Congress his nickname is “ Rahm - bo , ” due to his aggressive nature of getting things done .
Do n’t expect him to hide his opinions from President Obama , especially when it comes to issues ( like Israel ) that he is passionate about .
The Chief of Staff is one of the few people in the Administration that havs daily access to the President , so there should be no doubt that Rahm Emanuel will play a key role in President Obama ’s decision making process .
While I do n’t think that I ’m going to agree with all of President - elect Obama ’s choices , I definitely believe that he has started his trek to the White House on the right foot by picking Congressman Emanuel .

Advertisement Future astronauts could benefit from a magnetic " umbrella " that deflects harmful space radiation around their crew capsule , scientists say .
The super - fast charged particles that stream away from the Sun pose a significant threat to any long - duration mission , such as to the Moon or Mars .
But the research team says a spaceship equipped with a magnetic field generator could protect its occupants .
Lab tests are reported in the journal Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion .
The approach mimics the protective field that envelops the Earth , known as the magnetosphere .
Astronauts ' risk
Our star is a constant source of charged particles , and storms that arise on the Sun 's surface result in huge numbers of these particles spilling into space .
As well as this plasma , or " solar wind " , high velocity particles known as cosmic rays also flood through our galaxy .
The Earth 's magnetosphere deflects many of these particles that rain down on the planet , and our atmosphere absorbs most of the rest .
The first time we switched it on , it worked
Ruth Bamford International space agencies acknowledge that astronauts face a significant risk of ill health and even death if they experience major exposure to this harsh environment .
And even the spacecraft themselves are not immune to the effects .
A solar flare crippled the electronics on Japan 's mission to Mars , Nozomi , in 2002 , for example .
But researchers from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ( RAL ) , the Universities of York and Strathclyde , and IST Lisbon have shown how it might be possible to create a portable mini-magnetosphere for spaceships .
People scale
In its experimental set - up , the team simulated the solar wind in the laboratory and used magnetic fields to isolate an area inside the plasma , deflecting particles around the " hole " .
It was not initially clear the idea would work , said Ruth Bamford , who led the research .
" There was a belief that you could n't make a little hole in the solar wind small enough to do this at all , " Dr Bamford , from RAL , told BBC News .
" It was believed that you had to have something very large , approaching planetary scale , to work in this way . "
The team has had to take into account the physics of plasmas at the comparatively tiny human scale .
To create its metre - sized trial , the team used a plasma jet and a simple $ 20 magnet .
" The first time we switched it on , it worked , " said Dr Bamford .
What is more , the trial field seems to adjust itself automatically .
" It does have the capacity to be somewhat self - regulating , just like the Earth 's magnetosphere is , " Dr Bamford explained .
" When it gets a strong push from the solar wind , the bubble gets smaller .
The video shows us increasing the pressure of the solar wind , and the shield gets smaller but brighter . "
Power issues
Many more experiments are needed , Dr Bamford admits , to understand how best to harness the effect ; and a practical implementation is probably 15 to 20 years away .
The approach mimics how the Earth 's magnetic field deflects particles
To protect a spaceship and its crew , she said , the craft itself might carry the magnetic field generator .
Alternatively , it was possible to envisage a constellation of accompanying ships dedicated to the purpose of providing the umbrella where it was needed most .
The approach will probably also work with a field that is not on constantly , but cycles on and off - conserving the power that is precious on long - term missions .
The details of how to cycle the field and control its shape must be hammered out , however .
" There 're a lot of things to work out , like control , reliability , weight to launch , and so on , " said Dr Bamford .
" I do n't think it 'll come down to as little as sticking fridge magnets on the outside of the spacecraft . "

A book criticial of the religion of Scientology has been pulled from British bookshops and the UK branch of online retail site Amazon due to " legal reasons " .
Irish author John Duignan said he was " dismayed and furious " at Scientologist attempts to have the book banned but " not at all surprised given the Church 's record on freedom of expression " .
Mr Duignan 's book is still on sale in Ireland , however .
Titled ' The Complex : An Insider Exposes the Covert World of the Church of Scientology ' , it explores Mr Duigan 's experiences while a member of the church .
In it , he claims Scientologist conditioning made him prepared to kill on behalf of the cult and subjected him to harsh indoctrination techniques .
The church is famously litigious .
Earlier this year it threatened to sue online magazine Gawkers for posting a clip of church member and Hollywood actor Tom Cruise preaching the virtues of the religion .
The clip made Mr Cruise appear deluded and incoherent .
This post continues on from Part 1 of this series .
You 'll find much of this content has been used before in these previous posts , although post does include content updated for F# 1.9.6.2 ( the September 2008 CTP ) .
The first thing we need to do is – as with any AutoCAD .NET project – add project references to AutoCAD ’s managed assemblies , acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll .
With F# ’s integration into Visual Studio 2008 you do this in exactly the same way as you would for a C# or VB.NET project , by selecting Project -> Add Reference ... from the pull - down menu or right - clicking the project inside the Solution Explorer and selecting Add Reference ... from the context menu .
Here you then browse to the AutoCAD 2009 folder and filter for * mgd * files ( at least this is the way I do it ) , and select the two we want :
Figure 10 – Adding project references to AutoCAD ’s managed assemblies
Now we need to make sure AutoCAD recognizes a module within a namespace , from which it is able to load commands .
I found – by using .
NET Reflector – that the appropriate structure is to declare your functions as the contents of a module ( this needs to come after the # light directive ) :
module MyNamespace .MyApplication
Next we ’re going to specify the .NET namespaces we ’ll be using inside this application :
open Autodesk .AutoCAD .Runtime open Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices open Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices
We ’ll then skip past our definitions of words and sortedWords , and define our command function :
[ < CommandMethod ( " Words " ) > ] let listWords ( ) = //
Let 's get the usual helpful AutoCAD objects let doc =
Application .DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument let ed = doc .
Editor let db = doc .
Database // " use " has the same effect as " using " in C# use tr = db. TransactionManager.StartTransaction ( ) ; //
Get appropriately - typed BlockTable and BTRs let bt = tr.GetObject ( db.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForRead ) :?>
BlockTable let ms = tr.GetObject ( bt.[BlockTableRecord.ModelSpace ] , OpenMode.ForRead ) :?>
BlockTableRecord let ps = tr.GetObject ( bt.[BlockTableRecord.PaperSpace ] , OpenMode.ForRead ) :?>
BlockTableRecord
Most of this section should be familiar to anyone who has used the .NET API to AutoCAD – there are really only a couple of ideas that may need explanation :
The use keyword is just like C# ’s using – but we do n’t use curly braces to define scope .
The scope gets defined as the remainder of the function in which the use statement has been used .
Once the function completes the used object will be disposed of automatically .
We ’re using the dynamic cast operator ( :? > ) to specify the type of object we ’re opening with GetObject ( ) .
This operator involves a query to check whether this is valid – if we wanted to do a static cast we could use :> instead .
Now we have opened our modelspace and paperspace objects ( we could go further and open other layouts , but – once again – I ’ll leave that as a follow - on exercise for those who feel the need to do it :-) we can look at the code we need to extract the text from our database - resident objects .
Let ’s start by defining a local function which takes an Object Id and uses it to open an object , and for a textual object ( DBText or MText ) it will return its contents :
// A function that accepts an Object Id and returns // a list of the text contents , or an empty list .
//
Note the valid use of tr , as it is in scope let extractText x = let obj = tr. GetObject( x , OpenMode .
ForRead ) match obj with | :?
MText as m -> m. Contents | :?
DBText as d -> d. TextString | _ -> " "
Once again we have n’t specified the type of the argument – this will be inferred by the system – but we could very easily do so .
We ’re using the transaction previously started in the listWords function – the reason for defining extractText local to it – which is quite valid , as it ’s in scope .
After opening the object for read from its ID we ’re using pattern - matching – a technique that is a huge timesaver for functional programmers – to check on the type of the object and return the appropriate property of it .
This is just like a much cleaner switch statement in C# .
We could choose to match against any property of the object , but in our case we want to check the type , so use this operator : :?.
The as keyword is a syntactic shortcut that defines a value we can then use to easily dereference the object and get at its properties and methods .
The final clause of the three is a wildcard : it will match all object that are not DBText or MText objects and return an empty string .
Now that we can get at the contents of our text objects , let ’s write a quick recursive function to display the contents of the final list of words inside AutoCAD :
// A recursive function to print the contents of a list let rec printList x = match x with | h :: t -> ed. WriteMessage ( "
" + h ) ; printList t | [ ] -> ed. WriteMessage ( "
" )
Once again , this is a local function , so using our Editor ( accessed via the ed value ) is quite valid .
We ’re using pattern - matching again to create a recursive function ( indicated via the rec keyword and then the recursive call to printList ) .
When we find an empty list ( [ ] ) we simply print a newline , but when we find a list with a head ( h ) and a tail ( t – which may well end up being empty , by the way , we ’ll find out the next time we recurse into printList ) , we print the head and recurse with the tail .
One thing to look out for when defining recursive functions : they really need to be defined as tail - recursive , which means that the recursive call should be the last operation .
This allows the compiler to perform tail call optimization , which replaces the declared recursion with a simply while loop inside the generated code .
Why does this matter ?
Well , calling a function does have some overhead , as stack space is required to store information about the function and its arguments , so if we have a list of 10,000 words to print and the function has n’t been optimized , the recursion could cause problems .
( The number could be 100,000 or 1,000,000 , but the point is there is a number ) .
The above code does get optimized properly ( even if the pattern for the empty list comes after the recursive call – it ’s really about the position of the recursive call in the clause that recurses , rather than the overall program ) , and this is easy to check with .
NET Reflector .
In fact there ’s an article on my blog covering just this :
http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/02/using-reflector.html
Seq.to_list ( Seq.cast ms ) @ //
Create a list of modelspace ids , Seq.to_list ( Seq.cast ps ) |> // appending those from paperspace List.map extractText |> //
Extract the text from each object sortedWords |> //
Get a sorted , canonical list of words printList //
Print the resultant words
A couple of comments on the above plumbing : ms and ps are both IEnumerable types ( which correspond to the Seq class in F# ) , but are both untyped .
This means we have to cast them , to be able to access them properly from F# , and then we can simply call Seq.to_list to get the contents into a list .
The @ operator appends the list of ObjectIds of objects in modelspace with those in paperspace , and we then pipe the list into a call to List.map which runs our extractText function on all the objects in the combined list .
The results get piped into our sortedWords function , and we finally print them to the command - line using our recursive printList function .
Finally , we ’re just going to call commit on our transaction object , as for performance reasons this is currently best practice :
// As usual , committing is cheaper than aborting tr. Commit ( )
That ’s it for our first AutoCAD application .
Let ’s see the entire listing :
# light // Declare a specific namespace and module name module MyNamespace .
MyApplication open Autodesk.AutoCAD .Runtime open Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices open Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices // Partial application of split which can then be // applied to a string to retrieve the contained words let words = let seps = " \t~` !@ # $ %^&*() - =_+{} |[ ]\\ ;':\" <>? ,./" seps.ToCharArray ( ) |> Array.to_list |> String.split let sortedWords x = List.map words x |> //
Get the words from each string List.concat |> //
No need for the outer list Set.of_list |> //
Create a set from the list Set.to_list //
Create a list from the set //
Now we define our command [ < CommandMethod ( " Words " ) > ] let listWords ( ) = //
Let 's get the usual helpful AutoCAD objects let doc =
Application .DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument let ed = doc .
Editor let db = doc .
Database // " use " has the same effect as " using " in C# use tr = db. TransactionManager.StartTransaction ( ) ; //
Get appropriately - typed BlockTable and BTRs let bt = tr.GetObject ( db.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForRead ) :?>
BlockTable let ms = tr.GetObject ( bt.[BlockTableRecord.ModelSpace ] , OpenMode.ForRead ) :?>
BlockTableRecord let ps = tr.GetObject ( bt.[BlockTableRecord.PaperSpace ] , OpenMode.ForRead ) :?>
BlockTableRecord //
Now the fun starts ... //
A function that accepts an Object Id and returns // a list of the text contents , or an empty list .
//
Note the valid use of tr , as it is in scope let extractText x = let obj = tr. GetObject( x , OpenMode .
ForRead ) match obj with | :?
MText as m -> m. Contents | :?
DBText as d -> d. TextString | _ -> " " //
A recursive function to print the contents of a list let rec printList x = match x with | h :: t -> ed. WriteMessage ( "
" + h ) ; printList t | [ ] -> ed. WriteMessage ( "
" ) //
And here 's where we plug everything together ...
Seq.to_list ( Seq.cast ms ) @ //

Introducing parallel processing in AutoCAD via F# Asynchronous Workflows
As mentioned previously , pure functional code lends itself to be run on multiple computing cores in parallel .
While the tools are n’t yet there to make this happen automatically – via implicit parallelization – this is a likely outcome , over the coming years .
For now we have the possibility of writing code that uses explicit parallelization – where we specify the tasks we know can be executed at the same time and leave the language and runtime to take care of the coordination .
There are a couple of ways to do this , right now : the Parallel Extensions to .NET ( also in CTP stage and due for inclusion in Visual Studio 2010 ) provide a number of parallel constructs , such as parallel versions of for and while loops .
F# currently provides the capability to define and execute Asynchronous Workflows , which is what we ’re going to look at now .
First , let ’s take a look at a sample application that we ’re going to parallelize .
This sample goes through and queries , via RSS , the latest posts on a number of different blogs .
It then generates AutoCAD geometry – text with a hyperlink – for each of these posts .
So we turn AutoCAD into an RSS reader , for all intents and purposes .

I have numbered the lines , to make it easier for us to talk about the changes that are needed to introduce parallelism into this sample .
Both synchronous and asynchronous versions of this application are available on my blog .
I wo n’t go through the above code in detail , here : firstly , it ’s not intended as a perfect implementation of an RSS consumer – there are too many variations in the way RSS is implemented by different sites , so I know for a fact that this code will not work for certain blogs – it ’s really intended to be an example of a – potentially time - consuming – asynchronous ( in this case network - based ) activity that is easy to run in parallel .
A word of caution : AutoCAD is not thread - safe – it is very much a single - threaded application – so we need to coordinate the results of these tasks prior to making the changes to the AutoCAD database .
Luckily
F# makes this very easy for us to do , so that ’s really not a problem .
Here is the updated source that makes use of Asynchronous Workflows , with the modified / new lines highlighted in red ( with a grey background for those reading this in black & white :-) :

Let 's look at the specific changes :
Line 7 has been changed to allow both files to be part of the same project .
Lines 45 - 50 implement a new , asynchronous function to download content from a URL .
The async primitive coordinates a set of activities , while the let ! and use !
statements indicate that these right - hand side of the operation will be run asynchronously and that the results should be bound to the left .
So here we 're only getting the HTTP content asynchronously - the reading is to occur synchronously .
Lines 131-134 implement an asynchronous task that not only calls our asynchronous HTTP request function but coordinates the creation of AutoCAD geometry based on the contents received .
Lines 207-211 are where we make use of these newly - defined functions by firing them off in parallel ( the framework will use the processing capabilities available to it to execute the tasks as efficiently as possible ) and coordinating the results into a single array , which we convert to a list to maintain our previous processing code .
When we run either the RSS or ARSS ( its asynchronous version ) , we should see this kind of result :
Figure 11 – AutoCAD geometry created from our RSS feeds
Now let ’s see how they compare in terms of performance .
I executed the RSS and ARSS commands a number of times in sequence to get a feel for relative performance .
Command : rss Elapsed time : 00:00:08.1958195 Command : arss Elapsed time : 00:00:02.2802280 Command : rss Elapsed time : 00:00:04.1264126 Command : arss Elapsed time : 00:00:03.6343634 Command : rss Elapsed time : 00:00:03.6563656 Command : arss Elapsed time : 00:00:01.9891989 Command : rss Elapsed time : 00:00:03.1673167 Command : arss Elapsed time : 00:00:03.1223122 Command : rss Elapsed time : 00:00:05.7375737 Command : arss Elapsed time : 00:00:01.9391939
The first execution time is much higher due to an initial startup penalty or the need to fill some page cache with the content .
On average , though , the asynchronous code runs in 60 - 70 % of the time needed by the synchronous version .
The code was run a dual - core notebook : some of the performance will be related to using both cores , but most will be due to the parallelization of asynchronous tasks that have some latency due to use of the network .
With more accesses in parallel you would see this performance difference become increasingly exaggerated .
Click to viewWhile the next iteration of the ubiquitous Microsoft desktop operating system , Windows 7 , is n't a dramatic overhaul of its predecessor Windows Vista , it does fix several sore spots and add a few welcome features .
Rumor has it that Windows 7 will drop in the middle of next year , but last month Microsoft released a " preview " tester build of Windows 7 .
After living in the Windows 7 Preview for a week now , several features and niceties jumped out at me which promise to make Windows a better place to work come 2009 .
Let 's take a look .
Note : The Windows 7 Preview is a pre-beta release , which means it 's not even close to feature - complete .
Chances are good that later releases will add or take away features listed below ( though most likely later releases will grow these seeds and add a few more goodies ) .
Second note : Surely Windows 7 includes stability and performance improvements under the hood with highly technical explanations that would make operating system coders very happy .
However , this list is purely from my experience as a regular user , living and working with Windows 7 for about five days .
Here are just a few of the things to look forward to in Windows 7 .

10 . Ding - dong , the Sidebar is dead .
One of the first things I hunted down and killed in Windows Vista was the Sidebar , which loaded by default and docked Vista 's Gadgets to the right side of your desktop .
In Windows 7 , the sidebar is no more , and gadgets , should you want them , can roam free across the desktop .
This time around , the gadgets feel less distracting to me — the CPU meter and calendar gadgets are my favorites , though this screenshot shows many more .

9. Calculator , WordPad , and Paint got overhauled .
It sucks that Windows 7 is stripping the built - in Photo Gallery and movie - making software that you 'll find in Vista ( even the Windows Calendar is nowhere to be found in the 7 Preview ) , but a few of their built - in stalwarts did get some attention .
WordPad and Paint both got the Office 2007 ribbon installed , and Calculator now incorporates real world uses into it .
At this point only masochists still use Paint and WordPad , but the extension of the ribbon to those inconsequential programs may be a harbinger for more upgrades and ribbon appearances in the future .

While I 'm running the Windows 7 Preview on a plugged - in desktop computer , notebook owners will be thrilled to know that Windows 7 promises to run more efficiently and thus longer on battery .
Our brother site Gizmodo reports :
Vista 's power management was definitely better than XP's , and Windows 7's is remarkably better still .
Part of it is just that whole smarter background management , which for battery life does things like dial down the processor more often , use less juice to play a standard def DVD , automatically turn off your Ethernet adapter , common sense stuff like that .
But it does n't just do all this fancy energy - saving jujitsu behind your back ( though it can ) .
Windows 7 is capable of delivering a battery efficiency report that breaks down in detail what 's chomping on your battery - power - slurping hardware , vampire -y processes , the works .

7 . You can switch between Wi -Fi networks in one click from the system tray .
File this under " a small change can make a huge difference " : Click on the Wi-Fi adapter in your system tray to pop up a menu of available wireless networks .
From there you can refresh the list , and choose the one you want to connect to in one click .
Another boon for roaming notebook users .

6 . You can decide what you do and do n't want to see in the system tray .
No more registry - editing to blanket - disable balloon notifications in your system tray !
Windows 7 lets you set what icons and notifications you see in your tray with a detailed dialog box .
Just right - click the system tray and choose " Customize ... " in the menu .

5 . You get more control of User Account Control .
The single biggest complaint about Windows Vista was its User Account Control 's incessant , nagging , pop -up dialogs that would ask you if you were ABSOLUTELY SURE you wanted to do the thing you just told the computer to do .
In the name of security , Vista would even check if this STRANGE and SCARY program called Notepad was ok to run :

While legions of Vista users would sacrifice the well - intentioned security that User Account Control offered by turning it off completely just to get their sanity back , in Windows 7 you can fine - tune the level of nags , warnings , and confirmation prompts you get .

4. Libraries group similar content ; Homegroups to make sharing libraries easier .
Windows networking is a pain in the ass , but Windows 7 is out to fix that with two things : content Libraries and Homegroups .
Libraries are a way to group similar types of files even if they live in different folders .
For instance , your Video library could include your TV folder , Movies folder , DVD Rips folder , and your Home Movies folder .
Then , you can create a Homegroup ( basically a reworking of Windows ' existing Workgroups ) , that makes sharing those libraries between PCs easier .
Since I do n't have two Windows 7 boxes available , I was n't able to test how much easier sharing files was between the machines ; however , the whole file - sharing layout and UI looks significantly more intuitive for regular Jolenes who just want to view the photos stored on the office computer in the living room .

3 . You can instantly snap your windows to size , and clear the desktop in one motion .
As widescreen monitors become more common , easier side - by - side window management is key — and Windows 7 builds that in .
While not as configurable as a third - party program like GridMove , Windows 7 offers the ability to snap a window to half your screen size simply by dragging it to the left or right of the screen .
Here 's what it looks like when you do so — let go of your mouse button and that Lifehacker browser window would snap that half - screen - sized glass overlay you see behind it .

Along similar lines , the new " Aero Shake " feature lets you clear the desktop of all background windows by grabbing the top bar of the active window and moving it back and forth quickly .
Here 's a screencast of the shake in action .

2. Windows 7 starts up faster .
Scheduling your morning coffee run for the time between the moment you hit the power button on your PC and actually start working sucks .
Windows Vista is sloooooow when it comes to starting up and getting you to your desktop ; but even the Preview tester release of Windows 7 shows 20 % faster boot times than Vista .

1 . You can do MUCH more from the Windows 7 taskbar .
Most people live with the Windows taskbar visible on their desktop at all times , so the more use you can get out of the real estate it hogs , the better .
Windows 7 's taskbar is greatly improved in two ways .
First , you can pin programs to it indefinitely for easy quick launch , similar to RocketDock or the Mac OS X dock .
Second , on a crowded desktop covered with windows , using the new " Aero Peek " feature , you can preview individual windows from grouped taskbar apps , and even close documents from the thumbnails themselves .
This does n't sound like a big deal in theory , but in practice when you 've got two monitors and a dozen windows open from four apps , Peek comes in way handy .
Here 's a screencast of Peek in action .
( Note : The Windows 7 Preview 's version of Peek is yet incomplete ; this is just the beginning of what you 'll be able to do with it . )
Click to view
There 's also a permanent " Show Desktop " button on the far right of the taskbar which both clears the Desktop of all windows ( instant Boss button ! ) and restores them right to where they were in another click .
As you can see , Windows 7 is a big pile of small improvements over Vista that amount to a lot in aggregate .
As such , ordering this list was difficult , since there is n't an obvious , stand - out , " here 's why you 'd definitely upgrade to Windows 7 " feature .
It 's simply better in many little ways .
So now , YOU tell us :

Skateboarding is a passionate sport and like all professional sports , having the facilities available to help you improve is the first step to improving techniques and continuation of the passion .
Having your own skateboard ramp although requires a fair amount of space , once erected you will without a doubt wonder why you never got around to it earlier .
Building a skateboard ramp can be as simple or sophisticated as you want it to be .
From simple quarter pipes that are portable to entire indoor rooms dedicated for skateboarding at fitted with a variety of sized ramps .
Having a plan before gathering your power tools together is important ; consider the type of ramp that best suits your skill level and the space that it will be installed .
Begin by sketching out your ideas on paper ; this will give you an idea of what the job involves and how to go about achieving it .
Measure twice cut once
Once you have your ideal skate ramp on paper , ensure you understand the measurements so you can build it to scale .
MDF or plywood can be used for the sides of the ramp , use plans and templates if you have any to outline the shape , otherwise fishing line is a great choice to assist in marking the desired curve as it does n’t bend like string .
Depending on how wide you wish your ramp to be , cut out support joists in preparation to connect sides of the ramp together , remember to brace joists over recommended spans if you plan on having a wider skateboard ramp .
It is easy to get ahead of yourself when starting any DIY project , but remember to measure twice and cut once to minimize unwanted labour .
Joining ramp together
There will be different parts of the ramp you will need to connect together .
Deck screws are common .
Bracing and secondary support from other parts of the ramp can add to the overall strength and stability of the joining part , although skateboarding does not create heavy impacts , it should be strong enough to withstand any fall that can be encountered whilst performing on a skateboard .
Installing surface layers
Three main options apply for surfacing the frame , the first layer of the surface should always be untreated plywood followed by the top layer which can be a material called ‘ skatelite ’ , it is the best skate surface on the market and is weather resistant but is expensive .
Masonite is a surface that is thin , a brown looking board that is made from steamed wood chips and pressed to form hardboard .
It is relatively affordable and makes for a smooth skate surface , however masonite will warp if rain gets to it so needs to be painted and sealed for protection .
The third option is to install a second layer of plywood , but note that plywood is not weather resistant so it too should be painted and sealed for protection .
Finishing touches
Complete the skate ramp by installing a suitable round metal pipe that spans across the width of the ramp .
Drill a 12 mm hole on one side wide enough for an extended Philips head and use a self - drilling metal screw to fix the inside of the pipe to the frame .
It is n’t difficult to build your own skate ramp and the accomplishment you get can be very rewarding .
Skateboarding is a sport that can be enjoyed by all ages and having your own skateboard ramp to cater for the available space you have will bring significant joy to any skateboard enthusiast .
POSTVILLE , Iowa — Oscar Andres has worked on the poultry line at the kosher meat producer Agriprocessors here since September and he says that a few dead chickens always make it out of company holding pens and onto the slaughter line conveyor belt .
On October 31 , though , Andres said that nearly half the chickens coming down the conveyor belt were dead — many of them rotting so completely that when he went to pick up the legs of the chickens they would fall out of the body .
“ It was really terrible , ” said Andres , a 29 - year - old who came to work at the factory from Palau .
“ It ’s really hard in the close conditions that we work — this bad smell was everywhere .
It ’s like we work and throw up at the same time .
Even myself , I was throwing up .
It ’s really , really bad — but they never stop .
They keep us going and going . ”
“ We have never experienced anything like this before , ” Andres added .
The Friday on which this happened was just one day after Agriprocessors , the beleaguered kosher meat producer , ran into its greatest legal difficulties yet .
On Thursday October 30 a bank sued Agriprocessors for defaulting on a $ 35 million loan .
That same day , the former CEO of the Iowa slaughterhouse , Sholom Rubashkin , was arrested for allegedly helping undocumented immigrants land jobs at the plant .
The arrest and lawsuit came a few months after Agriprocessors was the subject of a massive federal immigration raid in which nearly 400 workers were arrested .
A company spokesman , Chaim Abrahams , was asked on November 2 about the proliferation of dead chickens on the slaughter line , and said : “ I have no idea . ”
He declined to answer any other questions .
Previously , the company had not responded to multiple calls for comment .
Agriprocessors ’ financial difficulties have been building — early last week , all beef production was halted .
But the company ’s struggles were nowhere more gruesome than in the ongoing effort to produce poultry last week .
Jeff Abbas , who runs the local radio station , said that it appears the company has not been able to come up with the money to feed the live chickens that it still has .
Father Paul Ouderkirk , a priest at Postville ’s Catholic church , said he has been hearing reports from workers “ telling us that they saw trucks of poultry sitting there for days . ”
Indeed , the evening of November 1 , after the plant had been closed for more than 24 hours , a reporter driving around Postville came upon two tractor trailers full of turkeys in an otherwise depopulated parking lot near the slaughterhouse .
The turkeys had been left with no apparent food or water .
The white - plumed animals were four to a cage , and a rough count indicated that the two trucks held over 1,000 animals .
A number of turkeys appeared to have already died .
The trailers full of birds were in the same place early the next morning .
In the lawsuit seeking to initiate foreclosure proceedings , the bank , First Bank , said that it needed to take control of the company ’s assets before the assets , including the live poultry , were destroyed .
“ First Bank is informed and believes the millions of chicks and chickens in the Borrowers ’ inventory are in danger of starving to death , ” the suit stated .
Andres said that the plant ’s chicken production had been decreasing steadily over the last month , and this week dropped to below half of what it was when he arrived .
Andres ’s eyes were noticeably red and swollen , and he said he has had a persistent sickness from the conditions inside the slaughterhouse .
But he said it has been the nature of his work during the last week that has been particularly distressing .
In addition to the dead chickens , Andres said , most of the living chickens on the conveyor belt were still very young .
“ Some of them were still without feathers .
Like naked chickens .
They ’re really small , like this small , ” he said gesturing with cupped hands .
“ I asked my supervisor why we are killing them , ” Andres said .
“ He just said , ‘ This is what we have . ’
He would n’t give any more of an answer . ”

Tall , broad - shouldered , mustached , Michael Kostiw looks like the former oilman and CIA case officer in Africa he once was .
Now , as Republican staff director for Sen.
John McCain on the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee , Kostiw , 61 , is probably the closest top former CIA official to the Republican presidential candidate , and is discussed as a possible candidate for a senior intelligence position should McCain win the presidency .
But his relationship with his former Agency is complex .
Standing in his large office in the Senate Russell building on a quiet day during August congressional recess , Kostiw shows off a pair of wooden statuettes that were given to him by an African nation ’s ambassador — and longtime top official in his country ’s government — to Washington .
The envoy , Kostiw says , is an old contact that he proposed trying to recruit two decades ago when he was a CIA case officer in the country .
But his Agency boss at the time waved him off the recruitment , saying , “ That guy is n’t going anywhere . ”
It ’s a small but telling anecdote in an almost two - hour conversation with a man whose career trajectory from CIA Soviet East Europe division operations officer to Texaco oilman to co-vice chair of the International Republican Institute to top Porter Goss and McCain Senate aide may signal what a McCain presidency would mean for the intelligence community — and why many from the CIA are quietly worried about a McCain presidency .
The Bush years have been brutal for the CIA , which was pilloried for getting Iraq intelligence wrong while accused of downplaying and withholding intelligence from the White House that would have justified military action .
Many current and former US spies expect a McCain administration guided by neoconservatives to treat them with hostility and mistrust .
They also say McCain would likely weaken the CIA by giving broad new spying authorities to the Pentagon , which CIA officials believe is more amenable to giving policymakers the intelligence they want , while being subject to less congressional oversight .
These critics point especially to the McCain campaign ’s top national security adviser Randy Scheunemann — who ran a front group promoting war with Iraq and the fabrications of controversial Iraqi exile politician Ahmad Chalabi , the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , and who has lobbied for aggressive NATO expansion .
Scheunemann ’s record , they argue , encapsulates everything wrong with the past eight years of Bush leadership on intelligence issues , from a penchant for foreign policy freelancing and secret contacts with unreliable fabricators , to neoconservatives ’ disdain for the perceived bureaucratic timidity of the CIA and State Department , to their avowed hostility for diplomacy with adversaries .
If McCain wins , “ the military has won , ” says one former senior CIA officer .
“ We will no longer have a civilian intelligence arm .
Yes , we will have analysts .
But we wo n’t have any real civilian intelligence capability . ”
“ McCain would be an absolute disaster , ” says a second recently retired senior US intelligence operations officer .
“ He is prejudiced against the CIA .
The day after the 2004 election when Bush won , McCain came on TV and gave an interview in which he said something to the effect of , ‘ The CIA tried to sabotage this election .
They ’ve made their bed and now they have to lay in it . ’
I used to like McCain , but he is inconsistent . ”
Columnist Robert Novak quoted McCain in November 2004 as saying , “ With CIA leaks intended to harm the re-election campaign of the president of the United States , it is not only dysfunctional but a rogue organization . ”
McCain is influenced by a circle of hardline Republican legislators and congressional staff as well as disgruntled former Agency officials “ who all had these long - standing grudges against people in the Agency , ” the former senior intelligence officer said .
“ They think the CIA is a hotbed of liberals .
Right - wing , nutty paranoia stuff .
They all love the military and hate the CIA .
Because the CIA tells them stuff they do n’t want to hear . ”
But Kostiw says such fears are overblown .
He insists that McCain ’s national security inclinations are more independent than the neoconservative caste of his campaign ’s advisory brain trust would suggest .
“ McCain on intelligence will favor an OSS - type agency , ” Kostiw said , referring to the CIA ’s World War II - era predecessor organization , the Office of Strategic Services .
What does that mean ?
“ An effective intelligence professional element that will take risks and will be responsive to civilian control and made up of the best and brightest officers the US has to offer . ” A civilian agency ?
“ It has to have a civilian function , but will have a vast military element as well .
I always say , you have to keep the Central in the Central Intelligence Agency . ”
“ Lots of people talk to John on foreign policy matters — not just Randy Scheunemann , ” Kostiw adds , ticking off a list of realist Republican foreign policy hands : Brent Scowcroft , national security adviser to President George H.W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , General Jim Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , former defense secretary James Schlesinger .
But are these people really in McCain ’s inner circle ?
“ The inner circle is the critical issue , ” Kostiw concedes .
“ There has been a battle within the McCain campaign between neoconservatives and realists , but by and large , neoconservatives hold the high ground , ” says a former White House official now advising the Obama campaign on intelligence issues , on condition of anonymity .
“ And some of their positions have been deeply troubling , ” he added , citing McCain ’s proposal to kick Russia out of the group of eight leading industrialized countries .
Kostiw downplays any damage done by the McCain camp ’s rhetorical hostility to Moscow .
And he says that McCain has been around so long , he is not overly susceptible to the influence of his national security brain trust .
“ I ’ve been in meetings with McCain , where some adviser is discussing a policy issue , ” Kostiw said .
“ And at the end , McCain thanks them and says he ’s made up his own mind , and the outcome is the other way . ”
Take his position against torture , Kostiw points out , a position that put McCain at stark odds with the Bush / Cheney White House .
But former CIA hands say they have heard such reassurances from Kostiw before — about former House intelligence committee chairman Porter Goss , who served as CIA director from 2004 until his sudden resignation in 2006 — and they proved delusionally unfounded .
“ Mike [ Kostiw ] is a nice guy , ” says the former senior CIA operations officer .
“ But this is the guy who sat around talking to all of us when Porter came in [ as CIA director in 2004 ] , and told us how much Porter respected us , and not to worry about the stories we hear .
He was trying to reassure us that Goss was not out to destroy the Agency .
He told us everything is going to be fine . ”
Goss ( for whom Kostiw was a special adviser ) brought to Langley several ultrapartisan House Republican aides — the “ Gosslings ” — whose hostility to the Agency ’s senior operations officers and conviction that they were not loyal to the Republican president was so blatant , it led to the angry departure of the two top operations veterans — and dozens more — and sent morale plummeting .
After Goss ’ proposal that Kostiw serve in the CIA No. 3 spot crumbled when it was leaked that Kostiw had been fired from the Agency two decades earlier , allegedly for not paying for a package of bacon from a grocery store ( some colleagues say that was just the cover story , and that Kostiw had in fact left the Agency for other financial - related reasons ) , Goss , against the advice of senior CIA officers , appointed a controversial , womanizing administrative officer , Kyle “ Dusty ” Foggo , to be the CIA executive director .
Foggo ’s indictment on corruption charges related to the Congressman Duke Cunningham corruption case in May 2006 coincided with Goss ’ abrupt resignation the same month .
( Foggo is slated to go on trial in October . )
The top two Agency operations vets who had quit in disputes with the Gosslings — Steve Kappes and Michael Sulick — returned to the Agency after Goss ’ departure .
And Kostiw , after serving as Goss ’ “ special adviser ” at the Agency , went to work for McCain on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Kostiw may insist that a McCain presidency would steer away from his advisers ’ ideological zeal .
But his fellow former intelligence officers are skeptical , fearing his assurances will prove as overly optimistic as his promises to them about Goss .
Soul Brotha # 1 , better known as Rush Limbaugh , has clarified who is black and who is not .
Seriously .
He may not look like it , but Rush apparently has deep knowledge legitimate blackness .
Taking issue with polls that say some white blue collar workers are leery of Barack Obama because he is black , Limbaugh choked and gargled and spluttered , and gave a quick lesson in blackology : " He 's not black , " he said of Obama .
Not a " shred of African - American blood " in him , Limbaugh ranted .
" He 's Arab . "
Arab , Arab , Arab , Arab .
Honestly , where to start here ?
Rush 's point , apparently , is that bigotry and prejudice are fine ( he 's Arab !
Arab , Arab , Arab , Arab ) , but it 's important to be bigoted for the right reasons .
So anti-Arab bias seems OK .
Being anti-black ?
Well , in the snippet he does n't say .
But Obama has a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya .
He was born in the U.S. and spent all but four years of his childhood in Hawaii .
He 's a long - time practicing Christian .
But Rush , let 's address some of your points :
A : You say Obama is not black .
He 's disqualified from blackness as you define it because his father is from " Arab " parts of Africa .
You mean , the Arab parts like Kenya ?
That 's sub-Saharan Africa , Rush , and there are lots of black folks there .
Besides , you 've got ethnicity and religion all twisted up .
A person does n't have to be Black or Arab .
There are Black Arabs ; there are white Arabs , Arab Christians ( a big population in Israel ) as well as Arab Muslims etc .
But of course , that 's not really what you mean .
You 're using code language for " Muslim " and your listeners should n't need more than that be scared of him .
Clever .
Ignorant , bigoted , fear - mongering and underhanded , but definitely clever .
B. Now for your assertion that Obama is n't African American .
Who could be more so ?
He is literally of African and American descent .
What 's so funny about this is when the term African - American came into vogue , people like you , Rush , railed that it was ridiculous because the link to Africa for many black Americans is distant .
Now you have a man whose link is recent and he does n't qualify either .
Oh please .
But many people who call themselves African Americans , like Irish Americans or Italian Americans or Armenian Americans , are acknowledging not only ancestral connection , but the unique experience of being from somewhere else , or having parents or forebears from somewhere else , and assimilating here in the U.S. Like Obama .
C. Shreds of blood ?
What the heck are those ?

The " Burdick Print "

Abstract
The Burdick Print ( or Burdick Track ) is claimed by some strict or " young earth " creationists to be a " giant man track " from Glen Rose , Texas .
However , it is one of several prints on loose blocks of rock which show strong evidence of a carved origin , and is acknowledged by Glen Rose residents to be one of the carvings made by George Adams in the 1930's .
It shows serious anatomic errors as well as subsurface features which truncate at the print 's surface , confirming it 's carved origin .
Furthermore , the orientation of algal fossils in the rock suggests that the original " up " direction was the side opposite the alleged footprint .
In other words , evidently the carver unwittingly created the print on what was originally the bottom side of the rock .
Introduction
Many creationists once claimed that fossilized human footprints or " man tracks " occurred alongside dinosaur tracks in Paluxy Riverbed near Glen Rose , Texas , supposedly refuting evolution and the standard geologic timetable .
However , careful investigations of the Paluxy evidence in recent years have shown that the alleged human prints involved a variety of misidentified phenomena , including metatarsal dinosaur tracks , erosional markings , and a smaller number of doctored and carved specimens -- most of the latter on loose blocks of rock ( Cole and Godfrey 1985 ; Kuban 1986a , 1986 b , 1986 c , 1989 ; Hastings 1987 , 1988 ; Strahler , 1989 ) .
In the wake of these developments most creationists have largely abandoned the " man track " claims , although a few persistent individuals continue to promote them , including Carl Baugh and Don Patton .
This paper focuses on a loose rock slab called the " Burdick Print , " which Baugh and Patton claim to be genuine giant human footprint ( Patton , 1990 ) , but which is shown to be a carving by several lines of evidence .
History
Several known loose " man tracks " are reported to have come from Glen Rose , Texas , or nearby areas .
Four of the slabs are strikingly similar in appearance : all having long toes , very wide ball , and other abnormal features , possibly indicating a common carver .
At least three such " long - toed " slabs still exist , including the " Burdick track " and two slabs that led paleontologist Roland Bird to Glen Rose in 1938 ( discussed below ) .
A fourth long - toed slab is known only from a photograph .
Yet another slab , often called the " Caldwell track , " has a very different appearance ( with short toes and narrower ball ) ; although still promoted by Carl Baugh and a few others , it was shown to be a definite carving years ago ( Neufeld , 1975 ) .
Figure 2 . The Burdick Print ( side view ) .

Two of the " long toed slabs " were first publicized after being seen by Roland T. Bird in a trading post near Gallup , New Mexico in 1938 .
Bird immediately recognized the tracks as carvings , but wondered what prompted someone to make them .
His curiosity was further piqued upon seeing four dinosaur track carvings in a nearby shop .
After learning the tracks reportedly came from Glen Rose , Bird redirected his travel route to that location , leading to his now famous dinosaur track excavations there ( Bird 1939 , 1954 ) .
While in Glen Rose Bird asked about the " man tracks " but the only specimen the locals were able to show him was a single , indistinct elongate depression , which Bird speculated was made by an unknown dinosaur .
Evidently Bird was on the right track , so to speak , since it is now known that elongate ( metatarsal ) dinosaur tracks are common in the area , and have often been mistaken by locals and creationists for " man tracks " ( Kuban , 1986 b ) .
Such tracks may have initiated the first " man track " rumors among local residents in the early 1900's , and perhaps inspired the early " man track " carvings ( along with economic need during the Great Depression ) .

In 1939 Bird described his work at Glen Rose in Natural History magazine , mentioning the loose " man track " slabs he has seen in Gallup and the single elongate " mystery " track , neither of which he considered genuine human tracks .
However , a completely different impression was soon fostered by some creationists .
In 1950 and 1955 Burdick published articles in The Signs of the Times claiming that clear human tracks exist in the Paluxy Riverbed .
Rather than showing photographs of " man tracks " in the riverbed itself , the only Glen Rose " man tracks " Burdick pictured the two loose slabs Bird had seen in New Mexico .
Burdick implied that the pictured slabs were examples of genuine " man tracks " that Bird had seen in the riverbed and removed from it , which was not the case .
Other " man track " claims based on the same loose slabs were made by John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris in the popular creationist book The Genesis Flood ( 1961 ) .
The authors implied that the pictured Gallup slabs were perfectly natural in appearance and known to be genuine tracks chiseled out of the Paluxy .
Likewise , creationist A.E. Wilder - Smith failed to distinguish between the loose slabs and the alleged human tracks in the riverbed , and even implied that Bird had cut out clear human tracks .
( 1968 , 1975 ) .
Later , other creationists ( including John Morris , Henry Morris ' son ) were more skeptical of these and other loose " man tracks , " and instead focused on supposed in situ human tracks in the Paluxy riverbed .
Where the Gallup slabs came from before Roland Bird saw them in New Mexico is uncertain , but some sketchy information exists .
According to John Morris , Burdick 's early investigations in the 1940's led him to Al Berry , who was in possession of these and other track slabs .
Berry signed an affidavit stating that he and his friend Jack Hill ( who owned the store where Bird saw the Gallup slabs ) went to Glen Rose in September of 1938 to retrieve some " human " and " cat " tracks which were in danger of being destroyed by the construction of a small dam on the Paluxy river .
However , there is reason to believe that if these tracks were present in the riverbed , they may have been carved there before Berry and Hill arrived -- perhaps by George Adams .
This conclusion was supported by Robert Gentry , who once believed the prints genuine , but later changed his mind based on some unspecified information that came to him ( Morris , 1980 , p. 115 ) .
It is also possible that the tracks were never in the riverbed , but carved on loose blocks from the start .
In any case , there is no in situ documentation for these tracks , which immediately compromises their scientific value .

According to John Morris , the Burdick track ( the right - foot slab ) was purchased " years ago " by Burdick from a Rev. Beddoe of Arizona , who in turn had purchased the track from the late Pessee Hudson , proprietor of a knick - knack store in Glen Rose .
Morris added that " many things were purchased in that store , including some of George Adams carvings . "
Morris continued , " tracing the print proved impossible , but it was reported to have come from a tributary south of Glen Rose . " ( 1980 , p. 117 ) .
More recently Carl Baugh and Don Patton claim that based on clues from " old timers " in Glen Rose , and comparison of matrix features , they traced the source of the Burdick Track to the Cross Branch of the Paluxy .
However , they did not provide any documentation of the lithologic match , nor evidence that rocks from other tributaries or outcrops around Glen Rose would not have matched .
Neither did they report finding any evidence of a trackway there from which the Burdick Print would have came , nor evidence that the Cross Branch contained any other tracks ( human or otherwise ) .
Morris was equivocal about the authenticity of the Burdick track .
His analysis listed several supposedly positive aspects about the track ( none of which are valid , as discussed further below ) .
He also neglected several serious problems with the print .
However , Morris acknowledged that it might have been carved , and that it is considered a carving by most researchers ( 1980 , p. 118 ) .
During the 1970's most other creationists also questioned or rejected this print and other loose track slabs .
In the early 1970 's Stanley Taylor and crew investigated several Paluxy sites and promoted various " man track " claims in articles and their widely viewed film Footprints in Stone ( 1973 ) , but acknowledged that the loose slabs were probable carvings .
In 1970 the Loma Linda team cross sectioned the Burdick track across the ball ; although the team considered the subsurface features ambiguous , they concluded that the track was a probable carving , based on its external features and the knowledge that similar tracks were carved in Glen Rose .
They also sectioned one of the Gallup slabs and a " cat " slab , both of which they found to be probable carvings ; and the Caldwell track , which they concluded to be a definite carving ( Neufeld , 1975 ) .
In the 1980 's the anatomical problems with the loose slabs were further elucidated by mainstream workers ( Cole et al , 1985 ) .
Around 1983 the Burdick track was acquired from Burdick by Carl E. Baugh , who began excavating and promoting alleged " man tracks " in Glen Rose in 1982 .
Baugh regularly displays the Burdick track in his Creation Evidences Museum , and prominently featured it in his table display at the 1986 International Creation Conference ( ICC ) in Pittsburgh , Pa. , where I was allowed to inspect and photograph the slab .
Figure 4 . Burdick
Track showing new cuts made through toe and heel areas .
In 1990 the Burdick track was re-sectioned ( Figure 4 ) across the toes and heel under the direction of Carl Baugh and Don Patton .
Subsequently Patton promoted the track in the MIOS newsletter , which requested donations for a new museum display of the track ( Patton , 1990 ) .
At the 2nd International Conference on Creationism in 1990 , Patton displayed and sold photographs of the new cross sections , claiming that they showed subsurface deformation lines proving the print authentic .
However , others at the conference , including the current authors and creationist paleontologist Kurt Wise , observed that the alleged pressure features were algal structures truncated by the print depression , indicating that that track was carved .
Nevertheless , Carl Baugh and Don Patton continued to promote the track as genuine ( Baugh , 1996 , 2005 ) .
Print Morphology
The Burdick track is on a tan limestone slab about 18 inches long by 13 inches wide by about 5 inches thick .
The print depression itself is " giant sized , " approximately 15 inches ( 38 cm ) long by 7 1/2 ( 19 cm ) inches wide ( across the ball ) .
It is about an inch deep at the deepest parts ( the ball and big toe ) .
The general shape of the print depression is not that of a genuine human print .
The track boundaries and features are distinct ( eliminating the possibility that abnormalities are due to slippage , turning , or mud-slumping ) , but not anatomically correct .
The length of the print alone is not necessarily an objection , since such foot lengths are occasionally encountered .
However , the track proportions and other features are very abnormal , even for a 15 inch foot .
The print is too wide at the " ball " and too narrow at the heel , giving the print an almost triangular shape overall .
The length to ball - width ratio is about 2.0 , compared to a typical range of 2.4 to 2.8 for normal , clear human tracks .
The toes depressions are far too long , and the " big toe " is too narrow .
The lengths of outermost two toes are especially abnormal , being nearly twice the expected lengths .
Also , all four lessor toes show peculiar , multiple joint or pad marks .
On a normal print the lesser toes normally register as mere dots .
Don Patton suggested that the shape of the toes was due to " turning , " but the print shows no indication of lateral foot movement , and a normal foot would not produce toe marks of this shape even if the foot had turned .
As anthropologist Laurie Godfrey observed while discussing the long toed slabs , it looks as if a carver was looking at the top of his foot rather than at the bottom while making the toes ( Godfrey , 1985 ) .
Another problem is that a line drawn across the top of the toes would form an almost diagonal straight line , in contrast to the normally prominent downward curve from the big to the smallest .
Burdick and a few others have suggested that a raised ridge between the first two toes supported the authenticity of the print and would be " almost impossible to carve . "
Actually this feature would be easy to carve -- requiring merely the reduction of the surrounding material ( even that would be unnecessary if the original rock happened to have a raised area here ) .
Missing from the track is a raised transverse ridge that normally separates the ball from the toes .
The ball itself is too straight across the top , too wide latitudinally , too far forward ( especially at the center ) .
The latter abnormality relates to another problem : a prominent mound near the center of the print ( which intrudes into the ball ) .
This mound evidently was intended to be an arch , but is misplaced and malproportioned ( it should be closer to the inner edge ) .
This misplacement creates an unnatural trench near the inner edge .
The heel is too narrow and angled toward the rear ; a normal print has a more prominent , distinctly ovoid heel depression .
One might object that the print proportions of a " giant " individual might be slightly different from those of a normal - sized person .
Unfortunately for the " man track " advocates , to the extent that the print proportions would vary , they would do so in a manner opposite the pattern seen in the Burdick print and similar long - toed slabs .
For example , the great toes of " giant " individuals would tend to be relatively wide and short .
As Laurie Godfrey noted , the carver " not only did a poor job of reproducing the shape of a human footprint , but they erred in the wrong direction " ( 1985 , pp. 20 - 21 ) .
Don Patton has claimed that Dallas " James Donaldson , " a Dallas " football player " has a foot over 3 inches longer than the Burdick track ( making his foot over 18 inches long ! )
Evidently Patton meant James Donalson , a Dallas Mavericks basketball player , who wears a size 18 shoe ( which translates to a foot about 13 1/ 4 inches -- almost 2 inches smaller than the Burdick print ) .
Patton also claimed , based on a recent Natural History article ( 1990 ) , that certain Indian tracks have almost the same length / width ration as the Burdick print .
However , this applies only to the foot - length / toe - width ratio ( since these Indians have well splayed toes ) .
The more important and static foot - length to ball - width ratio for the Indian tracks is about 2.6 , which is normal for human tracks .
Moreover , the overall shape of the Indian prints is clearly human , and differs in significant ways from the Burdick print .
Other External Features
The surface of the Burdick track contains many small pit marks unlike known track surfaces in Glen Rose .
The sides of the slab show many chisel marks , which like the pit-marks , are reminiscent of the carving technique described by Wayland Adams .
Don Patton ( 1990 ) claims to have found the outcrop from which the Burdick track was taken , but has not documented that the bed contains any tracks , or that it contains pit patterns like the Burdick track .
The upper right area of the slab contains a curved incision which John Morris suggests is a " circle " suggesting that the removed of the track began to chisel at this point but then decided to widen the circle to reduce the chance of damage .
However , the incision is not a circle or anything close to it , and alternate explanations are equally plausible .
A carver may have decided to trim the block down ( either before or after carving ) at the point of the incision , and then changed his mind .
Some larger holes ( near the toes ) and some slash - like marks ( mostly in the heel ) also occur on the Burdick track .
They have been claimed by some to be evidence of authenticity , on the assumption that carving would erase them ( Morris , 1980 , p. 121 ) .
However , the holes may be invertebrate burrows , and may well have been deep enough to survive carving .
The slash - like marks may be remnants of chiseling .
None of the marks constitute evidence of genuineness .
The print margins are largely flat and lacking in " mud up - push " features , which are usually , though not always , found on real tracks .
There is a small raised area at the back of the heel , but this could be carved by reduction of material behind it , or due to a natural irregularity of the original rock slab .
Cross Sections
During the 1970's the track was sectioned longitudinally near the left edge , and diagonally through the ball .
In 1990 the track was sectioned twice across the toes , and once through the heel .
These five sections would expose 10 surfaces .
Figure 5 . Cross section through the toe area of Burdick Print .
Both surfaces of the ball section and one of the longitudinal surfaces ( on the track side ) were inspected and photographed by one of us ( Kuban ) at the ICC in 1986 .
Photographs of some of several recently exposed surfaces were examined by both authors at the 1990 ICC in Pittsburgh .
One of us ( Wilkerson ) requested from MIOS permission to examine photographs of the remaining surfaces , and was denied .
The inspected sections show elongated semi-circular stromatolite ( algal ) structures .
Some of the algal structures happen to partially overlap some the toe depressions , prompting Patton to claim that the structures are pressure lines .
However , the structures are distributed through much of the subsurface without regard to the location of the toe marks or other print depressions .
Further , wherever the structures meet the print depression , they are truncated by the depression and / or not in proper coincidence with it .
The nature of these structures is further described below .
Figure 6 . Cross section through the heel of Burdick Print .
Note the truncated features .
Although it is uncertain exactly where the slab on which the Burdick print originated , its general composition is typical of various limestone beds in the Glen Rose area .
Moreover , one can deduce from certain algal features that the slab was already detached from its host formation when the print was carved .
Indeed , as will be explained further below , the algal features seem to indicate that the " print " occurs on what was originally the underside of the original slab -- providing still further evidence of carving .
Limestones are often formed by calcium secreting algae .
Algal limestones are distinguished from other types of limestones by their characteristic small - scale stromatolite structure .
The algal colonies grow upward in concentric layers that have a tear drop shape .
The narrow end of the tear drops point downward .
This orientation can be used to deduce the " up " direction in the rock .
Many stromatolites from 1 /4 to 3/4 inch in diameter are seen in the cross sections of the Burdick track .
The truncation of these structures at the bottom edges of the " print " indicates that complete structures once existed , but have been partly removed .
The stromatolite morphology , with upward rather than downward curvature , indicates that the sedimentological " up " direction of the rock slab is opposite the " up " direction of the print ; in other words , the print was probably carved on the bottom of the slab .
Coloration
Some of the stromatolitic structures have red-yellow discoloration .
Algal organisms act as a mechanical trap for iron ( magnetite ) and other metals .
They also act as an agent for chemical precipitation of metals because they provide the necessary reducing environment .
Minute amounts of iron , upon oxidization and / or hydration form hematite and limonite , red and yellow - colored minerals respectively .
These colorations are formed by the action of oxygenated ground waters subsequent to deposition and have nothing to do with formation or preservation of the track .
Requirements of Authenticity and a Prediction
Not all prints will show subsurface striations ( depending on the nature of the host sediment ) .
However , any bedding lines in the substrate should be consistently deformed by the track indentations , and should be similar for all the individual toe depressions .
This clearly is not the case with the Burdick track .
Besides showing poor consistency with the track depressions in general , there are dramatic differences in the features ( or nonfeatures ) under each of the toes .
If the track were authentic another necessary condition would be that any deformational lines seen in one section should be well matched by a nearby section .
If , on the other hand , the alleged deformational lines are really stromatolite structures , one would not see the same relationship to the track indentations as in the displayed section .
Specifically , since the stromatolite structures are generally semi-spherical , their individual axes would be significantly offset in the other section .
This prediction could be tested by examination of the other toe section , which MIOS has not made public .
Baugh and Patton have sold and published photographs only of those sections that they considered helpful to their case .
They have been selective in their use of data and have not made the entire data set available to other researchers .
Conclusion
The Burdick track contains severe anatomic errors as well as abruptly truncated subsurface algal structures , indicating that it is a carving .
The carver probably took a piece of limestone from a local outcrop , and carved a print ( or enhanced an existing vague depression ) on what was originally the " bottom " of the rock .
The knowledge that similar tracks were carved in Glen Rose , and lack of in situ documentation for the track , further undermine claims that the track is genuine .
Creationists would do well to abandon the Burdick track as anti-evolutionary evidence .
Editor 's Note
Don Patton of MIOS was invited to submit a companion paper giving his interpretation of the Burdick tract , but declined .

McCain brother calls 911 over traffic , says 'f - -k you ' to operator David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Early this week , Sen. John McCain 's brother Joe , while in Alexandria , VA , called 911 because he was irritated with traffic .
When the operator asked him if he was really calling the emergency line to complain about highway conditions , Joe McCain responded , " F - - k you " and hung up .
According to WJLA 7 in Alexandria , the operator dialed the caller back .
Shockingly enough , Joe McCain 's voicemail answered .
Audio of the call plays out as such :
Operator : " 911 , state your emergency . "
Caller : " It 's not an emergency but , do you know why on one side at the damn drawbridge of 95 traffic is stopped for 15 minutes and yet traffic 's coming the other way ? "
Operator : " Sir , are you calling 911 to complain about traffic ? "
Caller : " F - - k you . "
When the emergency operator called back , she was greeted with , " Hi this is Joe McCain .
I can't take this message now because I 'm involved in a very ( inaudible ) important political project ...
I hope on Nov. 4th we have elected John . "

Natural vs. Artificial :
There are two " persons " identified in law .
These are " natural - person " and " artificial - person " .
See Government Tricks for more details .
A natural - person is defined as " A human being that has the capacity for rights and duties " .
Note that the word capacity means the ability , but not the obligation for rights and duties .
An artificial - person is defined as " A legal entity , not a human being , recognized as a person in law to whom legal rights and duties may attach - e.g. a body corporate " .
Sometimes an artificial - person may be referred to as a CORPORATION , which is not always the same as an Incorporated Company .
These subtle re-definitions are made in Statutes whenever the Government wants to change the meaning of the word .
There are many different types of artificial - persons , each with different duties .
Here are a few different types of artificial - persons :
Taxpayer , Resident , Driver , Voter , Citizen , Homeowner , Officer , etc .
Whenever you read any Law or Statute , you must be sure to check the meaning of the word " person " as it applies to that particular law .
In order to implement slavery of it's citizens and control them according to its whim , the Government had to invent a system that would not violate a man 's fundamental rights , but would allow the Government to " own " everything produced or gained by its citizens .
The technique used by the Government was to create an artificial - person ( referred to herein as a CORPORATION for emphasis ) for every man & woman in Canada .
As creator of a CORPORATION , the Government can demand anything it wants from the CORPORATION .
As a legal entity , a CORPORATION does not have feelings and cannot be hurt .
It can be subject to slavery and complete domination by its creator and the CORPORATION must obey its creator .
So for every John Doe man or woman in Canada , the Government created a JOHN DOE CORPORATION .
Capital letters are used to represent CORPORATIONS and COMPANIES .
Lower case letters are used to represent the name of the natural - person .
See Capitalization .
As a CORPORATION needs a business number , in order to do business , the Government assigns a unique business number to each JOHN DOE it creates .
Such a business number began as a Birth Certificate number , then later on is accompanied by a S.I.N. ( Slave Identification Number a.k.a. Social Insurance Number ) .
The creator ( Master ) can then track all activities of the Slave and claim ownership on all property and income of the Slave .
Finally the Government needs to appoint an Officer of the CORPORATION to run the day - to - day activities .
Such a position requires a contract since the Officer will be held accountable for the actions of the CORPORATION .
So , the Government tricks John Doe to become the Officer for the JOHN DOE CORPORATION by signing such contracts as Driver 's Licence , Bank Accounts , Citizenship Cards , Passports , etc .
In the Income Tax Act , the Government just decrees that John Doe is the Legal Representative for the Officer of the JOHN DOE CORPORATION and the only contract involved is the annual Income Tax Return ( yes it is a contract for one year ) wherein John Doe gives his agreement as Officer of JOHN DOE for the previous year .
Unfortunately John
Doe does not know that he is an Officer for the JOHN DOE CORPORATION and must therefore follow the rules imposed upon JOHN DOE .
Hence the confusion sets in because John Doe believes that he is the same as JOHN DOE and therefore has to forfeit his rights and duties upon demand by the Government and its officials .
Here is a quotation from " Memorandum on Law of the Name " , which summarizes the so - called Name Game used by the courts ( the All - Caps NAME is a legal - fiction : something presumed by law to be true until said presumption is rebutted and the truth is brought forward ) :
' It is clear that the existance of a NAME written as all - caps is a necessity - created legal - fiction .
This is surely an issue to be raised , and the supporting particulares are outlined in this memorandum .
Use of the proper name must be insisted upon as a matter of abatement - correction - for all parties of an action of purported law .
However , the current " courts " cannot correct this since they are all based upon presumed / assumed fictional law and must use artificial , juristic NAMES .
Instead , they expect the lawful Christian man or woman to accept the all - caps NAME and agree by silence to be treated as if he or she were a fictional entity invented and governed by mortal enemies .
They must go to unlimited lengths to deceive and coerce this compliance or the underlying criminal farce would be exposed and a world - wide plunder / enslavement racket that has held all life on this planet in a vice grip for millenia would crumble and liberate every living thing .
At this point , the would - be rulers of the world would be required to succeed in life by honest , productive labours , the way those upon whom they parasitically feed are forced to conduct their lives . '
Legal Foundations for Artificial Persons :
Here are some citations from older case - law that discusses how Artificial Persons are only subject to man-made artificial statutes : ' Inasmuch as every government is an artificial person , an abstraction , and a creature of the mind only , a government can interface only with other artificial persons .
The imaginary , having neither actuality nor substance , is foreclosed from creating and attaining parity with the tangible .
The legal manifestation of this is that no government , as well as any law , agency , aspect , court , etc. thereof can concern itself with anything other than corporate , artificial persons and the contracts between them . " [ underline and bold emphasis added ]
S.C.R. 1795 , Penhallow v. Doane 's Administraters ( 3 U.S. 54 ; 1 L.Ed. 57 ; 3 Dall. 54 ) . ' and ... '
That the majority shall prevail is a rule posterior to the formation of government , and results from it .
It is not a rule binding upon mankind in their natural state .
There , every man is independent of all laws , except those prescribed by nature .
He is not bound by any institutions formed by his fellowmen without his consent . "

We recently received a copy of a letter from one of our readers ( see letter ) sent to the International Bar Association , and to date , there has been no reply .
Natural Persons when defined in the Income Tax Act of Canada :
The Income Tax Act now includes the use of the term " natural person " in such a manner that it can only be a role or capacity in which a man or woman acts , before the law .
Just look at these quotes from the ITA and let your head spin where they seem to imply that a natural person is the same as a corporation : Definitions 94 .
( 1 ) : " exempt amount " in respect of a trust 's particular taxation year means an amount that is ( c ) paid [...] by the trust directly to a beneficiary [...] under the trust if
( i ) the beneficiary is a natural person none of whose interests as a beneficiary under the trust was ever acquired for consideration , Definitions 94 .
( 1 ) : " exempt foreign trust " at a particular time means ( f ) a non-resident trust if ( ii ) throughout the trust 's taxation year that includes the particular time ( B ) the trust is maintained for the benefit of natural persons the majority of whom are non-resident , and ( g ) a non-resident trust ( other than a prescribed trust or a trust described in paragraph ( a.1 ) of the definition " trust " in subsection 108 ( 1 ) ) that throughout the particular period that began when it was created and ends at the particular time ( ii ) has been operated exclusively for the purpose of administering or providing superannuation or pension benefits that are primarily in respect of services rendered in the particular country by natural persons who were non-resident at the time those services were rendered ; Definitions 95 .
( 1 ) : " entity " includes an association , a corporation , a fund , a natural person , a joint venture , an organization , a partnership , a syndicate and a trust ; [ See that " includes " must be restrictive in the list above , otherwise we would have to include the normal definition of " entity " , bringing in aliens from outer space ]
Definitions 118.04 . ( 1 ) : ( 2 ) For the purposes of this section , ( a ) a qualifying expenditure of an individual includes an outlay or expense made or incurred by a co-operative housing corporation , a condominium corporation ( or , for civil law , a syndicate of co-owners ) or a similar entity ( in this paragraph referred to as the " corporation " ) , in respect of a property that is owned , administered or managed by that corporation , and that includes an eligible dwelling of the individual , to the extent of the individual 's share of that outlay or expense , if ( i ) the outlay or expense would be a qualifying expenditure of the corporation if the corporation were a natural person and the property were an eligible dwelling of that natural person , and ( b ) a qualifying expenditure of an individual includes an outlay or expense made or incurred by a trust , in respect of a property owned by the trust that includes an eligible dwelling of the individual , to the extent of the share of that outlay or expense that is reasonably attributable to the individual , having regard to the amount of the outlays or expenses made or incurred in respect of the eligible dwelling of the individual ( including , for this purpose , common areas relevant to more than one eligible dwelling ) , if ( i ) the outlay or expense would be a qualifying expenditure of the trust if the trust were a natural person and the property were an eligible dwelling of that natural person , and [ This one is a real " doozie " .
Now we have " if the corporation were a human being " NP , and " if the trust were a human being " NP , putting us right back into their fiction .
They can only lie for so long before their stupidity gets them . ]
Response to a Reader :
The following is a response which I sent to a Reader ( of the web - site ) who was asking about legal persons .
I think it provides some useful information : Begin Quote Both NP and AP are called " legal persons " .
When a human acts within the Statute law , as a natural person , he is subject to those laws which apply to the NP .
The human 's acting in the capacity of a natural person must be by agreement , consent , or contract , as you have indicated .
Just as an " artificial person " is a " legal person " , so is a " natural person " a " legal person " .
In fact , any " person " is a " legal person " because when the word " person " is used in law , it means a " legal person " .
Laws are created by man to have effect on these " legal persons " .
There must be a mechanism for a human to be subject to some of man 's laws ( if he agrees ) so the law has created two " legal persons " , one is called " natural " and the other is called " artificial " ( in the law ) .
No man has dominion over another man , therefore Man 's law cannot have jurisdiction over any man , except by agreement .
A statute cannot have jurisdiction over a man unless he agrees to be so ruled ( by consent or accepting a benefit from the state ) .
I do not agree with your casual use of the word " natural person " from old dictionaries .
Now , all " persons " are subject to man-made laws , so you see that it is not safe to use the word " person " any more , even in casual conversation , because of the confusion it creates .
Do n't get confused with the expression " natural law " ( the law of nature ) and " natural person " ( a creation in man 's laws and dictionaries ) .
The adjective " natural " carries entirely different meanings in each case .
I think the confusion comes when we introduce Statute laws .
Your references are from an older dictionary , and have been modified in later dictionaries .
The more recently accepted idea is that any " person " , natural or artificial , is a " legal person " within the Statutes .
For example , the Bank Act ( a statute ) refers to a natural person .
Furthermore , the Interpretation Act defines " person " as follows : " person , or any word or expression descriptive of a person , includes a corporation " and adjectives such as natural , artificial , fake , legal , are all " expressions descriptive of a person " , which means that , unless defined otherwise , the Interpretation Act defines " natural person " , " artificial person " , " legal person " , " fake person " , etc , all as corporations .
You see how twisted these people are when the pull stunts like " any word or expression descriptive of a person " .
Any use of the word " person " puts us into man 's legal system , because no man or woman is the same as a " person " .
Men and women are living souls occupying a human body for a time .
They are not " persons " of any form .
" Person " in the legal sense only refers to " bodies " in law , either human or fake , to be governed by the laws .
To govern humans , the term " natural person " is used in the laws to distinguish humans from all other legal entities .
Outside the law , " persons " do not exist , only men and women exist .
In the old days , we used to be able to refer to a man or woman as a " person " however such slack use of the language no longer is safe as a result of the perversion of the laws and the re-definition of words made by those wishing to control others ( in other words , your basic childhood " bully " who has moved himself into a position of power and influence over others ) .
In an attempt to seduce all people into believing that they are subject to Statute Law , there is much half - truth information put forward to add to the confusion .
The changing definitions for NP and AP within dictionaries and statures are cases in point .
The dictionaries are updated to enforce the current mind - set of the state and the legal profession .
As a case in point , the head of the Law Faculty at a Canadian University has stated ( via an email to me ) that all human beings ( men and women ) are slaves to the state .
That is the belief and doctrine of the Law Faculty at University .
This is what is being taught in school without any critical thinking from the students to rebuke such rubbish .
Men and women are outside Statute Law unless they contract to be within them .
Then , those humans who agree to be bound by Statute Law are only involved when reference is made to a natural person ( a human within those laws ) .
The other non-humans are artificial persons ( sometimes called " fake persons " by judges ) .
End Quote
Old English Quotation :
The following are Excerpts from Chapter XVI - Of PERSONS , AUTHORS , and things Personated from Leviathan , 1651 A.D. , by Thomas Hobbes :
' A person , is he , whose words or action are considered , either as his own , or as representing the words or actions of an other man , or any other thing to whom they are attributed , whether Truly or by Fiction . '
' When they are considered as his owne , then is he called a Naturall Person :
And when they are considered as representing the words and action of an other , then is he a Feigned or Artificiall person . '
' Of Persons Artificiall , some have their words and actions Owned by those whom they represent .
And then the Person is the Actor ; and he that owneth his words and actions , is the AUTHOR .'
' And therefore he that maketh a Covenant with the Actor , or the Representer , not knowing the Authority he hath , doth it at his own perill . '
' An Idol , or meer Figment of the brain , may be Personated ; as were the Gods of Heathen ; which by such Officers as the State appointed , were Personated , and held Possessions , and other Goods , and Rights , which men from time to time dedicated , and consecrated unto them .
But Idols cannot be Authors : for an Idol is nothing .'
' Of Authors there be two sorts .
The first is simply so called ; which I have before defined be him , that owneth the Action of another simply .
The second is he , that owneth an Action , or Covenant of another conditionally ; that is to say , he undertaketh to do it , if the other doth it not , at , or before a certain time .
And these Authors conditionall , are generally called SURETYES , in Latine Fidejussores , and Sponsores ; and particularly for Debt , Proedes ; and for Appearance before Judge , or Magistrate , Vades . '
" Whereas it is essential , if man is not to be compelled to have recourse , as a last resort , to rebellion against tyranny and oppression , that human rights should be protected by the rule of law , "
( Preamble - Universal Declaration of Human Rights )
1. M80 Stiletto
The M80 Stiletto is equipped with four C32 1232 kW ( 1652 HP ) engines manufactured by the Caterpillar , Inc. , yielding a top speed in excess of 50 knots ( 90 km /h ) and a range of 500 nautical miles ( 900 km ) when fully loaded .
It can be outfitted with jet drives for shallow water operations and beaching .
This extreme performance is based on M Ship Co. ’s proprietary , globally patented technology , retaking the bow wave using its energy to create an air cushion for more efficient planing .
It weighs 45 tons and carries 2,000 sq. ft. of cargo .
It cost roughly $ 6 million but the fully equipped vessel with cost $ 10 million .
The design and construction of this vessel made from carbon fiber for reduced weight and added rigidity .
You will be seeing these vessels operational in littoral or coastal zone .
The M80 Stiletto is also notable because it is the largest U.S. Naval vessel built using carbon fibre composite and epoxy building techniques , which yields a very light , but strong hull .
The Stiletto has been popular for its efficiency , low cost , innovation , higher payload fraction , agility , shock mitigation , shallow draft and stealth which are the new priorities for the next generation naval craft .
2. Sea Shadow ( IX - 529 )
A futuristic - looking vessel with a shape reminiscent of Darth Vader ’s helmet , Sea Shadow is a test platform for researching advanced technologies in propulsion , automation , sea- keeping and reduced signatures .
Sea Shadow provides government and industry an opportunity to test new technologies at sea before committing to using them in new ship designs .
Sea Shadow has a SWATH hull design .
Below the water are submerged twin hulls , each with a propeller , aft stabilizer , and inboard canard .
The portion of the ship above water is connected to the hulls via the two angled struts .
The SWATH design helps the ship remain stable even in very rough water of up to sea state 6 ( wave height of 18 feet ( 5.5 m ) or “ very rough ” sea ) .
The T - AGOS 19 - and - 23 - class oceanographic ships have inherited the stabilizer and canard method to help perform their stability - sensitive surveillance missions .
The vehicle cost approximately $ 50 million to build and the total test program is approximately $ 195 million over roughly 10 years .
It is owned by the Navy and operated by LMSC personnel .
3. Sea Fighter
The Sea Fighter is an aluminum catamaran designed to operate effectively in littoral , or coastal , waters .
It can maneuver in as little as 11 feet ( 3.35 m ) of water .
The hull number FSF - 1 stands for “ fast sea frame ” and is the first U.S. Naval vessel to have a catamaran design .
The experimental vessel will be used to test the hydrodynamic performance , structural performance , structural behavior , mission flexibility and propulsion - system efficiency of high - speed vessels .
A multi-purpose stern ramp allows the ship to launch and recover manned and unmanned surface and sub-surface vehicles up to the size of an 11 - meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat ( RHIB ) .
From its flight deck , the Sea Fighter can operate while supporting two H - 60 helicopters or vertical takeoff and landing tactical unmanned aerial vehicles ( VTUAV ) at a time .
The ship has a modern computer system to control its systems and for navigation .
Steering and throttle control are done by wire rather than mechanical linkage .
Sea Fighter is expected to pave the way for a future line of fast , long range destroyers capable of travelling fast enough to avoid or out maneuver most of the current generation of torpedoes .
They have a very low radar signature , making detection difficult .
They would be able to respond quickly to targets located by air or satellite and aggressively attack surface and submerged vessels using their speed to evade torpedo and missile attack .
4. P960 Skjold Patrol Boat
The Skjold class patrol boats is a new range of superfast , large stealth missile craft , also known as MTBs ( missile torpedo boats ) .
The word Skjold means “ shield ” in Norwegian .
The flexibility inherent in Skjold is interesting also to other navies .
They are among the fastest warships in the world and can reach speeds of up to 60 knots / 110 km /t .
An important capability of the Skjold is its covert operational capability in littoral warfare , particularly in using Norway ’s coastal topography with its islands and fjords , to carry out surveillance and engage hostile forces from a close distance while remaining undetected .
The shallow draught of 0.9 m to 2.3 m allows the ship to access very shallow waters denied to other vessels .
To ensure stealth capabilities radar absorbent materials ( RAM ) have been used in the load - bearing structures over large areas of the ship .
This strategy leads to significant weight saving compared to conventional construction techniques of applying RAM cladding to the external surfaces .
The ship ’s profile has a faceted appearance with no right angle structures and few orientations of reflective panels .
Doors and hatches are flush with the surfaces and the windows are flush without visible coaming ( edge of window aperture ) and are fitted with radar reflective screens .
5. FNS Tornio
The FNS Tornio has been designed and constructed as stealth ships with minimal magnetic , heat and radar signatures .
The shape of the vessel has been designed to reduce radar signature .
Metal parts have been covered with radar absorbent material , and the composite parts have radar absorbent material embedded in the structure .
Radar transparent materials ( kevlar , balsa ) have been used where applicable .
“ It ’s harder to find this vessel and harder for an aeroplane to attack us , ” adds LtSG Lehto , commanding officer of the Hamina - class fast attack craft ( FAC ) , FNS Tornio .
This vessel is equipped with legacy weapons and combat data system fit that included 40 mm and 23 mm guns and an electro - optronic director .
Trials resulted in the improvements seen first in ship two , Tornio , which includes Umkhonto vertical launch surface - to - air missiles ( SAMs ) , RBS 15SF surface - to - surface missiles and a Bofors 57 mm gun , integrated with the Advanced Naval Combat System ( ANCS ) SQ 2000 .
On a date that has been written down in history for the nation and for Barack Obama it has also been written down in the Shelby County Court House in Memphis , TN , but not for the winning election .
The President - elect and future 44th President of The United States would likely have been ‘ bench warranted ’ for not appearing in court for an illegal placement of campaign advertisements by City of Memphis Public Works employee , Gene Soucy , who cited Barack Obama personally and not the local campaign office for the placement of campaign signs .
According to Soucy , 512 campaigns signs were illegally placed on right - of - way land in the city which is an area that the City of Memphis prohibits .
The bench warrant was actually intended to be placed for Barack Obama on the date of election , November 4th , the same day he was voted into office as President of the United States of America by millions of voters .
After the original court date of November 4th was missed , a bench warrant in General Sessions Div 14 was about to ordered by a judge who was sitting in for Judge Potter who was absent from his bench that day .
However , the date was reset after attorney Javier Bailey a Democratic State party member was notified .
Currently , under the booking number 08725976 , the name Barack Obama is listed under a Class C action for Illegal Posting / Advertising Signs with now a court date of December 8 , 2008 at 1:30 PM .

Those darn gays and their desire to treated like any other American couple ... they 've forced James Dobson 's Focus on the Family to announce layoffs of approximately 20 % of their work force , or 202 employees , due in no small part to the more than $ 500,000 spent on the Yes on 8 campaign .
Colorado Independent :
Focus on the Family announced yesterday afternoon that 202 jobs will be cut companywide — an estimated 20 percent of its workforce .
Initial reports bring the total number of remaining employees to around 950 .
Focus on the Family is poised to announce major layoffs to its Colorado Springs - based ministry and media empire today .
The cutbacks come just weeks after the group pumped more than half a million dollars into the successful effort to pass a gay - marriage ban in California .
Critics are holding up the layoffs , which come just two months after the organization ’s last round of dismissals , as a sad commentary on the true priorities of the ministry .
“ If I were their membership I would be appalled , ” said Mark Lewis , a longtime Colorado Springs activist who helped organize a Proposition 8 protest in Colorado Springs on Saturday .
“ That [ Focus on the Family ] would spend any money on anything that ’s obviously going to get blocked in the courts is just sad .
[ Prop. 8 ] is guaranteed to lose , in the long run it does n’t have a chance — it ’s just a waste of money . ”
In all , Focus pumped $ 539,000 in cash and another $ 83,000 worth of non-monetary support into the measure to overturn a California Supreme Court ruling that allowed gays and lesbians to marry in that state .
The group was the seventh - largest donor to the effort in the country .
The cash contributions are equal to the salaries of 19 Coloradans earning the 2008 per capita income of $ 29,133 .
In addition Elsa Prince , the auto parts heiress and longtime funder of conservative social causes who sits on the Focus on the Family board , contributed another $ 450,000 to Prop .
8 .[..]
Lewis , the Colorado Springs activist , wonders whether the families who donate to the nonprofit ministry , realize where their funds really end up .
“ Seriously , I would imagine their supporters have got to be asking the question about whether their church is really practicing their theology . ”
Vote No on Amendment 48
This Anti-Woman , Anti-Choice initiative will be on the Colorado ballot in November .
Proponents of this would define a fertilized egg as a “ person ” in the Colorado constitution in sections 3 , 6 and 25 of the Colorado Bill of Rights .
The so - called “ Personhood Amendment ” wants to establish a way to ban all abortion .
It ’s offenses are manifold .
As Friedman grimly chronicles , this bill is not just anti-abortion , but anti-contraception ; it will disproportionately effect young women , women of color , incarcerated women , and low - income women ; it advances fetal rights over women ’s rights and it misleadingly co-opts feminist language .
( The group backing the amendment is called Colorado for Equal Rights . )
Amendment 48 not only bans all abortions in every instance–even in cases of rape or incest , or when the life of the woman is at risk–it also threatens stem cell research and in vitro fertilization , compromises the doctor - patient relationship , and deprives access to common hormonal birth control methods ( i.e. the pill and IUD ) , and to emergency contraception for rape and incest victims .
Femisting.com has also compiled extensive research on this amendment .
This is one of the facts they uncovered .
Fetal ( or in this case , even embryonic ) “ rights ” trumping women ’s rights ?
Check .
The amendment would officially change the definition of “ person ” to include “ any human being from the moment of fertilization , ” therefore endowing all embryos in the state ( whether they ’re implanted in a woman ’s body or not ) with “ inalienable rights , equality of justice , and due process of law . ”
What is unclear : would this initiative mean Colorado women who face an ectopic pregnancy would need government approval before the life - threatening pregnancy is removed ?
Also , would this initiative open the door for criminal investigations into miscarriages or situations where a woman ’s body rejected implantation of a fertilized egg ?
What makes matters even worse , is that the group pushing Amendment 48 includes some right - wing funders , who are n’t even from Colorado .
They are using Colorado to see how far they can push their agenda .
I want to help them spread the word to fight this horrible amendment and raise awareness of the ramifications of such ludicrous legislation .

In an interview on CBS ’ 60 Minutes , his first since the election , President - elect Barack Obama talked about the economy , the housing market and how to create a sustainable auto industry .
He said that the $ 700 billion bailout plan has done little to improve the economy so far , but he credited the Bush administration Sunday for working to address the global financial crisis .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/Aw_G8TbXQnY]
“ There ’s no doubt that we have not been able yet to reset the confidence in the financial markets and in the consumer markets and among businesses that allow the economy to move forward in a strong way , ” Obama said .
“ And my job as president is going to be to make sure that we restore that confidence .
We should n’t worry about the deficit next year or even the year after . …
The most important thing is that we avoid a deepening recession . ” [ social_buttons ]
The president - elect also said that not enough has been done to address bank foreclosures and distressed homeowners .
Obama said he has spent the days since the election on short - and long - term issues , from doing “ whatever it takes ” to stabilize the economy , restore consumer confidence and create jobs , to getting sound health care and energy policies through Congress .
While investors are still riding a rollercoaster on Wall Street , Obama said the economy would have deteriorated even more without the $ 700 billion bank bailout .
Re-regulation is a legislative priority , he said , not to crush “ the entrepreneurial spirit and risk - taking of American capitalism ” but to “ restore a sense of balance . ”
“ We ’ve gotta set up a negotiation between banks and borrowers so that people can stay in their homes .
That is going to have an impact on the economy as a whole .
And , you know , one thing I ’m determined is that if we do n’t have a clear , focused program for homeowners by the time I take office , we will after I take office . ”
Obama credited Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for trying to remedy “ an unprecedented crisis ” that the country has n’t seen since the Great Depression .
“ Hank Paulson has worked tirelessly under some very difficult circumstances , and I think Hank would be the first one to acknowledge that probably not everything that ’s been done has worked the way he had hoped it would work . ”
A member of the transition team works with Paulson daily , Obama said , getting the needed background and sometimes offering approaches to address the economic meltdown .

Vice President - elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said he thinks the Bush administration should explicitly assure the Iranian leadership that it would not seek a regime change , as one part of the incentives and sanctions that the United States and Europe have been offering in hopes of prying Iran away from its nuclear program .
Mr. Obama , for his part , has been a little less clear .
In an interview in September he said , “ I think it is important for us to send a signal that we are not hell - bent on regime change just for the sake of regime change , but expect changes in behavior , and there are both carrots and there are sticks available to them for those changes in behavior . ”
European officials said that the Obama advisers have played their cards close to the chest .
“ They come in , they listen and they say , ‘ Thank you very much , ’ ” said one official of a European embassy in Washington .
He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue .
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said over breakfast with reporters in Washington this week that he thinks “ the personality of Barack Obama can make a difference ” when it comes to Iran .
But Mr. Kouchner also urged that Mr. Obama exercise caution , using a speech at the Brookings Institution to warn against undermining the carefully plotted , but so far unsuccessful , transatlantic effort to rein in Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Israel has been pushing , too .
A senior Israeli official said that the Israeli government is in touch with Mr. Obama ’s close aides , in particular with Dennis B. Ross , President Clinton ’s former envoy to the Middle East .
“ For us , it ’s Iran , ” the official said , adding that Israel wants to make sure that Mr. Obama will tackle the Iran issue as soon as he takes office .
“ We ca n’t afford a vacuum . ”
Russia , too , has already made a proposal , one that is close to Moscow ’s heart .
Last Friday , Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr V. Grushko said that Russia would not deploy missiles in Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave that borders Poland , if Mr. Obama were to scrap the Bush administration ’s planned missile defense shield .
Mr. Obama has said that he supports a missile shield , provided that the technology is workable and cost efficient .
As for the Taliban , it seems unlikely that Mr. Obama will be acceding to its call for American troops to be pulled out of Afghanistan .
He said during the campaign that , to the contrary , he would increase the number of American combat brigades deployed there .

Traveling is one of my favorite things to do , so naturally the airport is one of my favorite places .
I enjoy people watching , the excitement of departing to a new destination , and arriving home after a long journey .
LAX is my home base .
It 's the fifth busiest airport in the world for passengers with over 62 million people flying in and out last year .
It has n't been significantly altered since the 1980's so it 's about time for a face - lift .
Fentress Architects in association with HNTB has been selected to develop a design concept for the modernization scheme of LAX .
Inspired by the Pacific Ocean , the design will include roof tops that flow like rhythmic waves breaking on shore and flat - seam stainless steel stretching over the column - free structure .
The plans also intend to considerably change the appearance and feel of the Tom Bradley International Terminal with larger curbside canopies creating an airy cover and a more gracious entry to this important Gateway .
The revamped LAX will feature a two - level bridge offering either a train ride on the lower level , or automated pedestrian walks on the upper level .
The split level design will allow unobstructed views to both the north and south with viewing lounges at either end of the bridge providing a welcoming view downtown to the east and a departing view of the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean to the West .
With fluid flow of passengers in mind , the new LAX airport will sport an automated people mover connecting terminals and outside transport .

Energex says about 3,500 customers in south - east Queensland are still without power after Sunday 's destructive storm .
Most of the affected properties are on the north side of Brisbane but about 200 homes are still without electricity at Ipswich , the Gold Coast , Redcliffe and Caboolture .
Energex says more than 500 staff worked in heavy rain last night to restore power to as many homes as possible .
The electricity provider says there are about 1,000 homes and businesses either no longer exist or are too badly damaged to be safely reconnected .
Energex is urging people in storm - affected suburbs to turn off their appliances even if they do not have power .
The warning came after a house caught fire after power was restored to streets in the worst - hit suburb of The Gap last night .
It is believed the fire was started by a stove that turned on when the electricity was re-connected .
The house received only minor fire damage .
Police are closing the main road between The Gap and neighbouring Keperra this morning to clear storm debris .
Acting Superintendent Joe Joyce says Settlement Road will be closed between 9:00 am and 3:00 pm
He says general traffic and sightseers are hampering relief efforts .
" It will allow us to clear the debris a lot quicker than we otherwise would have , " he said .
Meanwhile , Premier Anna Bligh is urging Queenslanders to dig deep and support her disaster relief appeal for victims of the storms .
The State Government is donating $ 500,000 to start the appeal , and Ms Bligh says the public can make donations at any Commonwealth Bank .
" We have got thousands of homes affected , more than 4,000 homes needing repair people out of their homes people in very difficult circumstances , so I just say ' Queenslanders come let 's just get behind them ' , " she said .
" It could be any one of us over a summer season . "
Public Works Minister Robert Schwarten says he and the Premier will discuss a re-building strategy this morning with insurance experts and the Building Services Authority .
" I 've been in 10 years as a minister through a lot of disaster areas and it's equal to any of those , " he said .
" It might be a small sample of Brisbane , but it 's a very important one .
There 's a lot of damage and the damage rivals that of any other disaster Qld has seen . "
Except in rare cases when they are pulled from early reviews , or when they appear on re-released editions of games , the quotes on the box come from previews .
What is a preview , exactly ?
A preview is what 's written after a bunch of PR people show off the best parts of a game , explain how conceptually brilliant it 's all going to be , and tell the writer that the horrible glitches are " being ironed out . "
There is thus a tendency for previews to contain a great deal of gross exaggerations .
It 's not malicious - writers do n't open up their word processors and think , " I 'm going to completely overhype this bitch ! " - it 's just the nature of the system .
Previews are based on a writer 's sincere desire for a game to be good and the publisher 's ability to make it look good .
And , if all the brilliant innovations turn out to be plumes of smoke , justice usually comes as a scathing review .
But by the time the review is out , quotes like these have already been printed on every box ...

DENVER 
The reality in Colorado is that a big piece of the election is already over .
The state ’s heavy emphasis on mail - in and early voting means that close to 1.5 million votes , or about 46 percent of the registered total , are already in the can , cast and waiting to be counted .
That means two things .
First , that a surge , or a misstep , at the last minute can only help or hurt so much , since voter decisions were in many cases made on conclusions reached in mid-to - late October .
Second , it mandates , in a still - tight race , a pinpoint , surgical search for the votes still left .
Mary Ann Larsen and Diane Tapia-Gonzales , who knocked on doors in the Denver suburb of Arvada on Thursday night as volunteers for Senator Barack Obama , the Democratic nominee for president , epitomized the new narrow - cast focus .
On their computer - generated lists , every name came with a one - to - five scale based on prior contact  one being committed to Mr. Obama , five being four - square for the Republican nominee , Senator John McCain .
The women knew who had already voted  updates come in daily from local county clerks  and who had a mail - in ballot in hand not yet submitted .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign is similarly obsessed with the details .
“ Everyone knows which votes are turned in and where the votes are that are left , ” said Tom Kise , the campaign ’s communications director for its south central region .
“ ALL I ’ve got is precious time , ” W. Axl Rose sings in the title song of Guns N’ Roses ’ new album , and he must be well aware of how that line sounds now .
Mr. Rose , 46 , the only remaining original member of Guns N’ Roses , needed 17 years , more than $ 13 million ( as of 2005 ) and a battalion of musicians , producers and advisers to deliver “ Chinese Democracy , ” the first album of new Guns N’ Roses songs since 1991 .
It ’s being released on Sunday , with CDs sold exclusively at Best Buy .
( In another 21st - century fillip the album ’s best song , “ Shackler ’s Revenge , ” appeared first in a video game , Rock Band 2 . )
“ Chinese Democracy ” ( Geffen ) is the Titanic of rock albums : the ship , not the movie , although like the film it ’s a monumental studio production .
It ’s outsize , lavish , obsessive , technologically advanced and , all too clearly , the end of an era .
It ’s also a shipwreck , capsized by pretensions and top - heavy production .
In its 14 songs there are glimpses of heartfelt ferocity and despair , along with bursts of remarkable musicianship .
But they are overwhelmed by countless layers of studio diddling and a tone of curdled self - pity .
The album concludes with five bombastic power ballads in a row .
“ Chinese Democracy ” sounds like a loud last gasp from the reign of the indulged pop star : the kind of musician whose blockbuster early success could once assure loyal audiences , bountiful royalties , escalating ambitions and dangerously open - ended deadlines .
The leaner , leakier 21st - century recording business is far less likely to nurture such erratic perfectionists .
( Mr. Rose did manage to outpace Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine , which re-emerged on tour this year but has n’t yet released a successor to its 1991 masterpiece , “ Loveless . ” )
The new rock paradigm , a throwback to the 1950s and early 1960s , is to record faster , more cheaply and more often , then head out on tour before the next YouTube sensation distracts potential fans .
“ Chinese Democracy ” is such an old - school event that at this point no album could easily live up to the pent - up anticipation and fascination .
Over the last two decades Guns N’ Roses ’ 1987 debut album , “ Appetite for Destruction , ” has sold 18 million copies in the United States alone .
The original band , particularly the guitar team of Slash on lead and Izzy Stradlin on rhythm , collaborated to forge a scrappy combination of glam , punk and metal behind Mr. Rose ’s proudly abrasive voice , which could leap from a baritone growl to a fierce screech .
Singing about sex , drugs , booze and stardom , Mr. Rose was a rags - to - MTV success story for the 1980s : a self - described abused child from heartland America who got himself out of Indiana and reinvented himself as a full - fledged Hollywood rock star , charismatic and volatile , never pretending to be controllable .
Sarah Palin unwittingly took a prank call from a Canadian comedian who posed as French president Nicolas Sarkozy and told her she would make a good US leader one day .
In the six - minute call , which will air on a Quebec radio station on the eve of the US presidential election , the governor of Alaska misses several hints that the conversation , in which the comedian uses an exaggerated French accent , is a joke .
The McCain - Palin campaign later issued a statement which said Mrs Palin was " mildly amused " and added : " C'est la vie . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
During the call with Marc - Antoine Audette and Sebastien Trudel , a Montreal comedy duo known as the Masked Avengers , the moose - hunting Republican running mate talked about how she was a " careful shot " , praised Mr Sarkozy , and asked him to give his wife , model - turned - singer Carla Bruni , " a big hug for me " .
" I look forward to working with you and getting to meet you personally and your beautiful wife , " she told the fake Mr Sarkozy .
" Oh my goodness , you 've added a lot of energy to your country with that beautiful family of yours . "
When the comedian told her he could see her as a president one day , Mrs Palin laughed and replied : " Maybe in eight years . "
She also discussed the perils of hunting with vice president Dick Cheney , who shot and injured a friend while hunting quail in 2006 .
" I just love killing those animals .
Mmm , mmm , take away life , that is so fun , " the fake Mr Sarkozy said .
After he suggested they should go hunting together by helicopter , she replied : " Well , I think we could have a lot of fun together while we 're getting work done .
" We can kill two birds with one stone that way . "
The comedian joked that they should not go with Mr Cheney before Mrs Palin added : " I 'll be a careful shot . "
Playing off Mrs Palin 's much - mocked comment in an early television interview that she had insights into foreign policy because " you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska " , the comedian told her : " You know we have a lot in common also , because from my house I can see Belgium . "
" Well , see , we 're right next door to different countries that we all need to be working with , yes , " Mrs Palin replied .
Tracey Schmitt , Mrs Palin 's campaign spokeswoman , said : " Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had joined the ranks of heads of state , including President Sarkozy and other celebrities , in being targeted by these pranksters .

Way back in the heat of the Democratic primary , I told all who would listen that if it came down to Hillary vs. McCain I 'd vote McCain .
If Senator McCain was still around , I suppose I would n't regret that claim , but somewhere along the line , Senator McCain got replaced by Candidate McCain .
I was dwelling on this a bit today and it struck me .
One benefit of this long campaign is that it really does show a person 's character .
And I realized .
We have two men running for president right now .
One has stayed true to himself throughout despite all the pressure .
The other really has n't or maybe we 've just seen what he really was all along .
Obama said at the outset that he wanted a civil campaign on the issues .
He said he would avoid the politics of person destruction .
He demanded a cool , no drama organization -- much like himself .
Editor 's note : Ron Paul is a Republican congressman from Texas who ran for his party 's nomination for president this year .
He is a doctor who specializes in obstetrics / gynecology and says he has delivered more than 4,000 babies .
He served in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was elected again to Congress in 1996 .
Rep. Paul serves on the House Financial Services Committee .
Rep . Ron Paul says the government 's solution to the crisis is the same as the cause of it -- too much government .
( CNN ) -- Many Americans today are asking themselves how the economy got to be in such a bad spot .
For years they thought the economy was booming , growth was up , job numbers and productivity were increasing .
Yet now we find ourselves in what is shaping up to be one of the most severe economic downturns since the Great Depression .
Unfortunately , the government 's preferred solution to the crisis is the very thing that got us into this mess in the first place : government intervention .
Ever since the 1930s , the federal government has involved itself deeply in housing policy and developed numerous programs to encourage homebuilding and homeownership .
Government - sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were able to obtain a monopoly position in the mortgage market , especially the mortgage - backed securities market , because of the advantages bestowed upon them by the federal government .
Laws passed by Congress such as the Community Reinvestment
Act required banks to make loans to previously underserved segments of their communities , thus forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks .
These governmental measures , combined with the Federal Reserve 's loose monetary policy , led to an unsustainable housing boom .
The key measure by which the Fed caused this boom was through the manipulation of interest rates , and the open market operations that accompany this lowering .
When interest rates are lowered to below what the market rate would normally be , as the Federal Reserve has done numerous times throughout this decade , it becomes much cheaper to borrow money .
Longer - term and more capital - intensive projects , projects that would be unprofitable at a high interest rate , suddenly become profitable .
Because the boom comes about from an increase in the supply of money and not from demand from consumers , the result is malinvestment , a misallocation of resources into sectors in which there is insufficient demand .
In this case , this manifested itself in overbuilding in real estate .
When builders realize they have overbuilt and have too many houses to sell , too many apartments to rent , or too much commercial real estate to lease , they seek to recoup as much of their money as possible , even if it means lowering prices drastically .
This lowering of prices brings the economy back into balance , equalizing supply and demand .
This economic adjustment means , however that there are some winners -- in this case , those who can again find affordable housing without the need for creative mortgage products , and some losers -- builders and other sectors connected to real estate that suffer setbacks .
The government does n't like this , however , and undertakes measures to keep prices artificially inflated .
This was why the Great Depression was as long and drawn out in this country as it was .
I am afraid that policymakers today have not learned the lesson that prices must adjust to economic reality .
The bailout of Fannie and Freddie , the purchase of AIG , and the latest multi-hundred billion dollar Treasury scheme all have one thing in common :
They seek to prevent the liquidation of bad debt and worthless assets at market prices , and instead try to prop up those markets and keep those assets trading at prices far in excess of what any buyer would be willing to pay .
Additionally , the government 's actions encourage moral hazard of the worst sort .
Now that the precedent has been set , the likelihood of financial institutions to engage in riskier investment schemes is increased , because they now know that an investment position so overextended as to threaten the stability of the financial system will result in a government bailout and purchase of worthless , illiquid assets .
Using trillions of dollars of taxpayer money to purchase illusory short - term security , the government is actually ensuring even greater instability in the financial system in the long term .
The solution to the problem is to end government meddling in the market .
Government intervention leads to distortions in the market , and government reacts to each distortion by enacting new laws and regulations , which create their own distortions , and so on ad infinitum .
It is time this process is put to an end .
But the government cannot just sit back idly and let the bust occur .
It must actively roll back stifling laws and regulations that allowed the boom to form in the first place .
The government must divorce itself of the albatross of Fannie and Freddie , balance and drastically decrease the size of the federal budget , and reduce onerous regulations on banks and credit unions that lead to structural rigidity in the financial sector .
Until the big - government apologists realize the error of their ways , and until vocal free - market advocates act in a manner which buttresses their rhetoric , I am afraid we are headed for a rough ride .

The data seem to contradict research in the 1970s suggesting that in hard times there are more deaths from heart disease , cirrhosis , suicide and homicide , as well as more admissions to mental hospitals .
But those findings have not been replicated , and several economists have pointed out flaws in the research .
In May 2000 , the Quarterly Journal of Economics published a surprising paper called “ Are Recessions Good for Your Health ? ” by Christopher J. Ruhm , professor of economics at the University of North Carolina , Greensboro , based on an analysis measuring death rates and health behavior against economic shifts and jobless rates from 1972 to 1991 .
Dr. Ruhm found that death rates declined sharply in the 1974 and 1982 recessions , and increased in the economic recovery of the 1980s .
An increase of one percentage point in state unemployment rates correlated with a 0.5 percentage point decline in the death rate  or about 5 fewer deaths per 100,000 people .
Over all , the death rate fell by more than 8 percent in the 20 - year period of mostly economic decline , led by drops in heart disease and car crashes .
The economic downturn did appear to take a toll on factors having less to do with prevention and more to do with mental well - being and access to health care .
For instance , cancer deaths rose 23 percent , and deaths from flu and pneumonia increased slightly .
Suicides rose 2 percent , homicides 12 percent .
The issue that may matter most in an economic crisis is not related to jobs or income , but whether the slump widens the gap between rich and poor , and whether there is an adequate health safety net available to those who have lost their jobs and insurance .

During a decade of economic recession in Japan that began in the 1990s , people who were unemployed were twice as likely to be in poor health than those with secure jobs .
During Peru ’s severe economic crisis in the 1980s , infant mortality jumped 2.5 percentage points  about 17,000 more children who died as public health spending and social programs collapsed .
You can listen to the debate at MPR .
7:02 CT : There will be no rules , but candidates should keep their answers concise .
The candidates were then wheeled out in alphabetical order : Dean Barkley , Norm Coleman and Al Franken .
7:03 CT : Coleman starts first , the lawsuits will take the stage .
Coleman stated that he has not received any gifts from family friends or allies .
" The plaintiff to the lawsuit said that their was not basis for this claim . "
I highly doubt that if they took the time file a lawsuit .
7:04 CT : Norm was then asked if Al Franken has any connection to the lawsuit ; Coleman did not answer the question but detoured to talk about how " Al Franken is targeting [ Norm 's ] family . "
7:05 CT : " Mr. Franken , do you have any connection to the lawsuit ? "
Franken responded , " None , " and then paused for a moment .
" The lawsuit is not about Norm Coleman 's wife it 's about Norm Coleman 's sugar daddy .
Norm Coleman cannot blame this on me ; this is Norm Coleman 's problem . "
Franken would not go so far to say that Coleman is corrupt , but called it a serious allegation .
7:08 CT : Barkley has had no part in this debate so far .
7:09 CT : Coleman : " There is a line to be drawn . "
The ad Norm Coleman continues to referrer to , the one where Al Franken attacks his wife follows .
Nothing in the ad directly attacks his wife .
7:10 CT : Franken responded by stating that the lawsuit " is not about Norm Coleman 's wife , this is about money . "
7:13 CT : Now onto Dean Barkley , " now you know one of the reasons I 'm running .
This is probably the most negative campaign in Minnesota history ... I may end up getting sued too . "
7:14 CT : What will be the biggest issue to face America in the next six years ?
Dean went first and stated that he wants to turn America around and put it on a new direction .
He also wants to clean up Washington ; " Lets take the direct bribery out of politics . "
7:16 CT : Norm Coleman next : " If you play to the partisan divide you accomplish nothing . "
7:17 CT : Franken then stated that he wants to fix the economic situation ; " Washington has not been working for Minnesota families . "
Franken then went on to list several issues that he believes he can fix .
7:18 CT : Question from a women in the audience .
She asked each of the candidates to name one program they support that could be set aside while the nation gets its financial situation in order .
7:20 CT : Franken gets to respond first , " every item on my agenda has a return on my investment ... that 's what Clinton did . "
7:21 CT : Barkley then got his typical line of " I 've been working on the issues since 1992 when I first said it was broke ... We need a four year spending cap to stop the bleeding ; how are we going to pay for these things Al . "
Barkley then went on to question the massive military spending that contributes to our nations 11 trillion deficit . >
7:22 CT : Coleman then stated the standard Kerry line : " You ca n't support something if you voted against it . "
The moderator then essentially said that 's not the question , please answer it .
" I would give up my raise , " the crowd started booing and then he again got side tracked after briefly mentioning a spending freeze . "
7:24 CT : Another question from the audience ; the college question .
How will you make it more affordable ?
7:25 CT : Coleman essentially stated that he will continue his work with Pell grants .
He was also sure to point out that his IRA has taken a hit and that he has two kids in college .
7:26 CT : Franken discussed his intention to give a $ 5,000 tax credit for kids seeking higher education .
Franken then told a story about a student from Mankato State University who has to donate his plasma to pay for his education and he will still graduate with debt .
He then went on to mention Obama .
7:28 CT : Onto Barkley , " If you want a guy who can make empty promises , I 'm not your guy . "
He later went on to say that he will not pander , but will focus on the issues .
7:30 CT : Barkley gets to ask a question to Al Franken : " I know you support Obama , but can you name a position McCain supports that you also support . "
7:31 CT : " I agree with Sarah Palin and John McCain ... on their counter terrorism stance .
You do n't kill everybody .
You make friends and then your friends tell you who to kill . "
7:32 CT : Norm Coleman then asked Franken to " name three things Franken has done for Minnesota . "
7:33 CT : Franken started but Coleman did n't like the fact that Al was actually answering the question .
It got testy for a moment .
" Franken went on to say that he worked with chemical dependency " patients .
Franken then cited his participation in Operation Helmet , a joint venture with a Republican from Texas with the intention of providing additional helmets for the troops overseas .
The third activity he cited was his numerous charitable events .
7:36 CT : Franken then asked Coleman " how many years should a politician have to debate until they can be a lobbyist . "
7:37 CT : Coleman responded by saying " what would that accomplish " in reference to a lifetime ban .
7:38 CT : Franken responded by answering Norm 's question ; Franken roughly stated that Senators vote on certain bills because they believe it will benefit them later down the road .
7:39 CT : Barkley finally got another question .
Would you cut off funding for the war ?
Barkley said " Yes , " Coleman said " No " and then gave a story about mothers in his office , and then Franken said " No . "
Barkley stated that the question was not a direct question about " the Iraq war , but rather a hypothetical immoral war . "
7:42 CT : Another question from the crowd ; it sounded like a young boy .
How would you help push alternative energy ?
7:43 CT : Coleman went first and stated his support for the 2005 energy bill citing the fact that " 85 senators voted for this bill and Franken said he would not . "
7:44 CT : Barkley next ; " I will not support tax breaks for Oil Companies . "
Barkley then cited the difference between the passive income stipulation included in the 2005 energy bill " that only benefits the wealthy . "
7:45 CT : Franken gets the last word on the energy issue .
" Norm Coleman basically said that if people agree blah blah blah [ sic ] . "
Then went onto say that if people actually agreed this election would n't look so bad for the Republicans .
7:46 CT : Another question from South Minneapolis .
Is health care a privilege , right or responsibility ?
7:47 CT : Barkley first ; " 16 % of our GDP [ Gross Domestic Product ] is taken over by health care .
That is much higher than other European countries . "
Barkley believes that health care should be a right and the ultimate solution is a single payer plan , although he has other solutions that are less drastic ..
7:49 CT : Al then agreed with Barkley on the " right " to health care .
Al stated that " I support Barack Obama 's health care plan .
If you like your health care now you can keep it , if you do n't have health care it will be less expensive . "
7:50 CT : Coleman followed citing " Franken 's support for a single payer plan during his primary run with Cirisii ... Under that plan you take the healthy kids and make them unhealthy because they are n't allowed to take Liptor and Prilosec . "
These are not drugs , kids are taking , or need to be taking under any plan .
7:51 CT : Yes and no question time .
Is Medicare better than no Medicare ?
7:52 CT : Coleman : " Yes " , Barkley : " Yes ' , and Franken " Sort of . "
7:53 CT : Raise taxes ?
Barkley : " No " , Franken " No " , Coleman " No . "
7:54 CT : Is our current plan for children 's health care adequate ?
Barkley " Yes " , Coleman " Yes " , Franken " we can fix it . "
7:54 CT : Franken wants to do a quad - partisan bill with Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman .
7:54 CT : Approve a Supreme Court Justice who differs with your view on abortion .
7:54 CT : Barkley : " I would never ask that question " .
Coleman : would ask " if they 're qualified . "
Franken : responded that he would not press the issue because " privacy emanates from the constitution . "
7:55 CT : End Iraq war ?
7:55 CT : Barkley " Yes " , Franken " Yes " .
Coleman " Yes because we 're not gonna be in Iraq in six years because gen .
Petreaus has achieved such great success . "
7:56 CT : Final statements , Franken first .
7:57 CT : " Elections are a time to hold our politicians responsible .
If you believe George Bush was right 90 % of the time I 'm not your guy . "
Franken then did his " I ask for your vote " bit .
Ending with his desire to end the war .
7:57 CT : Now Norm : " These are the most challenging times in my 37 years of public service .
The question is not who do you blame , but rather who will fix it ... We can bridge the partisan divide . "
7:58 CT : Barkley concludes the night : " There are a lot of people who believe that Al or Norm are their worst nightmare ... Do you think that Al and Norm will change the direction of Washington ... Send Washington a message by sending Dean Barkley to the Senate . "
Whew !
What was all that mess ?
I ’m still in a daze , sort­ing it all out , decompressing .
On the campaign trail , McCain immediately got on message .
I became a prop , a cartoon character created to be pummeled .
Pass the Vit­a­min C .
For the past few years , I have gone about my busi­ness , hang­ing out with my kids and , now , my grand­chil­dren , tak­ing care of our elders ( they moved in as the kids moved out ) , going to work , teach­ing and writ­ing .
And every day , I par­tic­i­pate in the nev­er - end­ing effort to build a pow­er­ful and irre­sistible move­ment for peace and social justice .
In years past , I would now and then – often unpre­dictably – appear in the news­pa­pers or on TV , some­times with a ref­er­ence to Fugi­tive Days , my 2001 mem­oir of the exhil­a­rat­ing and dif­fi­cult years of resis­tance against the Amer­i­can war in Viet­nam .
It was a time when the world was in flames , rev­o­lu­tion was in the air , and the ser­i­al assas­si­na­tions of black lead­ers dis­rupt­ed our utopi­an dreams .
These media episodes of fleet­ing noto­ri­ety always led to some extrav­a­gant and fan­tas­tic asser­tions about what I did , what I might have said and what I prob­a­bly believe now .
It was always a bit sur­re­al .
Then came this polit­i­cal season .
Dur­ing the pri­ma­ry , the blo­gos­phere was full of chat­ter about my rela­tion­ship with Pres­i­dent - elect Barack Oba­ma .
We had served togeth­er on the board of the Woods Foun­da­tion and knew one anoth­er as neigh­bors in Chicago ’s Hyde Park .
In 1996 , at a cof­fee gath­er­ing that my wife , Bernar­dine Dohrn , and I held for him , I made a dona­tion to his cam­paign for the Illi­nois State Senate .
Obama ’s polit­i­cal rivals and ene­mies thought they saw an oppor­tu­ni­ty to deep­en a dis­hon­est per­cep­tion that he is some­how un-Amer­i­can , alien , linked to rad­i­cal ideas , a clos­et ter­ror­ist who sym­pa­thizes with extrem­ism – and they pounced .
Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s ( D‑N.Y. ) cam­paign pro­vid­ed the script , which includ­ed guilt by asso­ci­a­tion , demo­niza­tion of peo­ple Oba­ma knew ( or might have known ) , creepy ques­tions about his back­ground and dark hints about hid­den secrets yet to be uncovered .
On March 13 , Sen. John McCain ( R‑Ariz . ) , appar­ent­ly in an attempt to reas­sure the ​ “ base , ” sat down for an inter­view with Sean Han­ni­ty of Fox News .
McCain was not yet aware of the nar­ra­tive Han­ni­ty had been spin­ning for months , and so Han­ni­ty filled him in : Ayers is an unre­pen­tant ​“ ter­ror­ist , ” he explained , ​ “ On 9 ⁄ 11 , of all days , he had an arti­cle where he bragged about bomb­ing our Pen­ta­gon , bomb­ing the Capi­tol and bomb­ing New York City police head­quar­ters . …
He said , ​‘I regret not doing more . ’ “
McCain could n’t believe it .
Nei­ther could I .
On the cam­paign trail , McCain imme­di­ate­ly got on mes­sage .
I became a prop , a car­toon char­ac­ter cre­at­ed to be pummeled .
When Alas­ka Gov. Sarah Palin got hold of it , the attack went viral .
At a now - famous Oct. 4 ral­ly , she said Oba­ma was ​ “ pallin ’ around with ter­ror­ists . ”
( I pic­tured us shar­ing a milk­shake with two straws . )
The crowd began chant­i­ng , ​ “ Kill him ! ” ​ “ Kill him ! ”
It was down­hill from there .
My voice­mail filled up with hate mes­sages .
They were most­ly from men , all vent­ing and sweat­ing and breath­ing heav­i­ly .
A few threats : ​ “ Watch out ! ” and ​ “ You deserve to be shot . ”
And some e‑mails , like this one I got from satan@​hell .​com : ​ “ I ’m com­ing to get you and when I do , I ’ll water - board you . ”
The police lieu­tenant who came to copy down those threats dead­panned that he hoped the guy who was going to shoot me got there before the guy who was going to water - board me , since it would be most foul to be tor­tured and then shot .
( We have been pals ever since he was first assigned to inves­ti­gate threats made against me in 1987 , after I was hired as an assis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Illi­nois at Chicago . )
The good news was that every time McCain or Palin men­tioned my name , they lost a point or two in the polls .
The car­toon invent­ed to hurt Oba­ma was now pok­ing holes in the rapid­ly sink­ing McCain - Palin ship .
That ​ ’ 60 s show
On Aug. 28 , Stephen Col­bert , the faux right - wing com­men­ta­tor from Com­e­dy Cen­tral who chan­nels Bill O’Reilly on steroids , observed :
To this day , when our coun­try holds a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion , we judge the can­di­dates through the lens of the 1960 s. …
We all know Oba­ma is cozy with William Ayers a ​ ’ 60 s rad­i­cal who plant­ed a bomb in the cap­i­tal build­ing and then lat­er went on to even more heinous crimes by becom­ing a col­lege pro­fes­sor .
…
Let us keep fight­ing the cul­ture wars of our grand­par­ents .
The ​ ’ 60 s are a polit­i­cal gift that keeps on giving .
It was inevitable .
McCain would bet the house on a dis­hon­est and large­ly dis­cred­it­ed vision of the ​ ’60s , which was the defin­ing decade for him .
He built his polit­i­cal career on being a pris­on­er of war in Vietnam .
The ​’60s – as myth and sym­bol – is much abused : the down­fall of civ­i­liza­tion in one account , a time of defeat and humil­i­a­tion in a sec­ond , and a per­fect moment of right­eous oppo­si­tion , peace and love in a third .
The idea that the 2008 elec­tion may be the last time in Amer­i­can polit­i­cal life that the ​ ’60s plays any role what­so­ev­er is a mixed bless­ing .
On the one hand , let ’s get over the nos­tal­gia and move on .
On the oth­er , the lessons we might have learned from the black free­dom move­ment and from the resis­tance against the Viet­nam War have nev­er been learned .
To achieve this would require that we face his­to­ry ful­ly and hon­est­ly , some­thing this nation has nev­er done .
The war in Viet­nam was an ille­gal inva­sion and occu­pa­tion , much of it con­duct­ed as a war of ter­ror against the civil­ian pop­u­la­tion .
The U.S. mil­i­tary killed mil­lions of Viet­namese in air raids – like the one con­duct­ed by McCain – and entire areas of the coun­try were des­ig­nat­ed free - fire zones , where Amer­i­can pilots indis­crim­i­nate­ly dropped sur­plus ordi­nance – an immoral enter­prise by any measure .
What is real­ly important
McCain and Palin – or as our late friend Studs Terkel put it , ​ “ Joe McCarthy in drag ” – would like to bury the ​ ’60s .
The ​’60s , after all , was a time of reject­ing obe­di­ence and con­for­mi­ty in favor of ini­tia­tive and courage .
The ​’60s pushed us to a deep­er appre­ci­a­tion of the human­i­ty of every human being .
And that is the threat it pos­es to the right wing , hence the attacks and all the guilt by association .
McCain and Palin demand­ed to ​ “ know the full extent ” of the Oba­ma - Ayers ​ “ rela­tion­ship ” so that they can know if Oba­ma , as Palin put it , ​“ is telling the truth to the Amer­i­can peo­ple or not . ”
This is just plain stupid .
Oba­ma has con­tin­u­al­ly been asked to defend some­thing that ought to be at democracy ’s heart : the impor­tance of talk­ing to as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble in this com­pli­cat­ed and wild­ly diverse soci­ety , of lis­ten­ing with the pos­si­bil­i­ty of learn­ing some­thing new , and of speak­ing with the pos­si­bil­i­ty of per­suad­ing or influ­enc­ing others .
The McCain - Palin attacks not only involved guilt by asso­ci­a­tion , they also assumed that one must apply a polit­i­cal lit­mus test to begin a conversation .
On Oct. 4 , Palin described her sup­port­ers as those who ​ “ see Amer­i­ca as the great­est force for good in this world ” and as a ​ “ bea­con of light and hope for oth­ers who seek free­dom and democ­ra­cy . ”
But Oba­ma , she said , ​ “ Is not a man who sees Amer­i­ca as you see it and how I see Amer­i­ca . ”
In oth­er words , there are ​ “ real ” Amer­i­cans – and then there are the rest of us .
In a robust and sophis­ti­cat­ed democ­ra­cy , polit­i­cal lead­ers – and all of us – ought to seek ways to talk with many peo­ple who hold dis­sent­ing , or even rad­i­cal , ideas .
Lack­ing that sim­ple and yet essen­tial capac­i­ty to ques­tion author­i­ty , we might still be burn­ing witch­es and enslav­ing our fel­low human beings today .
Maybe we could wel­come our cur­rent sit­u­a­tion – torn by anoth­er ille­gal war , as it was in the ​’60s – as an oppor­tu­ni­ty to search for the new .
Per­haps we might think of our­selves not as pas­sive con­sumers of pol­i­tics but as ful­ly mobi­lized polit­i­cal actors .
Per­haps we might think of our var­i­ous efforts now , as we did then , as more than a sin­gle cam­paign , but rather as our movement - in - the - making .
We might find hope in the growth of oppo­si­tion to war and occu­pa­tion world­wide .
Or we might be inspired by the grow­ing move­ments for repa­ra­tions and prison abo­li­tion , or the ris­ing immi­grant rights move­ment and the stir­rings of work­ing peo­ple every­where , or by gay and les­bian and trans­gen­der peo­ple coura­geous­ly press­ing for full recognition .
Yet hope – my hope , our hope – resides in a sim­ple self - evi­dent truth : the future is unknown , and it is also entire­ly unknowable .
His­to­ry is always in the mak­ing .
It ’s up to us .
It is up to me and to you .
Noth­ing is pre­de­ter­mined .
That makes our moment on this earth both hope­ful and all the more urgent – we must find ways to become real actors , to become authen­tic sub­jects in our own history .
We may not be able to will a move­ment into being , but nei­ther can we sit idly for a move­ment to spring full - grown , as from the head of Zeus .
We have to agi­tate for democ­ra­cy and egal­i­tar­i­an­ism , press hard­er for human rights , learn to build a new soci­ety through our self - trans­for­ma­tions and our lim­it­ed every­day struggles .
At the turn of the last cen­tu­ry , Eugene Debs , the great Social­ist Par­ty leader from Terre Haute , Ind. , told a group of work­ers in Chica­go , ​ “ If I could lead you into the Promised Land , I would not do it , because some­one else would come along and lead you out . ”
In this time of new begin­nings and ris­ing expec­ta­tions , it is even more urgent that we fig­ure out how to become the peo­ple we have been wait­ing to be .

Here ’s the image for this week ’s “ Where In The Universe ” challenge .
And , like last week , we ’ll provide the image , but wo n’t reveal the answer right away .
This gives everyone a chance to mull over the image and provide their answer in the comment section .
But check back tomorrow for the answer and to see how you did .
Again , here ’s the procedure :
Take a look at the image above and try to determine where in the universe this image was taken .
Give yourself extra points if you can name the spacecraft responsible for taking this image .
Post your answers in the comments ( if you ’re brave enough ! ) and check back tomorrow for the answer .
Good luck !
UPDATE : The answer has now been posted below .
If you have n’t made your guess yet , no peeking before you do !!
As the majority of the commenters said , this is Neptune ’s moon Triton , taken by Voyager 2 .
In the summer of 1989 , NASA ’s Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft to observe the planet Neptune , its final planetary target .
Passing about 4,950 kilometers ( 3,000 miles ) above Neptune ’s north pole , Voyager 2 made its closest approach to any planet since leaving Earth 12 years earlier .
Five hours later , Voyager 2 passed about 40,000 kilometers ( 25,000 miles ) from Neptune ’s largest moon , Triton , the last solid body the spacecraft will have an opportunity to study .
Good job , everyone !
Was George W. Bush a conservative president ?
For liberals , this is a settled question .
Bush is not merely a conservative , he is the conservative .
He is the ur - right - winger , the Platonic ideal of all that is truly Republican .
For some liberals , this is clearly just a tactical pose .
Bush is unpopular , so they hope to discredit conservatism by marrying it to Bush , just as Barack Obama succeeded by painting John McCain as a Bush clone .
This is the moment , as Obama might say , to permanently block the right - hand fork in the road so the country can only move leftward .
The view on the right is very different , and the debate about the Bush years will largely determine the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement .

Bush ’s brand of conservatism was always a controversial innovation on the right .
Recall that in 2000 he promised to be a “ different kind of Republican , ” and he kept his word .
His partner in passing the No Child Left Behind Act was liberal Massachusetts Sen .
Ted Kennedy .
Bush ’s prescription drug benefit -- the largest expansion of entitlements since the Great Society -- was hugely controversial on the right .
He signed the McCain - Feingold bill to the dismay of many Republicans who ’d spent years denouncing campaign - finance “ reform ” as an assault on freedom of speech .
The fight over his immigration plan nearly tore the conservative movement apart .
This is not to suggest that Bush was in fact a liberal president .
Politics is not binary like that .
There were conservative triumphs -- and failures -- to the Bush presidency .
He appointed two solid conservatives to the Supreme Court .
He tried to privatize Social Security , though that failed for sundry reasons .
His much - touted “ compassionate conservatism ” was rejected by many of us on the right as a slap to traditional conservatives and an intellectual betrayal of Reaganite principles .
It was a rhetorical capitulation to Bill Clinton ’s feel - your - pain political posturing and an embrace of the assumptions that have been the undergirding of liberalism since the New Deal .
That is , the measure of one ’s compassion is directly proportionate to one ’s support for large and costly government programs .
And Bush admitted as much .
In an interview with the Weekly Standard ’s Fred Barnes , Bush explained that he rejected William F. Buckley ’s brand of anti-government conservatism .
Conservatives had to “ lead ” and to be “ activist , ” he said .
In 2003 , Bush proclaimed that when “ somebody hurts ” government has to “ move . ”
This was n’t a philosophy of government as much as gooey marketing posing as principle .
Ronald Reagan would have spontaneously burst into flames if he ’d uttered such sentiments .

Dissent from Bush was muted for years , in large part because of 9/11 and the Iraq war .
Conservatives , right or wrong , rallied to support their president , particularly in the face of shrill partisan attacks from Democrats who seemed more interested in tearing down the commander in chief than winning a war .
But the Bush chapter is closing , and the fight to write the next one has begun .
In one corner , there are a large number of bright , mostly younger , self - styled reformers with a diverse -- and often contradictory -- set of proposals to win back middle - class voters and restore the GOP ’s status as “ the party of ideas ” ( as the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it ) .
In another corner are self - proclaimed traditional conservatives and Reaganites , led most notably by Rush Limbaugh , who believe that the party desperately needs to get back to the basics : limited government , low taxes and strong defense .
What is fascinating is that both camps seem implicitly to agree that the real challenge lurks in how to account for the Bush years .
For the young Turks and their older allies -- my National Review colleagues Ramesh Ponnuru , Yuval Levin and David Frum , the Atlantic ’s Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam , New York Times columnist David Brooks et al -- the problem is that Bush botched the GOP ’s shot at real reform .
For the Limbaugh crowd , the issue seems to be that we ’ve already tried this reform stuff -- from both Bush and McCain -- and look where it ’s gotten us .

Neither camp has adequately explained where Bush figures in their vision for the future of the party .
Is reform going to be a debugged compassionate conservatism 2.0 or a Reaganesque revival of conservative problem solving ?
Does back - to - basics mean breaking with the precedents of the last eight years or building on them ?
The irony is that both camps agree on a lot more than they disagree .
The reformers are committed to market principles and reducing the size and role of government , and so are the back - to - basics crowd .
The problem is that an elephant named George in the room is blocking each side from seeing what the other is all about .
But hopefully not for much longer .

Leon Trotsky - Culture and Socialism - 1927
By Leon Trotsky
23 October 2008
This work concisely explains the fundamentals of a Marxist approach to culture and art , explaining the link between the growth of technological culture and mass acquisition of artistic and spiritual culture in the 1920s USSR .
Trotsky begins by discussing the different components of culture : technology and material culture , philosophy , the natural sciences , and the arts and humanities .
After polemicizing against views – then promoted by the growing Soviet bureaucracy under the name " proletarian culture " – that art from previous epochs of mankind 's history should be disregarded due to their dangerous class influences , Trotsky explains the material realities of the early USSR with which the Marxist movement had to deal in order to raise the cultural level of the population .
This text is a slightly edited version of the translation by Brian Pearce which originally appeared in Labour Review , New Park Publications , in Autumn 1962 .
* * *
I. Technology and Culture
Let us recall first of all that culture once signified a ploughed , cultivated field , as opposed to untouched forests and virgin lands .
Culture was juxtaposed to nature , that is , what had been achieved by human effort was contrasted with the gifts of nature .
This juxtaposition fundamentally retains its force even today .
Culture is all that has been created , built , assimilated and achieved by man throughout the course of his entire history , in contrast with what has been given by nature , including the natural history of man himself as an animal species .
The science which studies man as a product of animal evolution is called anthropology .
But from the very moment when man separated himself from the animal kingdom , – and this occurred approximately when he first took into his hands primitive tools such as stones or sticks and armed the organs of his body with them , – from that time the creation and accumulation of culture began , that is , of all kinds of knowledge and skill in the struggle with nature in order to pacify nature .
When we speak of the culture accumulated by past generations , we deliberately rest upon primarily its material acquisitions in the form of tools , machines , buildings , monuments and so forth .
Is this culture ?
Undoubtedly it is culture , or its material deposits , – material culture .
It creates , – on the foundations of nature – the basic setting for our life , our everyday existence , and our creativity .
But the most valuable part of culture consists of its deposits in the consciousness of man himself – our devices , customs , skills , and acquired capabilities which grew out of all preceding material culture and , while resting upon it , continues to rebuild it .
We will then , comrades , consider it firmly established : culture grows out of man 's struggle with nature for existence , for the improvements of living conditions , for the increase of his power .
But it is on this basis that classes grow as well .
In the process of adapting to nature , in the struggle with its hostile forces , human society develops into a complex class organization .
It is the class structure of society which most decisively determines the content and form of human history , i.e. , its material relations and their ideological reflections .
By saying this , we are also saying that historical culture has a class character .
Slave society , feudal - serf and bourgeois society have engendered a corresponding culture : at various stages there is different culture , with a multitude of transitional forms .
Historical society is the organization of the exploitation of man by man .
Culture serves the class organization of society .
An exploiting society gives birth to an exploitative culture .
But does this then mean that we are against all culture of the past ?
We have indeed come upon a profound contradiction .
Everything that has been won , created and built through the efforts of man and which serves to elevate man 's powers – is culture .
But since we are dealing with social rather than individual man ; since culture is a socio- historical phenomenon by its very essence ; since historical society was and continues to be class society , then culture unfolds as a fundamental instrument of class oppression .
Marx said : " The dominant ideas of an epoch are the ideas of the ruling class of the given epoch . "
This statement also applies to culture as a whole .
Yet we say to the working class : you must master all the culture of the past , otherwise you wo n't build socialism .
How can this be understood ?
Many have stumbled over this contradiction , and they stumble so frequently because they approach the concept of class society superficially , semi-idealistically , forgetting that fundamentally this is the organization of production .
Every class society developed according to definite means of struggling with nature , and these means have changed depending on the development of technology .
What is more fundamental : the class organization of society or its productive forces ?
Undoubtedly , the productive forces .
For it is on them , on a certain level of their development , that classes evolve and refashion themselves .
In the productive forces is expressed man 's materialized economic skill , his historical ability to secure his own existence .
Classes grow on this dynamic foundation , and their mutual relations determine the character of culture .
And hence , with regard to technology above all else , we must ask ourselves : is it only an instrument of class oppression ?
It is enough to ask such a question to be able to answer at once : no , technology is a basic conquest of mankind ; although it has indeed served until now as an instrument of exploitation , it is at the same time the basic requirement for the liberation of the exploited .
The machine strangles the wage - slave .
But the wage - slave can only be freed through the machine .
Herein lies the root of the whole question .
If we do n't forget that the driving force of the historical process is the growth of productive forces which liberate man from the power of nature , then we will understand that the proletariat must master the entire accumulation of knowledge and skill , developed by mankind over the course of its history , in order to raise itself up by rebuilding life on the principles of solidarity .
" Does culture drive technology , or technology culture ? " – asks one of the notes lying before me .
This is the wrong way to pose the question .
Technology cannot be counterposed to culture , for it is culture 's mainspring .
Without technology there is no culture .
The growth of technology drives culture forward .
But the science and general culture which rise up on the basis of technology give a powerful impulse to the growth of technology .
Here there is a dialectical interaction .
Comrades , if you need a simple but expressive example of the contradiction imbedded in technology itself , then you wo n't find a better one than railways .
If you examine European passenger trains , then you will see there wagons of " various classes . "
These classes remind us of the classes in capitalist society .
First class is for the privileged elite , second for the middle bourgeoisie , third for the petty bourgeoisie and fourth – for the proletariat , which for good reason was formerly called the fourth estate .
Taken by themselves , railways are a colossal cultural and technological conquest by mankind , which greatly changed the face of the earth in the course of a single century .
But the class structure of society influences even the structure of the means of transport .
And our Soviet railways are still a long ways from equality .
That is not only because they use wagons inherited from the past , but also because the New Economic Policy only prepares equality , but does not create it .
Before the advent of railways , civilization crowded along the shores of the seas and banks of large rivers .
Railways introduced whole continents to capitalist culture .
One of the fundamental , if not the most fundamental reason for the backwardness and neglect of the Russian village is the lack of railways , highways and access roads .
In this respect , the majority of our villages remain in pre-capitalist conditions .
We must overcome what is our great ally and at the same time our greatest foe – distance .
Socialist economy is planned economy .
A plan assumes communication , most of all .
The means of transportation are the most important mode of communication .
Every new railway line is a road to culture , and in our conditions a road to socialism .
Once again , with the raising of the technology of the means of transportation and the prosperity of the country , the social profile of the railways will change as well : the division into " classes " will disappear , and everyone will travel in comfortable wagons ... if , by that time people still ride in wagons , rather than preferring to travel on airplanes which are available to one and all .
Let 's take another example – the instruments of militarism , the means of destruction .
In this sphere the class nature of society is expressed in particularly clear and repulsive forms .
There is no destructive device , be it an explosive or a poisonous substance , the discovery of which would not be a valuable scientific or technological achievement in itself .
Explosives or poisonous substances can also be used for creative , and not only destructive purposes , and they open up new possibilities in the area of discoveries and inventions .
The proletariat can seize state power only by shattering the old apparatus of class rule .
We have performed this work more decisively than ever has been done in history .
However , in building a new apparatus , we discovered that we were compelled to use elements of the old to a certain and rather significant degree .
The further socialist reconstruction of the state apparatus is inextricably linked with political , economic and cultural work in general .
We do n't have to shatter technology .
The proletariat takes possession of the factories outfitted by the bourgeoisie , and it does so in the form in which the revolutionary overthrow found them .
The old equipment serves us to this very day .
Such a circumstance reveals most clearly and directly the fact that we do not renounce this " heritage . "
How could it be otherwise ?
After all , the revolution was carried out precisely in order to seize this " heritage . "
However , in the form in which we took it , the old technology is completely unsuitable for socialism .
It represents the crystallized anarchy of the capitalist economy .
The competition between various enterprises , the drive for profits , the uneven development of separate branches , the backwardness of various regions , the small - scale nature of agriculture , the squandering of human resources , – in technology all this found its expression in iron and copper .
But whereas the apparatus of class oppression can be shattered with a revolutionary blow , the productive apparatus of capitalist anarchy can only be reconstructed gradually .
The completion of the restoration period , – on the basis of the old equipment – only leads us to the threshold of this grandiose task .
We must complete it no matter what .
II .
The Heritage of Spiritual Culture
Spiritual culture is just as contradictory as material culture .
And just as from the arsenals and warehouses of material culture we put into circulation not the bow and arrow , not stone tools or bronze age tools , but we take the best possible tools of the latest technology , – we must approach spiritual culture in just the same way .
The main element in the culture of the old society was religion .
It was the most important form of human knowledge and unity ; but in this form was expressed most of all the weakness of man before nature and his powerlessness within society .
We are thoroughly sweeping aside religion and all its surrogates .
The situation with philosophy is different .
From the philosophy created by class society we must assimilate two invaluable elements : materialism and dialectics .
It was precisely from the organic combination of materialism and dialectics that Marx 's method was born and his system arose .
This method lies at the foundations of Leninism .
If we pass on to science in the true sense of the word , then here it becomes absolutely clear that we confront an enormous reservoir of knowledge and skill accumulated by mankind throughout its long life .
One can , it is true , point out that in science , whose goal is the cognition of reality , there are many tendentious class adulterations .
Absolutely correct !
If even the railways show signs of the privileged position of some and the poverty of others , then the same applies even more so to science , whose material is much more flexible than the metal and wood used to build railway cars .
But we must keep in mind that scientific creativity is fundamentally nourished by the need to understand nature , in order to master its forces .
Although class interests have introduced and continue to introduce false tendencies even in the natural sciences , nevertheless this falsification is limited by the bounds beyond which it begins to directly obstruct technological progress .
If you examine the natural sciences from the ground up , from the realm of accumulating elementary facts to the highest and most complex generalizations , then you will see that the more empirical the scientific investigation , the closer it is to its material and to the facts , the more indisputable are the results it gives .
The wider the field of generalizations , the more closely natural science comes to problems of philosophy , the more susceptible it is to the influence of class suggestions .
Matters are more complicated and worse when it comes to the social sciences and the so - called " humanities " .
Even here , of course , the desire to know what is was fundamentally at work .
Due to this we have had , by the way , the brilliant school of classical bourgeois economists .
But class interest , which is felt in the social sciences much more directly and imperatively than in natural science , soon brought to a halt the development of economic thought in bourgeois society .
In this field we communists are better armed , however , than in any other .
Basing themselves on bourgeois science and criticizing it , the socialist theoreticians who were awakened by the class struggle of the proletariat created , in the works of Marx and Engels , the powerful method of historical materialism and its unsurpassed application in Capital .
This does not mean , of course , that we are insured against the influence of bourgeois ideas in the fields of economics and sociology as a whole .
No , at every step the most vulgar professorial - socialistic and philistine - populist tendencies burst into our everyday practice from the old " treasure - houses " of knowledge , seeking nourishment for themselves in the amorphous and contradictory relations of the transitional period .
But even in this realm we have the irreplaceable criteria of Marxism which have been verified and enriched in Lenin 's works .
And the less we restrict ourselves to the experience of today , the more widely we embrace world - wide economic development as a whole , separating its basic tendencies from conjunctural changes , the more decisive will be our victory over vulgar economists and sociologists .
In questions of law , morality and ideology in general , the situation of bourgeois science is even more lamentable , if this is possible , than in the realm of economics .
One can find a tiny pearl of genuine knowledge in these fields only after rummaging through dozens of professorial dungheaps .
Dialectics and materialism comprise the basic elements of the Marxist cognition of the world .
But this by no means implies that they can be applied in any field of knowledge like an ever - ready master - key .
The dialectic cannot be imposed on facts , it must be derived from the facts , from their nature and their development .
Only painstaking work on boundless material gave Marx the ability to erect the dialectical system of economics on the concept of value as realized labor .
Marx 's historical works , and even his newspaper articles , are constructed in the same way .
One can apply dialectical materialism to new fields of knowledge only while mastering them from within .
Bourgeois science can be cleaned up only by mastering bourgeois science .
You will achieve nothing here by wild criticism or naked command .
Assimilation and application go hand in hand here with critical re-working .
We have the method , but there is enough work to last generations .
The Marxist criticism of science must be not only vigilant , but cautious , otherwise it might degenerate into out - and - out sycophancy or Famusovism .
[ 1 ]
Let us take psychology as an example .
Pavlov 's reflexology completely follows the lines of dialectical materialism .
It destroys for all time the wall between physiology and psychology .
The simplest reflex is physiological , and a system of reflexes gives us " consciousness . "
The accumulation of physiological quantity yields a new " psychological " quality .
The method of Pavlov 's school is experimental and painstaking .
Generalizations are being won step by step : from a dog 's saliva to poetry , i.e. , to its psychological mechanics ( but not its social content ) .
Of course , the paths leading to poetry are yet to be seen .
The school of the Viennese psychoanalyst Freud takes a different approach to the problem .
It assumes in advance that the driving force behind the most complex and refined psychic processes is physiological need .
In this general sense it is materialistic , if we leave aside the question of whether or not it places too much emphasis on the sexual element at the expense of others , for this is already a debate within the confines of materialism .
But the psychoanalyst does n't approach the problem of consciousness experimentally , from lower phenomena to higher , or from simple reflex to complex ; he tries to take all these intermediate steps with a single bound , going from the top down , from religious myth , lyrical poem or dream – straight to the physiological foundation of the psyche .
Idealists teach that the psyche is independent , and that the " soul " is a bottomless well .
Both Pavlov and Freud consider that physiology is the bottom of the " soul . "
But Pavlov , like a diver , descends to the bottom and painstakingly investigates the well from the bottom up .
Freud , on the other hand , stands above the well , and with a penetrating stare tries to capture or guess the outlines of the bottom through the depths of the ever - changing and murky water .
Pavlov 's method is the experiment .
Freud 's method is conjecture , and sometimes fantastic .
The attempt to declare psychoanalysis " incompatible " with Marxism and to simply turn one 's back on Freudianism is too simple , or , to be more precise , simplistic .
But in no case are we obliged to adopt Freudianism either .
It is a working hypothesis which can give and undoubtedly does give conclusions and conjectures which go along the lines of materialist psychology .
In time , the experimental path leads to verification .
But we have neither the grounds nor the right to impose a ban on the other path , which , even if it is less reliable , still tries to anticipate the conclusions that will be reached by the experimental path , just much more slowly . [ 2 ]
With these examples I wanted , if only partially , to show the diversity of our scientific heritage and the complexity of the ways in which the proletariat can begin to master it .
If in economic construction matters are not decided by decree and we must " learn to trade , " then in science , naked command will yield nothing but harm and embarrassment .
Here we have to " learn how to learn . "
Art is one of the forms through which man finds an orientation in the world ; in this sense the heritage of art is no different from the heritage of science and technology , – and it is no less contradictory .
However , unlike science , art is a form of cognizing the world not as a system of laws , but as a grouping of images and , at the same time , as a means of inspiring certain feelings and moods .
The art of past centuries has made man more complex and flexible , raising his psyche to a higher level and enriching his mind in many ways .
This enrichment is an invaluable conquest of culture .
Mastery of the old art is therefore a necessary prerequisite not only for the creation of a new art , but for the construction of a new society , because for communism , people are needed with a highly developed psyche .
Is the old art capable , however , of enriching us with the artistic cognition of the world ?
Yes , it is .
And it is precisely for this reason that it is capable of nourishing our feelings and cultivating them .
If we were to indiscriminately renounce the old art , then immediately we would become poorer in spirit .
Here and there we can observe among us today the tendency to advance the idea that art has as its goal only the inspiration of certain moods , but by no means the cognition of reality .
Hence the conclusion : what kind of feelings can we be infected with by the art of the nobility or bourgeoisie ?
This is fundamentally wrong .
The significance of art as a means of cognition – not only for the popular masses too , but for them in particular – is no less than its " sensual " significance .
Not only the heroic poem , but the fairy - tale , song , proverb and popular ditty give us cognition in images ; they illuminate the past , generalize our experience , widen our horizons , and only in this connection are capable of inspiring certain " feelings . "
This applies to all literature in general , not only to the epos but to the lyrical poem as well .
It applies to painting and sculpture , too .
The only exception , in a certain sense , is music , the effect of which is powerful , but one - sided .
Of course , even music is based on a particular cognition of nature , of its sound and rhythms .
But here the cognition is so deeply concealed , and the results of nature 's inspirations so greatly refracted through the nerves of man , that music acts as a self - sufficient " revelation . "
Attempts to approximate all forms of art to music as the art of " infection " have frequently been made , and they always have signified the reduction of the role of reason in art in favor of an amorphous sensuality ; in this sense they were and are reactionary ...
Worst of all , of course , are such works of " art " which give us neither cognition in images nor artistic " infection , " but which advance the most outlandish pretensions .
We publish no small number of such works , and unfortunately they appear not in student notebooks of work - studios , but in many thousands of copies ...
Culture is a social phenomenon .
For this very reason , language , as an instrument of communication between people , is its most important tool .
The culture of language itself is the most important condition for the growth of all fields of culture , particularly science and art .
Just as technology remains unsatisfied by the old measuring instruments and creates new ones : micrometers , voltmeters and so forth , aiming for and achieving ever greater accuracy , so , too , in the realm of language , the ability to choose the appropriate words and to combine them in the appropriate fashion , we need constant and systematic painstaking work on the achievement of the greatest precision , clarity and sharpness .
The basis of this work must be the fight against illiteracy , semi-literacy or a low level of literacy .
The next stage in this work is the mastery of classical Russian literature .
Yes , culture has been the main instrument of class oppression .
But culture , and it alone , can become the instrument of socialist emancipation .
III .
Our Cultural Contradictions
Town and Country
What is peculiar about our position is that we – at the crossroads of the capitalist West and the colonial - peasant East – were the first to carry out a socialist revolution .
The regime of proletarian dictatorship was first established in a country with an enormous heritage of backwardness and barbarism , so that with us whole centuries of history lie between a Siberian nomad and a Moscow or Leningrad proletarian .
Our social forms are transitional to socialism , therefore they are immeasurably higher than capitalist forms .
In this sense we are justified in considering ourselves the most advanced country in the world .
But our technology , which lies at the foundations of material or any other culture , is extraordinarily backward in comparison to the advanced capitalist countries .
Herein lies the basic contradiction of our present reality .
The historical task which flows from this contradiction consists in raising technology to the level of the social form .
If we were unable to do this , then our social structure would inevitably fall to the level of our technological backwardness .
Yes , in order to understand the full significance of technological progress for us , we must openly tell ourselves : if we were to be unable to supplement the Soviet form of our structure with the required productive technology , then we would preclude the possibility of making the transition to socialism and we would return back to capitalism , – and to what kind ?
To semi-serf , semi-colonial capitalism .
The struggle for technology for us is the struggle for socialism , to which the entire future of our culture is inextricably linked .
Here is a fresh and very expressive example of our cultural contradictions .
A few days ago a note appeared in our newspapers that our Public Library in Leningrad has taken first place when it comes to the number of volumes : it now holds 4,250,000 books !
Our first sensation is a legitimate feeling of Soviet pride : our library is the first in the world !
To what do we owe this achievement ?
To the fact that we expropriated private libraries .
By nationalizing private property we have created the richest cultural institution , which is accessible to all .
This simple fact indisputably illustrates the great advantages of the Soviet structure .
But at the same time our cultural backwardness is expressed in the fact that the percentage of illiteracy in our country is greater than in any other European nation .
Our library is first in the world , but as yet the minority of our population reads books .
That 's the way it is almost everywhere .
Nationalized industry with gigantic but far from fantastic projects of the Dneprostroi , the Volga - Don Canal , etc. , – yet the peasants still thresh with flails and rollers .
Our marital legislation is permeated with a socialist spirit , but beatings still play no small role in family life .
These and other contradictions flow from the entire structure of our culture , which is at the crossroads between West and East .
The basis of our backwardness is the monstrous domination of the village over the city , of agriculture over industry ; moreover the village is dominated once again by the most backward tools and means of production .
When we speak about historical serfdom , we primarily have in mind estate relations , the bondage of the peasant to the land - owner and Tsarist official .
But , comrades , serfdom has a deeper foundation beneath it : the bondage of man to the earth , the full dependence of the peasant on the elements .
Have you read Gleb Uspensky ?
I fear that the younger generation is not reading him .
We must republish him , or at least his best works , and he has some superb ones .
Uspensky was a populist .
His political program was thoroughly utopian .
But Uspensky – the chronicler of the village – is not only a superb artist , he is also a remarkable realist .
He was able to understand the everyday life of the peasant and his psyche as derived phenomena which grow on an economic base and which are completely determined by it .
He was able to understand the economic base of the village as the enslaved dependence of the peasant in the labor - process on the soil , and in general on the forces of nature .
You should definitely read at least his Power of the Land .
With Uspensky , artistic intuition replaces the Marxist method and , judging from its results , can in many respects compete with it .
For precisely this reason , Uspensky the artist was always locked in mortal combat with Uspensky the populist .
Even now we still must learn from the artist if we want to understand the powerful remnants of serfdom in peasant life , particularly in family relations , which often spill over into city life : it is enough to listen carefully to the different notes of the discussion now unfolding concerning problems of marital legislation !
In all parts of the world , capitalism has made extremely tense the contradiction between industry and agriculture , town and country .
In our country , due to the belatedness of our historical development , this contradiction bears an absolutely monstrous character .
No matter how strange it might seem , our industry has already tried to equal the European and American examples at a time when our countryside has kept receding into the depths of the seventeenth and even more distant centuries .
Even in America capitalism is clearly unable to raise agriculture to the level of industry .
This task completely passes over to socialism .
In our conditions , with the colossal predominance of the village over the city , the industrialization of agriculture is the most important part of socialist construction .
By the industrialization of agriculture we understand two processes , which , only when taken in combination , can finally and decisively erase the boundary between town and country .
Let us dwell a bit more on this crucial question .
The industrialization of agriculture consists , on the one hand , in the separation from the village domestic economy of a whole series of branches involved in the preliminary processing of industrial resources and raw foodstuffs .
For all industry in general has come from the countryside , by way of handicrafts and primitive production , through the detachment of various branches from the closed system of household economy , through specialization , and the creation of the necessary training , technology , and then even machine production .
Our Soviet industrialization will have to follow this path to a large degree , i.e. , it must follow the path of socializing a whole series of productive processes which stand between village economy , in the true sense of the word , and industry .
The example of the United States shows that unlimited possibilities lie before us .
But the question is not exhausted by what we have said .
The overcoming of the contradictions between agriculture and industry assumes the industrialization of field - crop cultivation , animal husbandry , horticulture and so forth .
This means that even these branches of productive activity must be based on scientific technology : the broad utilization of machines in the correct combination , tractorization and electrification , fertilization , proper crop rotation , laboratory and experimental testing of methods and results , the correct organization of the entire production process with the most rational use of labor power , etc .
Of course , even highly organized field cultivation will differ in some ways from machine - building .
But then even in industry , various branches profoundly differ from one another .
If today we are justified in juxtaposing agriculture to industry as a whole , then this is because agriculture is conducted on a small scale and by primitive means , with a slavish dependence of the producer on the conditions of nature and with highly uncultured conditions of existence for the peasant - producer .
It is not enough to socialize , i.e. to switch over to factory rails , separate branches of today 's village economy , such as butter - making , cheese - making , the production of starch or syrup , etc .
We must socialize agriculture itself , that is , tear it away from its present state of fragmentation and replace today 's squalid digging around in the soil with scientifically organized grain and rye " factories , " with cattle and sheep " processing plants , " and so forth .
That this is possible is shown in part by the capitalist experience already at hand , in particular in the agricultural experience of Denmark , where even hens have been subordinated to planning and standardization ; they lay eggs according to schedule , in enormous quantities , and of the same size and color .
The industrialization of agriculture means the elimination of today 's fundamental contradiction between countryside and city , and consequently , between the peasant and worker : when it comes to their role in the nation 's economy , their living standards , or their cultural level , they must approximate each other to such a degree that the very boundary between them has disappeared .
A society where the mechanized cultivation of the fields is an equal part of the planned economy , where the city adopts the advantages of the countryside ( open spaces , greenery ) , and where the village enriches itself with the advantages of the city ( paved roads , electric lights , piped water supply , sewer system ) , that is , where the very contradiction between town and country disappears , where the peasant and worker turn into participants of equal value and equal rights in a unified production process – such a society will be a genuine socialist society .
The road to this society is long and difficult .
Mighty electro - power stations are the most important milestones along the way .
They will bring to the village both light and transforming power : against the power of the soil – the power of electricity !
Not long ago we opened the Shatura power station , one of the best of our construction sites , built on a peat - bog .
From Moscow to Shatura is a little more than one hundred kilometers .
It would seem that they could shake hands .
And yet what a difference in conditions !
Moscow is the capital of the Communist International .
But you go a few dozen kilometers and you find backwoods , snow and fir - trees , frozen swamps and wild beasts .
Black , log - cabined hamlets lie dozing beneath the snow .
Sometimes wolf tracks can be seen from the window of the railway car .
Where the Shatura station now stands , a few years ago , when they started construction , elk could be found .
Now the distance between Moscow and Shatura is covered by a sophisticated construction of metallic masts which support the cable for 115,000 volts of current .
And beneath these masts , foxes and wolves will bring out their young .
That 's the way it is with our entire culture – it is made from the most extreme contradictions , from the highest achievements of technology and generalizing thought on the one hand , and from the primordial taiga on the other .
Shatura lives on peat as if it were pasture .
Indeed , all the miracles created by the childish imagination of religion , and even by the creative fantasy of poetry , pale before this simple fact : machines which occupy insignificant space are devouring the age - old swamp , transforming it into invisible energy , and returning it along slender cables to the same industry which created and set up these machines .
Shatura is a thing of beauty .
It was made by builders who were gifted and devoted to their work .
Its beauty is neither artificial nor superimposed , but growing from the inner characteristics and demands of technology itself .
The highest , indeed the only , criterion of technology is expediency .
The test of expediency is its ability to economize .
And this assumes the greatest correspondence between the whole and its parts , between means and ends .
The economic and technological criterion completely coincides with the aesthetic .
We can say , and this is no paradox : Shatura is a thing of beauty because the kilowatt - hour of its energy is cheaper than the kilowatt - hour of other stations constructed in similar conditions .
Shatura stands on a swamp .
We have many swamps in the Soviet Union , many more than power stations .
And we have many more forms of fuel which are waiting to be transformed into mechanical power .
In the south , the Dnieper flows through the wealthiest industrial region , expending the mighty forces of its current on nothing ; it plays along the centuries - old rapids , and waits for us to harness its currents with a dam , forcing it to illumine , set in motion and enrich our cities , factories and fields .
This we shall do !
In the United States of America , each inhabitant receives 500 kilowatt - hours of energy per year ; here , the figure is only 20 kilowatt - hours , that is , twenty - five times less .
In general we have fifty times less mechanical driving power per person than in the United States .
The Soviet system outfitted with American technology – that would be socialism .
Our social system would put American technology to other , incomparably more rational use .
But then American technology would transform our social structure and liberate it from the heritage of backwardness , primitiveness and barbarism .
The combination of the Soviet social structure with American technology fosters a new technology and new culture – a technology and culture for all , without favorites or outcasts .
The " Conveyor " Principle of Socialist Economy
The principle of socialist economy is harmoniousness , that is , continuity based on inner coordination .
Technologically , this principle finds its highest expression in the conveyor .
What is the conveyor ?
An endless moving belt which brings to the worker or takes away from him anything that is required by the pace of his work .
It is now widely known how Ford uses a combination of conveyors as a means of internal transport : of transfer and supply .
But the conveyor is something more : it is a method of regulating the very production process , insofar as the worker is forced to coordinate his movements with the movement of an endless belt .
Capitalism uses this for a higher and more thorough exploitation of the worker .
But such a usage is connected with capitalism , not with the conveyor as such .
Indeed , where is the development of the methods of regulating labor headed : in the direction of piecework payment or in the direction of the conveyor ?
Everything indicates that it is in the direction of the conveyor .
Piecework payment , much like any other form of individual control over the worker , is characteristic of capitalism during the early epochs of its development .
This way guarantees a full physiological workload for the individual worker , but it does n't guarantee the coordinated efforts of various workers .
Both of these problems are solved automatically by the conveyor .
Socialist organization of the economy must strive to lower the physiological burden of the individual workers in correspondence with the growth of technological power , at the same time maintaining the coordination of the efforts of different workers .
And that precisely will be the significance of the socialist conveyor , as opposed to the capitalist one .
Speaking more concretely , the main point here is the regulation of the belt 's movement given a certain number of workers ' hours , or , on the contrary , in the regulation of the workers ' time given a certain belt speed .
Under the capitalist system the conveyor is implemented within the framework of a single enterprise , as a method of internal transport .
But the principle of the conveyor as such is much wider .
Every separate enterprise receives from without raw materials , fuel , auxiliary materials , and supplemental labor power .
The relations between separate enterprises , even the most gigantic , are regulated by laws of the market , although it is true that these laws are in many instances limited by various kinds of long - term agreements .
But every factory taken separately , and even more so society as a whole , is interested in the fact that raw material is supplied on time , that it does n't lie about in warehouses or create hold - ups in production , that is , in other words , that it yields to the principle of the conveyor , in full correspondence to the rhythm of production .
In this there is no need to always imagine the conveyor in the form of an endless moving belt .
Its forms can be of limitless diversity .
A railway , if it is working according to plan , i.e. , without cross-hauling , without seasonal accumulation of loads , in short , without the elements of capitalist anarchy , – and under socialism a railway will work in precisely this way – is a powerful conveyor , guaranteeing the timely supply of factories with raw materials , fuel , materials and people .
The same thing applies to steamships , trucks , and so forth .
All forms of communication will become elements of transport for the inner system of production from the standpoint of the planned economy as a whole .
Oil pipelines are a kind of conveyor for liquid substances .
The more widespread the grid of oil pipelines , the less we need reservoirs , and the smaller is the portion of oil which turns into dead capital .
The conveyor system by no means assumes the crowding together of enterprises .
On the contrary , modern technology allows their dispersion , not , of course , in a chaotic and random manner , but taking into strict account the most appropriate place ( Standort ) for each separate factory .
The possibility of the wide distribution of industrial enterprises , without which it is impossible to dissolve the city into the village , and the village into the city , is largely guaranteed by electrical energy as a motive force .
Metal cables are the most sophisticated conveyor of energy , making it possible to divide motive force into the smallest units , putting it to work or turning it off by simply pressing a button .
It is precisely with these characteristics that the energy " conveyor " comes into the most hostile collision with the limitations of private property .
In its present development , electricity is the most " socialistic " sector of technology .
And it is no wonder , for it is its most advanced sector .
Gigantic land improvement systems – for proper irrigation or drainage – are , from this standpoint , the water conveyors of agriculture .
The more that chemistry , machine - building and electrification liberate land cultivation from the action of the elements , thereby guaranteeing the highest level of planning , the more completely will today 's " village economy " be integrated into the system of a socialist conveyor which regulates and coordinates all production , starting from the subsoil ( the extraction of coal and ore ) and the soil ( plowing and sowing of the fields ) .
On the basis of his conveyor experience , old man Ford is trying to construct something of a social philosophy .
In this attempt we see an extremely curious mixture of production and administrative experience on an exceptionally grand scale with the unbearable narrowness of a self - satisfied philistine who , while becoming a millionaire , has merely remained a petty - bourgeois with lots of money .
Ford says : " If you want riches for yourself and well - being for your fellow citizens , act like I do . "
Kant demanded that every person act so that his behavior might become a norm for others .
In the philosophical sense , Ford is a Kantian .
But the practical " norm " for Ford 's 200,000 workers is not Ford 's behavior , but the motion of his automated conveyor : it determines the rhythm of their lives , the movement of their hands , feet and thoughts .
For the " well - being of fellow citizens , " Fordism must be separated from Ford ; it must be socialized and purified .
And socialism will do this .
" But what about the monotony of labor , depersonalized and despiritualized by the conveyor ? " asks one of the notes from the audience .
This concern is not serious .
If you think it through to the end and talk it over , then it is mainly directed against the division of labor and against machinery in general .
This is a reactionary path .
Socialism and resistance to machinery have never had anything in common , nor will they ever .
The fundamental , most crucial and most important task is the elimination of want .
It is necessary that human labor gives as great a quantity of products as possible .
Bread , boots , clothing , newspapers , – all that is necessary should be produced in such quantity that no one fears that he will go without .
We must eliminate want , and along with it , greed .
We must win prosperity , leisure , and along with them , the joy of living for all .
A high productivity of labor is unattainable without mechanization and automation , the finished expression of which is the conveyor .
The monotony of labor will be compensated by its shortening duration and by its growing ease .
Society will always have branches of industry which demand individual creativity ; that is where those will go who find their calling in production .
We are talking , of course , about the most basic type of production in its most important branches , until , in any case , new chemical and energy revolutions in technology topple today 's forms of mechanization .
But we will let the future worry about that .
Travel in a rowboat demands great personal creativity .
Travel on a steamship is " more monotonous , " but more comfortable and reliable .
Besides , you really wo n't make it across the ocean in a rowboat .
And we must cross the ocean of human want .
Everyone knows that physical needs are much more limited than spiritual ones .
The excessive satisfaction of physical needs quickly leads to satiety .
Spiritual needs know no boundaries .
But for spiritual needs to flourish , the full satisfaction of physical needs is required .
Of course , we cannot , nor do we , postpone the struggle for raising the spiritual level of the masses until the time when we have no unemployment , homelessness or poverty .
Everything that can be done , must be done .
But it would be a wretched and contemptible pipe - dream to think that we can create a genuinely new culture before we secure the prosperity , abundance and leisure of the popular masses .
We can and will verify our progress as it is expressed in the everyday life of the worker and peasant .
The Cultural Revolution
I think that it is now clear to everyone that the creation of a new culture is not an independent task which is completed apart from our economic work and social or cultural construction as a whole .
Is trade part of " proletarian culture ? "
From an abstract point of view , we would have to answer this question negatively .
But an abstract point of view wo n't do here .
In the transitional epoch , moreover in the initial stage in which we are located , products assume – and will long continue to do so – the social form of the commodity .
But the commodity must be treated properly , that is , we must be able to sell and buy it .
Without this , we will never move from the initial stage into the next .
Lenin said that we must learn to trade , and he recommended that we learn from the European cultural examples .
The culture of trading , as we now know quite well , is one of the most important components of the culture of the transitional period .
Whether we will call the culture of trade associated with the workers state and cooperation " proletarian culture " – I do n't know .
But that it is a step toward socialist culture is beyond dispute .
When Lenin spoke of the cultural revolution , he saw its basic content as raising the cultural level of the masses .
The metric system is a product of bourgeois science .
But to teach one hundred million peasants this uncomplicated system of measures means to accomplish a great revolutionary and cultural task .
It is almost beyond doubt that we will not achieve this without the tractor and without electric energy .
The basis of culture is technology .
The decisive instrument of the cultural revolution must be the revolution in technology .
With regard to capitalism , we say that the development of the productive forces is being held up by the social forms of the bourgeois state and bourgeois property .
Having carried out the proletarian revolution , we say that the development of social forms is being held up by the development of productive forces , i.e. , by technology .
The great link in the chain , which , if we seize hold of can produce the cultural revolution , is the link of industrialization , – but by no means the link of literature or philosophy .
I hope that these words will not be understood as an ill - meaning or disrespectful attitude toward philosophy and poetry .
Without generalizing thought and without art , human life would be bare and poverty - stricken .
But after all , that , to a large degree , is how life is now for millions of people .
The cultural revolution must consist in opening up the possibility that they can truly gain access to culture , and not just its leftover stubs .
But this is impossible without creating the greatest material preconditions .
That is why a machine which automatically produces bottles is for us at the present moment a first - rate factor in the cultural revolution , while an heroic poem is only a tenth - rate factor .
Marx once said that philosophers had sufficiently interpreted the world , and that the task now was to turn it upside down .
In these words there was by no means a lack of respect for philosophy .
Marx was himself one of the most powerful philosophers of all time .
His words simply meant that the further development of philosophy , and of culture as a whole , both material and spiritual , demands a revolution in social relations .
And therefore Marx appealed from philosophy to the proletarian revolution , – not against philosophy , but for it .
In the same sense , we can now say : it 's fine when poets sing of the revolution and proletariat ; but it is even better when a powerful turbine does the singing .
We have many songs of mediocre value which remain the property of small circles .
We have terribly few turbines .
By this I do n't want to say that mediocre poems hinder the appearance of turbines .
No , such an assertion can not be made .
But the correct orientation of public opinion , i.e. , an understanding of the true correlation of phenomena – the whys and wherefores – is absolutely necessary .
We must understand the cultural revolution not in a superficial idealistic way nor in the spirit of small circles .
We are talking about changing the conditions of life , the methods of work and the everyday habits of a great people , of a whole family of peoples .
Only a powerful system of tractors which will for the first time in history allow the peasant to straighten his back ; only a glass - blowing machine which produces hundreds of thousands of bottles and frees the lungs of the glassblower ; only a turbine of tens and hundreds of thousands of horsepower ; only an airplane accessible to all ; – only all these things together will guarantee the cultural revolution – and not for the minority but for all .
Only this kind of cultural revolution deserves the name .
Only on its foundations will a new philosophy and a new art begin to flourish .
Marx said : " The dominant ideas of an epoch are the ideas of the ruling class of the given epoch . "
This is also true with regard to the proletariat , but in quite a different way than with other classes .
Having seized power , the bourgeoisie tried to perpetuate it .
Its entire culture was adapted to this purpose .
Having taken power , the proletariat must inevitably strive to shorten the period of its rule as much as possible , by drawing nigh the classless socialist society .
The Culture of Morals
To trade in a cultured way means , among other things , not to deceive , that is , to break with our national trading tradition : " If you do n't deceive , you wo n't make a sale . "
Lying and deceiving is not just a personal flaw , but a function ( or action ) of the social order .
Lying is a means of struggle , and consequently , it flows from contradiction of interests .
The most basic contradictions flow from class relations .
Of course , one could say that deception is older than class society .
Even animals display " cunning " and deception in the struggle for existence .
Deception – military cunning – played no small role in the life of primitive tribes .
Such deception still more or less flowed directly from the zoological struggle for existence .
But from the moment when " civilized , " i.e. class society arrived , the lie became horribly more complicated , turned into a social function , split along class lines and also became part of human " culture . "
But this is the part of culture which socialism will not accept .
Relations in either socialist or communist society , i.e. , in socialist society 's highest development , will be thoroughly transparent and will not require such auxiliary methods as deception , lies , falsification , forgery , treachery and perfidy .
However , we are still a long way from that .
In our relations and morals there are still many lies rooted both in serfdom and the bourgeois order .
The highest expression of serfdom's ideology is religion .
The relations in feudal - monarchal society were based on blind tradition and elevated to the level of religious myth .
A myth is the imaginary and false interpretation of natural phenomena and social institutions in their interconnection .
However , not only the deceived , that is , the oppressed masses , but also those in whose name the deception was carried out – the rulers , – for the most part believed in the myth and relied upon it in good conscience .
An objectively false ideology , woven out of superstitions , does not necessarily signify subjective mendacity .
Only to the extent that social relations become more complex , that is , to the extent that the bourgeois social order develops , with which religious myth comes into ever growing contradiction , religion becomes the source of ever greater cunning and more refined deception .
Developed bourgeois ideology is rationalistic and directed against mythology .
The radical bourgeoisie tried to make do without religion and build a state based on reason rather than tradition .
An expression of this was democracy with its principles of liberty , equality and fraternity .
The capitalist economy , however , created a monstrous contradiction between everyday reality and democratic principles .
A higher grade form of lying is required to fill up this contradiction .
Nowhere do people lie more politically than in bourgeois democracies .
And this is no longer the objective " lying " of mythology , but the consciously organized deception of the people , using combined methods of extraordinary complexity .
The technology of the lie is cultivated no less than the technology of electricity .
The most " developed " democracies , France and the United States , possess the most deceitful press .
But at the same time – and this we must openly acknowledge – in France they trade more honestly than we do , and , in any case , with incomparably more attention paid to the buyer .
Having achieved a certain level of well - being , the bourgeoisie renounces the swindling methods of primary accumulation , not from any abstract moral considerations , but for material reasons : petty deception , forgery and avariciousness spoil the reputation of an enterprise and undermine its future .
The principles of " honest " trade , flowing from the interests of trade itself at a certain level of its development , enter into morals , become " moral " rules and are controlled by public opinion .
True , in this area , too , the imperialist war introduced colossal changes , throwing Europe way back .
But the post - war " stabilization " efforts of capitalism overcame the most malignant forms of savagery in trading .
In any case , if we take our Soviet trading as a whole , that is , from the factory to the consumer in the distant village , then we must say that we trade in an immeasurably less cultured way than the advanced capitalist countries .
This flows from our poverty , from the shortage of commodities , and from our economic and cultural backwardness .
The regime of proletarian dictatorship is irreconcilably hostile both to the objectively false mythology of the Middle Ages and to the conscious deceitfulness of capitalist democracy .
The revolutionary regime is vitally interested in laying bare social relations rather than masking them over .
This means that it is interested in political honesty , in saying what is .
But we must not forget that the regime of revolutionary dictatorship is a transitional regime , and consequently , a contradictory one .
The presence of powerful enemies forces us to use military cunning , and cunning is inseparable from lying .
Our only need is that the cunning employed in the struggle against our enemies does not mislead our own people , that is , the laboring masses and their party .
This is a basic demand of revolutionary politics which can be seen throughout all of Lenin 's work .
But while our new state and social forms are creating the possibility and necessity of a greater degree of honesty than has ever been achieved between rulers and ruled , the same cannot be said about our relations of common , everyday life ; here our economic and cultural backwardness – and in general our entire heritage from the past – continues to exert enormous pressure .
We live much better than in 1920 .
But the shortage of the most necessary among life 's blessings still leaves its mark on our life and on our morals , and will continue to do so for many years to come .
From here flow the large and small contradictions , the large and small disproportions , the struggle tied to the contradictions , and the cunning , lies and deception all tied to the struggle .
Here , too , there is only one escape : raising the level of our technology , both in production and in trade .
A correct orientation along these lines should by itself contribute to the betterment of our " morals . "
The interaction between rising technology and morals will advance us along the way to a social structure of civilized cooperators , that is , to a socialist culture .
Notes
By George Will - October 9 , 2008
WASHINGTON -- Time was , the Baltimore Orioles manager was Earl Weaver , a short , irascible , Napoleonic figure who , when cranky , as he frequently was , would shout at an umpire , " Are you going to get any better or is this it ? "
With , mercifully , only one debate to go , that is the question about John McCain 's campaign .
In the closing days of his 10 - year quest for the presidency , McCain finds it galling that Barack Obama is winning the first serious campaign he has ever run against a Republican .
Before Tuesday night 's uneventful event , gall was fueling what might be the McCain - Palin campaign 's closing argument .
It is less that Obama has bad ideas than that Obama is a bad person .
This , McCain and his female Sancho Panza say , is demonstrated by bad associations Obama had in Chicago , such as with William Ayers , the unrepentant terrorist .
But the McCain - Palin charges have come just as the Obama campaign is benefiting from a mass mailing it is not paying for .
Many millions of American households are gingerly opening envelopes containing reports of the third - quarter losses in their 401 ( k ) and other retirement accounts -- telling each household its portion of the nearly $ 2 trillion that Americans ' accounts have recently shed .
In this context , the McCain - Palin campaign 's attempt to get Americans to focus on Obama 's Chicago associations seem surreal -- or , as a British politician once said about criticism he was receiving , " like being savaged by a dead sheep . "
Recently Obama noted -- perhaps to torment and provoke conservatives -- that McCain 's rhetoric about Wall Street 's " greed " and " casino culture " amounted to " talking like Jesse Jackson . "
What fun : one African - American Chicago politician distancing himself from another African - American Chicago politician by associating McCain with him .
After their enjoyable 2006 congressional elections , Democrats eagerly anticipated that 2008 would provide a second election in which a chaotic Iraq would be at the center of voters ' minds .
Today they are glad that has not happened .
The success of the surge in Iraq , for which McCain justly claims much credit , is one reason why foreign policy has receded to the margins of the electorate 's mind , thereby diminishing the subject with which McCain is most comfortable and which is Obama 's largest vulnerability .
Tuesday night , McCain , seeking traction in inhospitable economic terrain , said that the $ 700 billion -- perhaps it is $ 800 billion , or more ; one loses track of this fast - moving target -- bailout plan is too small .
He proposes several hundred billions more for his American Homeownership Resurgence -- you cannot have too many surges -- Plan .
Under it , the government would buy mortgages that homeowners cannot -- or perhaps would just rather not -- pay , and replace them with cheaper ones .
When he proposed this , conservatives participating in MSNBC's " dial group " wrenched their dials in a wrist - spraining spasm of disapproval .
Still , it may be politically prudent for McCain to throw caution , and billions , to the wind .
Obama is competitive in so many states that President Bush carried in 2004 -- including Florida , North Carolina , Virginia , Ohio , Indiana , Iowa , Colorado and New Mexico -- it is not eccentric to think he could win at least 350 of the 538 electoral votes .
If that seems startling , that is only because the 2000 and 2004 elections were won with 271 and 286 , respectively .
In the 25 elections 1900 - 1996 , the winners averaged 402.6 .
This , even though the 1900 and 1904 elections -- before Arizona , New Mexico and Oklahoma attained statehood , and before the size of the House was fixed at 435 members in 1911 -- allocated only 447 and 476 electoral votes , respectively .
The 12 elections from 1912 through 1956 , before Hawaiian and Alaskan statehood , allocated only 531 .
In the 25 twentieth - century elections , only three candidates won with fewer than 300 -- McKinley with 292 in 1900 , Wilson with 277 in 1916 and Carter with 297 in 1976 .
President Harry Truman won 303 in 1948 even though Strom Thurmond 's Dixiecrat candidacy won 39 that otherwise would have gone to Truman .
After John Kennedy won in 1960 with just 303 , the average winning total in the next nine elections , up to the 2000 cliffhanger , was 421.4 .
In 1987 , on the eve of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's third victory , the head of her Conservative Party told a visiting columnist : " Someday , Labour will win an election .
Our job is to hold on until they are sane . "
Republicans , winners of seven of the last 10 presidential elections , had better hope they have held on long enough .

I .
If men were like ants , there would be no interest in human freedom .
If individual men , like ants , were uniform , interchangeable , devoid of specific personality traits of their own , then who would care whether they were free or not ?
Who , indeed , would care if they lived or died ?
The glory of the human race is the uniqueness of each individual , the fact that every person , though similar in many ways to others , possesses a completely individuated personality of his own .
It is the fact of each person 's uniqueness — the fact that no two people can be wholly interchangeable — that makes each and every man irreplaceable and that makes us care whether he lives or dies , whether he is happy or oppressed .
And , finally , it is the fact that these unique personalities need freedom for their full development that constitutes one of the major arguments for a free society .
Perhaps a world exists somewhere where intelligent beings are fully formed in some sort of externally determined cages , with no need for internal learning or choices by the individual beings themselves .
But man is necessarily in a different situation .
Individual human beings are not born or fashioned with fully formed knowledge , values , goals , or personalities ; they must each form their own values and goals , develop their personalities , and learn about themselves and the world around them .
Every man must have freedom , must have the scope to form , test , and act upon his own choices , for any sort of development of his own personality to take place .
He must , in short , be free in order that he may be fully human .
In a sense , even the most frozen and totalitarian civilizations and societies have allowed at least a modicum of scope for individual choice and development .
Even the most monolithic of despotisms have had to allow at least a bit of " space " for freedom of choice , if only within the interstices of societal rules .
The freer the society , of course , the less has been the interference with individual actions , and the greater the scope for the development of each individual .
The freer the society , then , the greater will be the variety and the diversity among men , for the more fully developed will be every man 's uniquely individual personality .
On the other hand , the more despotic the society , the more restrictions on the freedom of the individual , the more uniformity there will be among men and the less the diversity , and the less developed will be the unique personality of each and every man .
In a profound sense , then , a despotic society prevents its members from being fully human .
If freedom is a necessary condition for the full development of the individual , it is by no means the only requirement .
Society itself must be sufficiently developed .
No one , for example , can become a creative physicist on a desert island or in a primitive society .
For , as an economy grows , the range of choice open to the producer and to the consumer proceeds to multiply greatly .
Furthermore , only a society with a standard of living considerably higher than subsistence can afford to devote much of its resources to improving knowledge and to developing a myriad of goods and services above the level of brute subsistence .
But there is another reason that full development of the creative powers of each individual cannot occur in a primitive or undeveloped society , and that is the necessity for a wide - ranging division of labor .
No one can fully develop his powers in any direction without engaging in specialization .
The primitive tribesman or peasant , bound to an endless round of different tasks in order to maintain himself , could have no time or resources available to pursue any particular interest to the full .
He had no room to specialize , to develop whatever field he was best at or in which he was most interested .
Two hundred years ago , Adam Smith pointed out that the developing division of labor is a key to the advance of any economy above the most primitive level .
A necessary condition for any sort of developed economy , the division of labor is also requisite to the development of any sort of civilized society .
The philosopher , the scientist , the builder , the merchant — none could develop these skills or functions if he had had no scope for specialization .
Furthermore , no individual who does not live in a society enjoying a wide range of division of labor can possibly employ his powers to the fullest .
He cannot concentrate his powers in a field or discipline and advance that discipline and his own mental faculties .
Without the opportunity to specialize in whatever he can do best , no person can develop his powers to the full ; no man , then , could be fully human .
While a continuing and advancing division of labor is needed for a developed economy and society , the extent of such development at any given time limits the degree of specialization that any given economy can have .
There is , therefore , no room for a physicist or a computer engineer on a primitive island ; these skills would be premature within the context of that existing economy .
As Adam Smith put it , " the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market . "
Economic and social development is therefore a mutually reinforcing process : the development of the market permits a wider division of labor , which in turn enables of further extension of the market .
If the scope of the market and the extent of the division of labor are mutually reinforcing , so too are the division of labor and the diversity of individual interests and abilities among men .
For just as an ever - greater division of labor is needed to give full scope to the abilities and powers of each individual , so does the existence of that very division depend upon the innate diversity of men .
For there would be no scope at all for a division of labor if every person were uniform and interchangeable .
( A further condition of the emergence of a division of labor is the variety of natural resources ; specific land areas on the earth are also not interchangeable . )
Furthermore , it soon became evident in the history of man that the market economy based on a division of labor was profoundly cooperative , and that such division enormously multiplied the productivity and hence the wealth of every person participating in the society .
The economist Ludwig von Mises put the matter very clearly :
Historically division of labor originates in two facts of nature : the inequality of human abilities and the variety of the external conditions of human life on the earth .
These two facts are really one : the diversity of Nature , which does not repeat itself but creates the universe in infinite , inexhaustible variety .
...
These two conditions … are indeed such as almost to force the division of labor on mankind .
Old and young , men and women cooperate by making appropriate use of their various abilities .
Here also is the germ of the geographical division of labor ; man goes to the hunt and woman to the spring to fetch water .
Had the strength and abilities of all individuals and the external conditions of production been everywhere equal the idea of division of labor could never have arisen . …
No social life could have arisen among men of equal natural capacity in a world which was geographically uniform .
...
Once labor has been divided , the division itself exercises a differentiating influence .
The fact that labor is divided makes possible further cultivation of individual talent and thus cooperation becomes more and more productive .
Through cooperation men are able to achieve what would have been beyond them as individuals .
...
The greater productivity of work under the division of labor is a unifying influence .
It leads men to regard each other as comrades in a joint struggle for welfare , rather than as competitors in a struggle for existence .
Freedom , then , is needed for the development of the individual , and such development also depends upon the extent of the division of labor and the height of the standard of living .
The developed economy makes room for , and encourages , an enormously greater specialization and flowering of the powers of the individual than can a primitive economy , and the greater the degree of such development , the greater the scope for each individual .
If freedom and the growth of the market are each important for the development of each individual and , therefore , to the flowering of diversity and individual differences , then so is there a casual connection between freedom and economic growth .
For it is precisely freedom , the absence or limitation of interpersonal restrictions or interference , that sets the stage for economic growth and hence of the market economy and the developed division of labor .
The Industrial Revolution and the corollary and consequent economic growth of the West were a product of its relative freedom for enterprise , for invention and innovation , for mobility and the advancement of labor .
Compared to societies in other times and places , 18th - and 19th - century Western Europe and the United States were marked by a far greater social and economic freedom — a freedom to move , invest , work , and produce — secure from much harassment and interference by government .
Compared to the role of government elsewhere , its role in these centuries in the West was remarkably minimal .
By allowing full scope for investment , mobility , the division of labor , creativity , and entrepreneurship , the free economy thereby creates the conditions for rapid economic development .
It is freedom and the free market , as Adam Smith well pointed out , that develop the " wealth of nations . "
Thus , freedom leads to economic development , and both of these conditions in turn multiply individual development and the unfolding of the powers of the individual man .
In two crucial ways , then , freedom is the root ; only the free man can be fully individuated and , therefore , can be fully human .
If freedom leads to a widening division of labor , and the full scope of individual development , it leads also to a growing population .
For just as the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market , so is total population limited by total production .
One of the striking facts about the Industrial Revolution has been not only a great rise in the standard of living for everyone , but also the viability of such ample living standards for an enormously larger population .
The land area of North America was able to support only a million or so Indians 500 years ago , and that at a barely subsistence level .
Even if we wished to eliminate the division of labor , we could not do so without literally wiping out the vast majority of the current world population .
II .
We conclude that freedom and its concomitant , the widening division of labor , are vital for the flowering of each individual , as well as the literal survival of the vast bulk of the world 's population .
It must give us great concern , then , that over the past two centuries mighty social movements have sprung up which have been dedicated , at their heart , to the stamping out of all human differences , of all individuality .
It has become apparent in recent years , for example , that the heart of the complex social philosophy of Marxism does not lie , as it seemed to in the 1930s and ' 40s , in Marxian economic doctrines : in the labor theory of value , in the familiar proposal for socialist state ownership of the means of production , and in the central planning of the economy and society .
The economic theories and programs of Marxism are , to use a Marxian term , merely the elaborate " superstructure " erected on the inner core of Marxian aspiration .
Consequently , many Marxists have , in recent decades , been willing to abandon the labor theory of value and even centralized socialist planning , as the Marxian economic theory has been increasingly abandoned and the practice of socialist planning shown to be unworkable .
Similarly , the Marxists of the " New Left " in the United States and abroad have been willing to jettison socialist economic theory and practice .
What they have not been willing to abandon is the philosophic heart of the Marxian ideal — not socialism or socialist planning , concerned anyway with what is supposed to be a temporary " stage " of development , but communism itself .
It is the communist ideal , the ultimate goal of Marxism , that excites the contemporary Marxist , that engages his most fervent passions .
The New Left Marxist has no use for Soviet Russia because the Soviets have clearly relegated the communist ideal to the remotest possible future .
The New Leftist admires Che Guevara , Fidel Castro , Mao Tse - Tung not simply because of their role as revolutionaries and guerrilla leaders , but more because of their repeated attempts to leap into communism as rapidly as possible .
Karl Marx was vague and cloudy in describing the communist ideal , let alone the specific path for attaining it .
But one essential feature is the eradication of the division of labor .
Contrary to current belief , Marx 's now popular concept of " alienation " had little to do with a psychological sense of apartness or discontent .
The heart of the concept was the individual 's " alienation " from the product of labor .
A worker , for example , works in a steel mill .
Obviously , he himself will consume little or none of the steel he produces ; he earns the value of his product in the shape of a money - commodity , and then he happily uses that money to buy whatever he chooses from the products of other people .
Thus , A produces steel , B eggs , C shoes , etc. , and then each exchanges them for products of the others through the use of money .
To Marx , this phenomenon of the market and the division of labor was a radical evil , for it meant that no one consumed any of his own product .
The steelworker thus became " alienated " from his steel , the shoemaker from his shoes , etc .
The proper response to this " problem , " it seems to me , is , " So what ? "
Why should anyone care about this sort of " alienation " ?
Surely the farmer , shoemaker , and steelworker are very happy to sell their product and exchange it for whatever products they desire ; deprive them of this " alienation " and they would be most unhappy , as well as dying from starvation .
For if the farmer were not allowed to produce more wheat or eggs than he himself consumes , or the shoemaker more shoes than he can wear , or the steelworker more steel than he can use , it is clear that the great bulk of the population would rapidly starve and the rest be reduced to a primitive subsistence , with life " nasty , brutish , and short . "
But to Marx this condition was the evil result of individualism and capitalism and had to be eradicated .
Furthermore , Marx was completely ignorant of the fact that each participant in the division of labor cooperates through the market economy , exchanging for each other 's products and increasing the productivity and living standards of everyone .
To Marx , any differences between men and , therefore , any specialization in the division of labor , is a " contradiction , " and the communist goal is to replace that " contradiction " with harmony among all .
This means that to the Marxist any individual differences , any diversity among men , are " contradictions " to be stamped out and replaced by the uniformity of the antheap .
Friedrich Engels maintained that the emergence of the division of labor shattered the alleged classless harmony and uniformity of primitive society , and was responsible for the cleavage of society into separate and conflicting classes .
Hence , for Marx and Engels , the division of labor must be eradicated in order to abolish class conflict and to usher in the ideal harmony of the " classless society , " the society of total uniformity .
Thus , Marx foresees his communist ideal only " after the enslaving subordination of individuals under division of labor , and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor , has vanished . "
To Marx , the ideal communist society is one where , as Professor Gray puts it , " everyone must do everything . "
According to Marx in The German Ideology ,
In communist society , where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes , society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow , to hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticize after dinner , just as I have a mind , without ever becoming hunter , fisherman , shepherd or critic .
And the Marxist , August Bebel , consistently applied this dilettantish notion to the role of women :
At one moment a practical worker in some industry she is in the next hour educator , teacher , nurse ; in the third part of the day she exercises some art or cultivates a science ; and in the fourth part she fulfills some administrative function .
The concept of the commune in socialist thought takes on its central importance precisely as a means of eradicating individual differences .
It is not just that the commune owns all the means of production among its members .
Crucial to the communal ideal is that every man takes on every function , either all at once or in rapid rotation .
Obviously , the commune has to subsist on no more than a primitive level , with only a few common tasks , for this ideal to be achieved .
Hence the New Left commune , where every person is supposed to take turns equally at every task ; again , specialization is eradicated , and no one can develop his powers to the full .
Hence the current admiration for Cuba , which has attempted to stress " moral " rather than economic incentives in production , and which has established communes on the Isle of Pines .
Hence the admiration of Mao , who has attempted to establish uniform urban and rural communes , and who recently sent several million students into permanent exile into the frontier agricultural areas , in order to eliminate the " contradiction between intellectual and physical labor . "
Indeed , at the heart of the split between Russia and China is Russia 's virtual abandonment of the communist ideal in the face of China 's " fundamentalist " devotion to the original creed .
The shared devotion to the commune also accounts for the similarities between the New Left , the utopian socialists of the 19th century , and the communist anarchists , a wing of anarchism that has always shared the communal ideal with the Marxists .
The communist would deny that his ideal society would suppress the personality of every man .
On the contrary , freed from the confines of the division of labor , each person would fully develop all of his powers in every direction .
Every man would be fully rounded in all spheres of life and work .
As Engels put it in his Anti-Dühring , communism would give " each individual the opportunity to develop and exercise all his faculties , physical and mental , in all directions . … "
And Lenin wrote in 1920 of the abolition of " the division of labour among people , to educate and school people , give them all - round development and an all - round training , so that they are able to do everything .
Communism is advancing and must advance towards that goal , and will reach it … "
This absurd ideal — of the man " able to do everything " — is only viable if ( a ) everyone does everything very badly , or ( b ) there are only a very few things to do , or ( c ) everyone is miraculously transformed into a superman .
Professor Mises aptly notes that the ideal communist man is the dilettante , the man who knows a little of everything and does nothing well .
For how can he develop any of his powers and faculties if he is prevented from developing any one of them to any sustained extent ?
As Mises says of Bebel 's Utopia ,
Art and science are relegated to leisure hours .
In this way , thinks Bebel , the society of the future " will possess scientists and artists of all kinds in countless numbers . "
These , according to their several inclinations , will pursue their studies and their arts in their spare time .
...
All mental work he regards as mere dilettantism .
...
But nevertheless we must inquire whether under these conditions the mind would be able to create that freedom without which it cannot exist .
Obviously all artistic and scientific work which demands time , travel , technical education and great material expenditure , would be quite out of the question .
Every person 's time and energy on the earth are necessarily limited ; hence , in order to develop any of his faculties to the full , he must specialize and concentrate on some rather than others .
As Gray writes ,
That each individual should have the opportunity of developing all his faculties , physical and mental , in all directions , is a dream which will cheer the vision only of the simple - minded , oblivious of the restrictions imposed by the narrow limits of human life .
For life is a series of acts of choice , and each choice is at the same time a renunciation .
...
Even the inhabitant of Engels ' future fairyland will have to decide sooner or later whether he wishes to be Archbishop of Canterbury or First Sea Lord , whether he should seek to excel as a violinist or as a pugilist , whether he should elect to know all about Chinese literature or about the hidden pages in the life of the mackerel .
Of course , the only way to resolve this dilemma is to fantasize that the New Communist Man will be a superman .
The Marxist , Karl Kautsky , asserted that in the future society " a new type of man will arise … a superman … an exalted man . "
Leon Trotsky prophesied that under communism :
man will become incomparably stronger , wiser , finer .
His body more harmonious , his movements more rhythmical , his voice more musical . …
The human average will rise to the level of an Aristotle , a Goethe , a Marx .
Above these other heights new peaks will arise .
In recent years , communists have intensified their efforts to end the division of labor and reduce all individuals to uniformity .
Fidel Castro's attempts to " build Communism " in the Isle of Pines , and Mao Tse - Tung 's Cultural Revolution , have been echoed in miniature by the American New Left in numerous attempts to form hippies communes and to create organizational " collectives " in which everyone does everything without benefit of specialization .
In contrast , Yugoslavia has been the quiet despair of the communist movement by moving rapidly in the opposite direction — toward every - increasing freedom , individuality , and free - market operations — and has proved influential in leading the other " communist " countries of Eastern Europe ( notably , Hungary and Czechoslovakia ) in the same direction .
III .
One way of gauging the extent of " harmonious " development of all of the individual 's powers in the absence of specialization is to consider what actually happened during primitive or preindustrial eras .
And , indeed , many socialists and other opponents of the Industrial Revolution exalt the primitive and preindustrial periods as a golden age of harmony , community , and social belonging — a peaceful and happy society destroyed by the development of individualism , the Industrial Revolution , and the market economy .
In their exaltation of the primitive and the preindustrial , the socialists were perfectly anticipated by the reactionaries of the Romantic movement , those men who longed to roll back the tide of progress , individualism , and industry , and return to the supposed golden age of the preindustrial era .
The New Left , in particular , also emphasizes a condemnation of technology and the division of labor , as well as a desire to " return to the earth " and an exaltation of the commune and the " tribe . "
As John W. Aldridge perceptively points out , the current New Left virtually constitutes a generational tribe that exhibits all the characteristics of a uniform and interchangeable herd , with little or no individuality among its members .
Similarly , the early 19th - century German reactionary , Adam Müller , denounced the :
vicious tendency to divide labor in all branches of private industry . …
[ The ] division of labor in large cities or industrial or mining provinces cuts up man , the completely free man , into wheels , rollers , spokes , shafts , etc. , forces on him an utterly one - sided scope in the already one - sided field of the provisioning of one single want …
The leading French conservatives of the early 19th century , Bonald and de Maistre , who idealized the feudal order , denounced the disruption by individualism of the preexisting social order and social cohesion .
The contemporary French reactionary , Jacques Ellul , in The Technological Society , a book much in favor on the New Left , condemns " our dehumanized factories , our unsatisfied senses … our estrangement from nature . "
In the Middle Ages , in contrast , claims Ellul , " Man sought open spaces … the possibility of moving about … of not constantly colliding with other people . "
In the meanwhile , on the socialist side , the economic historian Karl Polanyi 's influential The Great Transformation makes this thesis of the disruption of a previous social harmony by individualism , the market economy , and the division of labor the central theme of the book .
For its part , the worship of the primitive is a logical extension of the worship of the preindustrial .
This worship by modern sophisticated intellectuals ranges from Rousseau 's " noble savage " and the lionizing of that creature by the Romantic movement , all the way to the adoration of the Black Panthers by white intellectuals .
Whatever other pathology the worship of the primitive reflects , a basic part of it is a deep - seated hatred of individual diversity .
Obviously , the more primitive and the less civilized a society , the less diverse and individuated it can be .
Also part of this primitivism reflects a hatred for the intellect and its works , since the flowering of reason and intellection leads to diversity and inequality of individual achievement .
For the individual to advance and develop , reason and the intellect must be active , it must embody the individual 's mind working upon and transforming the materials of reality .
From the time of Aristotle , the classical philosophy presented man as only fulfilling himself , his nature , and his personality through purposive action upon the world .
It is from such rational and purposive action that the works of civilization have developed .
In contrast , the Romantic movement has always exalted the passivity of the child who , necessarily ignorant and immature , only reacts passively to his environment rather than acts to change it .
This tendency to exalt passivity and the young , and to denigrate intellect , has reached its present embodiment in the New Left , which worships both youth per se and a passive attitude of ignorant and purposeless spontaneity .
The passivity of the New Left , its wish to live simply and in " harmony " with " the earth " and the alleged rhythms of nature , harks back completely to the Rousseauist Romantic movement .
Like the Romantic movement , it is a conscious rejection of civilization and differentiated men on behalf of the primitive , the ignorant , the herd - like " tribe . "
If reason , purpose , and action are to be spurned , then what replaces them in the Romantic pantheon are unanalyzed , spontaneous " feelings . "
And since the range of feelings is relatively small compared to intellectual achievements , and in any case is not objectively known to another person , the emphasis on feelings is another way to iron out diversity and inequality among individuals .
Irving Babbitt , a keen critic of Romanticism , wrote about the Romantic movement :
The whole movement is filled with the praise of ignorance and of those who still enjoy its inappreciable advantages — the savage , the peasant and above all the child .
The Rousseauist may indeed be said to have discovered the poetry of childhood … but at what would seem at times a rather heavy sacrifice of rationality .
Rather than consent to have the bloom taken off things by analysis one should , as Coleridge tells us , sink back to the devout state of childlike wonder .
However , to grow ethically is not to sink back but to struggle painfully forward .
To affirm the contrary is to proclaim one 's inability to mature .
… [ The Romantic ] is ready to assert that what comes to the child spontaneously is superior to the deliberate moral effort of the mature man .
The speeches of all the sages are , according to Maeterlinck , outweighed by the unconscious wisdom of the passing child .
Another perceptive critique of Romanticism and primitivism was written by Ludwig von Mises .
He notes that " the whole tribe of romantics " have denounced specialization and the division of labor .
" For them the man of the past who developed his powers ' harmoniously ' is the ideal : an ideal which alas no longer inspires our degenerate age .
They recommend retrogression in the division of labor … " with the socialists surpassing their fellow Romantics in this regard .
But are primitives or preindustrial men privileged to develop themselves freely and harmoniously ?
Mises answers :
It is futile to look for the harmoniously developed man at the outset of economic evolution .
The almost self - sufficient economic subject as we know him in the solitary peasant of remote valleys shows none of that noble , harmonious development of body , mind , and feeling which the romantics ascribe to him .
Civilization is a product of leisure and the peace of mind that only the division of labor can make possible .
Nothing is more false than to assume that man first appeared in history with an independent individuality and that only during the evolution [ of society ] … did he lose … his spiritual independence .
All history , evidence and observation of the lives of primitive peoples is directly contrary to this view .
Primitive man lacks all individuality in our sense .
Two South Sea Islanders resemble each other far more closely than two twentieth - century Londoners .
Personality was not bestowed upon man at the outset .
It has been acquired in the course of evolution of society .
Or we may note Charles Silberman 's critique of Jacques Ellul 's rhapsodies on the " traditional rhythms of life and nature " lived by preindustrial man , as compared to " dehumanized factories … our estrangement from nature . "
Silberman asks :
But with what shall we contrast this dehumanized world ?
The beautiful , harmonious life being lived by , say , the Chinese or Vietnamese peasant woman , who works in the fields close to nature , for twelve hours a day — roughly the conditions under which the great bulk of women ( and men ) have worked … through all of human history ?
For this is the condition that Ellul idealizes .
And , as for Ellul 's paean to the Middle Ages as being mobile , spacious , and uncrowded :
This would have been startling news to the medieval peasant , who lived with his wife and children , other relatives , and probably animals as well in a one - room thatched cottage .
And even for the nobility , was there really more possibility of " moving about " in the Middle Ages , when travel was by foot or hoof , than today , when steelworkers spend sabbaticals in Europe ?
The savage is supposed not only to be " noble " but also supremely happy .
From the Rousseauans to what Erich Fromm has called " the infantile Paradise " of Norman O. Brown and Herbert Marcuse , the Romantics have extolled the happiness yielded by the spontaneous and the childlike .
To Aristotle and the classic philosophers , happiness was acting in accordance with man 's unique and rational nature .
To Marcuse , any purposive , rational action is by definition " repressive , " to which he contrasts the " liberated " state of spontaneous play .
Aside from the universal destitution that the proposed abolition of work would bring , the result would be a profound unhappiness , for no individual would be able to fulfill himself , his individuality would largely disappear , for in a world of " polymorphous " play everyone would be virtually alike .
If we consider the supposed happiness of primitive man , we must also consider that his life was , in the famous phrase of Hobbes , " nasty , brutish , and short . "
There were few medical aids against disease ; there were none against famine , for in a world cut off from interregional markets and barely above subsistence any check to the local food supply will decimate the population .
Fulfilling the dreams of Romantics , the primitive tribe is a passive creature of its given environment and has no means for acting to overcome and transform it .
Hence , when the local food supply within an area is depleted , the " happy - go - lucky " tribe dies en masse .
Furthermore , we must realize that the primitive faces a world which he cannot understand , since he has not engaged in much of a rational , scientific inquiry into its workings .
We know what a thunderstorm is , and therefore take rational measures against it ; but the savage does not know , and therefore surmises that the God of Thunder is displeased with him and must be propitiated with sacrifices and votive offerings .
Since the savage has only a limited concept of a world knit together by natural law ( a concept which employs reason and science ) , he believes that the world is governed by a host of capricious spirits and demons , each of which can only be propitiated by ritual or magic , and by a priest - craft of witch doctors who specialize in their propitiation .
The renaissance of astrology and similar mystic creeds on the New Left marks a reversion to such primitive forms of magic .
So fearful is the savage , so bound is he by irrational taboo and by the custom of his tribe , that he cannot develop his individuality .
If tribal custom crippled and repressed the development of each individual , then so too did the various caste systems and networks of restriction and coercion in preindustrial societies that forced everyone to follow the hereditary footsteps of his father 's occupation .
Each child knew from birth that he was doomed to tread where his ancestors had gone before him , regardless of ability or inclination to the contrary .
The " social harmony , " the " sense of belonging , " supplied by mercantilism , by the guilds , or by the caste system , provided such contentment that its members left the throes of the system when given an opportunity .
Given the freedom to choose , the tribesmen abandon the bosom of their tribe to come to the freer , " atomistic " cities looking for jobs and opportunity .
It is curious , in fact , that those Romantics who yearn to restore the mythical golden age of caste and status refuse to allow each individual the freedom to choose between market on the one hand , or caste and tribal commune on the other .
Invariably , the new golden age has to be imposed by coercion .
Is it , indeed , a coincidence that the natives of undeveloped countries , when given a chance , invariably abandon their " folk culture " on behalf of Western ways , living standards , and " Coca - Colaization " ?
Within a few years , for example , the people of Japan were delighted to abandon their centuries - old traditional culture and folkways , and turn to the material achievements and market economy of the West .
Primitive tribes , too , given a chance , are eager to differentiate and develop a market economy , to shed their stagnant " harmony " and replace their magic by knowledge of discovered law .
The eminent anthropologist , Branislaw Malinowski , pointed out that primitives use magic only to cover those areas of nature of which they are ignorant ; in those areas where they have come to understand the natural processes at work , magic is , quite sensibly , not employed .
A particularly striking example of the eager development of a pervasive market economy among primitive tribesmen is the largely unheralded case of West Africa .
And Bernard Siegel has pointed out that when , as among the Penajachel of Guatemala , a primitive society becomes large and technologically and societally complex , a market economy inevitably accompanies this growth , replete with specialization , competition , cash purchases , demand and supply , prices and costs , etc .
There is thus ample evidence that even primitive tribesmen themselves are not fond of their primitivism and take the earliest opportunity to escape from it ; the main stronghold of love for primitivism seems to rest among the decidedly nonprimitive Romantic intellectuals .
Another primitivistic institution that has been hailed by many social scientists is the system of the " extended family , " a harmony and status supposedly ruptured by the individualistic " nuclear family " of the modern West .
Yet the extended family system has been responsible for crippling the creative and productive individual as well as repressing economic development .
Thus , West African development has been impeded by the extended family concept that , if one man prospers , he is duty bound to share this bounty with a host of relatives , thus draining off the reward for his productivity and crippling his incentive to succeed , while encouraging the relatives to live idly on the family dole .
And neither do the productive members of the tribe seem very happy about this supposedly harmonious societal bond .
Professor Bauer points out that :
many admit in private discussion that they dread these extensive obligations . …
The fear of the obligations of the family system is partly responsible for the widespread use of textiles and trinkets as outlets for savings , in preference to more productive forms of investment which are more likely to attract the attention of relatives .
And many Africans distrust banks , " fearing that they may disclose the size of their accounts to members of their families .
They , therefore , prefer to keep their savings under the fireplace or buried in the ground . "
In fact , the primitive community , far from being happy , harmonious , and idyllic , is much more likely to be ridden by mutual suspicion and envy of the more successful or better favored , an envy so pervasive as to cripple , by the fear of its presence , all personal or general economic development .
The German sociologist Helmut Schoeck , in his important recent work on Envy , cites numerous studies of this pervasive crippling effect .
Thus the anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn found among the Navaho the absence of any concept of " personal success " or " personal achievement " ; and such success was automatically attributed to exploitation of others , and , therefore , the more prosperous Navaho Indian feels himself under constant social pressure to give his money away .
Allan Holmberg found that the Siriono Indian of Bolivia eats alone at night because , if he eats by day , a crowd gathers around him to stare in envious hatred .
The result among the Siriono is that , in reaction to this pervasive pressure , no one will voluntarily share food with anybody .
Sol
Tax found that envy and fear of envy in " a small community where all neighbors watch and where all are neighbors " accounted for the unprogressiveness , the slowness of change toward a productive economy among the Indians of Guatemala .
And when a tribe of Pueblo Indians showed the beginnings of specialization and the division of labor , the envy of their fellow tribesmen impelled them to take measures to end this process , including physical destruction of the property of those who seemed in any way better off than their fellows .
Oscar Lewis discovered an extremely pervasive fear of the envy of others in a Mexican Indian village , a fear producing intense secretiveness .
Wrote Lewis :
The man who speaks little , keeps his affairs to himself , and maintains some distance between himself and others has less chance of creating enemies or of being criticized or envied .
A man does not generally discuss his plans to buy or sell or take a trip .
Professor Schoeck comments :
it is difficult to envisage what it means for the economic and technical development of a community when , almost automatically and as a matter of principle , the future dimension is banned from human intercourse and conversation , when it cannot even be discussed .
Ubiquitous envy , fear of it and those who harbor it , cuts off such people from any kind of communal action directed towards the future . …
All striving , all preparation and planning for the future can be undertaken only by socially fragmented , secretive beings .
Furthermore , in this Mexican village no one will warn or tell anyone else of imminent danger to the other 's property ; there is no sense of human social solidarity whatsoever .
Among the Indians of Aritama in Colombia , the Reichel - Dolmatoffs reported :
Every individual lives in constant fear of the magical aggression of others , and the general social atmosphere in the village is one of mutual suspicion , of latent danger , and hidden hostility , which pervade every aspect of life .
The most immediate reason for magical aggression is envy .
Anything that might be interpreted as a personal advantage over others is envied : good health , economic assets , good physical appearance , popularity , a harmonious family life , a new dress .
All these and other aspects imply prestige , and with it power and authority over others .
Aggressive magic is , therefore , intended to prevent or to destroy this power and to act as a leveling force .
The Reichel - Dolmatoffs also noted that if one member of a group in Aritama should work faster or better than his fellows , his place of work is marked with a cross before he arrives the next morning , and his envious colleagues pray to God to make this more able worker slow and tired .
Finally , Watson and Samora found that the major reason for the failure of a group of lower - class Spanish - speaking citizens of a mountain township in southern Colorado to rise into parity with the upper- class Anglo community , was the bitter envy of the Spanish group toward any of their number who managed to rise upward .
Anyone who works his way upward is regarded as a man " who has sold himself to the Anglos , " " who has climbed on the backs of his people . "
The anthropologist Eric Wolf has even coined the term " institutionalized envy " to describe such pervasive institutions , including the practice and fear of black magic in these primitive societies .
Schoeck notes :
Institutionalized envy … or the ubiquitous fear of it , means that there is little possibility of individual economic advancement and no contact with the outside world through which the community might hope to progress .
No one dares to show anything that might lead people to think he was better off .
Innovations are unlikely .
Agricultural methods remain traditional and primitive , to the detriment of the whole village , because every deviation from previous practice comes up against the limitations set by envy .
And Schoeck aptly concludes :
There is nothing to be seen here of the close community which allegedly exists among primitive peoples in pre-affluent times — the poorer , it is held , the greater the sense of community .
Sociological theory would have avoided many errors if those phenomena had been properly observed and evaluated a century ago .
The myth of a golden age , when social harmony prevailed because each man had about as little as the next one , the warm and generous community spirit of simple societies , was indeed for the most part just a myth , and social scientists should have known better than to fashion out of it a set of utopian standards with which to criticize their own societies .
In sum , Ludwig von Mises 's strictures against Romanticism do not seem to be overdrawn :
Romanticism is man 's revolt against reason , as well as against the condition under which nature has compelled him to live .
The romantic is a daydreamer ; he easily manages in imagination to disregard the laws of logic and nature .
The thinking and rationally acting man tries to rid himself of the discomfort of unsatisfied wants by economic action and work ; he produces in order to improve his position .
The romantic … imagines the pleasures of success but he does nothing to achieve them he does not remove the obstacles ; he merely removes them in imagination . …
He hates work , economy , and reason .
The romantic takes all the gifts of a social civilization for granted and desires , in addition , everything fine and beautiful that , as he thinks , distant times and creatures had or have to offer .
Surrounded by the comforts of European town life he longs to be an Indian rajah , bedouin , corsair , or troubadour .
But he sees only that portion of these people 's lives which seems pleasant to him …
The perilous nature of their existence , the comparative poverty of their circumstances , their miseries and their toil — these things his imagination tactfully overlooks : all is transfigured by a rosy gleam .
Compared with this dream ideal , reality appears arid and shallow .
There are obstacles to overcome which do not exist in the dream . …
Here there is work to do , ceaselessly , assiduously . …
Here one must plough and sow if one wishes to reap .
The romantic does not choose to admit all this .
Obstinate as a child , he refuses to recognize it .
He mocks and jeers ; he despises and loathes the bourgeois .
The Romantic , or primitivist , attitude was also brilliantly criticized by the Spanish philosopher , Ortega y Gasset :
it is possible to have peoples who are perennially primitive … those who have remained in the motionless , frozen twilight , which never progresses towards midday .
This is what happens in the world which is mere Nature .
But it does not happen in the world of civilization which is ours .
Civilization is not " just there , " it is not self - supporting .
It is artificial .
...
If you want to make use of the advantages of civilization , but are not prepared to concern yourself with the upholding of civilization — you are done .
In a trice you find yourself left without civilization .
...
The primitive forest appears in its native state .
...
The jungle is always primitive and , vice versa , everything primitive is mere jungle .
Ortega adds that the type of man he sees rising to the fore , the modern " mass- man , " " believes that the civilization into which he was born and which he makes use of , is as spontaneous and self - producing as Nature . ... "
But the mass - man , the herd - man , is also characterized by his desire to stamp out those individuals who differ from the mass : " The mass … does not wish to share life with those who are not of it .
It has a deadly hatred of all that is not itself . "
IV .
The Left , of course , does not couch its demands in terms of stamping out diversity ; what it seeks to achieve sounds semantically far more pleasant : equality .
It is in the name of equality that the Left seeks all manner of measures , from progressive taxation to the ultimate stage of communism .
But what , philosophically , is " equality " ?
The term must not be left unanalyzed and accepted at face value .
Let us take three entities : A , B , and C. A , B , and C are said to be " equal " to each other ( i.e. , A=B=C ) if a particular characteristic is found in which the three entities are uniform or identical .
In short , here are three individual men : A , B , and C . Each may be similar in some respects but different in others .
If each of them is precisely 5 ' 10 " in height , they are then equal to each other in height .
It follows from our discussion of the concept of equality that A , B , and C can be completely " equal " to each other only if they are identical or uniform in all characteristics — in short , if all of them are , like the same size of nut or bolt , completely interchangeable .
We see , then , that the ideal of human equality can only imply total uniformity and the utter stamping out of individuality .
It is high time , then , for those who cherish freedom , individuality , the division of labor , and economic prosperity and survival , to stop conceding the supposed nobility of the ideal of equality .
Too often have " conservatives " conceded the ideal of equality only to cavil at its " impracticality . "
Philosophically , there can be no divorce between theory and practice .
Egalitarian measures do not " work " because they violate the basic nature of man , of what it means for the individual man to be truly human .
The call of " equality " is a siren song that can only mean the destruction of all that we cherish as being human .
It is ironic that the term " equality " brings its favorable connotation to us from a past usage that was radically different .
For the concept of " equality " achieved its widespread popularity during the classical liberal movements of the 18th century , when it meant , not uniformity of status or income , but freedom for each and every man , without exception .
In short , " equality " in those days meant the liberation and individualist concept of full liberty for all persons .
Thus , the biochemist Roger Williams correctly points out that the
" free and equal " phrase in the Declaration of Independence was an unfortunate paraphrase of a better statement contained in the Virginia Bill of Rights … " all men are by nature equally free and independent . "
In other words , men can be equally free without being uniform .
This libertarian credo was formulated with particular cogency by Herbert Spencer in his " Law of Equal Liberty " as the suggested fundamental core of his social philosophy :
man 's happiness can be obtained only by the exercise of his faculties .
...
But the fulfillment of this duty necessarily presupposes freedom of action .
Man cannot exercise his faculties without certain scope .
He must have liberty to go and to come , to see , to feel , to speak , to work ; to get food , raiment , shelter , and to provide for each and all the needs of his nature . …
To exercise his faculties he must have liberty to do all that his faculties actually impel him to do .
...
Therefore , he has a right to that liberty .
This , however , is not the right of one but all .
All are endowed with faculties .
All are bound to … [ exercise ] them .
All , therefore , must be free to do those things in which the exercise of them consists .
That is , all must have rights to liberty of action .
And hence there necessarily arises a limitation .
For if men have like claims to that freedom which is needful for the exercise of their faculties , then must the freedom of each be bounded by the similar freedom of all … .
Wherefore we arrive at the general proposition , that every man may claim the fullest liberty to exercise his faculties compatible with the possession of like liberty by every other man .
Thus , only the specific of equality of liberty — the older view of human equality — is compatible with the basic nature of man .
Equality of condition would reduce humanity to an antheap existence .
Fortunately , the individuated nature of man , allied to the geographical diversity on the earth , makes the ideal of total equality unattainable .
But an enormous amount of damage — the crippling of individuality , as well as economic and social destruction — could be generated in the attempt .
Let us turn from equality to the concept of inequality , the condition that exists when every man is not identical to every other in all characteristics .
It is evident that inequality flows inevitably out of specialization and the division of labor .
Therefore , a free economy will lead not only to diversity of occupation , with one man a baker , another an actor , a third a civil engineer , etc. , but specific inequalities will also emerge in monetary income and in status and scope of control within each occupation .
Each person will , in the free - market economy , tend to earn a monetary income equal to the value placed upon his productive contribution in satisfying the desires and demands of the consumers .
In economic terminology each man will tend to earn an income equal to his " marginal productivity , " to his particular productivity in satisfying consumer demands .
Clearly , in a world of developed individual diversity , some men will be more intelligent , others more alert and farsighted , than the remainder of the population .
Still others , meanwhile , will be more interested in those areas reaping greater monetary gain ; those who succeed at wildcatting crude oil will reap greater monetary rewards than those who remain in secretarial jobs .
Many intellectuals are wont to denounce the " unfairness " of the market in granting a far higher monetary income to a movie star than , say , to a social worker , in that way rewarding the " material " far more than the " spiritual . "
It strikes one that if the social worker 's alleged " goodness " indeed resides in her " spirituality , " then it is surely inappropriate and inconsistent to demand that she receive more of the " material " amenities ( money ) vis -à - vis the movie star .
In the free society , those who are capable of providing goods and services that the consumers value and are willing to purchase , will receive precisely what the consumers are willing to spend .
Those who persist in entering lower - priced occupations , either because they prefer the work or because they are not sufficiently capable in the higher - paid fields , can scarcely complain when they earn a lower salary .
If , then , inequality of income is the inevitable corollary of freedom , then so too is inequality of control .
In any organization , whether it be a business firm , a lodge , or a bridge club , there will always be a minority of people who will rise to the position of leaders and others who will remain as followers in the rank and file .
Robert Michels discovered this as one of the great laws of sociology , " The Iron Law of Oligarchy . "
In every organized activity , no matter the sphere , a small number will become the " oligarchical " leaders and the others will follow .
In the market economy , the leaders , being more productive in satisfying the consumers , will inevitably earn more money than the rank and file .
Within other organizations , the difference will only be that of control .
But , in either case , ability and interest will select those who rise to the top .
The best and most dedicated steel producer will rise to the leadership of the steel corporation ; the ablest and most energetic will tend to rise to leadership in the local bridge club , and so on .
This process of ability and dedication finding its own level works best and most smoothly , it is true , in institutions such as business firms in the market economy .
For here every firm places itself under the discipline of monetary profits and income earned by selling a suitable product to the consumers .
If managers or workers fall down on the job , a loss of profits provides a very rapid signal that something is wrong and that these producers must mend their ways .
In nonmarket organizations , where profit does not provide a test of efficiency , it is far easier for other qualities extraneous to the actual activity to play a role in selecting the members of the oligarchy .
Thus , a local bridge club may select its leaders not only for ability and dedication to the activities of the club , but also for extraneous racial or physical characteristics preferred by the membership .
This situation is far less likely where monetary losses will be incurred by yielding to such external factors .
We need only look around us at every human activity or organization , large or small , political , economic , philanthropic , or recreational , to see the universality of the Iron Law of Oligarchy .
Take a bridge club of fifty members and , regardless of legal formalities , half - a- dozen or so will really be running the show .
Michels , in fact , discovered the Iron Law by observing the rigid , bureaucratic , oligarchic rule that pervaded the Social Democratic parties in Europe in the late 19th century , even though these parties were supposedly dedicated in equality and the abolition of the division of labor .
And it is precisely the obviously frozen inequality of income and power , and the rule by oligarchy , that has totally disillusioned the equality - seeking New Left in the Soviet Union .
No one lionizes Brezhnev or Kosygin .
It is the egalitarian attempt by the New Left to escape the Iron Law of inequality and oligarchy that accounts for its desperate efforts to end elite leadership within its own organizations .
( Certainly there has been no indication of any disappearance of the power elite in oft - heralded Cuba or China . )
The early drive toward egalitarianism in the New Left emerged in the concept of " participatory democracy . "
Instead of the members of an organization electing an elite leadership , so the theory ran , each person would participate equally in all of the organization 's decision - making .
It was , by the way , probably this sense of direct and intense participation by each individual that accounted for the heady enthusiasm of the masses in the very early stages of the revolutionary regimes in Soviet Russia and Cuba — an enthusiasm that quickly waned as the inevitable oligarchy began to take control and mass participation to die .
While the would - be participatory democrats have made keen criticisms of bureaucratic rule in our society , the concept itself , when applied , runs rapidly against the Iron Law .
Thus , anyone who has sat through sessions of any organization engaged in participatory democracy knows the intense boredom and inefficiency that develop rapidly .
For if each person must participate equally in all decisions , the time devoted to decision - making must become almost endless , and the processes of the organization become life itself for the participants .
This is one of the reasons why many New Left organizations quickly begin to insist that their members live in communes and dedicate their entire lives to the organization — in effect , to merge their lives with the organization .
For if they truly live and pursue participatory democracy , they can hardly do anything else .
But despite this attempt to salvage the concept , the inevitable gross inefficiency and aggravated boredom ensure that all but the most intensely dedicated will abandon the organization .
In short , if it can work at all , participatory democracy can work only in groups so tiny that they are , in effect , the " leaders " shorn of their following .
We conclude that , to succeed , any organization must eventually fall into the hands of specialized " professionals , " of a minority of persons dedicated to its tasks and able to carry them out .
Oddly enough , it was Lenin who , despite his lip service to the ultimate ideal of egalitarian communism , recognized that a revolution , too , in order to succeed , must be led by a minority , a " vanguard , " of dedicated professionals .
It is the intense egalitarian drive of the New Left that accounts , furthermore , for its curious theory of education — a theory that has made such an enormous impact on the contemporary student movement in American universities in recent years .
The theory holds that , in contrast to " old- fashioned " concepts of education , the teacher knows no more than any of his students .
All , then , are " equal " in condition ; one is no better in any sense than any other .
Since only an imbecile would actually proclaim that the student knows as much about the content of any given discipline as his professor , this claim of equality is sustained by arguing for the abolition of content in the classroom .
This content , asserts the New Left , is " irrelevant " to the student and hence not a proper part of the educational process .
The only proper subject for the classroom is not a body of truths , not assigned readings or topics , but open - ended , free - floating participatory discussion of the student 's feelings , since only his feelings are truly " relevant " to the student .
And since the lecture method implies , of course , that the lecturing professor knows more than the students to whom he imparts knowledge , the lecture too must go .
Such is the caricature of " education " propounded by the New Left .
One question that this doctrine calls to mind , and one that the New Left has never really answered , of course , is why the students should then be in college to begin with .
Why could n't they just as well achieve these open - ended discussions of their feelings at home or at the neighborhood candy store ?
Indeed , on this educational theory , the school as such has no particular function ; it becomes , in effect , the local candy store , and it too merges with life itself .
But then , again , why have a school at all ?
And why , in fact , should the students pay tuition and the faculty receive a salary for their nonexistent services ?
If all are truly equal , why is the faculty alone paid ?
In any case , the emphasis on feelings rather than rational content in courses again insures an egalitarian school ; or rather , the school as such may disappear , but the " courses " would surely be egalitarian , for if only " feelings " are to be discussed , then surely everyone 's feelings are approximately " equal " to everyone else 's .
Once allow reason , intellect , and achievement full sway , and the demon of inequality will quickly raise its ugly head .
If , then , the natural inequality of ability and of interest among men must make elites inevitable , the only sensible course is to abandon the chimera of equality and accept the universal necessity of leaders and followers .
The task of the libertarian , the person dedicated to the idea of the free society , is not to inveigh against elites which , like the need for freedom , flow directly from the nature of man .
The goal of the libertarian is rather to establish a free society , a society in which each man is free to find his best level .
In such a free society , everyone will be " equal " only in liberty , while diverse and unequal in all other respects .
In this society the elites , like everyone else , will be free to rise to their best level .
In Jeffersonian terminology , we will discover " natural aristocracies " who will rise to prominence and leadership in every field .
The point is to allow the rise of these natural aristocracies , but not the rule of " artificial aristocracies " — those who rule by means of coercion .
The artificial aristocrats , the coercive oligarchs , are the men who rise to power by invading the liberties of their fellow men , by denying them their freedom .
On the contrary , the natural aristocrats live in freedom and harmony with their fellows , and rise by exercising their individuality and their highest abilities in the service of their fellows , either in an organization or by producing efficiently for the consumers .
In fact , the coercive oligarchs invariably rise to power by suppressing the natural elites , along with other men ; the two kinds of leadership are antithetical .
Let us take a hypothetical example of a possible case of such conflict between different kinds of elites .
A large group of people voluntarily engage in professional football , selling their services to an eager consuming public .
Quickly rising to the top is a natural elite of the best — the most able and dedicated — football players , coaches , and organizers of the game .
Here we have an example of the rise of a natural elite in a free society .
Then , the power elite in control of the government decides in its wisdom that all professional athletics , and especially football , are evil .
The government then decrees that pro football is outlawed and orders everyone to take part instead in a local eurythmics club as a mass - participatory substitute .
Here the rulers of the government are clearly a coercive oligarchy , an " artificial elite , " using force to repress a voluntary or natural elite ( as well as the rest of the population ) .
The libertarian view of freedom , government , individuality , envy , and coercive versus natural elites has never been put more concisely or with greater verve than by H.L. Mencken :
All government , in its essence , is a conspiracy against the superior man : its one permanent object is to oppress him and cripple him .
If it be aristocratic in organization , then it seeks to protect the man who is superior only in law against the man who is superior in fact ; if it be democratic , then it seeks to protect the man who is inferior in every way against both .
One of its primary functions is to regiment men by force , to make them as much alike as possible and as dependent upon one another as possible , to search out and combat originality among men .
All it can see in an original idea is potential change , and hence an invasion of its prerogatives .
The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out for himself , without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos .
Similarly , the libertarian writer Albert Jay Nock saw in the political conflicts between Left and Right
simply a tussle between two groups of mass - men , one large and poor , the other small and rich …
The object of the tussle was the material gains accruing from control of the State 's machinery .
It is easier to seize wealth ( from the producers ) than to produce it ; and as long as the State makes the seizure of wealth a matter of legalized privilege , so long will the squabble for that privilege go on .
Helmut Schoeck 's
Envy makes a powerful case for the view that the modern egalitarian drive for socialism and similar doctrines is a pandering to envy of the different and the unequal , but the socialist attempt to eliminate envy through egalitarianism can never hope to succeed .
For there will always be personal differences , such as looks , ability , health , and good or bad fortune , which no egalitarian program , however rigorous , can stamp out , and on which envy will be able to fasten its concerns .

WASHINGTON , Oct 21 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday launched a new program to fund purchases of up to $ 600 billion worth of money market mutual fund assets in the latest step to provide liquidity to strained financial markets .
The initiative “ should improve the liquidity position of money market investors , thus increasing their ability to meet any further redemption requests and their willingness to invest in money market instruments , ” the Fed said in a statement .
The U.S. central bank ’s move is the third step it has taken to ease strains among money market mutual funds , which have been under pressure since mid-September when a leading fund , the Reserve Primary Fund , could not maintain the $ 1 per share net asset value threshold that is critical to the viability of such funds .
A severe credit freeze has followed the collapse of the U.S. housing market and led to one of the worst financial crises in decades .
Money market funds are viewed as a low - risk investment , paying slightly higher interest rates than bank savings accounts .
Many money market mutual funds buy commercial paper , short - term debt companies use to fund day - to - day operations .
Breaking the buck at the Reserve Primary Fund , which meant that investors were facing losses on their principal , led to a torrent of redemptions from other money market mutual funds .
Funds became anxious about their liquidity and have been reluctant to provide term funding .
The Fed facility is aimed at unfreezing these markets , Fed officials told reporters .
The Fed could lend as much as $ 540 billion to five “ special purpose vehicles ” set up to buy certificates of deposit and commercial paper from highly rated institutions , the officials said .
The Fed will provide senior secured funding of up to 90 percent to buy the assets from U.S. money market mutual funds and others .
“ This is going to help commercial paper , ” said Laurence Fink , chairman , and chief executive of investment management firm Blackrock Inc , on the company ’s earnings conference call .
“ This is the first thawing that I really see in terms of helping the commercial paper market unravel itself . ”
Major interbank rates and measures of credit stress receded on Tuesday , raising hopes money markets are on the mend .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told the U.S. Congress on Monday there had been encouraging signs that government steps taken so far were helpful in unfreezing credit markets , but that it was too soon to assess the full effects .
JPMorgan Chase JPM.N is the sponsor and manager of the special purpose vehicles announced by the Fed , an official said .
Each conduit will buy assets from 10 designated financial institutions .
Eligible assets include dollar - denominated CDs and commercial paper issued by highly rated financial institutions and having remaining maturities of 90 days or less , the Fed said .
Eligible investors include U.S. money market mutual funds but may over time include other U.S. money market investors .
Despite earlier efforts by the Fed to ease short - term funding strains , money market funds have still been anxious about liquidity pressures .
The Fed expanded liquidity offerings in response to requests from the industry , officials said .
There have been $ 500 billion in outflows from prime money market mutual funds since the end of August , a Fed official said .
While funds have stabilized in terms of outflows , they do not have large liquidity buffers remaining , the official said .
The facility is aimed at taxable money market mutual funds , not tax - exempt funds , officials said .
The Fed intends to announce the start date of the facility by the end of the week .

When Humphrey Lyttelton was alive , and I 'd meet fans of Radio 4's I 'm Sorry I Have n't a Clue , and they discovered I wrote his scripts , the conversation would invariably go something like this :
" What a genius . "
" He 's the funniest man on radio . "
" It must be such a joy to work with Humph . "
" Hang on - what do you mean you write his scripts ? "
" He has scripts ? "
There can be no greater compliment to the performance of a script than for the audience to fail to notice there is one .
At recordings of Clue , even I could forget there was a script .
Such was the transformation from the words I 'd cobbled up into the masterful performance provided by this octogenarian , Old Etonian trumpet - player , I could collapse with laughter along with the rest of the audience , as if I 'd never heard my own words before .
In fact , they no longer were my words .
From the moment Humph took the two small envelopes containing the scripts printed on postcards , the words became his .
When I am asked how a comedy writer is inspired to write new jokes every week , there is a pat answer : I get up and sit down at my computer with a cup of strong coffee .
I then think about the show I have to write : its form , its style , its performers .
I then begin to type , inspired by the thought of how the hell I 'm going to pay the mortgage .
That was generally the case - except when I had the luxury of Humph 's voice in my head .
The inspiration was always there to do something more quirky , more daring , more stupid and , occasionally , even more outrageously knob - gag - laden .
People often talk of the rich , slightly posh , authoritarian tone of Humph 's voice .
There was more than that for me .
I could hear the cheeky glint in his eye .
Most comedy performers prefer to have some involvement in the writing process .
Not Humph .
In 15 years , we never had a script meeting , nor even a quick discussion about a single word he was going to read .
His attitude was that the writing of the script was n't his job .
His job was to read it .
And yet it seems never to have occurred to many of his listeners that Humph actually had a script , even though he'd often point out during the broadcast that he was reading it for the first time .
During his silent , solitary pre-show read - through in a dingy corner of the theatre , I would occasionally spot him scribbling notes when he discovered a typo or a grammatical error .
He was making notes to remind himself to point them out .
He would delight in stopping , mid-performance , to announce that when he was supposed to say " genteel " , for example , the script said " gentile " .
Sometimes he would even read the stage directions .
After a set - piece game , he might say : " ' If that dies on its arse , make them do another one . '
I do n't think I was meant to read that bit . "
Or : " ... the title will be provided by the technical wizardry of the multi-pixelated laser display screen .
' Wait while someone comes on with piece of cardboard . ' "
It was as if Humph occasionally felt the show was going too well , was too professionally slick , and he felt the need to remind us not only what a rank amateur he was , but that all those around him were even worse .
As he did n't get involved in the writing , he could make great play of being dismissive of his script and bolster his " could n't care less " attitude .
This was n't an act - he really could n't have cared less .
That 's not to say he was n't the complete professional , but he did n't need to prove anything .
He had no future comedy career to worry about .
It did n't even occur to him that he was funny .
He often said that the others on the show were professional comedians , so why would he , a trumpeter , try to compete ?
He just found certain things funny , and he shared them with people around him whom he hoped would also find them funny .
Sometimes I wondered if producer Jon Naismith and I took too much advantage of his easygoing insouciance .
Much play was made of Humph as the " purveyor of blue - chip filth " , and he liked that title .
Indeed , he often said he wanted to drive between gigs in a tradesman 's van with " Humphrey Lyttelton : Purveyor of Blue - Chip Filth " written on its sides .
He also said he had never been so proud as when fellow jazzman George Melly , probably the filthiest raconteur ever to have scandalised an audience , claimed to be shocked at what Humph was getting away with .
Even though I was responsible for what I like to describe as " post - feminist irony " ( known in the comedy business as " knob gags " ) , I was sometimes equally amazed by what we asked Humph to try to get away with .
Most centred around his assistant and scorer , the ever - delightful Samantha .
" Samantha has been working down in the gramophone library today , where the archivists have been engaged in a heated argument about who sits at which desk to get the best view of Samantha 's shapely legs .
To calm things down , she had to keep them apart all morning . "
" Samantha has recently taken up beekeeping with a small hive , housing just three dozen or so .
This evening she has an expert beekeeper coming round to show her a few tricks of the trade , and he says he 'll quickly have her 38 bees out and flying round his head . "
" Samantha is off to see a chef gentleman friend who is renowned for his fine - quality offal dishes .
While she 's very keen on his kidneys in red wine and his oxtail in beer , Samantha says it 's difficult to beat his famous tongue in cider . "
That 's the problem with a knob gag : the next one only seems as funny if it 's filthier .
More than once , between tears of helpless laughter , the producer and I asked each other : " Can we actually broadcast that ? "
The rule was that the joke was always clean on the page , with the laughter coming solely from the mis-hearing - literally , in the double entendre .
We could therefore , if required , defend the material , in that it could only appear filthy to someone with a dirty mind - so what were they complaining about ?
However , given the graphic nature of the sexual acts that were " inadvertently " described , that is at least borderline disingenuous .
In fact , I do n't think anyone ever did complain .
There is a paradox in that although many listeners did n't realise Humph had a written script in front of him , they were nonetheless happy to accept that he clearly did n't understand what he was reading .
To claim that Humph did n't know what he was doing on Clue is , of course , complete nonsense .
As to his not being a comedian : that is also untrue .
It may not have said so in his passport , but he was one of the wittiest comedians I ever met - one who could go off - script with the sharpest ad - libs .
While being mocked by the others for his age and incompetence at trying to read a tricky retake , he stopped , gazed to the side for a moment , squinted , and asked : " Has the man in the end bed died ? "
Following a great roar of appreciation at the introduction of a favourite round , he once told the audience : " Now go off and invade Czechoslovakia . "
Then he pointed up to the circle and said : " I was only joking .
Sit down , Madam . "
Approaching what would have been his 87th birthday , he told an audience in Eastbourne : " It makes a nice change to be one of the youngest people in the room . "
Before Chairman Humph , panel games had been chaired by nice chaps ( and they invariably were chaps ) who hoped we'd all enjoy the show as much they were going to enjoy delighting each other with their wit and wisdom .
After Chairman Humph , we got Have I Got News for You , They Think It 's All Over , Never Mind the Buzzcocks and countless other comedy panel games , where the chairman appears not to want to be there and is n't too fond of either his guests or the subject matter .
Humph redefined the role of the comedy panel game chairman .
In the months before he died , Humph and the team toured a stage version of I'm Sorry I Have n't a Clue .
He became quite frail towards the end and it was obvious he was frustrated by his own body giving up on him .
At the end of one of the last performances , he was handed his trumpet to close the show .
An audience of 3,500 rose as one to express their appreciation , as Humph improvised a powerful , note - perfect rendition of We 'll Meet Again .
I wish we could , Humph .

Michelle Farrow stands in one corner of an octagonal fighting cage , glaring at her opponent in the opposite corner .
The 5 - foot - 7 , 143 - pound Farrow is no pushover — she 's got black belts in judo and jiu - jitsu , and her muscular arms look like mini-cannons — but her opponent resembles a tank in gym shorts .
At 217 pounds , Tank Lady weighs as much as two fighters .
And she looks mean .
As soon as the bell rings , Farrow rushes forward and delivers a hard kick to her opponent 's belly .
Undaunted , the Goliath - like girl grabs a handful of Farrow 's hair with her left hand and starts swinging at Farrow 's head with her right .
Farrow responds with a flurry of lefts and rights , 26 lightning - fast punches that send her mammoth opponent reeling backward .
Within seconds , the bigger fighter is running from Farrow 's fists , which continue slamming into her face and the sides of her head .
She 's no longer able to mount an offensive , or even defend herself , so the referee stops the match and declares a TKO victory for Farrow , 57 seconds into the first round .
( Video here . )
Rage in the Cage 117 , the special 10 - year anniversary megashow , is scheduled to take place Saturday , November 8 , at the U.S. Airways Center .
See more images from our cover shoot , and video of Michelle Farrow in action in 2001 , here .

This was no simple boxing or wrestling match , and it certainly was n't just for show .
This bout , which took place at Glendale Arena back in 2001 , was a mixed martial arts fight .
One of the most brutal full - contact sports in the world , MMA bars very few holds and strikes .
It 's been growing in popularity , and though you might not think women would be involved in a sport that revolves around punching , kicking , and choke holds , they are .
Michelle Farrow is an MMA pioneer .
Farrow 's been fighting in mixed martial arts competitions since 1996 .
In the past two years , women 's MMA has made major inroads , with the emergence of stars like Gina Carano and the televising of fights , presented by promoter EliteXC .
It 's been a harrowing road , especially for trailblazers like Farrow , who 's spent more than a decade toiling in dark dojos and fighting for little to no pay .
Women 's MMA is finally on the up , but at 42 , Farrow 's past her fighting prime — and she 's facing the fact that other women will reap the benefits she 's sown in bruises and blood .
She insists she 's happy to see the sport growing and she remains involved in local MMA , training a team of male fighters at her Phoenix dojo , The American Martial Arts Center , and serving as event coordinator for local events Rage in the Cage and the Desert Quest grappling tournaments .
As one of the first female fighters in MMA , Farrow 's fought for the respect and legitimacy she now sees the sport finally earning .
On her shoulder , Farrow has the words " woman warrior " tattooed in Japanese characters .
She proudly wears a tank top that reads " Takedowns , submissions , grappling , rear naked chokes — all on the first date . "
Her teenage nephew consistently brags to his friends , " My aunt can kick your ass . "
And she probably can .
Farrow has fought — and defeated — both women and men in martial arts competitions .
She knows how to break bones and throw people around .
But outside the fighting cage , she 's shy , almost passive .
" I 've never been in a street fight in my life , " she says .
" I was the kid that got picked on in school .
If somebody tried to start a fight with me on the street , I 'd probably run . "
Besides , it 's not worth breaking a nail in a bar brawl .
For all her toughness , Farrow 's surprisingly girly .
On a recent weeknight , she sits on the floor of The American Martial Arts Center , legs crossed in the lotus position , and studies her reflection in the large window that looks out to a dark , desolate strip mall on Dunlap Avenue in northwest Phoenix .
" Damn , my face is breaking out , " she laments .
" I went and got a facial yesterday , and the girl used this scrub that dried out my skin .
I got up this morning and was like , ' Oh , man . ' "
" I get manicures , pedicures , facials , " she continues , smiling and holding out a thick - veined hand with big knuckles and inch - long fingernails painted with glittery pink polish .
" These are my real nails .
If I were to fight again , I 'd cut them . "
Farrow has n't fought in more than two years .
But everybody in the local MMA scene is pushing her to come out of retirement .
Farrow has n't entirely ruled out the prospect of another cage fight , saying she 'd take a match " if the right fight came along . "
Local promoter Roland Sarria hopes she 'll get back in the ring .
" Michelle was the Rage in the Cage women 's champion for years .
She 's the most decorated female fighter in the history of Rage in the Cage , " he says .
" As a fighter , she 's world - level .
She 's fantastic , very aggressive in the ring .
I miss seeing her fight . "
Farrow says she would still fight , but female fighters in Phoenix have always been few and far between , so rather than training herself for occasional fights , she trains men .
That 's a sport unto itself .
" I tease them if they 're out of breath or something when we 're grappling , " she says .
" I 'll just look at them and say , ' What — you ca n't keep up with Grandma ? '
That seems to work pretty well . "
Once labeled " human cockfighting " by John McCain ( he prefers straight - up boxing ) and banned in many states , MMA is now embraced by a wider audience .
National fights are featured on TV networks like Spike and Showtime , and the largest MMA promotion , the Ultimate Fighting Championship , drew more than $ 200 million in revenue in 2006 .
The popularity of the sport has spread , and Arizona , in particular , has become a hub of MMA activity .
Roland Sarria launched his Rage in the Cage competitions 10 years ago , and he 's managed to fill more than 8,000 seats at venues like Dodge Theatre .
And in the past year , two major national MMA names — Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie — have opened training facilities in the Valley .
Politicians have taken note .
In April , Governor Janet Napolitano signed into law a measure that relaxes rules for MMA competitions in Arizona , allowing closed fist strikes and knees to the head .
With the new rules and so many fight schools taking root in the Valley , promoters are banking on Phoenix to be the next MMA boon , and female fighters are finally getting some of the spotlight .
Women 's MMA has grown since Michelle Farrow first stepped in the cage .
There are now hundreds of female fighters across the world , and a handful of fan sites like www.fightergirls.com and www.mmawoman.com.
Events such as the Fatal Femmes Fighting Championship and Hook ' n '
Shoot feature women 's fights , and — up until the company ceased operations on October 20 — EliteXC was putting women 's fights on the main card .
And the sport now has a marketable face and bona fide star in Muay Thai kickboxer Gina Carano , who appears as " Crush " on American Gladiators and is regularly a top Google image search .
She 's also a tenacious fighter with a solid MMA record of 7- 0 .
But even Carano , hailed by EliteXC as " the face of women 's MMA , " does n't make the kind of money a man fighting in a main event earns .
At the EliteXC : Heat event in Florida on October 4 , the promotion 's shining star , Kimbo Slice , stepped into the ring and lost to a virtually unknown fighter named Seth Petruzelli in 14 seconds of the first round .
Many critics cite this fight ( and Petruzelli 's comments insinuating he was offered bonus money to keep the fight off the mat ) as one of the reasons EliteXC plans to file for bankruptcy protection .
For his lackluster performance , Slice was paid $ 500,000 .
By contrast , Carano fought three full rounds , won by unanimous decision , and was paid $ 35,000 .
The rise of women 's MMA is a stinging success for Farrow .
With a career MMA record of 12 - 3 and numerous judo , jiu - jitsu , and grappling championships to her name , she could still fight if she insisted .
But her prime passed in the dark days of women 's MMA , before there were weight classes , rules , and paychecks .
Farrow fought when women had to pay for all their pre-fight medical expenses out of pocket , as well as hunt and beg for fights that often fell through and , if they did n't fall through , hope that the promoter would at least reimburse their travel expenses .
Michelle Farrow obviously did n't get into the sport for the fame and money .
She got into it because , quite simply , she discovered she could whup some major ass .
And she might be away from the ring , but nothing — be it a broken nose or a broken marriage — can keep her away from the dojo .
On a warm Thursday night in October at The American Martial Arts Center , Farrow 's leading a team of 13 students through a half - hour of warm - up drills that include several laps around the dojo , full - body stretches , balancing exercises , squats , lunges , and falling techniques .
" The most important thing to remember when you 're on the mat is do n't lay flat on your back , " she tells the students .
" One of the credos of jiu - jitsu is ' minimum effort , maximum efficiency . '
Control your posture , control the movement . "
If there were a credo for MMA , in general , it would be " Just whup some ass . "
The sport combines a wide variety of martial arts disciplines — the strikes of karate and kickboxing with the submission holds of jiu - jitsu , the wrestling skills of grappling , and the throws of judo .
Farrow and her ex-husband , Dusty , know all these skills .
They 've owned The American Martial Arts Center for five years , and they 've been competing in MMA competitions for 12 years .
Tonight 's class is all about cage fight techniques , though Farrow takes a moment out to nurse one of her fighters , Eric " Shortbus " Regan , when he takes a hit in the eye while sparring .
" Come on and let me look at it , " Farrow tells him , leading him into the bathroom and examining his eye .
" Boy , how did you do this ? "
She asks , swabbing under his eye with an alcohol - soaked cotton swab ( turns out he fell face - first onto the mat while wrestling ) .
She then grabs what boxers call " fake skin " ( a blister medicine called Compeed ) and applies it under his eye .
Regan whimpers .
" Oh , do n't be a baby , " Farrow teases him .
" You 're gonna be fine .
It 's just a scrape .
I could fix this with nail polish . "
Steve Sayegh , who 's trained with the Farrows for the past 12 years and has had several high - profile fights , says that Farrow 's always been rather motherly .
" When you 're part of this dojo , you 're part of this family .
There have been so many times when Michelle called in sick or left work early to be there for us , " he says .
" When she has vacation time , she puts it into the dojo . "
Farrow plays dual roles : the ass - kicking trainer who throws around guys twice her size and the surrogate mother who dotes after injured fighters with a first aid kit .
" I have true feelings for these boys , " she says .
" They 're my kids and my family , everything all wrapped up into one .
If they get hurt , it hurts me . "
Though she 's now ring mother to a stable of big male fighters , Farrow has n't forgotten the role she played in women 's MMA as one of the first female fighters , especially now that she sees the sport embracing the fairer sex .
" I 'm glad I was on the ground floor of it , " Farrow says .
" It sucks for me , because I did n't have the opportunities that these girls have , but I like to think that maybe they have those opportunities because I stuck with it all these years . "
The story of the born prizefighter , destined to sacrifice everything for a music - and - montage - filled moment of shining glory , is not Michelle Farrow 's story .
She 's won a dozen cage fights with flurries of fists , devastating chokeholds , and punishing joint locks known to snap ligaments .
But she was supposed to be a ballerina .
" If you would 've asked me when I was growing up if I ever thought I 'd be doing something like this , I would have told you that you were crazy , " Farrow says , cutting into a medium - rare steak at Black Angus .
It 's a Tuesday evening , and she 's in between her full - time day job as a computer programmer at American Express and her jiu - jitsu class at The American Martial Arts Center .
The black summer dress with a bright floral pattern she 's wearing now will be replaced by gym shorts and a sports bra in a few hours .
" I was a tomboy , but to be a professional fighter — to dedicate my life to fighting and teaching other people to fight and to make sure the sport continues and progresses —
I would have never , ever thought my life would 've been like that , " she continues .
" It 's kind of crazy when I think about it .
Sometimes I just scratch my head and go , ' How the heck did this happen ? ' "
Born in Chicago , Farrow says she moved to Phoenix with her " very strict , religious family " when she was 9 .
She was raised as a Jehovah 's Witness .
" I was one of those girls that was raised with the children - should - be - seen - and - not - heard thing , " she says .
" You 're taught that as a woman , as a girl , men are dominant .
The woman walks behind the man .
That was the upbringing I had until I was about 13 or so , and then everything kind of changed . "
Asked what caused the change , Farrow looks down and sighs .
" When I was 13 , my mother 's boyfriend sexually assaulted me .
My windpipe was crushed , I had broken ribs — it was brutal .
So that got me out of the religion . "
Already shy , Farrow says the assault made her even more withdrawn .
" It honestly made me more afraid of everything and more self - conscious , " she says .
" Fighting changed everything .
No man will ever hurt me again . "
Farrow says the man who assaulted her was charged , convicted , and sentenced to 21 years to life .
Farrow left home shortly afterward .
She says she and her mother are estranged , and she does n't really talk to her father very much .
She considers her students her family .
When she was 14 , Michelle met Dusty Farrow .
He was four years older , and they were both cadets in the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Explorer program .
Designed for young people interested in pursuing careers in law enforcement , the program teaches kids stuff like how to file police reports and serve search warrants .
Essentially on her own and estranged from her family , Michelle married Dusty when she was only 16 .
Dusty recalls that Michelle was shy .
" When I met Michelle , she did n't fight , " he says .
" She did n't do anything like that . "
Michelle was always athletic but found her options limited .
" All the sports I wanted to do in high school — football , wrestling — women could n't do .
You could run track or do gymnastics , and I was all right at track , but gymnastics was a disaster .
I 'm too tall for the gymnastics , " Farrow says .
" I wanted to be a ballerina , growing up , " she adds with a laugh .
" But that was n't happening .
I had the wrong body type , and I am not the most graceful person in the world — but on the mat , I kind of am .
I kind of am . "
Farrow was first drawn to mixed martial arts in 1993 , when she watched the Ultimate Fighting Championship 's first tournament on pay - per-view .
The card included fighters from seven different disciplines in a no-holds - barred mash - up bash - up .
The rules would change over the years as UFC events became sanctioned by state athletic commissions .
But originally , there were no weight classes and very few rules .
Gloves were not required , and matches could be incredibly violent .
In 1997 , the UFC began requiring fighters to wear padded gloves and banned hair - pulling , head - butting , groin kicks , and strikes to the back of an opponent 's head or neck .
Weight classes were introduced , and state athletic commissions started sanctioning UFC events .
Locally , all Rage in the Cage events are sanctioned by the Arizona Boxing Commission .
But it was a very different world when Michelle and Dusty Farrow started watching MMA in 1993 .
Not only was there a lack of rules , female fighters were virtually unheard of .
Michelle was 29 at the time , and there were n't many examples of female fighters .
One of the first women Farrow saw competing in MMA was Becky Levi , a former physical education teacher from Tucson who served as a conditioning trainer for UFC veteran Don " The Predator " Frye .
Levi's long retired ; the two never fought .
Farrow remembers her as an early influence .
But she trained with a man .
In the beginning , Michelle 's fight instruction came from her husband .
Dusty Farrow recalls Michelle 's second fight , which she took on about five minutes ' notice .
It was the summer of 1996 , when cage fighting was just starting in Arizona .
They were at the Cajun House ( now The Venue of Scottsdale ) to watch a fight tournament that some of their male friends were competing in .
Michelle and Dusty had just finished celebrating her birthday at Carlos O'Brien's , so Michelle was full of Mexican food , drinking at the bar .
She certainly was n't prepared for a fight .
But when the only female fighter on the card was stood up by her scheduled opponent , Michelle suddenly found herself beating some girl 's ass .
" Michelle goes and borrows gear and TKOs this girl in the second round , " Dusty says .
" We did n't know nothing about this girl — she was just huge , big and shredded and muscular .
Michelle should n't have even been in there , but this was before anything was regulated , when a fighter could just get up , sign a waiver , and go out there and fight . "
At the time , Michelle was working at American Express ( she 's been there for 17 years ) and also training students at the Leininger Dojo in Phoenix .
She and Dusty had no children ( nor do they now ) , so they focused completely on fighting .
In 1998 , Roland Sarria started calling Michelle and asking her to fight at his new Rage in the Cage events .
But when Michelle first approached Dusty about fighting , " I was a little bit shocked , " he says .
" Nobody wants to see someone they 're in a relationship with do that , because you go through a lot of emotions . . .
Who wants to see their loved one out there with the risk of getting hurt ?
It 's kind of hard to see that .
But I set my emotions aside and just let her do what she wanted to do . "
Within seven months of her first fight , Michelle Farrow had taken the nickname " Grapple Girl " and had become the most dominant of the few female fighters in Arizona — which came with even more challenges .
To begin with , Farrow could n't find fight gear that fit .
" Finding gloves to fit is so difficult for women , because they 're made for men's hands .
I have little tiny wrists , and I 'd be wrapping the gloves around three or four times , and I 'd still feel like they were gonna fall off , " she says .
" Some states require groin protection for women .
Forget it .
They do not make a decent groin protector for women , for fighting . "
As for protecting her breasts , Farrow 's only option was to double - up on sports bras to flatten her chest .
There was no stability with her weight , either , because there were so few female fighters and no weight classes then .
" [ Women 's MMA ] is much bigger than it was , but when I started , it was so small , and the weight ranges were crazy .
It was so hard to get fights for anybody , " Farrow says .
" A girl would pop up and say she wanted a fight , so you 'd fight her .
You 'd make the weight or you did n't .
So you 'd go up and down in weight ; it was havoc .
But it was what we had to do to get a fight . "
Training for fights required a disciplined , protein - rich diet , and countless hours of physical training .
Fights were rare , and there was always the danger they 'd fall through , which they frequently did .
The result was weeks of hard training for nothing and paying out of pocket for now - pointless pre-fight medical expenses ( physicals , eye exams , blood work , sometimes CT scans and MRIs ) .
" You just did n't have the luxury men have . . .
If one guy drops out , you 've got 20 guys standing in line to fight .
Not a big deal .
For a woman , if your fight bails , you can go six months to a year before you find another opponent , " Farrow says .
Even Gina Carano , the most celebrated female fighter in MMA history , may have trouble finding fights now that EliteXC has folded .
Some people in local MMA , like Dusty Farrow , would n't view that as a big loss .
He takes issue with female fighters getting attention for their good looks .
" I do n't want to name any names , but if you saw the fights on TV this past weekend [ Gina Carano 's match against Kelly Kobold at EliteXC : Heat ] . . .
Go to any layman on the street and ask , ' Have you heard of this girl ? ' and they 'll say , ' Of course .
She 's beautiful . '
That 's not how it 's supposed to be .
She 's supposed to be known for her fighting first , " he says .
Michelle says she watched Carano 's fight against Kobold and was unimpressed .
" I did n't see a lot of technique or skill , " she says , " I just saw a lot of wildly swinging for the trees . "
And although Carano 's record as a fighter is solid , Farrow 's fought more than twice as many matches in a career more than twice as long .
" Maybe it 's a little bit of jealousy on my part , but to tell you the truth , there are a lot more other girls who deserve to be there more than she did , " Dusty continues .
" Michelle put a lot of blood , sweat , and tears into this sport before that girl even knew what a cage fight was . "
Michelle Farrow 's last fight , in November 2006 , also marked the end of her marriage .
Farrow was defending her Rage in the Cage championship against Nicole Maldonado .
Turns out , Dusty had been having an affair with a woman who worked at a flower shop down the street from the dojo ; Michelle heard about the affair the day of the fight .
" My last fight , he was my corner man .
And I found out he'd been with somebody else that day , " Farrow says .
" It totally took the fight out of me .
My mind was n't there . "
In the video of her last match ( viewable at www.phoenixnewtimes.com), the camera shows Michelle conferring with Dusty before round three .
Clinging to the cage , she hangs her head and looks defeated before the bell even rings .
She 's thrown to the mat at the beginning of the round , and fight commentators express their disbelief .
" I cannot believe Michelle is on her back , " one of them says .
" This does not look like her . "
Maldonado straddles Farrow and unleashes a striking frenzy 27 seconds into the round .
Farrow attempts to twist out of the position , but keeps taking blows to the head .
After at least a dozen strikes from Maldonado go unanswered , the referee stops the match .
Farrow lost the fight , and the Rage in the Cage women 's championship she 'd held for five years ( Maldonado has since vacated the title and disappeared from MMA ) .
But losing her title was the least of Michelle Farrow 's worries .
" When we separated , I had to decide whether or not to give up the dojo , " she says , with tears in her eyes .
" And this is my life .
I can't abandon these guys .
So Dusty and I try to get along for the sake of the dojo , but we do n't really talk to each other all that much . "
Michelle says that sometimes she feels as though she and Dusty are cordial to each other for the sake of the kids — the kids being the students at the dojo .
" It 's like any family .
You have your ups and downs , you win , you lose , and you all take it together , " she says .
" It 's wonderful when they win , it 's horrible when they lose , but you learn to support them and love them and hold their hand when it hurts . "
The fighters at Farrow 's dojo all come to her with their injuries , and she patches them up with ice packs , antiseptics , and bandages .
At a Rage in the Cage event in Prescott this past September , Eric " Shortbus " Regan needed extra attention .
" He got cut bad , " Farrow says .
" The boy was a bloody mess . "
Farrow spent a half - hour wiping blood off Regan , giving him a sponge bath , and checking for other injuries ( luckily , there was just one bloody cut ) .
" If someone gets hurt , I 'm gonna go over there and try to take care of you , " she says .
" I do n't know if I 'm too motherly , but I do n't think my guys are lacking because of it .
I think it bonds the team together . "
For some men at The American Martial Arts Center , receiving fight training from a woman was uncomfortable at first .
" In the beginning , it was very awkward , " says Steve Sayegh , one of the Farrows ' veteran cage fighters .
" Coming in as a senior in high school , you 're young , dumb , and full of whatever you want to call it .
You 've got this pride that 's just completely way above normal , and you always want to think — especially as a football player or a wrestler — that you 're dominant .
And if you talk to Michelle before you start training with her , you get this idea that , ' Okay , it 's gonna be total domination for me out there . '
" And then you start grappling with her , and man !
She kicks ass .
She dominates the majority of the people , if not all of us , here .
She 's a badass .
She 's strong as hell .
She 's smart as hell .
For the typical guy out there who looks at a female and thinks less of them , the last person you wanna do that with is Michelle . "
Some of Michelle Farrow 's wishes are coming true .
MMA is getting bigger , and one of the largest growth spurts is taking place in her hometown .
In the past two years , Royce Gracie 's academy , The Lab , opened in Glendale , and Ken Shamrock 's Lion 's Den opened in Scottsdale .
Both facilities boast more than 3,000 square feet of mat space and regulation fighting cages .
By contrast , The American Martial Arts Center has a modest weight room and a smaller room covered in grappling mats .
The center 's sole means of promotion are the dojo's Web site , www.amacaz.com, and Farrow 's site , www.grapplegirl.com.
Sarria 's got a site , too ( www.rageinthecage.com), and three Rage in the Cage schools , but none of them comes close to the sheer size and star power of The Lab or The Lion 's Den .
In addition to the new MMA schools , one of the reasons everybody seems to view Phoenix as the next MMA hotbed is the adoption of more relaxed rules for cage fighting .
Some people see the prospect of more " extreme " fights in Arizona as a boon .
Others see potential problems .
" Let 's be honest — there are different levels of fighters , " Michelle Farrow says .
" The guys in this stage , this is a starting point .
This is a jumping - off platform .
Those rules shorten a fighter 's career .
I do n't want to see anybody get hurt , but then I do n't want to see anybody held back , either .
I 'm so tossed up and emotional over the whole issue . "
For her dedication to local MMA , Farrow will be inducted into the Rage in the Cage Hall of Fame at the event 's 10th anniversary show on November 8 .
The event marks the progression of the grassroots promotion — 15 bouts in a 22,000 - seat venue and a main event that pits eight - time UFC veteran Joe Riggs against former UFC heavyweight champion Ricco Rodriguez .
It 's a big event for Farrow , who 's too busy focusing on her fighters to dwell on her role as one of the unsung pioneers of women 's MMA .
She says she 's just happy to be part of the history and watch the sport grow .
" The women have to be patient and keep plugging along , " she says , " knowing that it may not be that great for you , but it 's just gonna keep moving on , and you 'll be part of the history of the sport .
And that 's all you can do . "
But , she says , she does still have some fight gloves that fit .
MCCAIN’S PLAN TO CUT MEDICARE ….
Under John McCain ’s healthcare plan , Americans would move away from an employer - based system , and instead get tax credits they ’d take to the free market to buy insurance .
We ’ve talked several times of late about the overwhelming flaws in this approach .
But today , a different question comes to the fore .
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the McCain plan ’s tax credits would cost $ 1.3 trillion over 10 years — and the McCain campaign insists it can account for every penny , and that the plan would be budget - neutral .
Where would that money come from ?
The Wall Street Journal ’s Laura Meckler has an important article this morning that explains exactly how McCain would pay for it — he ’d cut Medicare and Medicaid by $ 1.3 trillion .
… Douglas Holtz - Eakin , Sen. McCain ’s senior policy adviser , said Sunday that the campaign has always planned to fund the tax credits , in part , with savings from Medicare and Medicaid .
Those government health - care programs serve seniors , poor families and the disabled .
Medicare spending for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 is estimated at $ 457.5 billion .
Mr. Holtz - Eakin said the Medicare and Medicaid changes would improve the programs and eliminate fraud , but he did n’t detail where the cuts would come from … .
Mr. Holtz - Eakin said the plan is accurately described as budget neutral because it assumes enough savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make up the difference .
He said the savings would come from eliminating Medicare fraud and by reforming payment policies to lower the overall cost of care .
And if you think a McCain administration is going to find $ 1.3 trillion in Medicare by eliminating “ fraud ” and improving the payment system — without reducing benefits —
I ’ve got a bridge in Alaska I ’d like to sell you .
Jonathan Cohn has a terrific item delving into the policy details here , but the political implications of all of this are pretty extraordinary .
As Jonathan Chait explained , “ John McCain proposes to cut Medicare and Medicaid in an election year .
You ca n’t do that .
That , alone , is enough to cost you an election . ”
Quite right .
This actually has the potential to be a game - changer .
McCain ’s actual policy , not a caricature of it , calls for massive cuts to Medicare .
That ’s not an attack ; that ’s his plan .
I might recommend that Democrats take this message to South Florida .
I think there are a few voters there who might find this interesting .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A key index of the nation 's manufacturing activity fell to a 26 - year low , sliding into recession territory , according to a purchasing managers group .
The Institute for Supply Management 's ( ISM ) said Monday that its manufacturing index tumbled to 38.9 in October from 43.5 in September .
It was the lowest reading since September 1982 , when the index registered 38.8 .
Economists were expecting a reading of 42 , according to a survey conducted by Briefing.com .
The tipping point for the index is 50 , with a reading below that indicating contraction in manufacturing activity .
The index has hovered around the 50 mark since September 2007 , with an average of 49.1 .
A reading below 41 is considered a sign that the economy is in recession .
The October numbers are " well within recession territory , " said John Silvia , chief economist at Wachovia economics group .
He said continued weakness in new orders , production and employment , " suggests recessionary conditions in the manufacturing sector for the fourth quarter . "
Employment in the manufacturing sector fell for the third month in a row .
ISM 's employment measure registered 34.6 in October , down 7.2 points from September .
It was the lowest reading for the employment component since March 1991 , when it registered 33.6 .
New orders for manufactured goods have been declining for nearly a year .
In October , the ISM 's measure of new orders fell 6.6 points to 32.2 .
Factories have reported declining levels of production for the last 2 months , with a fall of 6.7 points in October to a reading of 34.1 .
The part of the index that measures the prices manufacturers pay for raw materials declined 16.5 points to a reading of 37 in the month .
It was the lowest point for the component since December 2001 when the prices index registered 33.2 .
" Lower input prices would normally be a positive , but they 're not a positive enough to get other elements to go up , " Silvia said .
In a sign of growing economic weakness worldwide , the index 's measure of export orders fell 11 points to a reading of 41 .
The decline came after 70 months of expansion .
Rising exports had been a bright spot for U.S. manufacturers as the domestic economy deteriorates .
But last month 's decline suggests that struggling consumers overseas are losing their appetite for U.S. exports .
The index also showed that factories and their customers are facing rising levels of inventory as orders dry up .
The factoriy component rose 0.9 point to 44.3 , and customer inventories grew 1.5 points to 55 .
" It appears that manufacturing is experiencing significant demand destruction as a result of recent events , with members indicating challenges associated with the financial crisis , interruptions from the Gulf hurricane , and the lagging impact from higher oil prices , " said Norbert Ore , chairman of the Institute for Supply Management 's Manufacturing Business Survey Committee , in a statement .
Monday 's report comes after the government said last week that the nation 's economy shrank in the third quarter .
U.S. gross domestic product , the broadest measure of economic activity , fell at an annual rate of 0.3 % in the third quarter , compared with a 2.8 % growth rate in the second quarter .
Many economists say weakness in consumer spending , among other things , could result in a negative GDP reading in the fourth quarter .
Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP are one of the classic , unofficial definitions of a recession .
November 20 , 2008
ONE OF the strange twists about modern science is that it sometimes gets used by the utterly irrational , who claim they 've found scientific proof to back up their bonkers theories .
So you get creationists who announce that they 've found geological evidence for the great flood , or some fundamentalist Christian will reveal that " new studies of whales suggest they have a larger stomach than we thought , so there was ample room for Jonah to live in one quite comfortably , perhaps creating a kitchen area near the intestine , and he could even have arranged a spare bedroom for guests by knocking through into the liver to create more space . "
The latest discovery seems more convincing , because a Stone Age grave has been discovered in which a genetically linked family is placed together , so they 've become known as " the first nuclear family . "
And one newspaper says , " This suggests family values have been thriving since before the time of Stonehenge . "
So that settles it .
The traditional family is so natural they were doing it in the Stone Age .
The skeptical might wonder how we know this grave contains the whole family , as there could have been loads more of them who all lived together communally , but are buried somewhere else .
And then it turns out that there is another body buried there that is n't genetically linked , but the discoverer , Wolfgang Haak , explains this was " probably an aunt or a stepmother . "
Yes , that must be it .
Or it might have been the friendly neighbor from the nuclear family in the hut next door , who 'd popped round to borrow a piece of flint because he was putting up shelves .
And the two men were probably discussing that week 's Top Gear , which featured a new type of wheel you could push from nought to eight miles per hour in nine seconds because it was made of fuel - injection rock , while the women flicked through a catalogue for sabre - toothed tigerskin coats .
And if they discover the bones of a rabbit somewhere nearby , that will probably have been the family pet , who was probably called Mister Munchkins .
Even better , the buried people appear to have all been killed in a neolithic raid .
So this was probably done by some rival permissive liberal tribe full of single parents and transvestites complaining , " I 'm an Iron Age man trapped in a Stone Age body , " in which all order had broken down , as will probably be proved soon when a cave painting is discovered showing loads of them on the Jeremy Kyle show above captions such as " My stepfather keeps leering at my mammoth , " and so they all went on the rampage .
NO MATTER how far society moves from the " traditional " family , we still seem determined to impose it on all history .
I went to the Viking museum in York a while ago , in which there were models of a supposedly typical Viking family , in which Viking dad was working while Viking mum was making dinner in a pot and the Viking kids played with a Viking dog and cat .
They should have had a commentary , with the dad saying " Hello darling , I 've had such a hard day at the pillaging office , that darned South - West division missed their target yet again , they 've barely massacred more than three villages since the new tax year . "
This might have pleased campaigners for the " traditional " family , such as Melanie Phillips , who complains that the current methods for teaching in schools " destroys the unique place of marriage in our society " by " teaching that families include single parents and children in local authority care . "
So to maintain our values , we should not only disapprove of such people , but deny they exist .
A glance through history suggests there 's nothing natural about the " traditional " family , and societies have found countless different ways of organizing themselves .
In hunter - gatherer societies , it appears that tribes lived and mated communally , as they depended on a communal effort to hunt and gather collectively .
If Jeremy Kyle had been around , then he'd have interviewed the monogamous , glaring at a hunter while sat on his haunches and scowling , " So - - you only have sex with one other person , do you ?
No one else in the tribe good enough for you , is that it ?
You make me sick . "
The modern family as we know it arose quite recently , as a product of towns and cities .
But even then , the " traditional family values " were n't always as we 'd understand them .
In ancient Greece and Rome , for example , it was deemed healthy and proper for male citizens to have male sex slaves , and anyone objecting would have told they were arguing " against nature . "
So come on Melanie Phillips , sign up to be a sex slave , and you 'll be true to your word in upholding traditional family values .

BARNAUL , Russia -- Russia 's oil - fired economic miracle is unraveling as industry shrinks and job losses mount .
Now the first stirrings of social unrest have the Kremlin groping for a response .
Gloom deepened over the outlook for oil - export revenue , Russia 's main earner , as prices plunged Thursday despite OPEC 's move this week to deeply cut production .
Oil hit a 4 ½ year low on anxiety about falling global demand , with crude closing at $ 36.22 a barrel in New York , down $ 3.84 .
This could spell trouble for Russia , which has pegged its 2009 budget on much higher oil prices , meaning it will have to trim spending .
( Please see related article on Page C1 . )
The drop in oil prices is eroding the Kremlin 's ability to replenish its gold and foreign - currency reserves just when it needs them most .
Although the country 's reserves are the world 's third - largest behind China and Japan , it has been spending tens of billions of dollars in an attempt to prop up its falling ruble and stave off public panic .
The central bank let the currency slide more quickly Thursday , the third small devaluation in four days .
The currency has lost more than 11 % against the government 's dollar - euro basket since August , when it hit its historic peak .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday painted a bleak picture of the economy .
Since October , more than 7,500 firms have informed the government they intended to lay off people , and 207,000 workers have had their working hours reduced , he said , calling these " worrying signals . "

Prison Corporation Charged with Murder , Manslaughter
22 Corporate Crime Reporter 42 , October 31 , 2008
A Texas grand jury in Willacy County , Texas last week indicted GEO Group Inc. – formerly Wackenhut Corrections Corporation – on one count of murder and two counts of manslaughter .
The indictment grows out of the April 26 , 2001 death of an inmate at one of the company ’s facilities in Raymondville , Texas .
The inmate – Gregorio De La Rosa – was beaten to death by fellow inmates with socks stuffed with padlocks .
The murder count alleges that the company “ intentionally or knowingly ” caused the death of De La Rosa by allowing the inmates to beat De La Rosa to death .
One of the manslaughter counts allege that the company “ recklessly allowed ” the beatings to occur .
The other manslaughter count alleges that the company intended to cause serious bodily injury while committing a felony – aggravated assault .
De La Rosa was beaten just four days before his release from the Willacy State Jail in Raymondville , Texas – which was owned and operated by the company .
De La Rosa , 33 , was serving a six - month sentence for a minor drug offense .
His family sued the prison company .
The family was represented by Ronald Rodriguez , a lawyer based in Laredo , Texas .
The District Attorney in Willacy County is Juan Angel Guerra .
Corporate Crime Reporter will run an interview with Guerra in next week ’s issue ( print edition only ) .
The civil lawsuit alleged that the beating was part of a “ tradition of payback , whereby prisoners were beaten just before their release . ”
The family alleged that the guards knew about these beatings but did nothing to stop them .
De La Rosa was not the first inmate to undergo beating by padlocks stuffed in socks prior to release , the lawsuit alleged .
In September 2006 , a jury returned a $ 47.5 million verdict – including $ 20.5 million in punitive damages .
Home
When I see it , the sun has nearly set .
The memory card inside my camera is almost full .
I do n't have a tripod with me .
But on the ground - floor the windows are wide open , the doors ripped from their hinges .
Jane Cooper Elementary sits gutted in one of the worst parts of one of the most impoverished and dangerous cities in the richest nation in the world .
In the late 1990s , Mayor Dennis Archer 's office identified this neighborhood as having " more children , more people living in poverty , a greater proportion of high school dropouts , and a larger percentage of violent juvenile offenses than the city as a whole . "
Which , in Detroit , is saying quite a bit .
For several blocks in each direction there are no traces of the neighborhood that once existed here .
Most of the houses surrounding the school were torn down for an industrial park that was never built .
The school sits alone , a stone monolith on the prairie , still covered in sculptural details and Pewabic tiles .
Nearly all of the surrounding streets are blocked off from traffic by Jersey walls ; other nearby streets are full of trash that has been illegally dumped there or dragged from the school by scrappers .
There are piles of old audio- visual equipment stripped of its metal and wires .
There are small scars of soot and ash on the concrete where scrappers have built fires to burn away the plastic coating of electrical wiring .
An abandoned boat straddles the edge of the street and the school 's parking lot .
I walk over to a playground built a decade ago with hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant money from private and public sources .
Everything is yellow - orange from the setting sun .
I listen for the telltale sound of scrappers working inside of the building : sledgehammers , metal - cutting - saws , yelling .
The last few times I drove past they were inside , but now there is no one in the building .
The scrappers must have headed off for their miles - long shopping - cart journeys to the nearest after - hours scrapyard ( where they will get a fraction of the market value for the metal they 've stolen ) .
I can't help myself .
I have to go in .
Later , when I 'm safe at home , I try to research the school using the limited resources of the internet , and I find little of substance .
It was a civil defense fallout shelter before the school itself and the neighborhood around it looked like they were hit by an actual nuclear blast .
Newspaper articles mentioning the school provide only stories of trauma experienced by a few students : three young girls lost their lives in a fire at their home in the neighborhood , a 13 - year - old wielding a knife had to be escorted out of the school by police , and an 11 - year - old girl was raped in her home by two men she met through a " party line " telephone number passed around at the school .
There is an article about the dentist who set up shop in the school , providing free dental care to students who had never been to a dentist , and the optometrist who provided eye exams and free glasses to students who could not see the blackboard .
And there are countless mentions of the school in the obituaries of old white people , alumni whose lives ended in the suburbs .
A cursory bit of research at the archives of the public library and I learn that at one time , " pride of home ownership was evident along tree - lined streets of the neighborhood with two - family flats , large brick bungalows , colonials and ' 50s - style brick ranches . "
It was a Slovakian enclave then , but this I already knew from the boarded - up " Slovak Hall " along Strong street .
The community was served by St. Cyril 's church that stood on this prairie as an epic ruin itself for years before it was demolished in 2003 .
Jane Cooper Elementary was once considered a good school .
But so many questions remain .
When was it built ?
Who was Jane Cooper ?
How many kids passed through its halls from the 1920s until the building was abandoned ?
The only other mentions of the school in the recent press are the accounts of its closing in 2007 .
You read that correctly : the last year of classes at Jane Cooper Elementary was 2006 - 7 .
After that , the cash - strapped Detroit Public Schools shut the school down .
All the damage in the photographs I took occurred in just a little over one year .
I had expected to be overwhelmed by the sense of loss and tragedy for the kids who last walked these halls , the kids whose names remained written on the blackboards , whose graded quizzes and homework and textbooks sat abandoned on the floor .
The kids who made this poster :
But that is an old story , one for the guys bolder and badder than me , the ones who first broke into this place and found the books still stacked neatly in their fine wooden cabinets , the lockers still in the halls , still occupied , perhaps , by forgotten tokens of individual students .
By the time I got here , everything is mixed together .
Everything is on the floor .
Sure , walking around I give some thought thought to the history of the place , to the segregated classes of solidly - middle - class white kids who over time gave way to segregated classes of poor black kids , all within these same halls , in these same classrooms .
I thought about the teachers who taught here , the lifers with careers that spanned decades , the idealists who burned out after only a few years .
I could go on and on with this false nostalgia .
The story I discovered here no longer belongs to the kids , but to those men with minds bent only towards metal .
They came in and took everything of worth .
They left textbooks , workbooks , chalkboards , maps .
Long gone are the lockers , the pipes , the chairs and desks , the electrical wiring , the pencil sharpeners , the metal bookshelves , the aluminum window panes .
Perhaps the most shocking of all was finding the once - lovely central auditorium stripped of its antique seating , the chair bases and backs littering the floor like dragon scales , the metal that held the seats together long ago melted down to feed the world 's ravenous appetite for steel .
It was impossible for me to cross this room without the clatter echoing through the halls like footsteps of an invading army , even though I was quite alone .
There will never be classes here again .
This building , like so many of the students who passed through it , has no hope .
All will be rubble soon .
When I showed these photos to my wife she asked , " Do n't you wonder if any of the scrappers live by some sort of code --- that some of them would n't scrap a school , or take playground equipment out of the ground ? "
She has never been inside any of these buildings .
Anyone who has seen the inside of such a building knows that these are men without honor .
The only code they live by is if I do n't take this , someone else will .
Where I live , men like these are a force of nature , like piranhas in the Amazon ; like locusts on the plains ; like vultures circling above you as you try to make your way across the sands .

15 Magnificent and Monstrous Computer Mice
The mouse : universally used ( trackballs just do n’t mesh that well with Excel ) but there is n’t that much you can do with the things , right ?
Wrong !
You only think that way because you are n’t trying to sell them !
Behold some of the lengths businesses go to to drag - and - drop your cash into their pockets :
1. The CP - 1 Spy Mouse
The perfect peripheral for the paranoid schizophrenic who believes that people are out to snoop through their stuff .
The CP - 1 ’s hidden microphone is perfect for catching anyone in your office area , assuming you have the good fortune to be spied by someone with a habit of talking loudly to themselves while engaged in illicit behavior .
Unfortunately , due to a little thing called “ natural selection ” there are n’t many of those .
And if you were the sort of person actually interesting enough to spy on , you would n’t be the sort of person who fantasizes about James Bond mice .
2. Ring Air Mouse
When is a mouse not a mouse ?
When it ’s just a ring .
Behold the MagicMouse , a wearable USB mouse that does away with chunky “ actual physical object ” aspect and gifts you with an entire extra dimension while it ’s at it .
Yes , this student project is a full 3D device – as well as the usual “ move around the screen ” feature ( which you may have met ) , moving your hand towards or away from the screen will zoom the display – or could be used to control scrollbars , alter fonts or whatever extra level of control your computer - use needs .
If it was a commercial product we ’d have one already .
3. Wiimouse
You knew it had to happen .
Since effectively creating “ hardcore gaming ” ( by suddenly making all the dedicated gamers a subset of a vast new casual market )
Wiimotes have been hacked to control everything from Roombas to dildos .
And “ moving a pointer around a screen ” is a hell of a lot closer to the intended Wiimote function than either of those .
Though perhaps less fun , unless you use it to visit particularly specific websites .
4. Hand Warmer Mouse
Have you ever suffered from a chilly hand while working on those TPS reports ?
Of course not , because nobody has , but Brando clearly imagine that we ’re all slaving away in Dickensian sweatshops where Scrooge supplies our servers but wo n’t pay for lumps of coal .
Which makes this product a little self - defeating – would n’t anyone in such a situation spend twenty - three dollars on a sweater , or basic food and medical supplies instead of a crappily gimmickized mouse ?
Still , it ’s nice to see that the one electrician brave enough to ignore the “ Design electronics so that they DON ’T overheat ” rule got work somewhere .
5. Choikawadeco Mouse
Behold the glory of the Choikawadeco mouse , and be amazed at the fact that it ’s even more unwieldy than its name !
Disco balls are awesome in all sorts of funky ways , but palm - pressing input peripherals is n’t one of them in the same way that tigers are awesome but are n’t great preschool teachers .
We can think of a few things slightly worse to have your hand clamped to for several hours a day but most of them were invented by the Inquisition before electricity existed .
6. USB Mouse Calculator
Prezzybox needs to be investigated by some kind of human rights organization .
They clearly have some kind of idiot / savant chained up in there making products , a demented split mind which can go through the entire process of conceiving of , designing and building a USB calculator mouse without thinking “ Is n’t building a calculator whose only purpose is to connect to a computer kind of useless ? ”
We assume he goes to work in a car with a small skateboard bolted to the steering wheel , after being woken by a wife with a copy of Playboy stapled to her face .
7. Iris Recognition Mouse
Another method of cash - extraction from middle managers who really wish they were secret agents : the iris- scanning mouse .
Despite the sheer level of unnecessarilarity ( hint : so high we had to invent a new word for it ) , and the way unsupported third party hacks demolish the security of a workstation rather than improving it , jamming an iris scanner into a mouse is like inserting a Faberge egg into a hamster .
Pointless , painful , and you ’ll significantly impair the function and quality of both in the process .
8. Mouse Mouse
Oh come on , you knew it had to happen .
At least this guy presents it as a tutorial instead of trying to extract money for his terrible gag .
We would demand an apology on behalf of the English language , but considering this guy was prepared to eviscerate a real actual dead mouse for the sake of some minor wordplay we ’ve decided not to bother him .
Or live in the same city , if we can help it .
9. Steampunk Mouse
To prove that not every mouse - modder is an insane fetishist who works with skinned corpses behold the beauty of the Steampunk mouse .
This anachronistic coolness combines the guts of a nameless modern mouse with a fantastic assortment of brass , cogs , levers and other things whose awesome appearance is only superseded by their anti-ergonomy .
10 . Alien Mouse
Bigger is n’t always better , especially when you ’re talking about small things meant to be easily moved by the weakened wrist of a computer user .
This is proved in spectacular fashion by the Alien Mouse , a megamassive monstrosity that encompasses your entire arm .
This is not a joke .
Your whole entire arm is meant to be embedded in its chain of pads and surfaces – there are spacesuits that are easier to get out of , and when you have to buy a bigger computer desk just to support your mouse then someone somewhere is doing something wrong .
There ’s a fair chance you could tear your limb off if you turn around suddenly in this thing , and the only machine that ’s allowed to do that looks like Arnold Schwarzzeneger .
11 . The Worst Designed Mouse in the World
Behold the Media Player Mouse .
Also know as “ What happens when a 1980s remote control sleeps with a $ 5 mouse , in the dark , after drinking two bottles of absinthe and getting off a double shift working in the Chernobyl clean - up operation ” .
The surface is studded with fantastically unusable buttons , some of which can only be reached if you break some of your knuckles in half while using the mouse .
This mouse has n’t even been in the same building as an actual designer , what with the whole “ letting the gimmick utterly destroy the original point of the device ” : the extra buttons displacing the actual mouse buttons to an unreachable point underneath the connecting wire .
You ’d have better luck controlling your computer by clutching a porcupine , and likely hurt yourself less in the process .
12 . The Antiergonomic Star Mouse
Sent directly through a portal in space from the Dimension of Pain because there ’s no way someone from the hu-man universe thought this was a good idea .
A mouse built entirely of sharp , pointy edges – perhaps some sort of self - flagellating peripheral for guilty catholics to use while surfing porn .
Wolverine could n’t use this without hurting himself .
We would mock it harder , but we fear the angular metal digits the makers must have would rip us to shreds .
13 . Heart Monitor Mouse
The Vit W1 mouse tracks your heart rate as you surf , uploading your pulse data via USB to a tracking application in your PC .
Because God Knows your windows box needs just one more process running in the background .
At this point you should feel free to make your own joke about heart rates and porn images .
14 . Vertical 3 Mouse
Some ideas are just so bolt - from - the - blue inspired that you have to act them immediately , dashing to the drawing board after dropping whatever work / food / lover you happened to be doing at the time .
Then there are the abominations painfully forced out like the consequences of swallowing a bowling ball .
The Vertical 3 mouse is one of the latter .
There ’s no form or function here , no good reason , just the image of a roomful of people in an uninspired electronics firm staring at a mouse thinking “ Dear god in heaven , how can we make it different ?
Even if that makes it hilariously unusable ? ”
15 . The T - 800 of Mice
To make up for the preceding abomination bask in the the glory of this custom - made stainless steel mouse .
A joy to behold and it could likely defend you against up to four Daleks .
The maker insists that it ’s ergonomic , but considering he spent eight months grinding steel to make it we ’ll have to assume that he ’d claim it could cure cancer and file him under “ slightly biased . ”
We will believe that your sense of touch wo n’t feel any pain because it ’s too busy reporting “ this thing is so damn cool ! ” – and even if it does hurt , you ’ll be too scared to complain .

it can be used for both an office space divider and storage closet .

UK Fuss
My friend Mike Hutchinson , in the UK , sent me to this site to see that the UK Advertising Standards Authority [ ASA ] have announced a decision against an advertisement shown on TV that touted the miraculous powers of gems , and offered expensive rings and pendants that would grant these boons to the buyer .
Said the announcer in these ads :
With their mysterious and amazing powers , gems have a great influence on the mind , body and soul of a human who wears them .
They can help in controlling your anger , reducing your stress , increasing your confidence and it also enhances your decision making abilities .
To grow further in life and to achieve what you have always wished for , it is extremely essential that your fate favors you .
For good fortune , and for a favorable effect of all the planets on your fate , Global Sky Shop presents a special product , Global Zodiac Rings and Pendents [ sic ] .
As authentication for these claimed benefits , they offered astrologer Sir Bejaan Daruwala , who declared :
The greatest benefit is your attitude , your perspective .
You should be positive .
You should be confident .
In today 's tough times , you should be mentally strong and balanced and positive .
And the greatest benefit of the gems is they can make you , they can make you very positive .
They can make you quite self - confident and brave .
Look at my hands ?
Tell me , do they tremble ?
They do n't .
Sometimes you hear some people , even nowadays , they talk about evil eye .
They ask me to save them from evil eyes .
Well , whether you believe it or not , people have such notions in their minds .
But with the help of these gems we can be protected from evil eyes .
There are many traders or businessmen who are not too stable .
They are very finicky ; they fail to stick to one thing or one direction .
They are always indecisive about their plans .
They may achieve stability by choosing to wear Global Sky Shop 's Emerald stone .
If such people wear this Opal stone , their power to attract people towards them might increase a hundred times .
There is nothing much to say now if these gems help you then you should buy them ...
Coral stone is red in color .
By wearing the Coral stone , one may experience extra power .
How astrologer Sir Bejaan Daruwala got to be knighted , is a burning question I 'll just have to wonder over ...
The presenter went on to explain that Global Sky Shops Zodiac gems are " made in five metals " - an impossibility - but used the provisional word " may " some 13 times in his dialogue , along with a few uses of " might " and " probably , " thus dimming any notion that a guarantee was being provided .
Also heard several times was the likely - true statement , " results may vary . "
Astrologer Bejaan went on at length extolling the magical powers of the gems , even dropping in the fact that they 'd been placed under a pyramid , which - as we know - will further strengthen their magic .
The ASA decided to dampen the operation .
They noted that the ads said that Global Zodiac Rings and Pendants would control anger , reduce stress , increase confidence and enhance decision - making abilities , bring success , good fortune and happiness in the wearers personal and professional life , protect from evil eyes , form a protective shield all around the wearer and not let negative energies affect the wearer , increase the wearers power to attract others , improve finances , become more intellectual , and become better at organizing , and they questioned whether the expensive trinkets - £ 90.95 [ US $ 140 ] - had , as claimed , electrification effects , power , and energy , just because they 'd been placed under a pyramid .
They also questioned whether the celebrities shown in the ad actually wore the items .
In response , the promoters explained that the ad was intended for broadcast on Asian channels only - as if only Asians would be naïve enough to accept such nonsense - and said they believed most viewers would regard it merely as entertainment .
In fact , a caption stating " These products are for entertainment purposes only " was repeated several times during the broadcast .
Promoters explained that the products were " presented as an aid to positive thinking and in that context the statements were not intended to be taken literally . "
Duh .
The Advertising Standards Authority , in its wisdom , found that the ads for Global Zodiac Rings and Pendants were misleading , were unsupported by evidence , were designed to attract vulnerable viewers , claimed a power to influence the future , and exploited the superstitious .
So there !
And what was their decision ?
First , remember that such nonsense as homeopathy , spiritualism , and " intelligent design " are very popular UK delusions , and they are widely and freely advertised without any substantiation .
In fact , they have been conclusively shown to be farcical .
Bearing that in mind , consider what decision the ASA reached :
We concluded that the ad must not be shown again in its present form and that the product should not be advertised without adequate substantiation for the claims made for it .
Oops !
My mind just boggled again ...
JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - A powerful earthquake struck an area off northern Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Monday , causing a brief tsunami warning and triggering panic among residents in parts of the island .
The magnitude 7.5 quake was at a depth of 21 km , with its epicenter 136 km ( 84 miles ) northwest of the provincial capital of Gorontalo , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
Two further weaker aftershocks struck in the same area of the Celebes Sea bordering the southern Philippines .
Indonesia ’s meteorological agency issued a tsunami warning after the first quake , but later lifted it .
There were no immediate reports of casualties , but a telephone operator in Gorontalo said the quake could be felt strongly in the city .
“ It felt quite big and caused panic , ” the operator told Reuters , adding that the telephone network had been disrupted .
In the town of Poso in central Sulawesi , residents rushed out of their houses and patients were evacuated from a hospital , Metro TV reported .
Residents also fled to higher ground in the Buol area of central Sulawesi after the quake , according to Elshinta radio .
“ We are not expecting anything dangerous but geologists are still monitoring the possible impact , ” said an official at the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology , the country ’s main earthquake watching agency .
Indonesia launched a new hi-tech system on Tuesday aimed at detecting a potential tsunami and providing faster alerts in a region battered by frequent earthquakes , though experts say large parts of the country are still not covered and the system will not be fully operational until 2010 .
The sprawling archipelago of some 17,000 islands , which lies in the seismically - active “ Pacific Ring of Fire , ” was hit by a devastating tsunami four years ago that left an estimated 170,000 people dead or missing in Aceh province .
Remember that $ 250 billion that the government is injecting into wobbly banks so they can start lending to American companies and consumers again ?
Yes ?
Well , of course the banks have no intention of lending out a dime of it .
Merrill 's John
Thain admitted as much two days after the bailout .
Then JP Morgan 's Jamie Dimon dropped hints to that effect by saying he " hoped " the bailout would work -- implying that he did n't think it would .
And now another JP Morgan executive has been kind enough to tell Joe Nocera of the New York Times ( via a recorded internal conference call ) that JP Morgan has no intention of lending the $ 25 billion of taxpayer money the government just gave it to help restore the US economy :
“ Twenty - five billion dollars is obviously going to help the folks who are struggling more than Chase , ” he began .
[ What 's it going to help those struggling folks do ?
Plug the gaping holes in their balance sheets .
But given that the value of their assets is still plunging , they'd be nuts to lend any of it out .
Instead , they 'll hoard it like starving people given boxes full of food .
Meanwhile , what will JP Morgan do ?...]
“ What we do think it will help us do is perhaps be a little bit more active on the acquisition side or opportunistic side for some banks who are still struggling .
And I would not assume that we are done on the acquisition side just because of the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers .
I think there are going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment , and I think we have an opportunity to use that $ 25 billion in that way and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression or what happens in the future , you know , we have that as a backstop . ”
As Joe observes , not a word about lending money .
To reiterate , what will banks do with the $ 250 billion we just gave them ?
hoard it
buy other banks with it .
And , of course , the insurance companies and car companies that now want some of that money also are n't going to lend it , either ( or use it to write new policies or make cars ) .
It 's just a sop to their shareholders and debtholders .
What SHOULD the government do ?
Send its bank regulators into JP Morgan and every other bank it wants to save , audit the asset values , and force the bank to write down the asset values to nuclear winter levels .
THEN inject the taxpayer money ( getting a far bigger piece of the equity in return ) .
This is what has worked historically , and it would eventually work here .
And do n't allow the banks to acquire other banks with cash .
Make them do it with stock , instead .
Then , only then , will the banks begin to lend that cash .
Because they 'll have no other choice but to put it to work .

In unprecedented move , Obama plans meeting with McCain Nick Juliano
Published : Friday November 14 , 2008
Print This Email This After a grueling campaign , former rivals Barack Obama and John McCain will sit down Monday to discuss how they can work together over the next four years in a meeting that virtually unprecedented .
" It 's well known that they share an important belief that Americans want and deserve a more effective and efficient government , and will discuss ways to work together to make that a reality , " Obama - Biden transition spokesperson Stephanie Cutter said in an e-mail .
The meeting will be the first time the president - elect and Arizona senator have spoken since Election Night , a transition aide tells RAW STORY .
The onetime rivals will be joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) , a close confidant of the former Republican presidential candidate , and Rahm Emanuel , Obama 's new chief of staff .
The two have a longstanding relationship and negotiated the terms of this year 's presidential debates .
It 's unclear precisely what the two will discuss , although the two share some priorities .
The president - elect said during the campaign that he wanted to govern in a bipartisan fashion while McCain called for spending reform and an elimination of spending earmarks .
When Obama and McCain sit down together on Monday , it will mark a virtually unprecedented meeting of former presidential rivals .
" I think [ the meeting ] probably is .. a unity sort of move on Obama 's part , " says Frederick Shiels , a professor of political science and history at Mercy College .
" He likes to do unprecedented things , and this is one of them . "
Shiels , who has written several books on the presidency , could not recall any examples of presidential rivals meeting together so soon after an election , except when an incumbent president was defeated .
For example , the first President Bush met with Bill Clinton soon after the 1992 election to facilitate a smooth transition .
President Bush did not sit down with opponents John Kerry or Al Gore after the 2004 and 2000 elections , each of which were fraught with their own complications .
In 2000 , a weeks - long recount and court battle that ended with the Supreme Court cementing Bush 's razor - thin margin in Florida left little room for reconciliation in its wake .
After another close result in 2004 , neither party seemed too interested in bipartisanship .
Bush made no overtures to Kerry following the election , and before the end of November the former Democratic candidate was urging his supporters to keep up the fight against Bush .
" Despite the words of cooperation and moderate - sounding promises , this administration is planning a right - wing assault on values and ideals we hold most deeply , " Kerry wrote in an e-mail that was sent to supporters on Nov. 19 , 2004 .
At the time , Kerry was considering another run for the White House in four years .
McCain , at 72 , has no interest in mounting another run for the presidency .
The Arizona senator has been relatively subdued since Election Day .
His first post-election appearance came this week on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno , where he called Obama " a good and decent person " and defended his vice presidential pick Sarah Palin from anonymous attacks lodged by former advisers .
Conversely , Palin seems to perhaps have not realized that the election is over .
Her remarks to the Republican Governors Association this week mirrored the former VP - candidate 's standard stump speech , and she has kept up the assault on Obama and his associates .
Palin has not been invited to Monday 's sit down .
There are several possible motives behind the Obama - McCain meeting , Shiels said .
It allows Obama to follow through on promises to seek bipartisanship and gives the president - elect a nice public relations boost .
But the meeting also presents the opportunity for Obama to solicit support from someone who could become a key ally in the Senate .
Keep in mind that prior to his run for the presidency this year , McCain proved willing to buck his party on issues like campaign finance reform .
As McCain returns to that maverick role , his support could be key in forging a bipartisan consensus on areas where he and Obama see eye - to - eye .
" There 's an element of razzle dazzle to this on Obama 's part , " Shiels told RAW STORY .
" But I think there 's some substance too . "
The White House pushed back asking the Department of Justice to investigate 200,000 Ohio voters .
Courts set back GOP voter suits
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. —
A Republican legal campaign questioning the legitimacy of many newly registered voters hit a wall this week when courts rejected several cases filed by GOP state parties and officials .
As Democrats registered record numbers of new voters over the recent months , Republicans asked courts to enforce a law intended to prevent fraud , but that voting rights advocates feared could erroneously purge thousands of legitimate voters from the rolls .

But over the last week , several judges ruled against or threw out Republican - filed challenges in battleground states .
Republicans hit back on Friday , when the White House asked the Department of Justice to investigate 200,000 Ohio voters with questionable registrations .
The battles are over a section of the Help American Vote Act , passed in 2002 by Congress to prevent another Florida - style recount .
HAVA requires states to match information supplied on voter registration forms with department of motor vehicles and Social Security records .
Individuals who provide information that does not match those documents may face confusion at the polls or be required to vote on a provisional ballot .
But critics of the provision say inaccurate state databases lead to erroneous disqualifications .
A study by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law found that the matching process fails 20 percent to 30 percent of the time due to minor errors like database typos , use of nicknames , and multiple entries .
“ The general narrative of what ’s going on with a lot of these cases is to attempt to limit the voters to who are participating , ” said Georgetown law professor Jonah Goldman , director of the nonpartisan National Campaign for Fair Elections .
“ The central premise is that more voters help Democrats . ”
Republicans , however , say that the databases are a way to increase security at the polls and stop illegal registrations from becoming fraudulent voters .
“ Make no mistake , HAVA disenfranchises no one and protects the right to vote , ” said Wisconsin Republican State Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen , state chairman of McCain ’s campaign .
“ HAVA checks are an important safeguard — one mandated by Congress and state law — to help make sure those lawful votes are not diluted by unlawful votes . ”
This year , McCain ’s campaign has waged war against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , better known as ACORN , a grass - roots low - income advocacy group that ’s under investigation for possible voter registration fraud .
At the beginning of October , ACORN reported that it registered 1.3 million new voters .
But further investigation found that 30 percent — roughly 400,000 registrations — were faulty in some way , either registered under fake names such Mickey Mouse , were duplicates or were incomplete .
Republicans jumped on the findings , arguing that the group was proof of a systemic voter fraud campaign by the left .
In the last presidential debate , McCain said the group was on “ the verge of maybe perpetrating the greatest fraud in voter history , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy . "
The Obama campaign struck back , with campaign lawyer Bob Bauer asking Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy to investigate the “ systematic development and dissemination of unsupported , spurious allegations of voter fraud ” by the McCain campaign , the Republican National Committee , and also any possible involvement by the Justice Department and White House officials .
But faulty registrations rarely turn into illegal votes .
While ACORN has admitted to errors in its registration process , documented cases of illegally cast ballots remain rare .
A five - year investigation by the Bush administration resulted in the convictions of only 26 voters found guilty of voting more than once , registration fraud , or ineligible voting .
“ This is not a plan that was hatched yesterday , ” said Daniel Tokaji , an election law specialist at Ohio State University Moritz College of Law .
“ The Republican party is using the whole ACORN rap as a justification for the stringent ballot security measures they are urging . ”
Over the past week , courts threw out several cases challenging the implementation of the match requirements .
On Wednesday , Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner told county boards of elections that they could not challenge voters on Election Day or reject absentee ballots based solely on a mismatch with the state databases .
The Ohio Republican party had sued Brunner , a Democrat , to force her to provide county election boards with the names of nearly 200,000 newly registered voters whose information did not match state databases .
Last week , the Supreme Court found that the party had no right to sue , effectively backing Brunner 's position .
A few hours after the decision , Republican fundraiser David Myhal filed nearly the same suit in state court .
Van Hollen filed a similar suit in Wisconsin , asking a state judge to force the bipartisan board of elections to retroactively check the information of everyone who registered to vote from January 2006 to August 2008 .
Wisconsin election officials admit that their database incorrectly flags voters at least 20 percent of the time .
When the six members of the state elections board , all retired judges , ran their own registrations through the system , four were incorrectly rejected .
Dane County Circuit Judge Maryann
Sumi threw out the case on Thursday , ruling that Van Hollen had no standing to sue under either federal or state law .
The Wisconsin Department of Justice plans to appeal the ruling .
And in Indiana , the chairman of the county Republican Central Committee and a member of the county Board of Elections sued to shut down three early - voting centers in Democratic stronghold Lake County that were not unanimously approved by the board .
They argued that in - person absentee voting could contribute to voter fraud .
On Wednesday , a Lake county superior court judge ordered the sites to remain open .
The Republican party appealed the ruling , which is set to go before the state court of appeals next Thursday .
In Montana , a state GOP official challenged nearly 6,000 voters living in Democratic strongholds who filed change of address forms with the U.S. Postal Service .
Registrations must contain current addresses .
After the Montana Democratic Party filed a federal lawsuit challenging the request , the state party backed down .
In Michigan , the Democratic National Committee and the Obama campaign sued the Michigan and Macomb County Republican parties after learning of an alleged Republican plan to use foreclosure filings to keep some residents who've failed to update their address from voting .
The suit settled last week and the information will not be used .
At least one case , in Georgia , is still outstanding .
On Wednesday , civil rights lawyers and state attorneys were unable to reach a compromise over the state ’s matching program after Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel , a Republican , made nearly 2 million requests to Social Security to verify voter identities , far more than have been made in any other state .
A coalition of voting rights group called the checks a “ systematic purging ” and sued to halt the use of the database matching program .
Democrats have suffered on notable loss , in Florida , where The Brennan Center and other voting rights advocates had challenged the state requirement that the driver 's license or Social Security number on a registration form must be verified for a voter to register .
They lost in federal court and Florida Secretary of State Kurt Browning began enforcing the law in early September .
Since then , the state has rejected almost 9,000 new registrations , according to state records .
Democrats were four times more likely to be caught by the law and minorities accounted for more than half of the rejected voters .
“ I ’m hoping one candidate or another is so far ahead that we do n’t care , ” said Rick Hasen , an election law expert at Loyola Law School .
“ But we are going to be in deep trouble if we have a razor thin election and have to turn to provisional ballots . ”
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - A group of Japanese lawyers and professors asked on Friday that Google Inc stop providing detailed street - level images of Japanese cities on the Internet , saying they violated privacy rights .

Google ’s Street View offers ground - level , 360 - degree views of streets in 12 Japanese cities and is also offered for some 50 cities in the United States and certain areas in Europe .
The service allows Web users to drive down a street , in a virtual sense , using their mouse to adjust views of roadside scenery .
“ We strongly suspect that what Google has been doing deeply violates a basic right that humans have , ” Yasuhiko Tajima , a professor of constitutional law at Sophia University in Tokyo , told Reuters by telephone .
“ It is necessary to warn society that an IT giant is openly violating privacy rights , which are important rights that the citizens have , through this service . ”
The Campaign Against Surveillance Society , a Japanese civilian group that Tajima heads , wants Google to stop providing its Street View service of Japanese cities and delete all saved images .
Google ’s office in Tokyo was unable to comment immediately .
Privacy concerns about Google ’s service have grown in Japanese media , especially after some people discovered their images on Street View .
Similar concerns have been raised in other parts of the world , including the United States and Europe .
In one case , a woman was shown sunbathing and in another a man was pictured exiting a strip club in San Francisco .
In March , Google said it would comply with a Pentagon request to remove some online images from Street View over fears they posed a security threat to U.S. military bases .
Web - based Google Maps and a related computer - based service called Google Earth have drawn criticism from a variety of countries for providing images of sensitive locations , such as military bases or potential targets of terror attacks .

If she please not her master , who hath espoused her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed ; to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .

10 Worst High Speed Crashes Ever
Wherever there are wide open roads , there will always be drivers trying to push the limits of their cars .
Many have no professional driving experience .
When you combine that with a high - performance vehicle , you often end up with spectacular crashes .
We 've compiled a list of top 10 highest speed crashes on open roads .
We hope you keep these in mind next time you have the urge to speed .
130 MPH # 10 .
Ferrari 360 Modena

There 's a growing clamor on the LittleBigPlanet forums about level ' moderation ' - if by ' moderation ' one means ' summary deletion . '
Without warning .
It does n't have to involve penis innuendo creations or anything blatantly offensive , either .
Just create a level that references anyone else 's IP , and you 're at risk of losing all your work on the spot .
Considering some people are spending standard workdays on these things , keep that in mind before you plunge into your Metal Gear Solid tribute .

Reader Robbie M. angrily wrote us after his level was taken down .
" So many cases have no questionable content in sight , even ones with humorous light hearted violence have been taken down , like the popular GoW Demon Skull level , " he said .
" Whats the point of having a community driven game if you 're not going to let your community do anything with it in an act to try and please everybody ? "

It 's not a case of removing the offending content and republishing the level .
One 's it 's taken down , it 's gone for good .
One user posted a strategy for keeping a copy of a level offline and republishing it in case it gets deleted .
But Robbie says there are instances of unpublished levels getting " moderated " too .
" I 've never been so infuriated over a game , " he says .
Traffic on the LittleBigWorkshop discussion board seems to back him up .
" This just happened to tons of levels in what seems like a matter of minutes , including my own level ' Failure To Launch . ' "
Says one user .
" By the trend I see from the levels I can no longer play from my recent levels on my planet , its all about copyright .
Some levels I 've seen now unplayable due to moderation : Pacman , Batman , and Scrubs related level . "
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
If " Failure to Launch " was taken down because it shares a title with a romantic comedy from 2006 , then this is truly out of hand .
The thread is more than nine pages long now , including a claim that a level based on the PlayStation 3 was taken down .
Destructoid rightly points out the absurdity of a console exclusive being unable to refer to that console .
Seriously , what on earth did Sony and Media Molecule think would happen here ?
One of the first things you see in any decent game with a custom level editor is someone 's homage to Super Mario Bros. , to the point that it 's become cliche .
I understand that those levels are not hosted online , and that 's probably what the lawyer - mans told them created risk of exposure to a lawsuit .
But your freedom to create absolutely is n't as open - ended as they 've implied .
And this creates a huge chilling effect on user - created content for the game that was supposed to set a new standard for it .

My Level has Been Moderated and I Don't Know Why [ LittleBigWorkshop Forum , thanks Robbie ]

The Economistmagazine , a bastion of free - market economics , gave its support today to Democrat Barack Obama to be the next US president .
With a front cover depicting a thoughtful Mr Obama beneath the words " It 's time " , the 165 - year old British publication said it wholeheartedly endorsed Mr Obama .
" In terms of painting a brighter future for America and the world , Mr. Obama has produced the more compelling and detailed portrait .
He has campaigned with more style , intelligence and discipline than his opponent , " it said .
" Mr Obama deserves the presidency , " said the London - based weekly , which has a substanial readership in the United States .
The Economist backed current US President George W Bush , a Republican , in the 2000 election and his unsuccessful Democratic challenger John Kerry in 2004 .
In 2000 , the United States was an undisputed superpower , the magazine said .
The main issue was what to do with the government 's huge budget surplus .
" When Americans go to the polls next week the mood will be very different .
The United States is unhappy , divided and foundering both at home and abroad .
Its self - belief and values are under attack . "
Despite some risk from inexperience , Mr Obama had clearly shown that he offered the best chance of restoring the United States ' self - confidence , the Economist said .
Noting that Obama would be the first black US president if he defeats Republican candidate John McCain in next Tuesday 's vote , the Economist said : " He would salve , if not close , the ugly racial wound left by America 's history and lessen the tendency of American blacks to blame all their problems on racism . "
A group that tracks every ball hit in the majors says Derek Jeter is the worst fielder in baseball .
Stats guru Bill James , author of the “ Baseball Abstract , ” and a panel of nine other voters , ranked Jeter 22nd among all major - league shortstops , with one calling Jeter “ the least effective defensive player in the major leagues , at any position . ”
Jeter received one 10th - place vote in balloting for the 2008 Fielding Bible Awards , announced yesterday .
One panel member comes from Baseball Info Solutions ( BIS ) , a group that … well , just say they do their research .
“ They watched film of every major - league game , and had recorded every ball off the bat by the direction in which it was hit [ the vector ] , the type of hit [ groundball , flyball , line - drive , popup , etc. ] and by how hard the ball was hit [ softly hit , medium , hard hit ] , ” according to James .
In an earlier article that appears on James ’ Fielding Bible Web site , BIS ripped Jeter .
“ They had analyzed the outcomes to determine who was best at turning hit balls into outs , ” James wrote .
“ One of their conclusions was that Jeter was probably the least effective defensive player in the major leagues , at any position . ”
On this year ’s list , Mets hater and World Series champion Jimmy Rollins topped the list of shortstops , followed by the Brewers ’ J.J. Hardy , the Braves ’ Yunel Escobar , the Angels ’ Erick Aybar , the Pirates ’ Jack Wilson , the White Sox ’ Orlando Cabrera , the Cardinals ’ Cesar Iztruis , the Rockies ’ Troy Tulowitzki , the Giants ’ Omar Vizquel and the Mets ’ Jose Reyes .
With the exception of Vizquel , who has 11 Gold Gloves , the rest of the group has four combined – one more than the apparently defensively challenged Jeter .
Jeter is no stranger to statistically questioned fielding .
A Penn University study released in February found Jeter to be the worst shortstop in the majors .
“ Maybe it was a computer glitch , ” Jeter told The Post during spring training .
“ Every [ shortstop ] does n’t stay in the same spot , every one does n’t have the same pitching .
Every one does n’t have the same hitters running .
It ’s impossible to do that . ”
Carlos Beltran was the only New York player to take the top spot at his position , finishing tops among center fielders .

Arming Yourself for the Future

I was sad to see that AmmoMan.com , the best place on earth in my humble opinion to get ammo for the past several years , increased its prices 25 % basically overnight Tuesday .
AmmoMan is not alone as the news today was filled with stories about gun stores across the country running out of weapons and ammunition .
The reason is obvious .
What was about $ 200 per case of 1,000 rounds Monday is now $ 249 .
I only checked the 7.62 stock but my friends tell me the higher prices are uniform elsewhere on all ammunition .
I looked up the prices on some small pistol reloading primers I am selling on GunBroker.com right now and I was shocked to see that many mail - order companies are currently " Out of Stock " on them .
I woke up Wednesday morning without any more of a worry than I had when I awoke Tuesday morning .
Was the election a death - knell for America ?
Well yes in many ways it was death for many things due to changes that will surely come , but as Becky Akers said so well , the sun still came up .
Some eyes will be opened .
Things will be worse than some predict and better than others predict .
A price will be paid by all of us .
I just wish it was n’t the price of ammunition .
Do n’t Panic !
Arthur Dent did not heed those words as often as he should have but if you want to be a good steward of your family ’s resources as I want to be , then Do n’t Panic .
No matter bad it will or will not get , the problems will not come for us in any immediate way .
Certainly not so much so that we should accept a 25 % hit on ammo .
The price increase may be greater as the next few days roll on .
Here was the message atop the AmmoMan.com website today :
AMMOMAN.COM WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY NEW ORDERS FOR A DAY OR TWO WE ARE 2000 ORDERS BEHIND AND NEED TO CATCH UP WE WILL NOT BE TAKING PHONE OR FAX ORDERS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE PHONES IT MAY TAKE UP TO 3 DAYS OR MORE TO ANSWER YOUR E-MAILS PLEASE BE PATIENT AND WE WILL BE WORKING SATURDAY AND SUNDAY TO CATCH UP WE WERE GETTING UP TO 800 ORDERS A DAY AND THAT’S JUST TOO MUCH FOR US THANKS FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING
If you live in a relatively free state that allows gun shows — and if you do n’t , then why do n’t you ? — you should attend any and all shows the next few weeks to look for better prices on ammunition if you ’re of the mindset that you should stock up now while you still can legally .
What Changed ?
Absolutely nothing has changed for the immediate time frame .
This is what is happening all across the country : ammo sales are skyrocketing .
Just as Clinton ’s election was healthy for the gun industry , Barry ’s election will be even healthier given the death and pestilence many see him bringing to America .
Right now , weapon distributors are having a great Christmas .
Ammo outlets are right now trying to restock with massive supplies of ammunition .
Their current big initial orders will die down once the initial shock for all of those blind Americans who actually thought Barry would not win is past .
My conclusion is this : ammo dealers will soon have massive stockpiles they cannot keep selling in the quantities these are selling this week .
Prices will be back to $ 200 per thousand ( for 7.62×39 ) or whatever you were accustomed to last week for your sought - after caliber very soon .
What Do You Do ?
If I am wrong , then prices will go up .
Your risk should not depend on what I say but how you perceive the situation .
Although I am focused on ammo right now , many of you are focused on weapons .
As ammo goes , so goes the weapons that shoot ammo .
I ’m going to wait it out some before adding to my ammunition supply .
I think prices will soften and soften quickly .
Prices will surely go back up again when Barry is sworn in but the rise will probably not be as dramatic as this week ’s rise and prices will probably go back down quickly to more normal levels .
I am not a prophet !
Still , as I ’m telling you here I predict prices will go back down … for a while .
Then they will go up for good until some unforeseeable change .
Will things get so bad that prices go through roof after he is sworn in ?
Of course .
Will the Democrat Communists in the Senate put a 4,000 % tax on ammo sales ?
You know the answer to that as well as I do ; they sure want to .
Therefore , it is incumbent upon you to buy what you think you will need for the coming reckoning .
But I suggest you do not rush into the current frenzy to pay today ’s prices .
I believe the market will pressure these prices down before prices finally go back up again perhaps forever .
But How Much Ammo Do I Need Anyway ?
You need exactly one case more than you currently have .
That is always the answer for everybody in all times no matter what your current supply is by the way .
Good Days Ahead – Perhaps 30 to 60 of them Only Though , And Not All At Once …
I think we will see windows of good price opportunity when ammo suppliers see this current rush dwindle and they see their re-orders come in by the truckloads .
If you worry about today ’s ammo prices , stay on top of ammo web sites daily to catch the deals when they have to unload this extra supply .
My conclusion of lower prices ahead is based on the laws of supply - and - demand , which are almost as reliable as the law of gravity .
This is why I believe these current high prices are unsustainable .
I am open to correction if you see this situation differently .
If you think there is no turning back and that we need to buy ammo now no matter what the price I ’m open to hearing what you have to say .
But we are seeing worldwide commodity prices drop dramatically as the world economies are destroyed one by one by bail - out programs wrought by the Democrat Communists and Republican Communists ( basically all but about one in Congress today ) , and their equivalents around the world .
I would love to hear if you think prices are the best today they will get in many years ahead and that they will never get better in the foreseeable future .
But please give your reasonings ; I have it on Good authority that iron sharpens iron .
