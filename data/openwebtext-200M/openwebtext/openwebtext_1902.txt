June 11 , 2007  -- " Free porn " just might be the two most exciting or frightening words in the English language , depending on your point of view .
And they 're especially threatening to the adult film industry , which has made billions through the sales of DVDs , videos , and sex products .
After two decades of phenomenal growth in profits , the porn industry is facing some major challenges as its X - rated DVDs and Internet content lose out to free videos and photos distributed by amateurs on the Web .
Sales and rentals of adult DVDs fell 30 percent in the last two years and sales of Internet - based porn , while still growing , have started to plateau , according to Adult Video News , an industry trade publication .
" The DVD market is a battle that we 're losing , " says Drew Rosenfeld , the creative director of Hustler Video Group .
" Looking back historically , we 're at less than half in numbers .
Even a line like Barely Legal , which is our hero brand , used to be off the charts and it's gone down to a third of what it used to be a few years ago . "
But pornographers will keep trying to adopt changes and hoping to make a buck .
" I do n't really think that there is less money to be made because of free content , " says Drew Rosenfeld , the creative director of Hustler Video Group .
" We 're making important changes , from hard DVDs to video on demand and we 're focusing a lot of production for Internet purposes first .
In the past , we 've put it online 90 - 100 days after we sell it on DVD .
Now we 're shooting it for the Web , which is less expensive for us and the consumer . "
Longtime observers of the industry are more pessimistic about its prospects .
" Why buy it when you can get it for free on the Internet , " says Luke Ford , an industry gossip columnist , comparing pornography to the plight of newspapers losing readers to the Web .
" There is less and less reason to pay for porn because there are plenty of free two to three - minute clips out there . "
Although many of the big companies , such as Vivid Video and Wicked Pictures , offer free clips to entice viewers to buy the full movie online , Ford claims that only one in a thousand viewers actually whip out their wallets .
Ford thinks that some of the changes planned by the industry , such as video - on - demand , higher - quality design of the DVD boxes and mobile phone cybersex , will not make any difference to their sagging profits .
" It does n't matter what the industry does -- it 's screwed in terms of profitability , " he say .
" There is a ton of free stuff floating around and the amateur stuff -- people filming themselves in their bedrooms and posting it online -- is not going to go away .
It will just keep growing . "
One of the entrepreneurs taking advantage of those changes is Steve Yagielowicz , a columnist for industry newsletter Xbiz and a porn Webmaster .
He runs several Web sites with free content , including Amateurs Guide , which features free thumbnail photos and movie galleries of amateur porn video .
Yagielowicz earns money by driving traffic to his wife 's amateur site , which features paid content .
And as an affiliate of larger porn producers , he earns commissions by featuring their content on his site .
" There must be 50,000 affiliates out there , " explains Yagielowicz .
" They get free content , usually free hosted galleries or 15 - second teaser clips , from Vivid or another big company and post it on their site .
And if someone likes that gallery and they click through and join the Vivid Web site , the affiliate gets a cut . "
And some in the industry are borrowing methods from Wall Street .
Francis Koenig , who once ran the New World Partners hedge fund , launched AdultVest last year .
The hedge fund specializes in matching investors with adult entertainment companies .
" We are making a market where there was none before , " says Alan Ramer , the fund 's director of business development .
Investors who qualify ( earn an annual income of $ 200,000 a year , have a combined household income of $ 350,000 a year and have a net worth of $ 1 million ) can put their money into several funds .
The Libor Fund , which launches next month , will specialize in financing adult clubs .
" This is a new model -- to promote a market in the adult industry that was n't there before . "
Porn has almost always been at the forefront of technology , adopting video , DVDs , the Internet , e-commerce , online payment , and digital TV long before the mainstream entertainment world .
But as the supply of X - rated content keeps increasing , the demand for free and inexpensive porn will keep growing , rendering the industry less able to charge for its products .
One technology that some in the industry are banking on is mobile cybersex , pornographic clips to be viewed on cellphones .
Industry estimates project the U.S. market will reach between $ 500 million and $ 1.5 billion by 2009 .
And researchers have noted that the increased privacy of cell phones compared to computers could benefit the popularity of adult content .
" Anecdotally , we have observed that users often consider their cell phone as a very personal and private device ; perhaps even moreso than their computer -- the probability of others discovering their search behavior ( through cached pages , auto - completion of query terms or URLs ) is smaller , " wrote Maryam Kamvar and Shumeet Baluja , computer science professors affiliated with Google .
But many industry veterans do n't hold out much hope for mobile cybersex , arguing that the screen is too small and that major carriers are unwilling to carry adult content .
Hustler 's Rosenfeld is also skeptical .
Although he says he was just given an order to start creating content for mobile phones , he does n't believe it will be profitable any time soon .
" None of that is being broadcast in the U.S. and it's only softcore right now — naked girls dancing , " he says .
" The big carriers here are n't willing to broadcast that kind of content . "
It has been to our attention that the longest bike in the world , officialy registered by Guiness record book is from Russia .
It ’s creator Oleg “ Leshij ” Rogov was from Tver city , a small town near Moscow city .
He was a big biker fan since his childhood .
One day he has got an idea to build the longest bike in the world , according to his own story “ probably after he got too much beer inside ” .
So after two years of planning and delaying he did it .
He built the bike that was 31 feet 4 inches long ( 9 metres 57 cm ) .
After the thing was ready he sent his claim to the Guiness book and got registered as longest bike in the world .
The saddest part of the story is that he got into accident and died this summer , still we have the photos of his creation , it would be some kind of tribute to him .
R.I.P. Mr “ Leshij ” !
I just released version 0.1 of FileManip , a Haskell library I put together to make it easier to futz about with files in the filesystem .
There are a few different components to the package .
The Find module lets you search the filesystem for files , after the manner of the Unix find program .
It provides a nice embedded language for building filters and controlling recursion , so you can write readable expressions like this :
find always ( fileType == ? RegularFile &&? extension ==? " .hs " ) " myPath "
This will return a list of all Haskell source files under myPath .
The list is built lazily , so if you have a million files in your tree , but you only examine the first ten elements of the list , no extra work is done .
The obvious counterparts to the Find module in other languages would be Perl ’s File : : Find module , and Python ’s os . walk function .
The Manip module provides some handy functions for manipulating files .
For example , renameWith provides procedural renaming : given a file name , it applies a function to it , then renames the file to that name .
Here ’s how you might use it to change your naming convention for C++ source files :
find always ( extension == ? " .cpp " ) >>= mapM_ ( renameWith ( replaceExtension " C " ) )
The modifyInPlace and modifyWithBackup functions edit a file in place ( the latter saves the original copy to a procedurally - renamed backup file ) , so that you can more easily write sed - like expressions :
modifyInPlace ( map toUpper ) " shouting.txt "
Least interesting , but nonetheless useful , is GlobPattern , a glob pattern matching module .
I wrote this because Haskell does n’t provide a standard one , and the only other one I know of ( in the MissingH library ) goes through the regexp machinery .
Ew .
Online docs are published here .
The source tarball is available here , at HackageDB , the Haskell package database .
There ’s also a Darcs repository available here :

Comments to blogs [ Jul. 3rd , 2005 | 07:22 pm ]
Ulrich Drepper
Why does n't livejournal provide a mechanism to permanently disable comments to blog entries ?
Why is it an option at all here and in other places ?
I think comments are a fatal flaw in the system of blogs .
Why do people use blogs and RSS enabled " story " delivery as opposed to email and email lists ?
For some people there certainly is the " where else " reason .
But in general , and this is certainly the reason for me , the main reason is that blogs are not email .
They are pull - based , not push - based .
People select to get information from sources they specify since they trust them .
And then there are comments to blogs .
Suddenly people are once again fed information they did n't request .
This does n't only mean spammers mechanically adding comments with unrelated messages .
Equally unwanted are comments about the blog they are attached to .
The trust associated with the blog is not transitively associated with the comments .
It is possible for the blog author to remove comments but then there is the outcry of the " censored " .
And beside , who has the time to constantly monitor the comments posted to one 's blog ?
If somebody wants to associate a comment with a blog , let them write their own blog entry and have it reference .
What is then needed is to use a blog search engine to locate blogs referencing other blogs ( there are a few ) .
But this does n't solve all problems .
There is the matter of trust .
What would be needed is to instrument the search engine with a private trust matrix which is used to sort the results .
This will allow people to find the comments of the people they trust first .
If they are interested , people can then look at the other comments from people who they do not trust ( yet ) .
If the comments are OK the trust matrix can be extended .
I fear this is a bit beyond what is currently implemented .
It should n't be a problem , technique - wise .
This is what personalized search is all about .
What is needed is a way to represent the trust matrix in a compact form .
Or have the results of a general search post - processed on the local machine .
This is possible today with code like Outfoxed .
There is still hope to make blogs useful and ( public ) email lists obsolete .
Even though his supposed fund - raising acumen was used to justify his ballooning salary , the chief executive of the Smithsonian Institution raised less private money for the museum complex last year than his predecessor did in 1999 , an independent committee said in a scathing report issued today .
Salary and other compensation for the executive , Lawrence M. Small , whose formal title was Smithsonian secretary , soared from $ 536,000 in 2000 to $ 915,000 in 2006 , the report said .
But ultimately , it added , the institution became more dependent on taxpayer funds and obtained less of its budget from private donations during his tenure .
Mr. Small resigned in March amid growing controversy over his lavish expense - account spending .
From 2000 to 2006 , the report said , he also took 70 weeks of vacation — nearly 10 weeks a year — and spent 64 business days serving on corporate boards that paid him a total of $ 5.7 million .
Rather than rein him in , the Smithsonian ’s Board of Regents stood by passively , the document said , and allowed him to spend the institution ’s money profusely on personal expenses and treat the board as irrelevant to decision - making .
If the war is grave
and deteriorating .

Discrediting By Association :
Undermining the Case
for
Patriots Who Question 9/11 by
Victoria Ashley
Version 1.2 , August 13 , 2007
revision history
8/2/07 : 911 Research publishes Version 1.0 of this essay
8/5/07 : 911 Research publishes Version 1.1 of this essay
8/13/07 : 911 Research publishes Version 1.2 of this essay
The website Patriots Question911.com makes a strong case for the important fact that hundreds of notable , credible , professional , and experienced people have serious questions about the official story of the 9/11 attacks .
These include government officials , scholars , household - name actors , retired military officers , pilots , and even 9/11 family members , shown in rich color photographs and paired with quotes in their own words along with relevant links .
Creator Alan Miller and others helping him have done a laudable job of tracking down and documenting these hundreds of individuals of note and presenting them in an appealing format for easy public understanding of the scope of concerns with the official story .
Unfortunately , the site currently also functions in a different and opposite way , albeit subtle .
By presenting , directly alongside the serious and professional notable individuals , the advocates of ridiculous nonsense claims about the 9/11 attacks -- space weapons , nukes , " TV fakery " and even holograms -- the website functions to undermine a serious reader 's overall belief that the site , the community , and the individuals are actually as credible as their titles suggest .
This is not an extensive criticism of the site , but a specific concern which can easily be corrected , but yet has not been .
Currently , individuals like Norman Mineta , Curt Weldon , Daniel Ellsberg and Richard Heinberg are placed on the same lists with Morgan Reynolds , David Shayler , Judy Wood and James Fetzer .
Given the history of these individuals in the 9/11 community , such mixing serves the opposite purpose of the ostensible premise of the site .
If one actually clicks on the links of these last four individuals , listens to the talks , or reads the material , there is no question that mixed with the real claims , the bizarre core of what they are advocating amounts to utter nonsense .
If the reader is not already aware , here 's what they have presented to key audiences :
On the day before the 5th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , Morgan Reynolds explained to a FOX News audience of millions :
" there are no big Boeing crashes . . . at all four events . . . what you will see is a fake , cartoon display . . . "
David Shayler explained to reporters at The Times , The Liverpool Echo , and in public appearances recorded on video , that the Trade Center jetliner crashes where faked using " missiles wrapped in holograms " , and that :
" ' . . . there is little evidence to show that jets went into the buildings . . .
Watch the footage frame by frame and you will see a cigar - shaped missile hitting the World Trade Centre . ' "
Judy
Wood sent in her theory directly to NIST in the form of a legal document that energy weapons from space caused the destruction of the WTC Towers :
" I assert that NIST contractors , as listed in NCSTAR 1 , including by way of non-exhaustive example , those listed below , either knew or should have known of the falsity of NCSTAR 1 as it relates to the use of directed energy weapons . "
Jim Fetzer is the primary force behind publicity and press releases for the claims of Judy Wood and Morgan Reynolds , advocating endless investigation into every possible scenario imaginable .
" . . . once [ Fetzer ] had become convinced that thermite / thermate could not explain the extent and character of the destruction , he began encouraging investigation of alternative hypotheses , including lasers , masers , and plasmoids . "
Yet , surprisingly , PatriotsQuestion911.com displays these people to the public as though they are serious professionals .
Morgan Reynolds , for example , is presented with a glowing vitae of career accomplishments suggesting rock solid credibility , even though one click on a link provided brings a reader to questions about what " objects " hit the WTC Towers , and essays ridiculing Prof.
Steven Jones , even calling him " retarded . "
Worse , perhaps , is the impact on 9/11 activists - the inclusion of these individuals without pause misrepresents them to new 9/11 activists who will naturally assume that these must be serious individuals .
They will promote them to others , link to them on their myspace and facebook pages , in their forum postings and via their email lists .
Eventually , ideas featured by these individuals -- such as that real commercial jets never hit the WTC -- can outrank sober analysis exposing the core of the crime in search engine returns , persuading even people skeptical of the mainstream media 's objectivity that the 9/11 " conspiracy theorists " are indeed all nuts .
In this way , Patriots Question911.com displays a classic example of discrediting by association -- the bundling of those asserting extreme nonsense claims , with those making genuine , serious , and undeniable claims .
The only ones to benefit from such bundling are those with an interest in the crime remaining covered up , unsolved and providing a rationale for endless war .
Table of Contents
Discrediting By Association Requires Denial to Flourish
The typical reaction of 9/11 activists to such a mixing of hoax and rational theories is to deny the relevance of the issue and to downplay any problems .
Phrases one typically hears are :
" Well , those are just a few people among many , so it can't really hurt that much . "
" But everything else they say is great ! "
" I do n't think it 's a big deal if they are n't 100 % perfect . "
These are natural first responses -- minimization of the problem -- and not surprisingly , discrediting by association depends on this response to continue to be effective .
As long as people are pretending it 's okay to say that holograms hit the WTC , the hoaxes remain alive , gain higher search engine ranking , and spread far and wide .
And by downplaying the absurdity of the idea that holograms were used as being merely a simple mistake , or just one small issue , the hoax promoters remain protected and unmolested by critique .
Interestingly , if one closely examines these ideas , the level of the absurdity becomes abundantly clear and denying the relevance becomes more difficult .
For example , if one considers which people we know personally ( not on the internet ) who seriously believe that holograms were involved in the attacks , we usually cannot think of a single person .
Sometimes a person will show up at local activist meetings who advocates these ideas , but more often than not they are also dysfunctional individuals who tend to disrupt the group at the expense of organizing , or are also presenting anti-social positions to the group , such as advocating racist ideas .
The harsh reality that most activists discover too late is that nonsense advocates are not including nonsense as a subtle aside , or as an occasional mention , or even by mistake most of the time -- instead , typically , they are continuously promoting the hoax ideas front and center from their own websites , at large conferences , in emails , on forums , and via the mainstream media .
And no matter how much discussion or debate they engage in , they never waver from their positions .
A common automatic response by those who see through the absurdity of the situation is a good remedy to denial :
" If he believes this he is insane .
Clearly he is not insane . "
This is the simple truth of many of the situations in which a sane , intelligent , social person claims to believe virtual lunacy around the events of 9/11 .
Depositing Misinformation Requires an Entrance Fee
In order to be accepted into an activist group with ideas such as hologram - wrapped missiles , one must typically also possess something which grassroots activists are in need of - important titles , inside information , unique technical abilities , etc .
This is nothing unique to the 9/11 truth movement and is common sense .
Indeed , they may even have unique , important and genuine information ready to hand over in order to gain their credibility as an asset .
This contradiction keeps activists in a quandary -- they are forced to consider if it's a worthwhile trade - off to have just a little bit of nonsense mixed in with the benefits this person offers , like social connections , titles , or insider knowledge .
It is important to note that falling for mis- or dis-information is not a sign of weakness or a failing , but is actually part of a natural human sense of fairness , compassion , and flexibility .
Most false claims depend on these admirable qualities to spread .
And more than likely , most sincere people working hard to spread truth have been taken in by hype at one time or another before looking into the details .
Some prominent advocates of false claims may themselves have been duped or manipulated , or simply do n't have the ability to critically evaluate the evidence .
Regardless , claims which have been widely and publicly rejected by the vast majority of the 9/11 truth community , and which have gained no support via the evidence in the six years since 9/11 , should never be presented to reporters in the mainstream press , NIST , or any other public body .
Yet this has happened , repeatedly .
An even more significant problem , however , is when errors are never acknowledged and the necessary corrections are never made .
Unfortunately , PatriotsQuestion911.com currently falls into this category .
Despite numerous requests by individuals to remove the hoax promoters Reynolds , Shayler , Wood , and Fetzer -- including requests by individuals invited to be on the site who have then declined because of the inclusion of these people -- the advocates of nonsense are never removed from the site .
Having experienced the reactions of many scholars members who were angered by the split of the scholars group and were then confronted with James Fetzer 's ideas -- his ongoing support via links and stories and press releases to Reynolds , Wood , Rick Siegel , etc. -- this writer can report that , by far , virtually every single person rejects such a group .
The fact that a prominent website like Patriots Question911.com does not reject the hoaxes at all should be a concern to all activists who care about the basic credibility of the movement .
Self - Serving Leadership
When activists in leadership positions make baseless claims directly to mainstream media , government bodies and large audiences , they are not functioning as leaders , but in a manner more like false prophets or well paid politicians .
Sometimes sincere leaders make mistakes .
But if mistakes are never acknowledged and corrected , permanent damage can be done .
Those " leaders " who repeatedly and irresponsibly recommend the least substantiated claims directly to mainstream media , with full knowledge that these views do not represent the views of the people they claim to lead , they are obviously not interested in actual representative leadership , but in representing only their own beliefs .
Given that no scientific evidence supports the idea that real planes did not hit the WTC towers , that holograms were used , that directed energy beams destroyed the WTC towers , or that nuclear weapons were used on 9/11/01 , the question remains , how could supposedly highly eloquent people in leadership positions who have been employed in distinguished government jobs for decades , now be making such claims ?
Additionally , these are not simply extraordinary claims -- after all , the idea of controlled demolition of the towers seems extraordinary -- but these are also claims lacking any of the necessary evidence .
This is in stark contrast to the diverse , abundant , redundant , and measurable evidence that supports the theory of controlled demolition .
Apart from the issue of discrediting serious efforts to expose the crimes , there is the issue of wasting people 's time : many researchers and scientists have felt compelled to spend large amounts of time refuting these unscientific claims in efforts to distance the movement from them .
Yet websites like Patriots Question911.com are working against these researchers and scientists by presenting them alongside proponents of unscientific claims and failing to acknowledge work refuting those claims .
PatriotsQuestion911.com claims not to know which theories are true except by relying on experts :
I do n't claim to know what really happened on 9/11 .
I cannot examine the facts of the matter first hand .
And I do n't have the experience to know what 's possible and what is unlikely regarding terrorist activities or military operations .
For that analysis , I need to rely on experts .
Since PatriotsQuestion911.com 's featured experts include promoters of bizzarre claims that are easily proved false , it -- and other websites that similarly feature such experts -- are effectively promoting hoaxes , regardless of personal statements claiming not to have an opinion .
Because false leaders will never move a community toward truth , but rather , only toward their own interests , the strong rejection of baseless claims and those who advocate them , is necessary for the growth of the movement .
PatriotsQuestion911.org 's Patriots Advocating Hoaxes
" Here is my assessment .
The reason for the discrepancy between what people know about 9/11 and what they are willing to do to stop the War on Terror ; the reason we have ultimately failed , in other words , has to do with the scope and sophistication of the political and social control mechanisms used against us ; namely , disruption and disinformation .
I have been an activist for 20 years , and I have seen and experienced COINTELPRO - style disruption many times in the past .
Yet never before have I witnessed it used on such a scale and with such precision as I have within the 9/11 Truth Movement .
There are thousands of examples . "
The Special Case of Morgan Reynolds and David Shayler
Morgan Reynolds and David Shayler function pairwise across the Atlantic -- they are seen as highly educated and articulate people who have held significant positions in government , but who now appear to believe that real commercial jets did n't hit the WTC .
Because Shayler and Reynolds are extremely eloquent speakers , the situation becomes all the more difficult for activists who have trouble making sense of this surreal situation , and typically end up stating that they " just hope that they wo n't bring up ' no - planes ' when the spotlight is on . "
The contradiction in logic presented by the cases of these two is stark , unbelievable , and yet surprisingly similar overall .
Apparent former government insiders are loudly making the case for " inside job " to the public for the benefit of the grassroots activists ( the little people ) , and yet both are casually mixing the real issues with virtual insanity .
Average people cannot help but wonder , " is this for real ? , " " Have they gone nuts ? , " or " Are they still working for the government ? "
One sees such discussion on blogs and forums often when the names arise :
David Shayler ( far left ) in an event with David Ray Griffin ( right )
J.UL1R4 said ...
" I got the chance to chat with David Shayler afterwards , who was drawing quite a crowd around him .
I was a little surprised to hear him talk about holograms , and it seems Shayler may be a ' no - planer ' .
. .
I honestly do n't know why he was discussing this theory . "
Anonymous said ...
" David Shayler is still working for MI5 .
The fact that you report that he is a ' no planer ' confirms this for me . "
J.UL1R4 said ...
" I did notice Shayler and his partner seem to have something of an entourage with them , which seemed like reasonable , warm intelligent people so it 's strange . "
Anonymous said ...
" If he believes this he is insane .
Clearly he is not insane . "
Even the UK press asks if Shayler was n't somehow replaced by someone else , perhaps only half jokingly .
Yet inside the activist community itself , websites like Patriots Question911.com ask no such questions at all .
They quietly hum along as though everything is just fine .
Although recent reports about Shayler giving a speech claiming to be a messiah suggest that he may indeed be showing signs of mental dysfunction , such a situation would only underscore the disappointing delay in the 9/11 community to address these glaring inconsistencies of logic which have been in the mainstream press from Shayler for years now .
While the supposed arguments supporting " no- planes " have been easily refuted by scientists and other professionals published in the Journal of 9/11 Studies , Reynolds and Shayler , neither having any background in science , claim to know better or act as though they do , by presenting the claims directly to mainstream media .
This is opposite to democratic leadership , in which a leader welcomes expert advice and wide support in decision making .
MORGAN REYNOLDS
" We gasp at Jones ' " analysis " of tower oscillation .
Can a Ph.D. physicist be this retarded ? "
" It is not my burden to prove what really happened .
That burden lies entirely with apologists for the official plane story like Hoffman .
Mr. Hoffman , not the skeptics , must prove that four Boeing airliners crashed as government and corporate media say they did . "
" A flimsy , high - speed jetliner must decelerate sharply upon impacting a strong , massive fixed object like a skyscraper unless the jetliner acquires more energy from somewhere , yet video evidence shows no deceleration of aircraft , no loss of momentum as it penetrates the tower . "
Morgan Reynolds thinks there was no plane debris at the WTC .
" There was no aircraft debris showering down below the impact zone .
Videos of the " glide- ins " and still pictures below the gashes support this conclusion .
Nor is jetliner debris visible in the two gashes themselves . "
Not surprisingly , any efforts to show that aircraft debris was indeed found are deemed " fake . "
Hence , Reynolds can conclude that there is no evidence that real commercial jets ever hit the WTC towers .
Since Reynolds is not a scientist himself , he engaged an MIT student -- Rick Rajter -- to create his ' no - Big- Boeings ' case for him . [ http://nomoregames.net/index.php?page=911&subpage1=deceleration_WTC2_myers ]
But the seemingly complicated video and physics arguments Rajter attempted to make were ( or had already been long ago ) roundly refuted by others [ http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/salter/review.html, http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/reynolds/ ] , and served mostly to take up the time of the scientific researchers of the community .
The primary attack target of Reynolds ' website is Dr. Steven Jones , with papers calling Jones " retarded " and other such names .
Tellingly , rather than working with critics to reach a consensus , Reynolds has instead spent considerable effort to try to discredit those who refute his claims or kick him out of their groups .
Generally , Reynolds presents a series of reasonable points questioning the 9/11 attacks and speaks eloquently about the history of false flags , but toward the end of his PowerPoint presentations , or buried in the center of his essays , he tucks in his belief that ' Big Boeings ' could not have hit the WTC Towers .
In contrast to his tendency to bury this claim in presentations to audiences at 9/11 truth events , Reynolds took the opportunity of a FOX News appearance during the fifth anniversary of the attacks to state to millions of viewers that he did not believe that real commercial jets hit the WTC , imploring them to examine the impacts frame by frame for themselves ( just as Shayler does with his hologram assertion ) .
This case is one of several examples of advocates of ridiculous claims being given front row seats in the mainstream media at key times to discredit the movement .

" The only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes "
" I 'm not trying to blow my own trumpet but the credibility I add to the movement is enormous . "
" A recent article for the British magazine New Statesman profiled David Shayler and Annie Machon , former MI5 agents who went public with details of their service , who have since joined the growing ' 9/11 truth movement . '
Much to Machon 's chagrin , Shayler outed himself as a ' no - planer ' who believes the airliners we saw strike the World Trade Center towers were actually cruise missiles disguised as planes using sophisticated hologram technology .
' The only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes ...
I know it sounds weird , but this is what I believe , ' Shayler told journalist Brendan O'Neill . "
" David Shayler , the former MI5 officer turned whistleblower , has joined the 9/11 deniers .
' We know for certain that the official story of 9/11 is n't true , ' he tells the New Statesman .
' The twin towers did not collapse because of planes and fire .
They were brought down in a controlled demolition .
The Pentagon was most likely hit by an American missile , not an aeroplane . '
Not that he thinks planes hit the towers .
' I believe no planes were involved in 9/11 .
The only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes . '
Hard to believe , is n't it ?
Come to think of it , are we sure this is n't an MI5 agent posing as Shayler in an attempt to discredit him ?
Is there indeed such a person as Shayler , or was he -- as some now think -- invented by the CIA ? "
" What I am still saying is go onto the internet and look at the footage . . . people have had a go at me saying there were no planes but there is little evidence to show that jets went into the buildings .
I 'm entitled to say they did n't and something else did . . .
You can make some accurate calculations from Newton 's laws of motion . "
JUDY WOOD
So much has already been written debunking the claims of Judy Wood that there is little more that can be added .
Physicist Greg Jenkins , of dc911truth.org , did the 9/11 community a service when he videotaped a conversation he had with Judy Wood following a presentation she gave in Washington .
Her apparent inability to understand basic concepts of physics which Jenkins attempted to discuss with her exposed the essential flawed basis for her claims , not just about energy weapons from space being involved in the WTC attacks , but even about her understanding of the events of 9/11 themselves .
Even Wood 's early analysis of the Towers ' destruction was inherently flawed , as promptly pointed out on discussion forums , and clearly refuted by Greg Jenkins in the Journal of 9/11 Studies :
" In an attempt to analyze the collapse times of the WTC towers ( what she calls the " billiard ball " analysis ) , the conservation of momentum and energy are flagrantly violated .
She assumes that with each collision , all momentum in the problem is obliterated .
Her underlying assumptions are left unstated and the reader is left to ponder this egregious violation of physical law . "
Later , Wood teamed up with Reynolds to attempt to criticize Dr. Steven Jones in papers .
However , the overt inclusion of ad hominem attacks exposed the papers as primarily hit pieces rather than scientific papers .

JAMES FETZER
" ' I 've put them in their place so many times , ' [ Fetzer ] says of his critics .
And as he sees it , his long - running battles over Wellstone and JFK have helped to prepare him for his role as spokesman for the truth movement .
' I know a whole lot about how these games are played , ' he says .
' When I come into this 9/11 thing , see , I am not just a formidable foe on my own .
I have this wealth of experience .
The others do n't know diddly shit about disinformation .
But , man , I 've lived through it . ' "
Jim Fetzer : " I must say I think we 're finding out Judy , what happened on 9/11 .
I 'm just blown away by your work .
This is the most fascinating development in the history of the study of 9/11 ...
I 'm going to make a wild guess Judy ; I 'm going to presume that these [ directed energy ] beams had to be located in Building 7 ? "
Judy Wood : " Nope .
I do n't think so . "
Fetzer : " Planes ? "
Judy Wood : " No ... I think it 's very likely it 's in orbit . "
Fetzer : " Oh Really ??
Oh ho ho ho ho !
Oh Judy .
Oh my oh my oh my oh my .
This is huge ... this is huge Judy . "
James Fetzer started off appearing to support the work of Dr. Steven Jones and offered to help form a scholars group with Jones and a handful of others .
Fetzer ran the website for the group , but within months Fetzer 's increasingly speculative , bizarre and one - sided posts began to earn criticism from other researchers .
Jim Hoffman wrote a critique of Fetzer 's research ( A Critical Review of : ' Thinking about " Conspiracy Theories " : 9/11 and JFK ' ) and an analysis of how the credibility of the original " 9/11 Scholars group " was undermined by Fetzer 's promotion of misleading claims on ScholarsFor911 Truth.org and his public appearances as the group 's spokesperson ( ScholarsFor911 Truth.org : Muddling the Evidence ) .
By the end of about one year , the situation had gotten so dire that some of the members , including Steven Jones , decided they could no longer allow Fetzer to control the website , and decided to take a vote on what to do , since Fetzer refused to remove the offending posts .
Eventually , after several weeks involving hundreds of emails attempting to resolve the situation , a poll and subsequent vote was taken of the membership via email .
All but ten of the more than two hundred members who participated in the vote voted to leave Fetzer 's original group and form a new group .
Thirty people , including the ten , voted to join both groups .
( For more information on the split , please see : Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice : FAQ )
That 2006 vote of the Scholars membership represents one of the only real - world measures of the actual support in the 9/11 community for James Fetzer .
Another real - world measure might be the fact that James Fetzer has been banned from posting at 911 blogger.com , a popular blog for 9/11 actions and information sharing .
But one would have no idea that Fetzer behaved in such ways from the large and detailed positive citation on PatriotsQuestion911.com .
Why would the site feature a person who is so disruptive as to be banned from discussion with other activists , and to have threatened legal action against other activists in the 9/11 community ?
Along with helping to force a split of the scholars group , on March 30th 2007 , Fetzer wrote up a press release titled " Scholars file challenges to NIST reports on 9/11 , " and posted it to his website 911 Scholars to announce the submission of a ' Request for Correction ' to the National Institute for Standards in Technology ( NIST ) by Morgan Reynolds , Judy Wood and Ed Haas .
Soon after this , an RFC by actual scientists was filed by Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice ( STJ911.org ) with the support of two 9/11 family members .
NIST staff members reading the submissions will probably assume that any subsequent filing is be packed with lunacy , after reading the one submitted by Wood , Reynolds and Haas .
Hence , the well is poisoned .
All later challenges , no matter how well - founded , will tend to be dismissed out of hand .
This was made all the worse by Fetzer 's claim that the filing was representative of a " Scholars " group .
And in August of 2007 , about a month before the 6th anniversary , Fetzer organized a conference of nonsense advocates and has published a press release which shows that both he and Kevin Barrett now support the idea of TV fakery , or that the videos of the events on 9/11 should be considered to have been " faked . "
Naturally , no one addresses a fatal flaw with this theory -- that the videos and photographs of the public could not all have been manipulated , and so would not be corroborated by multiple news broadcasts , some of which are now available in full length on archive.org .
" 'I used to think that the very idea of faking ' live ' broadcasts was at least faintly absurd , ' observed James Fetzer , the society 's founder .
' But it turns out that there is a delay between an event 's actual occurrence and the broadcasting of footage of that same event , which creates the opportunity for image manipulation . ' "
. . .
" Kevin Barrett , the founder of MUJCA and a member of Scholars , reports he is troubled by these new studies .
' I guess I 'll have to take this possibility more seriously now , ' Barrett said .
' In the past , I have assumed video fakery was far - fetched and that anyone who endorsed it was probably a crackpot !
Now I 'm not so sure . ' "
. . .
" . . . a group long convinced of video fakery , including Gerard Holmgren , Rosalee Grable , StillDiggin , Killtown , and others , who have been frustrated their arguments have not been taken seriously .
' For that reason , I 'm including this subject [ TV Fakery ] in a conference on The Science and the Politics of 9/11 : What 's Controversial , What 's Not . . '"
Fetzer 's Support for Morgan Reynolds
" ' The second complaint , which has been filed by Morgan Reynolds , disputes NIST 's explanations of the jetliner - shaped holes in the Twin Towers .
. . .
The complaint contends that real jetliners would have been dramatically slowed by the impact , which implies that the NIST report is not only factually wrong but also physically impossible in violating physical laws .
Morgan poses a substantial number of anomalies that NIST will be hard pressed to explain , ' Fetzer said . "
Interestingly , before the scholars split , Fetzer claimed on his website that he did not agree with the idea that real planes did n't hit the WTC .
Yet now , he sends this claim directly to NIST and suggests his support for it by his involvement in actively promoting the RFC to the public and to NIST .
Fetzer 's Support for Judy Wood
" [ The complaint ] filed by Wood runs forty - three pages , including photographs and other supporting evidence .
' It is a powerful critique that demonstrates the government has completely and utterly failed to explain what happened to the World Trade Center on that tragic and fateful day , ' ...
Wood goes further and points out that the huge quantity of dust resulting from the visible process of steel disintegration , some of which was captured on film , combined with these other effects suggest the probable use of high - tech , directed energy weapons . "
On Judy Wood , Fetzer says :
" ' There are experts in many areas of science and of engineering studying 9/11 , ' he explained , ' but she has degrees that are centrally focused on critical areas in which competence is required to begin to understand what happened on 9/11 .
No one else in the 9/11 community comes close to her level of expertise . ' "
Interestingly , only about 10 scholars polled out of over 200 appeared to agree with such positions .
But Reynolds and Wood are not the only people presenting bizarre and unfounded theories which Fetzer delivers to the public .
Others he supports have made threatening attacks on other researchers and false defamatory statements about them , such as Rick Siegel .
Fetzer is delivering these directly to the public via his website , his press releases , his appearances on his radio program , his conferences and any place else that will have him .
James
Fetzer 's website had about 800 other sites linking to it when the scholars group split .
Now it has over 1000 linking to it .
We can thank Patriots Question911.com for some of that linkage , no doubt , by its continued positive presentation of the man whose efforts undermine the serious contributions of others , and make it easier for newcomers to see all 9/11 skeptics as nutcases .
Fetzer 's Support for Rick Siegel
Also banned from most groups and blogs , Rick Siegel , like disruptors Nico Haupt and Eric Hufschmid , maintains what amounts to gossip column websites attacking other researchers .
Recently , Siegel 's website posted commentary attacking a victim of the 9/11 attacks and his wife with unfounded claims , and Siegel 's site , 911researchers.com , was forced to move to a new host after complaints were filed with its original host .
Soon afterwards , the New York Post got hold of this story and smeared all " conspiracy theorists " with Siegel 's abusive attack on widow Ellen Mariani and her husband :
" The odd thing is that the loonies are picking on Ellen .
She has been outspoken in insisting that the government knows more about the attacks than it is admitting .
But a source familiar with the groups says they tend to target people who fall short of their extreme anti-Semitic , anti-everything views . "
That Jim Fetzer thought highly of Siegel 's gossip attack site is shown by the fact that he continued to post a prominent link to it on the front page of his scholars site for months following the split of the group .
( the last archived version of the site -- May of 2007 -- shows that the link is still on the front page : http://67.15.255.19/~c911sch1/ . )
Facts such as these suggest that not only is Fetzer primarily interested in advocating the most discrediting and baseless claims imaginable , but he also nurtures internal disruption by sending the public to a gossip and attack site as a ' top ' link .
Other evidence of his support for Rick Siegel 's actions can be seen in an essay on the anniversary of the founding of the Scholars group in which he opines that Siegel should be on the board of directors .
" The board of directors , in my view , should include a wide range of perspectives about possible causes of destruction at the WTC , encompassing perspectives as diverse as those of David Ray Griffin , Morgan Reynolds , Rick Siegel , and Judy Wood . "
The question , then , is why Patriots Question911.com includes James Fetzer as though he is a notable and credible person , when in reality he has been banned from popular discussion arenas and has played an instrumental role in disrupting important groups both past and present , and in discrediting activists to large public audiences .
Fetzer 's History of Disruption
Articles , letters , emails and other documents can be found all over the internet which outline a history of disruptive interactions between various individuals and activist groups with James Fetzer , particularly in the JFK arena .
While we cannot know the full story behind most of the events which occurred , many descriptions are uncannily similiar to recent events in the 9/11 arena .
" [ Fetzer ] transferred to Columbia University for a year .
Those were heady days on the Columbia campus .
When the radical student group Students for a Democratic Society trashed a teacher placement office , Fetzer -- concerned that the campus disruptions might hamper his career -- aligned himself with an opposition group , Students for Columbia University .
At one point , he says , he was involved in a melee in which he shouted down SDS leaders with a bullhorn .
Only later did Fetzer come to suspect that some of his fellows with Students for Columbia University were probably agents provocateur -- and , by extension , that he had been made a government dupe . "
...
" Sometimes , Thompson says , Fetzer would share theories that -- even in the world of assassination buffs -- seemed off the wall .
" The first thing he sent me was a rather confusing claim that William Greer , the driver of the presidential limousine , could be seen in the Zapruder film turning around 180 degrees , holding up a chrome colored revolver , and shooting the president in the head , " Thompson remembers .
' At that point , I knew I was dealing with someone with diminished experience in these matters . ' "
...
" After one nasty dust - up with Thompson , Fetzer found himself denounced in a written statement by a group of prominent JFK researchers .
They called Fetzer 's attacks ' biased , prejudicial , counterproductive , and , finally , useless ' and insisted that he apologize .
The apology , says Thompson , never came . "
...
" For his part , Fetzer says he still suspects that Thompson is ' working on the other side . '
' He 's got a role to play , I 'm telling you .
He 's got a role to play , ' Fetzer whispers when Thompson 's name comes up in conversation .
' If he 's not an agent of disinformation , he 's certainly acting as if he were . '
It 's too bad , he adds , because he once admired Six Seconds in Dallas .
Heck , he once admired Thompson .
You can still hear it in his voice .
' I thought it was a wonderful book , ' Fetzer says .
' He was a philosopher .
He was an instant hero , which is why it 's so ironic that years and year later , he becomes my principal assailant . ' "
...
" As with Thompson , the name - calling between Bieter and Fetzer was unbridled .
. . .
For Bieter , the dispute turned acutely personal after Fetzer posted about the circumstances surrounding Bieter 's retirement from the law practice , hastened by allegations of malpractice and sexual harassment .
( The sexual harassment charge was ultimately dropped . ) . . .
The acrimony ultimately wound up in the courts . "
And from a letter posted to the internet by a Fetzer adversary , Josiah Thompson -
" So once again it is clear that Professor Fetzer has been wasting everyone 's time , gabbling about nothing for four pages of an email .
It 's because I 've finally decided not to waste any more time on the professor that this is my goodbye to him and all that .
But I leave you folks ( to return to doing some real research on cartridge cases ) with a sense of optimism .
I 've met people over the last few months who are not only capable of handling the good professor .
They are also capable of doing real research and , unlike the professor , are actually doing it .
Most of them are listed on the professor 's web page as ' agents of disinformation ' . "
Given such levels of ongoing disruption in multiple groups attempting to investigate cover-ups , over spans of years , why is James Fetzer being presented to the public for unwitting readers to believe his work is credible , beneficial or helpful ?
Rather than linking to our strongest researchers , he is linking to people so disruptive that The New York Post has to write a story on it .
Rather than being able to work with groups of serious researchers , he is propping up those who are presenting nonsense and who cannot defend their work scientifically .
Inherent Contradictions
PatriotsQuestion911.com 's inclusion of uncritical biographies of overt promoters of false and misleading claims as 9/11 truth is at odds with the goal of lending credibility to challenges to the official story .
That goal is explicitly stated on the site 's main page :
" I strongly desire to increase this collection of statements by responsible individuals who question the official account of 9/11 . "
Yet as this essay has shown , at least four of the individuals included on the site are actually reckless -- not responsible in the least -- attacking other researchers and disseminating misinformation as though it is accepted , when in reality it is widely rejected .
PatriotsQuestion911.org states :
" I do n't claim to know what really happened on 9/11 .
I cannot examine the facts of the matter first hand .
And I do n't have the experience to know what 's possible and what is unlikely regarding terrorist activities or military operations .
For that analysis , I need to rely on experts . "
Experts who believe that holograms were used to fake plane crashes on 9/11 ?
PatriotsQuestion911.org further states :
" My objective , at this point , is to have our government launch a new , extremely thorough , independent , and totally impartial re-examination of the terrible acts of 9/11 and the events leading up to them . "
Many if not all researchers and activists want a new investigation , but the mixing of credible critics of the official story with advocates of holograms , space weapons , nukes and other nonsense claims is never going to get us a new investigation , and will more likely produce the opposite outcome .
To call for a new investigation while spreading nonsense claims to the public -- despite repeated requests for their removal -- suggests that one actually prefers an investigation regardless of the veracity of the claims -- a torches - at - the - gates mentality in which the truth of the accusations is sidelined and forgotten .
Last but not least , the choice of links highlighted by Patriots Question911.com similarly suggests that truth -- as can be demonstrated by the scientific method and through careful , deliberate scholarly research by some of the credible individuals included in the site -- is not highly valued .
Interestingly , the list of recommended sites and videos under the " 9/11 Truth " columns falls almost entirely into two categories : those which actively promote hoaxes , and those which avoid the subject of disinformation .
It would be hard to find any films more widely regarded in the 9/11 community as hoax films than 9/11 Eyewitness , which suggests that helicopters and nuclear weapons were involved in the Twin Towers ' destruction , and 9/11 Ripple Effect , which continues to promote the pod claim several years after it was laid to rest .
Conclusion
PatriotsQuestion911.com is not unique in its mixing of nonsense - advocates with real researchers , but due to this site 's high visibility the need to address this issue is all the more important .
Efforts to get these small needed changes -- for the sake of the basic credibility of the entire 9/11 community -- have been fruitless .
Hence , in order to keep the public aware of the basic role of the insertions of nonsense into our work which sites like Patriots Question911.com are ignoring , this essay was created .
As we enter the 6th Anniversary of the attacks , the nonsense advocates are meeting for their own conference about TV fakery , nukes , UFOs , and space weapons , meaning that essays such as this are unfortunately increasingly necessary to provide a basic resource for journalists , researchers , and average readers who are questioning the 9/11 attacks , but are coming upon ideas so absurd , so often , that it might seem like most of the entire 9/11 community is simply nuts .
But if one looks closely one finds that , in general , these people also appear to have held reasonable jobs and have even won grants for tens of thousands of dollars from the government .
This basic contradiction which we see again and again -- nonsense combined with expert credentials or high competency -- is a red flag in which only two possible rationales reasonably exist : either the person has begun a tragic course of Alzheimer 's ( or some other organic disorder of the brain ) which has apparently not yet been diagnosed nor affected any of their other abilities to function independently , or they are intentionally protecting the official story by attempting to discredit by association those who are questioning it .
There are other possibilities - i.e. , ego , spite , ideology etc. -- but most of those necessitate such a level of reckless disregard for the truth that they amount to an intentional effort to discredit , nothing more .
Some will argue that efforts such as this essay are only negative , a waste of time , and risk getting us too involved in debunking and divisiveness rather than the positive work we should be doing .
Indeed , the individuals described in this essay would likely feel the same -- " Shut up about the disinformation already , and let 's all get along ! "
This is the basis for Big Tent , an organizing strategy which tends to welcome all ideas , no matter what their content , for purposes of " unity . "
The truth is , each of us has our own path , interests , fascinations , and abilities , and we can each contribute our best work by following what we feel most strongly about .
Sometimes writing about mis- and disinformation is a cathartic exercise which can allow researchers to move forward knowing they have done as much as they can do to expose the charades .
I recall discussing disinformation briefly on stage at a 9/11 event while waiting for the main speaker to arrive .
Audience members were confused about some of the information they 'd recently learned that made no sense to them and someone brought up a question .
When I explained a little about mis- and disinformation , the history of it , the examples we know of , the likely possibility that this may be at the root of the topic they were confused about , there was a palpable relief in the room as an audible sigh went across the audience .
It surprised me : people understood immediately and in a gut way .
A knowing look came over their faces as if to say , " Ah , of course . . . now I get it . "
After such situations are resolved , I 've noticed , events move forward positively .
I 've witnessed such relief in a number of audiences when false claims have been brought up --
" But I think nukes were what really caused those clouds at Ground Zero ! " -- and quickly decapitated by individuals like Dr. Steven Jones , Jim Hoffman and architect Richard Gage .
We are engaged in a two - front information war .
Pretending that we are not wo n't make one side go away .
There are more than enough of us for all the different types of efforts -- outreach , organizing , group building , physical evidence research , petitions , lawsuits , FOIAs , and refuting false claims -- to move forward in unison .
The good news is that more and more people are seeing the nonsense and are rejecting it openly in their posts to forums , in their own essays , on blogs , and in films .
Creating a firewall between the genuine research and the nonsense will take more than ignoring nonsense , it will take uniting against it .
That takes courage , as anyone knows who has attempted to expose mis- and dis-information and has been met with vitriolic public attacks and threats .
I would like to take a moment to mention and thank some researchers and activists who have made careful , unique and meaningful contributions to the effort to expose the role of mis- and disinformation in the 9/11 community :

Summary
The name test indicates when more assessments may be needed
The disorder is usually not diagnosed until a child is three or four , as the symptoms are variable .
However , parents of autistic children often say they have noticed early tell - tale behaviour .
The ' name test ' described in Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine appeared to aid earlier diagnosis .
Simple screen
The researchers studied two groups of infants - a healthy control group and a group of children deemed to be at higher than normal risk of autism because they all had older siblings with the condition .
At 12 months , all of the 46 infants in control group passed the name test , responding on the first or second call of their own name , while only 86 % of the 101 ' at risk ' infants passed .
The University of California Davis , Sacramento , team followed 46 of the 'at risk ' infants and 25 of the controls up to their second birthday .
Three - quarters of the 'at risk ' children who had failed the name test were found to have developmental problems at the age of two .
Of the children who were later diagnosed with autism , half had failed the name test at one year , and of those who were identified as having any type of developmental delay , 39 % had failed it .
Aparna Nadig and colleagues had tried the name test on the children when they were only six months old , but found this was too young an age to get any meaningful result .
Routine check
They stressed that if the name test were to be used routinely , it should not be relied on solely to diagnose autism - it merely indicates that a child may need more assessments .
Equally , a child who fails the test will not necessarily have autism .
However , one who fails repeatedly and consistently has a high likelihood of some type of developmental abnormality and should be referred for further checks and possibly early intervention , they said .
Judith Gould of the National Autistic Society said there was good evidence that early intervention could help .
But she also cautioned : " Just because a baby does not respond to their name does not necessarily mean that he or she has autism .
" The diagnostic assessments for autism are thorough and wide - ranging , taking into account a variety of other factors such as eye contact , pointing and showing .
" If parents are concerned about their child 's development , they should call the NAS helpline on 0845 070 4004 or seek the opinion of a medical professional . "
The House appropriations committee cut $ 139 m ( £ 69.5 m ) from the $ 310 m the Bush administration wants for preparatory work on the missile project in Europe .
It approved funds for a radar system in the Czech Republic but cut the $ 139 m
Mr Bush requested to establish a missile interception system in Poland , the most controversial part of the defence system .
In addition , the committee cut another $ 159 m from US - based parts of the missile plan .
John Murtha , chairman of the committee , said the White House has " got to convince us this is worthwhile " .
In a report attached to the revised budget , the committee said " it is premature to provide full funding for the European component , given the uncertainty surrounding the programme " .
The Congressional move came as Des Browne , the defence secretary , said yesterday that the UK had agreed to allow the US to upgrade the Menwith Hill airbase , in Yorkshire , as part of the proposed missile defence system .
Britain has already approved a radar system at Fylingdales , on the North Yorkshire Moors .
Mr Bush wants to place 10 interceptor missiles in silos in Poland , saying they are needed as a matter of urgency to defend against Iran which the US claims is pushing ahead with a nuclear weapons programme .
The budget cuts are part of $ 3.5 bn that the committee has slashed from the overall defence budget , which now stands at $ 459bn .
As well as reducing the budget , Congress is shifting priorities from futuristic programmes to more immediate concerns , such as improved healthcare for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan , pay rises for soldiers and marines , and much - needed weaponry for Iraq such as the heavily - armoured Stryker vehicles .
The committee 's pared - down budget will go to the full House for a vote next week but is almost certain to be passed .
The House and Senate have questioned whether establishing the system in eastern Europe is sensible given the extent of the opposition it has aroused in Russia .
They also question its technical feasibility and the failure of other Nato countries to commit fully to it .
Republicans on the committee joined the Democrats in voting for the bill .
Mr Murtha said Congress was trying to change the direction of the defence department across the board , not just on missile defence .
The Senate is not scheduled to vote on the budget until after the August recess .
While the Democrats and Republicans are divided over proposals to withhold war spending for Iraq , legislators from both parties have expressed scepticism about the European missile defence proposal .
Mr Bush could veto Congressional changes but may be reluctant to do this , given he might have to also use it in September in the Iraq war funding row .
Bill Young , the most senior Republican on the committee , said : " I do n't think this bill is subject to a veto . "
He said it had been designed for quick passage .
Even if Mr Bush was to block it , the extent of Congressional opposition will leave doubts over the European missile defence system , signalling that if the Democrats take the White House next year , the plan would be scrapped .
The congressional opposition will also embolden Russia to maintain its opposition .
Vladimir Putin , Russia 's president , ordered a Kremlin meeting of senior military and intelligence officers yesterday to build up the armed forces and intelligence - gathering to confront what he said is a new US global threat .
" The United States is becoming more active in pushing forward plans to deploy new bases in eastern Europe , " he said .
Mr Putin rejects US claims that the missile system is directed not against Russia but a possible attack from Iran .
He has suggested an alternative plan in which the interceptor missiles would be based in either Russia or a sympathetic neighbour but the White House is cool about this .
The Democrats have attached amendments to the spending bill , such as withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and closure of the Guantánamo detention centre in Cuba within 60 days , but these have no chance of being accepted by the Senate .
A separate vote on Iraq withdrawal is scheduled for September , when Democrats may be able to win over some Republican senators .
The vote will follow a report by the US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and the US ambassador , Ryan Crocker .
NAME
MapReduce.pm - Perl version of Google 's distributed data processing
ABSTRACT
Simple , generalized distributed data processing .
SYNOPSIS
On the commandline : # mr example .
mr inputcorpus outputcorpus File example.mr : ------------------ package ExamplePackage ; use MapReduce ; @ISA = qw( MapReduce ) ; ExamplePackage ->run ; sub Reader { ... } sub Map { ... } sub Reduce { ... } ------------------
DESCRIPTION
MapReduce is a generalized distributed data processing system ( see http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html).
You are strongly encouraged to read the paper before proceeding further , as it will make everything much clearer .
There is at least one open implementation of mapreduce .
The purpose of MapReduce .pm is to be 1 .
Perl - based , using Perl as the default language for mapreduce programs , and 2 . as simple as possible while still being useful .
Some people , like me , have a particular thing for simplicity .
This is a simplified , easy to use implementation .
Based on shared ssh keys and remote calls , it is currently suitable for small clusters ( < =100 or so machines ) .
To use it , you just write three functions into a .mr file : Reader ( ) , Map ( ) , and Reduce ( ) .
Reader defines an input record and returns an iterator for them .
Map takes an input record and creates a list of key / value pairs from it .
Reduce takes a key and a list of values , and returns a ( possibly different ) key and another list ( possibly a single value ) .
Strange as it may seem , an astonishingly large class of data processing tasks can be formulated as definitions of these three functions .
For example , here is a .mr file which counts all the occurrences of every unique word in a corpus of documents :
#### file MapReduce / bin/wc.mr #! perl -w use strict ; package WordCount ; use lib " MapReduce / lib " ; use MapReduce ; our @ISA = qw ( MapReduce ) ; WordCount ->run( @ARGV ) ; ########### #
Reads one line in per record sub Reader { my $ fh = shift ; sub { my $ record = < $ fh > ; return ( ) unless defined $ record ; return \$record ; } } # returns a flat list with key / value pairs eg # ( word => 1 , word2 => 1 , ... ) sub Map { my $ ref = shift ; return map { $ _ => 1 } split /\W+/ , $ $ref ; } # returns a single key / value pair , reduced from an iterator of values .
sub Reduce { my ( $ key , $ iter ) = @_ ; my $ val ; while ( defined ( my $ next = $ iter - > ( ) ) ) { $ val += $ next ->[ 0 ] ; } return $ key , $ val ; } #####################################
When this is called using the mr program , like so
# mr wc.mr odyssey odyssey_wc
... there will appear a new corpus called odyssey_wc , containing records of the form " word sum
" where sum is the number of occurrences of that word .
HOWTO
How to gather machines into a cluster .
1. Procure one or more machines .
Designate one machine as " master " .
This machine might participate in the distributed tasks , but not necessarily .
A single machine will work as well .
2 . Place a correct config file on the master machine as /etc / mapreduce.conf , with entries for each host in the pool .
See mapreduce - sample .conf for a template .
3 . On each machine , create a uniform username for the mapreduce user ( this can be any username ) .
The command " useradd mapreduce -m - G users -s / bin / bash " will do this .
4 . Log in to the mapreduce user account on the master machine .
Install the mr program into the ~ / bin dir and make sure this is in your path .
Generate and distribute shared ssh keys for the mapreduce user accounts .
This is a bit involved , so it has its own section below .
5 . On each machine , create a uniformly named , writable directory .
Default is / tmp / mr .
It 's nice to mount a whole disk on this , if you have extras .
This could also be a symbolic link to somewhere there is a lot of space .
The minimal - effort thing to do is
# mr - cmd " mkdir /tmp / mr "
6. Place a MapReduce.pm install dir in the home directory of each mapreduce user , and rename it so there is no version number .
This can be achieved like this from the master account ( after the above steps ) :
# mr - cmd=" scp masterhost : MapReduce-0.01.tar.gz . " # mr - cmd= " tar zxvf MapReduce * " # mr - cmd= " mv MapReduce - 0.01 MapReduce "
Your system is ready to go .
When adding an additional machine , just remember all hosts must share the same ssh keypair , and they all have to have entries for everyone in their .ssh / known_hosts file .
Therefore repeat steps 1 and 2 for the new host , and redistribute the master 's .ssh / known_hosts file to the pool after ssh'ing to the new host .
And do n't forget to add the new host to the /etc/mapreduce.conf !
GENERATING SHARED SSH KEYS FOR THE MACHINE POOL
All machines in the pool need shared ssh keys .
There are three steps to this .
- Generate a key pair .
- distribute the key pair across all hosts .
- distribute the host list across all hosts .
You can use the following procedure :
Generate the key pair .
ssh - keygen -t rsa
( hit enter whenever it asks you for any information , including passphrase )
cp .ssh/id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys2
Distribute the keys .
# mr - cmd=" mkdir .ssh ; chmod 0700 .ssh " # mr - cmd=" scp masterhost : .ssh/* .ssh /. "
Distribute the host list .
# mr - cmd=" scp masterhost:.ssh/known_hosts .ssh /. "
NOTE : Please see Hack # 66 in the excellent Linux Server Hacks by Rob Flickenger for details beyond the above instructions .
USING MAPREDUCE
The main tool is the mr program .
You can use this to launch mapreduce operations or just execute any command on every host in the pool .
After all the setup has been done , there should be sufficient information in the config file and command line for mapreduce to know what to do .
This info includes - the list of hosts in the pool - the location of the repository ( default / tmp / mr ) - the name of the task file where your program resides - the name of the input corpus - the name of the result corpus
Normally only the last three are specified on the command line .
Hence the typical call looks like this :
# mr wc.mr odyssey odyssey_wc
If something goes wrong and you need to clean up , this will get rid of the distributed output corpus :
# mr - cmd= " rm - r /tmp/mr/odyssey_wc "
( this assumes your repository is / tmp / mr and corpus to delete is odyssey_wc ) .
The cmd option is quite useful in practice , but be careful !
REQUIRES
Ssh using shared keys .
Digest ::MD5
DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
There are two implementations of this model ( that I know of ) : Google 's original , and a Lucene - related project called Hadoop .
Compared to Google 's much more involved version , this is more or less a toy .
It 's only suitable for smaller clusters , for various reasons .
There is no fault tolerance , so it 's only useful where machine failure is uncommon .
It 's based not on listening services per host , but instead on remote command invocation from a master program which forks processes to babysit the tasks .
This makes the code rather simple and requires no true installation on any host in the pool .
On the other hand it limits the number of hosts to available process memory on the master machine .
Plus any network trouble , or machine failure , is going to mess everything up .
A quite significant difference is the absense of a distributed file system .
Google uses " GFS " to make input files available to map tasks , while this implementation simply stores distributed files across the cluster so that each host is responsible for the files on its local storage .
This requires a preliminary " distribution step " which partitions a set of records across all hosts .
This is quite simple since it can be implemented as a MapReduce operation !
See ' partition_trec_docs.mr ' and ' partition_lines.mr ' in the bin directory for examples .
This turns out to be more convenient than it looks , because often you will want to perform another mapreduce operation on the results of the last , and in this way the files are already distributed .
I have n't looked at Hadoop very much .
Only to note that it appears much more " enterprise " , which is to say it has four xml configuration files ( MapReduce. pm has only one , on one machine ) , and ... a lot of source code .
It 's no doubt much more stable , and also harder to get started .
Not to mention ... there are no Perl bindings .
One final note on relative complexity .
The current Hadoop build has 313 java files with 61,810 lines of code .
This does n't include non-java code .
There are 14 jsp files , 13 sh files , and 586 html files ... anyway you get the picture .
You could not check out the source code and understand everything in half a day .
I 'm not disparaging the Hadoop effort at all .
It 's probably very high quality .
I 'm just saying the concept is very simple , and it might be possible to have a simple yet stable implementation .
Even though this version is probably not as stable as the others , it comprises barely 400 lines of code as of the first release .
It has only one configuration file , can be used almost immediately with very minimal effort , and is rather noninvasive , requiring nothing but untar - ing a directory on pool machines .
In short , perfect for exploring , understanding , and profitably using the MapReduce concepts with near - trivial time investment .
TO DO
It 's my goal to have a very sound system with comparable performance and stability to Google or Hadoop , using so little code that it can be read and understood in less than a day by a normal programmer .
The main glaring holes are fault tolerance and load balancing .
Currently the files are distributed evenly across hosts so that the last host to finish holds up all the rest , and effectively you are bound by the speed of the slowest .
Load balancing would take care of that .
Fault tolerance is even more important , since the entire operation can crash with one network hiccup or machine failure .
Google and Hadoop deal with these issues separately , using a distributed file system and centralized tracking of tasks .
I do n't particularly like those because they 're complicated and would require a lot more code than I feel is really necessary .
I 'm dreaming up something along the lines of " replicated responsibility " to handle both load balancing and fault tolerance .
I 'll write more about it when it gets clearer to me ... these are early days yet .
Please , if you have suggestions for elegant improvements , get in touch with me .

Here 's a no- brainer , zero - cost , pure people power issue for Democrats to latch onto for November :
Get rid of this " secret hold " crap in the Senate :
Senator who put ' secret hold ' on bill to open federal records is a secret , too WASHINGTON - In an ironic twist , legislation that would open up the murky world of government contracting to public scrutiny has been derailed by a secret parliamentary maneuver .
An unidentified senator placed a " secret hold " on legislation introduced by Sens. Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , and Barack Obama , D - Ill. , that would create a searchable database of government contracts , grants , insurance , loans and financial assistance , worth $ 2.5 trillion last year .
The database would bring transparency to federal spending and be as simple to use as conducting a Google search .
...
Now the bill is in political limbo .
Under Senate rules , unless the senator who placed the hold decides to lift it , the bill will not be brought up for a vote .
The measure in question had passed out of committee unanimously and was on the fast track for floor action until the hold was placed .
This is an incredible accountability measure , especially for Internet researchers like those who abound here at Daily Kos and other websites .
Here 's a description of what the mysterious hold is preventing , from Obama 's site :
This bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to establish and maintain a single public
Web site that lists all entities receiving federal funds , including the name of each entity , the amount of federal funds the entity has received annually by program , and the location of the entity .
All federal assistance must be posted within 30 days of such funding being awarded to an organization .
Holds are not uncommon ; in fact , they were used to great effect recently by Clinton and Murray , who held up approval on Bush 's new FDA nominee until Plan B was okayed .
But anonymous holds are nothing more than cowardly attempts at obfuscation , undermining as they do the underlying assumption of representative democracy - that legislators will be held accountable by voters for their actions .
Clinton and Murray took that risk .
This senator did not .
I 'd really like to see the duly elected objector - never mind if it's a Democrat or Republican - stand up and say : I think it 's a really , really bad idea to have $ 300 billion worth of government contracts available for public scrutiny .
And then we can hope he or she is facing re-election this cycle .
Update :
It looks like Porkbusters has already begun a campaign to have constituents call their senators and deny the secret hold .
Join that effort and keep checking in there to see who ’s still on the suspect list next week .

Wildlife rangers are battling to save an orphaned baby mountain gorilla found clinging to her dead mother in the Congo .
The adult gorilla had been shot a point - blank range in the back of the head .
Scroll down for more ...
The two - month - old , who has been named Ndakasi by conservationists looking after her in Goma , is taking baby formula from a feeding bottle .
" She 's more or less OK .
It is certainly a worrying situation , but not hopeless , " Paulin Ngobobo , senior warden in eastern Congo 's Virunga National Park .
Ndakasi , who was born on April 15 , would normally have suckled for up to three years .

Only 700 mountain gorillas survive in the wild , more than half of them in Virunga .
At least two have been killed and eaten already this year by rebels living off the land as militia fighting drags on despite the official end of Congo 's five - year war in 2003 .
It is unclear who had killed the adult female or why .
She had been killed " execution - style " in the back of the head and left at the scene rather than taken away to be eaten , said Emmanuel de Merode of conservation group Wildlife Direct .
Scroll down for more ...
" It looks like she was lured with bananas because we found bananas at the site .
" A second gorilla was probably shot because there was a trail of blood nearby and three gunshots were heard .
The other was probably wounded and got away , " he said .
" There are militia groups there .
This particular incident was in the Mikeno sector , which is on the border of Rwanda .
There was a lot of fighting in that area in January and those problems have not entirely been solved . "
Last month Wildlife Direct said Mai Mai rebels had attacked patrol posts in Virunga park , killing one wildlife officer and critically injuring three others , and threatened to slaughter gorillas if park rangers retaliated .
More than 150 rangers have been killed in the last decade while protecting Congo 's parks from poachers , rebel groups , illegal miners and land invasions , working through the war without pay .

of interfering with a religion — a misdemeanor under California law — for picketing outside Scientology 's heavily armed , razor wire - enforced base , outside Hemet California .
He split for Canada , becoming the world 's first " Scientology fugitive , " and he 's back in the U.S. dealing with a variety of court cases related to Scientology .
Henson was just thrown back in jail .
As best as I can make out from the limited information currently available , Henson and his lawyers were scheduled for a hearing at 1:30 pm on Tuesday , May 8th .
They were apparently unaware that warrants had recently been signed by the Governors of California and Arizona , and after the hearing , Henson was handed over to the Yavapai County Sheriff Department for incarceration until a hearing on Wednesday May 9th at 9 a.m.
( A note received this afternoon — May 9th — from Henson 's wife , Arel Lucas , says that he will remain in the lockup at least until Monday , May 13th .
She invites people to write to him at : Yavapai County Sheriff 's Office , Howard Keith Henson , 255 E. Gurley St. Prescott , AZ 86301 .
She also reminds you that the prison authorities read the letters before passing them on . )
Henson 's travails in his ongoing battle with Scientology and the law have been amply covered here I heard about Henson 's renewed captivity as I was editing this interview I did with him for The RU Sirius Show on March 29th .
While we talked about scientology a bit , the main focus was on another one of Henson 's interests .
Just before he was originally arrested in his conflict with the Scientologists , he was scheduled to talk at a European Space Agency conference on how Space Elevators could completely solve the carbon and energy problems .
Keith Henson has been a space buff since he was eight years old .
Back in 1975 , he and others — including nanotech guru K. Eric Drexler — founded the L5 Society .
They promoted space colonies and solar power satellites built out of metals extracted from moon rock .
The L5 Society eventually became the National Space Society .
Jeff Diehl joined me in interviewing Keith Henson on the show .
So what 's your favorite Tom Cruise movie ?
( Laughs )
None of them .
My dislike for the cult has spilled over into everything that 's associated with it .
But I do have to admit Tom has been very effective at taking Scientology down .
He certainly did more damage to their image in a year than I did in ten .
And he and Katie are n't done yet , I betcha .
He played a creepy head - fucker quite effectively in the film Magnolia .
It 's worth seeing if you decide to break your Cruise fast .
It 's been said that you fear the Scientologists will get to you in jail .
Some people who are otherwise sympathetic have expressed skepticism about this .
Do you have any evidence , any reason to fear the thuggery of Scientologists in the tank ?
I sure do .
I have evidence that I accidentally acquired a few weeks ago that the Riverside courts themselves were engaged in outright criminal acts — that is , using the power of the courts to entrap me into a crime .
That 's a pretty heavy charge .
Can you substantiate it ?
You can find a letter I wrote about this back in 2001 on my website .
I just never imagined I would get paper evidence pulled out of the county 's court files .
Well , recently , I was handed a paper out of the Riverside court files that had never been listed as part of the files .
Obviously somebody went looking for a warrant to send over to Arizona and pulled it out without looking at the date .
I know now , of course , that Riverside Court illegally keeps secret documents that are not listed in the docket .
So I accidentally found out that it 's the very warrant that would 've been used to arrest me at that deposition .
It 's dated September 15 , 2000 , and sure enough , they listed the charge of " Failure to Appear " on it .
And that 's just not a crime that happened on September 15 .
So the arrest warrant could not possible have been filled out that day .
It was most likely filled out weeks before the date on it .
And by issuing a warrant for a crime that never happened — the court itself was complicit in a serious criminal act .
If a person were convicted of this , they could spend many years in prison .
Well , obviously the Scientologists are very well - connected .
But you 've received a lot of public support .
Does that make you safer ?
Yes it does .
I was treated fairly roughly until hundreds of phone calls came into the jail .
And then they realized that this was not a person they could just shove down a hole and forget .
Have any establishment figures come to your side ?
Mostly , no .
It 's amazing how some people who are considered really brave heroes get terrified by the Scientology cult .
I hesitate to say which one of them panicked when I asked him to make a phone call for me to keep me in Canada .
But if you think about it , you could probably figure it out .
Well , I 'm sure it's not Jerry Brown , who used to be an L5 - er and is now the Attorney General of California .
Did you ever have any interactions with him ?
Not directly .
I 've got an email from his office that says that I should essentially file a complaint against the District Attorney and the courts .
Did you have any interactions with him back when you were in L5 ?
I 'd never met Jerry back in those days .
I met other people in his administration like Rusty Schweickart , who was a good buddy with Jerry Brown .
Are you optimistic or pessimistic about your upcoming case .
( Laughs )
Which one ?
I 've got three of them open at the moment .
There 's a motion to correct an injunction the Riverside court was not permitted to issue ; a bankruptcy case that has got tangled up recently with O.J. Simpson's ; and this extradition business in Arizona .
That last one requires the California governor to sign an extradition warrant , and there 's been enough complaints to him about it that I do n't think he 's going to do it .
( ed : He did , on May 1 ) It 's weird to hear O.J. Simpson 's name come up .
I do n't suppose you can talk any more about your connection with OJ .
There could be a book contract in there for you — the book industry loves OJ !
Well , I can give you a quick thing .
It turns out that that the lawyer for the other side in a bankruptcy case involving my bank worked against OJ Simpson – I think it was for the Goldbergs .
So he asked for a delay in my case .
We will contemplate all aspects of your possible connections with the OJ case over the coming weeks and months and maybe get back to it .
" If the e-Meter does n't fit , you must acquit " or something .
You 've been working on ideas for power satellites recently .
What is that , and how old is the idea , and how did you wind up back in the space engineering area again ?
Well , it 's actually connected to the Scientology cult .
I could n't be employed while I was trying to hide out from them .
They have agents inside the IRS , so when you use your social security number , they just pull it and come and get you .
So I spent a lot of the time in the past year working on a post - Singularity novel .
I did n't want to write about wars and violence , which is in the cards if we do n't solve the energy crisis .
So I had to make the people in the novel able to solve that .
There are only a few ways to get the amount of power needed to replace the fossil fuel sources that we 've been using up — and power satellites are one of them .
Power satellites are a way to put solar power collectors where the sun shines more of the time , and no clouds are in the way .
They 're just giant solar collectors in orbit with microwave transmitters and gigantic receivers on earth .
They 're an old idea .
It 's been 38 years since Peter Glazer invented them .
I revived the idea to cope with energy and global warming for this novel .
It 's one of the few ways you can deal with both .
So , just to be really clear : how does it resolve energy and global warming problems ?
Well , there are a few approaches that are big enough to replace the energy that we get from oil and coal .
Power satellites are one of them , and if you have the capacity to build power satellites , you can build planetary - scale sun shades as well .
Are n't there terrestrial energy alternatives to this ?
The only ones I know about are fusion and fission plants — a lot of fission power , huge fusion plants .
But they both suffer from a really nasty problem .
It 's just too easy to divert neutrons toward making high - quality plutonium — like 99 % plutonium 239 .
And with that , it becomes very easy to make terrorist nukes .
I wrote about it .
OK .
So apparently these things could be a threat .
Let 's get back to the power satellites .
Tell us more about those .
Okay .
There are three parts to the power sat .
Making the energy out of sunlight in space — there can be enormous structures — lightweight structures in geosynchronous orbit .
And you would probably use solar cells on the thing , but you could even use steam turbines .
And then you have a big transmitter to turn the power into a microwave beam of huge size .
And then you need a gigantic antenna on the ground that converts the microwaves back to electricity .
How big would it be ?
Well , if you could fit one in an area of forty square miles — that 's the size of a medium city — the ground antenna would be about 50 miles .
That sounds like a lot of land , but the receiving antenna is just light mesh .
It does n't block the sunlight , so you can put it over farmland and still farm underneath it .
Terrestrial solar power takes a lot more land .
Might this not kill off all the bees or something ?
Might not living under this antenna do something else strange to people ?
Well , yeah ... I mean , for instance , people are talking about cell phones killing off all the bees .
Well actually , that 's ridiculous .
Cell phones were around a long time before the bees started disappearing .
That 's too bad , because I 'm putting , like , a dozen cell phones on my front porch ... ( Laughs )
But I 'll tell you this — the power level that you get in a power satellite , out in the middle of the thing , is n't any more power than you get to your head when you 've got a cell phone running .
It 's pretty low .
So could you fly through this beam ?
Well , yeah .
I propose that we use much higher - powered beams , and then we just have a restaurant on wheels , where you put the thing in a duck flyway .
And you just move the restaurant around to the north side in the spring and the south side in the fall , and the ducks just fall out of the air completely cooked .
( Laughter . )
So you and a number of people have been talking about this for a long time .
Why have n't we moved in this direction ?
Well , the big holdup is the transport cost to orbit .
Rockets are just terrible , efficiency - wise .
I mean , you see this enormous blast of … well , you 've seen the launches of the Apollos .
It 's just terribly wasteful .
But using nanotubes , we can build a space elevator .
Getting the stuff up there is just a one - time expense , right ?
It is , sort of … and it is n't , sort of .
You have to power these things because there 's no free lunch .
But you can probably haul up a couple of hundred tons of material at a time .
You have to push it clear out to geo-synch , and then you have to unreel it in both directions .
Anyway , once you 've built one of these things , it only costs you to run it .
Now , for a long time , people working on a related idea have been hung up on a pathway that was just plain wrong .
They 've been trying to use , design , figure out how to use climbers that use beamed power — mostly lasers — to beam the materials up there .
The idea there is to have electric driving wheels on the things , powered by lasers .
That 's better than rockets , which are around maybe 1 % efficient .
But the best estimates I 've gotten from the people that are working on it are that they would be around 7 % , which is still just terrible .
So working on this novel , I came up with a moving cable design , because — if you 're going to try to solve the energy problem , the traffic you need going into space is enormous .
It 's a couple of thousand tons a day .
Anyway , the idea is an elevator that runs on a bunch of pulleys up into space and you just power the thing from the bottom .
So how fast is this baby gonna take me up into space ?
I 'm not sure .
The faster you go , the more throughput you get .
I think you can run it maybe as high as a thousand miles an hour .
At that speed , it 's 22,000 miles out there , so at that speed it would take you 22 hours to get to geo .
You 've got to bring your lunch and dinner … and I guess even breakfast .
Of course , we 're not transporting people , and I think you 'd actually want to run faster than that .
But remember , I 'm driving this thing as an endless loop from the ground .
So that means the lowest part of the thing is in the atmosphere .
And running up through the atmosphere at a thousand miles per hour is all sorts of supersonic shock waves and everything else like that .
Now you have to use nanotube cable to do this , right ?
So is this cable technically plausible at this point ?
They 've actually measured the strength of nanotube cable , and it 's strong enough to do the job .
If you can get it up to 63 gigapascals , you can just run it over a pulley at geosynch .
But if you can't do that , there 's a way that you can run intermediate stepped pulleys in the thing where you can get a constant diameter cable , and a stepped number of strands in parallel on it .
It has to be nanotube .
Steel is n't anywhere near good enough .
With nanotubes — they 've measured it as handling almost 6 million pounds per square inch .
And it 's only 30 % denser than water , so it 's strong enough and light enough — but it 's a bit expensive .
How expensive is it ?
( Laughs ) Carbon nanotubes , if you buy them at $ 75 million a ton ... So you can actually buy these now ?
Oh yeah .
I could … wait a second , what if I just wanted one nanotube .
( Laughs )
Well , one nanotube , you 'd blow away with your breath .
In fact , you 'd blow away an entire pound of the things .
Anyway , the elevator takes about a hundred thousand tons , so unless the price comes down , that 's $ 7.5 trillion worth of elevator cable .
But my guess is that the stuff will come down to cents per kilogram .
There 's a neat method that 's not really been sufficiently investigated .
If you can figure out how to get metal solvent to precipitate nanotubes ... you 're in business !
How long would it take the power satellite to pay back the energy that it takes to get itself into orbit ?
It takes roughly a gigawatt of power to drive the motors that drag all this stuff up into orbit .
You wind up with a five gigawatt power satellite .
It takes one day for this thing to re-pay the energy .
When it comes online , it 's generating 5 gigawatts every day .
After you account for everything on it — all the energy to refine the metals and make the solar cells , or whatever else you 're using — it may well take something like a hundred days .
But you get 24 - hour sunlight , unfiltered by clouds , and no night .
And you can really use much lighter structures for it .
The idea is that the cable would bring up enough materials to build one .
So if you 're talking about building 60 or 70 power satellites in a year 's time , that would displace all the existing coal plants in the U.S .
And if you keep doing it , in a few years you displace all of them in the entire world .
Is there anything you can imagine that might go wrong with these solar panels ?
Oh , tons of things can go wrong with it .
One of the nasty problems is you 've got to clean all the stuff out of lower orbits .
Space junk .
Yeah , you 've got to clean up the space junk .
So part of the project is 50 or 100 ion tugs that are capable of running around and gathering up all this stuff .
Sounds like Pac - Man .
If I remember correctly , you 're talking about 50 square miles , the size of a medium - sized city ?
And where might we try locating this thing , on the ground ?
You gotta put it on the equator , or really close .
There 's only one place that the U.S. owns that 's on the Equator — it 's called Baker Island .
It 's right smack out in the middle of the Pacific .
It 's 13 miles north of the equator , but if you put a ship anchored 12 miles south of there , it 'd still be in U.S. territorial waters .
And guess what we use for a ship ?
Yeah ?
The Enterprise .
Well , that belongs to the Navy .
So you get the Navy 's cooperation ?
Is that in the plan ?
I think so .
The US government is going to give up a perfectly good island that they could put prisoners on ?
( Laughs )
The point is to put it under U.S. law , maybe .
That 's the trick .
I do n't know whether you want to do that or not , but if you do — that 's the place you can do it .
You actually need the Enterprise , because you need the initial power to get the thing up there .
The Enterprise puts out about two - tenths to the gigawatt .
So you can bootstrap this thing .
The Enterprise is due to be decommissioned in seven years .
So we 've got seven years to put the business plan together .
It 's nuclear - powered , right ?
Yes , it 's the first nuclear - powered aircraft carrier .
In seven years , the carbon nanotubes can perhaps come down in price a little bit .
I imagine that once they start being used more , the price on those should come down quite a bit .
Is there stuff being made out of this now ?
What are likely to be some of the first products that will be made from these before we build a space elevator ?
There are a few things that are being made out of them now .
They 're used for the scanning probes on scanning / tunneling microscopes , for instance .
But they 're going to be useful for all kinds of things .
A quarter - inch cable made from carbon nanotubes can pick up a 150 - ton locomotive up with these things .
When can I hold a carbon nanotube in my hand … something made out of carbon nanotubes ?
If it was a really fine tube stretched really tight — like , say a thousandth of an inch in diameter — and you ran your hand through the thing , you 'd have two pieces of hand .
Let 's go back to your origins .
You 've been interested in space for a really long time .
Three decades ago we had the L5 Society .
I 've heard that the guy who now runs NASA Ames is sort of into the Gerard O'Neill concept of space colonies , so maybe that will come back .
What do you think has happened with the movement towards space , and do you see some hope in the civilian programs ?
What do you think about human beings moving up there ?
I do n't think it 's going to happen .
Never ?
No .
Not to any serious extent .
And the reason is … Second Life .
By the time we have the ability to get into space cheaply , it 's going to be late 2030s or early 2040's .
We may well be so far into the Singularity time that there wo n't be hardly any population left .
Really ?!
So that 's your analysis .
You think that human beings will have been replaced ?
Or we 'll have a Singularitarian disaster of some sort ?
I do n't know .
Even a singularity that is n't a disaster could easily wind up removing people 's desire to go into space .
Space was an adventure .
There 's also the idea that humans need a frontier .
You think that disappears into cyberspace ?
It could easily happen .
I was amazed by the fact that there are 300,000 people in Second Life , a year after it started .
Yeah , I actually suspect that this is the Second Life , and that 's the Third Life .
And each version of it seems a little worse than the previous one .
Returning to our creepy friends in Scientology , there 's a religion written by a science fiction writer .
Rumor is , that L. Ron Hubbard started the religion to prove that he could .
But it 's sort of a science fictional religion .
And certainly the areas that you 've dealt with in your life have sort of a science fictional aspect also .
So it 's like some science fictional battle .
There seems to be a great novel in there somewhere .
Yeah , it 's kind of interesting .
My own connection with it started clear back when I was in 7th grade , and my mother read me Farmer in the Sky Which is not by Hubbard , it 's by Robert Heinlein Heinlein .
Hubbard was , at best , a third - rate science fiction writer .
But he did manage to latch on to a technology that indeed works — it parts people with their money .
By the way , if you want to find my theory paper on why this occurs , just Google sex drugs and cults
The federal Fish and Wildlife Service took the first step yesterday toward declaring that the emperor penguin and nine other species of penguin need the protections of the Endangered Species Act .
One of the factors to be examined in the birds ’ decline will be the impact of climate change on their habitat .
Acting on a petition by the Center for Biological Diversity , an environmental group based in Arizona , the service said it had enough evidence to begin a full - scale review of the 10 groups of penguins .
The review is to determine things like the rates of decline and their possible causes .
One possibility is commercial fishing , which can affect the birds directly when they are caught in nets , or can provide competition for their prey , like the tiny shrimp known as krill .
Other factors to be studied include habitat loss , predators and climate change , officials of the service said in a conference call yesterday .

The penguins may join a short but growing list of species , including polar bears and two corals found off Florida , whose survival is deemed at risk in part because of the increasing warmth of the atmosphere and the oceans .

FOX and CBS have both recently refused to air ads for condoms that emphasize their use as a birth control method .
When interviewed by the New York Times , a FOX rep said , that the decision was based on their policy that condom ads " must stress health - related issues rather than the prevention of pregnancy . "
In other words , it is okay to educate consumers about STDs , but empowering them to make reproductive choices is beyond the purview of two of our nation 's most sex - saturated networks .
You can read Courtney 's full take on this at Alternet :
It is inexcusable that television networks , one of the best public sites for widespread education about safer sex , is acting coy at the cost of young women 's fullest lives .
The first time I met 23 - year - old Marvelyn Brown at a Washington , D.C. , luncheon celebrating young women 's achievements , she reached for her lemonade and I noticed a tiny red ribbon tattooed on her hand .
Marvelyn and I got to talking , and I learned that she had been diagnosed with HIV at the age of 19 .
She contracted it from unprotected sex with a boy she described as " prince charming " back in her hometown of Nashville , Tenn .
Her mother , whose only attempt at sex education was " just do n't get pregnant , " begged Marvelyn to tell everyone she had cancer instead .

Clean and green …
Via : Guardian :
Armed groups in Colombia are driving peasants off their land to make way for plantations of palm oil , a biofuel that is being promoted as an environmentally friendly source of energy .
Surging demand for “ green ” fuel has prompted rightwing paramilitaries to seize swaths of territory , according to activists and farmers .
Thousands of families are believed to have fled a campaign of killing and intimidation , swelling Colombia ’s population of 3 million displaced people and adding to one of the world ’s worst refugee crises after Darfur and Congo .
Several companies were collaborating by falsifying deeds to claim ownership of the land , said Andres Castro , the general secretary of Fedepalma , the national federation of palm oil producers .
“ As a consequence of the development of palm by secretive business practices and the use of threats , people have been displaced and [ the businesses ] have claimed land for themselves , ” he said .
His claim was backed up by witnesses and groups such as Christian Aid and the National Indigenous Organisation of Colombia .

Jesus Curses a Tree Mark 11:12-13
The next day , as they went out from Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
He noticed a fig tree with leaves in the distance .
A new bill introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday would force cable operators to offer a family tier of programming , along with an " opt- out " à la carte cable programming option .
At the same time , it would apply broadcast indecency standards that restrict indecent programming to the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM to cable and satellite networks .
The Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007 is cosponsored by Rep. Daniel Lipinski ( D - IL ) and Rep. Jeff Fortenberry ( R-NE ) and would be the à la carte law that Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin says is necessary .
The bill has not yet appeared on the Library of Congress web site , but Ars was able to obtain a copy of the legislation from Rep. Lipinski's office .
Tiers and à la carte
The bill has something for everyone who has been advocating for à la carte cable .
Those concerned by the amount of programming available on cable that 's inappropriate for young eyes should be pleased , as there 's a very real " think of the children " thread running through the bill .
" Of those homes with children subscribing to cable service , the vast majority subscribe to expanded basic cable service , " notes the bill .
For that reason , the bill would mandate the creation of " real family tiers of programming , " which the bill defines as all channels in the expanded basic tier aside from those carrying programming rated TV - Mature or TV - 14 between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm .
Those who are tired of paying for channels that they never watch will like the bill 's opt - out provision , which will give cable and satellite subscribers the ability to cancel channels on an individual basis .
The legislation says that anyone electing to do so would receive a " credit on the monthly bill ... for such blocked channels in an amount equal to the amount that such distributor pays for the right to provide such blocked channel . "
That rumbling you 're hearing is the heavy - duty lobbying machines of the cable companies being revved up and put into gear .
Cable and satellite providers have consistently opposed à la carte programming , saying that it would raise overall programming costs while dooming niche networks that have a limited audience .
A couple of cable companies — most notably Time Warner — have created family tiers , but those are the exception , rather than the rule .
And despite all the discussion about à la carte cable , consumers are generally indifferent to it and unrealistic about its price .
Applying broadcast standards to cable
Moving beyond à la carte and family tiers , the legislation would extend indecent programming restrictions that are currently applied to terrestrial TV to cable and satellite networks .
" In accordance with the indecency and profanity policies and standards applied by the [ FCC ] to broadcasters , as such policies and standards are modified from time to time , not transmit any material that is indecent or profane on any channel in the expanded basic tier of such distributor " except between 10 PM and 6 AM .
Rep. Lipinski and FCC chairman Kevin Martin , who has advocated for expanded indecency regulations , believe that parents need government help in protecting their children from objectionable content .
" In today 's culture , parents are increasingly worried that their children are exposed to obscene , indecent , and violent programming , " Rep. Lipinski said in a statement .
" While there is no doubt that parents are the first line of defense in protecting their kids , clearly they need more help . "
With the parental controls built into every television set , set - top box , and DVR being sold these days , the need for such legislation seems questionable at best .
Unlike broadcast television , which is available to anyone with a TV and an antenna , people subscribe to and pay for cable / satellite .
Those who are concerned about the possibility of indecent programming during the daytime already have several options available to them , including not subscribing to cable or using some of the technological means available to block objectionable content .
Bush : ' I 'm credible because I read the intelligence ' Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 24 , 2007 Print This Email This
In a Thursday morning press conference , President George W. bush insisted that his message on the threat to America from Al Qaida in Iraq was credible because he was relying on US intelligence that provided a reasonable warning .
" I 'm credible because I read the intelligence , " Bush said when a reporter asked if his warning in a Wednesday speech at the US Coast Guard Academy , based on two - year old intelligence , could be trusted .
He went on , " If I was trying to politicize it , I would have dropped it before the 2006 Elections ...
It 's my job as President to tell people the threats we face and what we 're doing about it . "
While answering the question , the President appeared to have a message for the 2008 candidates for President , as well .
" They are a threat to your children , David , and whoever is in the Oval Office better understand that and take measures to protect the American people , " he said .
The President also acknowledged that his troop escalation strategy , and the announcement of the September deadline for a report from General David Petraeus on its progress , would result in a likely increase in violence and bloodshed in Iraq .
" It could make August a tough month , because what they 're going to try to do is kill as many people as they can to try and influence the debate here at home .
Do n't you find that interesting ?
I do , that they recognize that the death of innocent people could shake our will , " the President explained .
But he said whatever violence level results in Iraq , it was up to General Petraeus to assess the progress of the ' troop escalation . '
" You want politicians making those decisions , or do you want commanders on the ground making those decisions ? " he asked .
On defining victory , the President said it would not come in the short term .
" The American people want to know when , when are you going to win ? " he said .
" Victory will come when that country is stable enough to be an ally in the war on terror and govern itself and defend itself .
And one of the things that appealed to me about Baker - Hamilton is that it will provide a long - term basis for that likely to happen , assuming the Iraqi government invites us to stay there . "
On Iran and its nuclear program , the President said that he would seek to expand the United Nations sanctions regime against the country .
" We need to strengthen our sanctions regime , I just spoke to Condoleezza Rice , we will work with our European partners to develop further sanctions , " he said , adding that the matter will be discussed with Russia and China 's Presidents .
The President was dismissive of the continuing controversy over the firing of the US Attorneys .
" It 's interesting how you started your question , ' over the last months , ' " he noted .
" This investigation is taking a long time , it 's being drug out , and I suspect for political reasons , I called it grand political theater . "
He also reiterated that he would not seek the Attorney General 's resignation .
" I 've got confidence in Al Gonzales doing the job , " he said .
When asked if he was worried whether his proposal on immigration would get locked up in electoral politics , Bush offered a detailed defense of the bill he is backing .
" The bill essentially says that before any other reforms take place , certain benchmarks will be met when it comes to securing the border .
Last year , during the debate , people said well let 's have security first .
That 's exactly what the bill does , " he said of how the bill would crack down on illegal immigration .
He further suggested that his critics not get caught up in the immigration reform proposal 's details .
" It 's easy to find something to be against in this bill .
All it takes is to take one little aspect of it and ignore the comprehensive nature and how good it is , " Bush argued .
He concluded by urging Congress to rise above politics in order to pass this reform .
" The question is : Will members of Congress rise above politics ?
I will , " he asked and answered .
" I 'm going to continue to reach out to members of Congress from both parties and call upon them to take the lead and show the political courage necessary to get the bill to my desk as quickly as possible . "
And the hits just keep on coming ...
The Gavel :
At 10:00 a.m. the Oversight Committee ( held ) a hearing , " FEMA 's Response to Reports of Toxic Trailers . "
The Committee will hold a hearing investigating formaldehyde levels in FEMA trailers provided for victims of the Gulf Coast hurricanes and FEMA 's response to these reports .
The Committee will hear from current residents occupying FEMA trailers , experts who are familiar with the health impact of formaldehyde , and from FEMA Administrator Paulison .
Formaldehyde is a chemical used in paint and adhesives , and is classified as a " known carcinogen " by the International Agency for Research on Cancer .
Reports of high formaldehyde levels found in FEMA issued trailers and FEMA 's response raise serious public health concerns .
Supplemental Memo and Exhibits
Waxman : " Another FEMA official wrote , the office of general counsel has advised ‘ We do not do testing , because it would imply FEMA 's ownership of this issue . '
Early in the process , due to the perseverance of a pregnant mother with a four month old child , FEMA did test one occupied trailer .
The results showed that their trailer had formaldehyde levels 75 times higher than the maximum workplace exposure levels recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health .
The mother evacuated the trailer .
FEMA then stopped testing other trailers . "

God and power are firmly linked in the US political scene
In the last election , President George W Bush , a born - again Christian , won the support of the vast majority of evangelicals , while his Democratic opponent John Kerry talked as little as possible about his own Catholicism .
But in the crowded field of candidates this time , it is the Democrats who are finding it easier to describe how their faith in Jesus informs their political beliefs and experience .
Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , and former senator John Edwards , appeared in a cable TV prime - time special .
They opened themselves up to questioning by some evangelical leaders on the issues that have traditionally wounded Democratic candidates in recent campaigns : support for abortion rights , and same - sex marriage .
Three of the Republican candidates at a recent primary debate were happy to admit that they did not believe in Darwinian evolution , due to their Biblically - founded beliefs .
This has got to be real , and authentic
Burns Strider , adviser to Hillary Clinton
So what lies behind the new Democratic candidates ' confidence in professing their faith in public ?
Is it just a question of - in effect - playing the " God card " with a view to peeling off as many evangelicals as possible ?
" One of the passions I have in doing this work for my party , and my candidate , is not to play that card , " said Burns Strider , who has a key advisory role on " faith outreach " , right at the heart of Hillary Clinton 's campaign team .
A native of the Baptist Deep South , he acknowledged that Democrats in the centre lost touch with a base that once lent them significant support , but that using faith testimony just for the sake of it would not wash .
" There 's nothing monochromatic about the evangelical community ... this has got to be real , and authentic , " he added .
The Obama campaign also has a full - time senior staffer working on faith outreach .
All candidates are aware of the positive impact of targeting religious " values - voters " in the 2006 Congressional elections .
' Source of tension '
But in purely electoral terms , there is a danger for Democratic candidates in lunging too far towards the faithful , and away from the secular , non-religious voter .
John Green is the senior fellow in religion and American politics at the Pew Forum , in Washington DC .
He said : " It 's possible that too much talk of religion might drive those votes away . "
Who can say more rosaries than the next person in a certain given amount of time , hardly seems to me , to be a qualification
Democratic Congressman Pete Stark
On Capitol Hill , it is a sign of just how important religion is to US politics that only one member of Congress has ever admitted to being an atheist - and that admission came just a few months ago .
The BBC's Heart and Soul programme visited Democratic Congressman Pete Stark , of California , in his busy ground - floor office , to find out what reaction there had been to his declaration .
He said the vast majority of e-mails he had received were from secularists around the world , praising his courage , and most of the critical response had been from Christians who said they " felt sorry " for his inability to embrace God .
On the presidential race , he had blunt advice : " Who can say more rosaries than the next person in a certain given amount of time , hardly seems to me , to be a qualification .
" I 'd like to hear much more specifics about how they plan to get us universal health care , " he said .
Pledge of allegiance
In the US , where freedom to practise religion - or to have no religion at all - is enshrined in the constitution , the consequences of being an atheist are electorally dire for anybody seeking public office .
Until a few years ago , the Colorado businessman Dave Habecker had served on his local town council for 13 years .
One of his fellow councillors successfully introduced the reciting of the national pledge of allegiance - in response to the Iraq war - as a sign of support for US troops , said Mr Habecker .
Religion is part of everyday life for many Americans
Ever since the mid-1950s , the pledge has contained the phrase " Under God " and at the height of the anti-communist era , US bank notes were also changed to include the inscription : " In God We Trust " .
Mr Habecker refused to stand and recite the pledge , and after being branded unpatriotic , was forced to enter a fresh election contest to remove him from office .
He lost by some 300 votes .
" I do n't know that anybody feels elated that I was removed from office for this reason , " he told the programme .
" Deep down they know that I was removed for my religious beliefs , which is anti-American .
We brag about being the freest country in the world .
Why do we coerce our citizens to stand and recite a pledge of allegiance ?
It 's a paradox . "
While it may be virtually impossible to survive in office without faith in a supreme being , it remains to be seen how successful the Democratic Party 's new confidence in the power of personal testimony will prove to be with a divided and volatile electorate .

On one side is an array of prominent Jewish community leaders and institutions saying that such criticism plays into the hands of Muslim radical groups and other extremists .
On the other side , left - wing Jewish writers and academics insist that basic freedom of expression is at stake .
Some British Jewish voices have warned of an atmosphere of ' McCarthyism ' reminiscent of the anti-Communist witchhunts in 1950s America .
The current dispute erupted earlier this year in the United States , home to the world 's largest diaspora Jewish community , with an essay published by the American Jewish Committee .
The AJC urged the community to ' confront ' those Jews who had joined in the ' verbal onslaught against Zionism and the Jewish state ' .
The essay denounced some critics by name , including prominent historian Tony Judt and Tony Kushner , the Pulitzer Prize - winning author of the play Angels in America
The heated argument escalated further with a feature on the dispute in the New York Times .
Judt , who was criticised in the article for having denounced Israel as ' arrogant , aggressive , anachronistic , infantile ... [ and ] immoral , ' told the New York Times he was convinced that leading Jewish voices simply wanted to stifle any harsh criticism of Israel .
But in a separate article , Boston - based sociologist Shulamit Reinharz - wife of the president of America 's leading Jewish university , Brandeis - rejected the idea that Jewish left - wingers could question the very existence of Israel without imperilling Jews .
' Most would say they are simply anti-Zionists , not anti-Semites .
But I disagree , because in a world where there is only one Jewish state , to oppose it vehemently is to endanger Jews . '
In London , a similar battle has erupted around academic Tony Lerman , head of think - tank the Institute of Jewish Policy Research ( JPR ) .
At issue are remarks he made before taking up the post in which he questioned the viability of Israel as a Jewish state .
He suggested replacing it with a Jewish - Arab state that would also offer a home for Palestinian refugees .
Four JPR directors , and one of its honorary patrons , the Tory peer Lord Kalms , have resigned in protest .
Against this background , a new British group calling itself Independent Jewish Voices is planning to launch tomorrow on Comment Is Free , the Guardian 's and Observer 's online comment site .
The group - including more than 100 writers , academics , doctors , lawyers , actors and others - objects to what it terms the misconception that British Jews ' speak with one voice and that this voice supports the Israeli government 's policies ' .
Kalms has insisted that he has no problem with criticism of individual Israeli government policies , but has suggested that Lerman 's questioning of the Jewish state 's existence risks providing cover for extremists who want Israel destroyed .
Writing in the Jewish Chronicle on Friday , he said he had been told that he should be ' tolerant of Mr Lerman 's views ' .
But , he argued , ' that is difficult when he proposes the suicide of the state of Israel . '
Echoing Kalms 's view , a former Australian Jewish community leader , Isi Leibler , also wrote in the Chronicle : ' How can a person publicly state that Israel should be displaced as a Jewish state ... [ and ] still occupy the role of executive director of Anglo - Jewry 's principal think - tank ? '
But JPR chairman Peter Levy - who also chairs the Chronicle - voiced strong support for Lerman and denounced the ' deeply disturbing , orchestrated campaign ' against him .
' The people responsible do not seem to value independent thinking , and wish to prevent discussion of matters that may be uncomfortable but are essential for us to address .
Their campaign demeans our community ... and should be brought to an end , ' Levy said .
a web - framework using Armed Bear Common Lisp as a Java Servlet
Rationale Current Status License Structure Tutorial
Sourceforge page
Overview
The Armed Bear Common Lisp that works on top of Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) can allow us to use the Common Lisp for web application development , and use all the mature Java web development platform features and libraries while programming in the dynamic and extensible Common Lisp language .
Typicaly Java web applications are implemented via the Java Servlets API .
Each servlet is a Java class , and servlets are executed in a Servlet Container , such as Apache Tomcat .
Thus , to Java web applications with Common Lisp , we 'd need to make a bridge between a Java Servlets and ABCL .
While there can be different approaches ( for example , we can try to create servlets with ABCL ) , most simple and natural one is to create a Java Servlet , that will load ABCL and forward web requests to ABCL .
ABCL will generate output for response to this requests .
Such servlet will act as bridge between Java Servlet Container and the ABCL application side .
One can ask the question , why use Java if we have plenty of other Common Lisp implementations ?
Well , plenty of Common Lisp implementations can be used for web development , but usage of Java platform has its advantage .
Most CL implementations do not have properly implemented native mulithreading , while Java , and thus ABCL , have full and stable support for threads -- it can make use of multiple cores / CPUs .
Maturity of CL web frameworks is questionable , while Java is very widespread and mature .
Also , a lot of libraries ara available for Java platform , and some of them might not be available for Common Lisp .
While some of them can be used via FFI , it wo n't be feasible for functions that require high performance ( FFI calls have their overhead )
There 's also a question of hosting -- it might be easier to find Java hosting rather than Lisp web hosting .
From hosting point of view , ABCL - web application is an ordinary Java Web Application , no installation of additional stuff is required .
Also , in some cases integration with existing solutions might be desired / required , or developers want have an option to easily migrate from Common Lisp to Java -- for example , they can code prototype in Common Lisp , and then migrate to Java for production high - performance system .
The current status is alpha .
Working prototypes have been created and tested , but there are known issues , this ABCL - web is not recommended for production environments .
The current project goal is to provide working prototype .
The security have not being tested , thus installing ABCL - web on your webserver will open security holes , upto control from remote !
Current prototype might have problems installing into arbitrary Servlet Container , Servlet Container should be somewhat tuned -- security disabled , etc .
abcl - web is distributed under LGPL license , with clarifications from LLGPL applicable .
( while components , such us ABCL itself , may come with different licenses ) .
To clarify this : you can use this however you want with your web applications , but if you modify ABCL - web , we 'd like to see your patches and apply them if they are useful in general .
runs on variety of platforms and servlet containers ( in theory , so far )
can use any Java library transparently
SLIME ( GNU Emacs ) IDE ( integrated development environment )
dynamic development -- you can write or change function , and it will be immidiately available
just - in - time debugging -- if error happens , you can debug it , fix it ( changing some functions , for example ) , and rerun processing -- and browser will just see a normal ( fixed ) page as if no error happened !
Read Tutorial for further explanations .
The goal of this project is not just to enable some development possibilities , but a complete framework , so development will not only be possible , but will be effective , easy , productive and fun !
Thus , we are going to provides all tools needed for development ( if there are more than one way available , we are going to provide all ways for user to choose ) .
Thus , we divide abcl - web into following layers :
The Servlet Bridge passes requests from Servlet Container to the Lisp interpreter .
It 's also responsible to load the Lisp and initialize web application .
We also want to debug our code , thus we have two servlets -- LspExec and LspDebug .
They are Java class files .
If we want debugging , we first launch LspDebug ( you can run it on the Apache start ) .
LspDebug loads the Lisp interpreter , and then loads file " lisp/dbgrstart.lisp " , that is supposed to initialize a debugging interface .
( since we use SLIME , dbgrstart.lisp loads and initializes the SLIME debugging server ) .
dbgrstart.lisp is not critical to LspDebug -- it can work without it .
Note , that unless you specify autostart , debugger will be loaded on first access to that servlet -- first access will take a long time , upto minute .
Once loaded , LspDebug will either tell that it failed to load interpreter , or will provide a form where you can write the lisp code .
It passes code you write to interpreter , and prints the results , or exception if code produces an error .
Please note , that it 's a very low - level debugger , and it 's only intended to be used for diagnosing some weird bootstrap problems .
Also , you should note that this debugger uses " throwing debugging hook " -- even if you 'll load SLIME , it will report errors the same ugly -- but stable -- way .
On the production servers , LspDebug should either be deleted , or access to it should be limited , since if you run it , anyone can execute arbitrary code on behalf of your webserver !.
LspExec is supposed to be loaded directly on production servers -- it 's able to initialize interpreter too , but it wo n't load dbgrstart .
lisp though .
Current version is able to detect that Swank ( SLIME backend ) is initialized , and to use SLIME 's debugging hook .
If no swank is found , any condition signaled will be critical and will be displayed instead of the page .
After installing hook , LspExec will try to load lisp / servlet - loader .lisp file .
If servlet loading process will have some fixable problems , you 'll be able to debug it in SLIME and continue process .
When file is loaded successfully , it will try to find symbol CL - USER ::* SERVLET *.
If it finds that symbol , and it's a lisp function , initialization is considered successful .
As for requests , LspExec will either report problem ( no interpreter or no servlet ) , or will pass request and response objects to that lisp function .
Lisp function should use response object to do output .
If lisp function throws , condition 's class will be displayed .
web.xml file can be also considered a part of bridge , but it 's quite simple .
If your webapp is called lispwebapp , it will normally map LspDebug to http://myserver/lispwebapp/servlet/LspDebug and LspExec to http://myserver/lispwebapp/servlet/LspExec
( you can change it ) .
It should also automatically start LspDebug on debugging environment and LspExec on production .
The first level of loader consists of two lisp files -- dbgrstart.lisp and servlet - loader.lisp .
dbgrstart.lisp is used to to start a debugger -- SLIME , and initialize some parameters .
Note that version of SLIME should be exactly same as you use in Emacs !
Remote debugging is possible , but it requires some special tweaks .
servlet - loader.lisp is used to compile and load all required libraries and application code .
For current version , any problem compiling / loading library is a critical error -- most likely you 'll need to restart Servlet Container ( tomcat ) after such errors -- but that should n't worry you after you setup all required libs .
The loading of application files ( that are changed more frequently ) is not a critical errror -- normally , you 'll be able to debug it via SLIME , update your files , and restart loading process .
servlet - loader.lisp launches second - level initialization -- servlet.lisp file .
Traditionally , servler.lisp creates packages , specifies Java classes being used and proceeds next - level initialization .
We could use asdf for neat loading process , but so far we use simple loader , which allows retry loading each individual file .
In current implementation , the servlet.lisp file also defines top - level servlet function -- servlet1 - service , which calls analyze - request , process - request and generate - output functions , allowing restart at each level .
Normally , web frameworks should just redefine those functions .
Currently the jfli-abcl library is used .
There is an alternative , but jfli-abcl is faster .
You just specify Java class classes you want to use in the loader -- ( def- java-class " java.io.InputStreamReader " ) -- and use package " java.io " unless you want to use qualified name | java.io| : InputStreamReader , and then you can create object -- ( InputStreamReader.new some params ) , and call methods -- ( InputStreamReader . read reader param pam pam ) -- first parameter should be class itself .
Normally you write all classes you use in the servlet.lisp , but you can also load new classes in REPL .
The roots of simple framework is defined in servlet.lisp -- they are functions analyze - request , process - request and generate - output .
analyze - request should identify which request we are going to serve and to extract form data , user session and other parameters .
Than both analyzed - request and normal request are passed to process - request .
Process - request should perform business logic operations and produce some data for output .
generate - output formats recieved data and sends them to response object .
( i believe it 's some kind of Dispatcher View pattern ) .
The goal of three - phase processing is that you can debug each part separately , so if generate - output is broken , you can have request parsed and processed , so you can just re-launch generate - output .
You can find that using simple framework for bigger projects would be overkill .
We can offer you two flavours of frameworks -- with auto- continuations and manual - continuations , more to come later :) .
In current lispwebapp examples , web - engine -- ' manual - continuations ' is used .
LML2 is supported / recommended .
( html ( : p ( ( :a :href " http://lml2.b9.com/ " ) " LML2 " ) " is supported " ) )
( html ( : p ( : princ (+ 2 2 ) ( dynamic - code - here ) ) ) )
JDBC is accessible through jfli-abcl , you can connect to MySQL , PostgreSQL or whatever .
Alternatively , you can use Jena -- Semantic Web Framework -- and have semantic - level database !

It 's like the special news report about the idiot who got screwed out of being a huge , e-bay mark - up jerk .
She might not have known about the limit , but I guarantee the camera crew that followed her around did .
This is almost enjoyable as watching her get mugged , although not quite .

The ingredient that helps give " salt & vinegar " potato chips that tangy snap is the key to a new waterproof coating for protecting concrete from water damage , according to a study scheduled for the August 1 issue of ACS ' Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research .
Awni Al - Otoom and colleagues in Jordan point out that concrete 's unique properties have made it the world 's most widely used structural material .
Concrete , however , is so porous that water soaks in , corroding steel reinforcing bars and meshes that strengthen concrete roads and buildings and causing cracks as water expands and contracts during freeze - thaw cycles .
Sealants are commercially available , but they have serious shortcomings , the study notes .
In the new report , researchers describe the use of sodium acetate as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly concrete sealant .
One of sodium acetate 's many uses is in flavored potato chips .
In laboratory studies using freshly made concrete , the researchers showed that sodium acetate seeps into pores in concrete and then hardens and crystallizes upon exposure to water .
The resultant swelling blocks entry of additional moisture , they said .
Under dry conditions , the crystals shrink back to their original size and allow moisture to evaporate .
The net result is " a significant reduction in water permeability , " that " can be expected to increase the service life of the concrete , " the report said .
Article : " Crystallization Technology for Reducing Water Permeability into Concrete "
Susan Milligan writes in the Globe today about Mr. G and his trump card – September 11 , 2001 .
You remember , right ?
That was the day some three thousand people got their asses killed by fanatics .
Mr. G harps on that day constantly in his lust for Presidential power .
The man ’s walking on the bones of the dead to get another job in politics .
Milligan notes that just six seconds into a speech in Delaware :
“ I ’ll tell you the reason I wear this flag , ” ( Giuliani said ) pointing to the American flag pin on his lapel .
“ Before September 11 , I only wore this flag rarely .
But I started wearing it everyday now .
Each time I wear it , it reminds me of September 11 . ”
Nice touch , Mr. G. Too bad the dead ca n’t vote , eh ?
But the thing about 9/11 is that no one seems to be able to identify what Mr. G did that merits his iconic status as a hero of that day .
Even his supporters have trouble with that :
Giuliani ’s supporters lavish him with praise for his handling of 9/11 .
At a recent Giuliani event , many said they could not recall any specific thing Giuliani did the day of the attacks .
But , they say , Giuliani ’s very presence in the streets of Manhattan after the attack – a stark contrast to President Bush , who was absent from public view for hours after the tragedy – displayed strong leadership and courage .
“ He took control , ” said Carolyn Mercadante , 70 , a Delaware voter who came to see Giuliani speak .
“ Just the fact that he was such a presence there ” in New York the day of the attacks , said 67 - year - old Bill Uranko of Middleton , Del. , when asked to explain what impressed him about Giuliani ’s Sept. 11 performance .
“ You could see he was visibly moved by what happened . ”
Well , hell ’s bells , I was visibly moved too .
How about I get elected President ?
Damn , that ’s it , I ’m officially announcing my candidacy for President of the United States .
Send me some money , folks .
We ’re gonna rout these pretenders .
So , let ’s see , Rudy pretty much just walked around wiping the dust off himself .
Just like everybody else was doing .
He did n’t save anybody ’s life .
He did n’t dig in the ruins for survivors .
He did n’t even have a place to go because the disaster command center he set up years before was in the World Trade Center , at his insistence .
You know , in one of the towers that went down , in the towers that were the biggest , most obvious targets in the city .
Sure , you remember , the towers that were attacked in 1993 .
Smart man , that Mr. G .
Then we have the firefighter , from Maryland , who thinks Mr. G “ stands out as someone who would protect the nation .
‘ We need a person who is going to take on the terrorists .
It ’s the real thing . ”
What ’s this guy think Mr. G is gonna do ?
Go to the Middle East and challenge al Qaeda to a fist fight ?
“ Take on the terrorists ” ?
Give me a break .
Mr. G not only could n’t protect his own city , he refused to take steps that would have protected the city ’s first responders .
After the 1993 attacks , he knew that the radio system used by firefighters and police was a failure .
He knew there were systems that would work in disaster situations .
He refused to provide police and firefighters with a proper system .
In effect , he signed the death warrants of hundreds of firefighters in the towers on 9/11 .
Atta boy , Mr. G !
And yet , here ’s Rep. Dave Reichert , Washington State chairman of Mr. G ’s campaign there .
“ The mayor may have more credibility in this [ antiterrorism ] area than some of the other candidates .
He has the experience to back up his comments . ”
No , he does n’t , Dave .
He did n’t do anything to fight terrorism on or before 9/11 .
He has n’t done anything since to fight terrorism .
In fact , he blew off the Iraq Commission , of which he was reputed to be a member , so he could go out and campaign .
You ’re blowing smoke , Dave , and it ’s coming out of your butt .
And finally , Fred Siegel , a history professor who wrote a book on Mr. G , said , “ Giuliani governed against the grain .
He alienated every interest group in New York , which is why he accomplished so much . ”
I would note that George W. Bush , the current sicko occupant of the Presidency , has alienated just about everyone on the planet except Tony Blair , by ‘ governing against the grain ’ .
So , what Mr. G is offering us is four to eight more years of Bushian psychopathy as a philosophy of government .
No thanks , Rudy .
Maybe you ought to just go back to New York and get a job digging bone fragments from the sewers around the World Trade Center .
Then you can say you actually did something useful about 9/11 .
Causes of Stress : Rating The Most Stressful Financial Events
The whole subject of finance is one of the most common causes of disagreement and discord in a family , and I ’m sure there has never been a home that has n’t been touched by stress at one point or another due to money .
It ’s a tough subject where issues of power , control and ego are in effect , and where the interplay between these elements has the potential to fuel explosive and problematic conditions at home .
I thought about this a bit and came up with a list of what I think are the most common financial stressors in one ’s life , wondering how well anyone can really prepare for such challenges if they ever arise .
There ’s this saying : “ Even the best laid plans can be foiled . ”
By the unexpected , that is .
Still , we get ready and brace ourselves for what can possibly happen , and hope our financial house can withstand the storms of fate , time and life changes .
The following list is not from a formal study but rather , from my own research and observations : I ’ve discovered that a measuring scale for stress actually exists , and it ’s called the Holmes - Rahe scale .
So I went ahead and assigned points to these events based on the scale , and provided approximate points where events were not officially represented .
Please note that this list is based on the scale but I had to fill in some of the gaps .
I ’ve divided the list into two sections — one that describes typical , ordinary financial stressors which most people inevitably go through , while the other describes stressors due to less likely , but impactful events which may or may not ever happen to you .
The Most Stressful Financial Events You Should Prepare For
Ordinary Life Changes That Affect Your Finances
Financial Events Financial Crisis Units Merging assets due to a marriage 50 Losing a job 47 Retiring 45 Getting “ sandwiched ” and caring for children and parents ( or older family members ) 40 Accommodating new children in the family 39 Changing careers or job responsibilities 32 Launching a business 32 Relocating 30 Spouse leaves work or returns to work 26 Lifestyle changes , deliberate or otherwise 25 Remodeling a house 25 Troubles at work 23 Buying a house 20 Claiming insurance for medical purposes 20
Extraordinary Life Changes That Affect Your Finances
Financial Events Financial Crisis Units Death and losing a breadwinner 100 Dividing assets during divorce 73 Going through probate 50 Enforcing a prenup when the other side is n’t interested 40 Becoming suddenly wealthy , when you need to please everyone 38 Going through bankruptcy or carrying a large debt 31 Going through foreclosure 30 Becoming a scam victim 30 Claiming insurance for disaster 30
Some surprising findings from trends based on the Holmes - Rahe scale : changes in your marital status through marriage , divorce , separation or reconciliation ; changes in your state of employment such as retirement and unemployment ; and changes in your financial status all end up rating higher in the stress scale than ( or at least equal to ) events surrounding a home foreclosure , bankruptcy filing or a personal debt crisis !
Having gone through a few job searches myself , I ca n’t imagine it to be anywhere as close to frightening ( or as stressful ) as a crumbling debt situation .
Could it be because the highly stressful events involve and change your existing relationships more than the less stressful events do ?
The scale can give you some idea of how stressed you are .
However , if you really want further quantification of your scores , you can try out the actual Holmes - Rahe test and see what your risk of serious illness happens to be !
The Most Stressful Occupations In America
CareerCast.com and CNBC provide some coverage on the most stressful jobs in America .
I came up with this table based on the information I found .
Stressful Job
Time Pressure Competition Unemployment Rate Real Estate Agent High Very High 4 % to 7 % Public Relations Officer High Very High 4 % to 7 % Firefighter Very High Low 0 % to 4 % Corporate Executive High High 0 % to 4 % Advertising Manager or Executive Moderate Very High Over 14 % Surgeon Moderate High 0 % to 4 % Taxi Driver Moderate Moderate Over 14 % Traffic Cop / Highway Patrol Moderate Low 0 % to 4 % Commercial Pilot Moderate Low 7 % to 10 %
Work stress is quite common .
Aside from those occupations I ’ve mentioned , what are some other stressful jobs that often make these lists ?
Race car driver , emergency medical technician ( and other professions in this field ) , stock broker , photojournalist and newscaster .
But what about the most stressful job of all ?
Well , if you are the “ President of the United States ” , this could very well be your fate :
Possible before and after ?
Now let ’s take a look at the other side of the coin .
The Jobs Rated Almanac reveals that the following five jobs are the least stressful : medical records technician , janitor , forklift operator , musical instrument repairer and florist .
Here ’s an interesting question : are there people who are just naturally more prone to stress ?
Apparently so .
You can very well be born with a certain vulnerability to stress , as the type of personality you have may play a part in the way you react to and manage high pressure situations .
For instance , people with “ Type A ” personalities — who are driven and anxious by nature — may be more prone to stress .
Certain types of jobs ( such as those that deal with life / death situations ) can also influence one ’s stress levels .
Furthermore , those who are touched by mental illness ( family or self ) may also be more vulnerable to stress ( source : Jobs Rated Almanac ) .
Let ’s see , how many serious bloggers out there have “ Type A ” personalities ?
If you ’re the kind of person who ’s highly anxious , then try various healthy activities ( e.g. yoga ) to help you relax .
It may just help you de-stress !
How Should We Handle Stressful Financial Situations ?
The best way to meet any stressful money situation head on is to prepare .
Granted , it can be difficult to discuss some of these things and make mutual decisions with your partner , and sadly in many cases , it can be pretty much impossible to reach agreement over some issues .
In fact , some events may be so unpalatable to imagine , that you may prefer to “ not even go there ” with your loved one .
Unpleasant or not , for many of the events outlined above , you can certainly work on plans to smoothen your transitions better .
It is always our heartfelt hope that we can somehow stave off these occurrences and if not , wish that we can have the fortitude , maturity and resources to navigate through our situation .

The American fascist would prefer not to use violence .
His method is to poison the channels of public information .
Henry A. Wallace
Even in this state , where President Bush acquired his loyalty to the policy , abstinence cannot be typecast .
Megan Randolph of Dallas , who like Jami Waite just finished high school , believes in the abstinence message .
But she is bothered by courses that try to scare teenagers with harrowing talk of ruined lives .
“ In those classes , there are going to be kids who have had sex and that has n’t happened , ” Ms. Randolph said .
“ So they ’re going to think that does n’t apply to them . ”
Teenagers , she said , crave unfettered information — the kind restricted under federal abstinence education law , which discourages intimacy outside marriage but provides no instruction for safer sex .
At her school , Ms. Randolph , 19 , was the “ sexpert , ” the one girls often called late at night , asking questions .
And this year , before leaving Dallas to attend the Air Force Academy , Ms. Randolph was hailed as volunteer of the year by the area ’s Planned Parenthood — part of abstinence education ’s axis of evil .
In northeastern Texas , advocates of abstinence education vow to fight for their mission because to them , it is not just a matter of sexuality or even public health .
Getting a teenager to the other side of high school without viruses or babies is a bonus , but not the real goal .
They see casual sex as toxic to future marriage , family and even , in an oblique way , opposition to abortion .
“ You have to look at why sex was created , ” Eric Love , the director of the East Texas Abstinence Program , which runs Virginity Rules , said one day , the sounds of Christian contemporary music humming faintly in his Longview office .
“ Sex was designed to bond two people together . ”
To make the point , Mr. Love grabbed a tape dispenser and snapped off two fresh pieces .
He slapped them to his filing cabinet and the floor ; they trapped dirt , lint , a small metal bolt .
“ Now when it comes time for them to get married , the marriage pulls apart so easily , ” he said , trying to unite the grimy strips .
“ Why ?
Because they gave the stickiness away . ”
Attorney for Breonna Taylor grand juror says truth must come out
You know I gotta say something , right ?
I 've been sitting on this one , trying to organize my thoughts carefully before writing something down and putting it up for the world to see .
But I think I 've figured out what I want to say , and I hope to do so with an economy of words , rather than through my usual explosion of prose .
To make it short , I have very little sympathy for these people .
I hate to say it , but that 's the way I honestly feel .
No one deserves to die this way , and the Taliban are assholes .
But those are constants in this equation – this , we already know .
In the end , the only people directly responsible for the hostages ' present predicament are the hostages themselves .
Dude – posing in front of the " Please stay the fuck out of Afghanistan unless you really , really have to go " sign and effectively giving fate the middle finger ... even non-Christian folks surely would have too much of a healthy fear of God to go that far .
But that 's the point , now in 'nit ?
They have an over - developed sense of matyrdom ; or the belief that the rules of the City of Man do n't apply to them , given that they think the Hand of God will keep and protect them , even if they walk in front of a moving train .
Hey , that 's fine – if you 're not dragging your country and the rest of the world into a diplomatic and ethical mess because you 've been swigging at the Kool - Aid too long .
The way I see it , one 's journey into heaven is n't going to be barred by not walking into the Valley of Death in the middle of a war zone , in a country that already has many religions – that , oops , mostly are n't Christian , and have expressly forbidden the teaching of said religion there .
At the threat of your life , by gunpoint , written out in expressed warnings , again and again .
In the unfortunate event that they are killed , I frankly do n't think anyone who approved of them going in the first place – friends or family – has much moral ground to stand on in demanding the early withdrawal of Korean troops .
You know , lots of journalists and other workers were over there doing whatever they felt they had to do , but took what they did and their situations with a certain gravity , a knowledge that they knew the risks , which they accepted and tried to minimize by keeping a low profile , respecting the culture ( or at least doing the required do - diligence to reduce risk for themselves and all in their party ) ; these people were not much of a step above arrogant , ethnocentric , ludicrously self - deluded tourists - as - missionaries who justified their stupidity and arrogance with spreading God 's word .
Do n't get me wrong – I respect anyone who chooses to do so .
But ignoring all reasonable warnings from both the host and even your own governments , running around in a bus all together without the security arrangements that are considered basic to anyone operating there , and blatantly engaging in missionary work while treating the whole thing like a trip to Disneyland – arrgh !
That 's beyond stupid , beyond irresponsible , and eminently selfish .
If and when anyone loses their lives in that group over there , I unfortunately have to say that I have little sympathy in my heart for them , because my soul has been wrenched enough when I saw the look of horror on the face of one of the men beheaded by insurgents a few years ago ; there are few things in my life I regret seeing – that video is one of them .
What sticks out in my mind , as this emotionally exhausting war has dragged on and on , claiming victims on all sides , is the fact that the people who go before them in death at the end of a sword wanted to live and showed it by taking precautions and accepting the challenges and risks inherent to what they were doing .
This is the very definition of courage , and I reserve a special respect for people such as Daniel Pearl , who have risked ( and sometimes lost ) their lives to get the story out , or Jean Chung , the Korean photojournalist who just won a prestigious award for her work in Afghanistan , who is smart , knows her environment , and has the fundamental respect for where she is such that she stays as safe as possible while doing what is inherently dangerous work .
What these deluded missionaries are engaged in is an exercise in profound stupidity and arrogance , which unfortunately just might get them killed .
No one wants them to die ; but I 'm sorry to say that I 'll reserve my grief and emotion – what little there is left at this point in this gruesome war – for people who actually give a shit about their lives and do n't treat what they 're doing like a game .
And for anyone who wants the Korean government to withdraw troops on behalf of these nincompoops who literally up and walked right into the middle of the line of fire and basically handed the Taliban a kiloton of leverage – tell it to Daniel Pearl 's wife , or the other people who lost their lives and behaved like they gave enough of a crap about what they were doing to treat their own lives , as well as the work they were engaged in , with enough respect to go about doing it properly , meaning , in a way far less likely to get them killed , or at least used as hostages .
I 'd like to hear what people like Daniel Pearl 's wife thinks of these people , who seem to take their lives – or , at least , the situation they 're walking into – for a joke .

Here is the official video to Neal Young ’s “ Let ’s Impeach the President ” .
Makes you wonder why a Canadian needs to express what the majority of Americans want and need .
The deal is likely to lead to profound changes for many of the 25,000 residents of the two complexes , where two - thirds of the apartments have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate .
Any new owner paying the equivalent of $ 450,000 per apartment is going to be eager to create a money - making luxury enclave , real estate executives say .
The sale would only add to the seismic cultural shifts already under way in New York City and especially in Manhattan , where soaring housing costs have made the borough increasingly inhospitable to working - class and middle - class residents .
It would be another challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s effort to stabilize and expand the number of affordable apartments in the city .
“ It ’s really sad , ” said Suzanne Wasserman , a historian and filmmaker who has lived in Stuyvesant Town since 1989 .
“ New York has always attracted people who are n’t just interested in money — people interested in culture and poetry and music and dance and those young people who are the creative capital of the city .
They are n’t going to have a place here and probably really do n’t already .
I think it affects everything about city life . ”
Rumors of an impending sale began circulating among residents several years ago when MetLife was in the midst of $ 300 million in upgrades that included new landscaping and playgrounds , spruced - up fountains , new wiring , air conditioning , carpeting and lights .
Rose Associates took over management three years ago .
At the same time , MetLife sought to oust tenants not listed on leases .
And as rents for more apartments hit the legal threshold of $ 2,000 a month , MetLife has been able to charge new tenants market rates for those apartments when they became vacant .
Under that threshold , the rent stabilization law limits increases to a fixed percentage each year for about a million apartments .
About 27 percent of the tenants at Peter Cooper and Stuyvesant Town are now exempt from it and pay market rents .

I ’ve been reviewing a lot of code lately , and I found so many abuses of eval ( ) , that I wanted to blog about it .
But I found that Eric Lippert has done excellent short articles about it right here , and here , and the abuses he blogged about there are exactly the ones I keep seeing in the code I ’ve been reviewing .
So instead , I ’ll blog about something that baffled me a few months back , when eval ( ) simply would n’t work when I used it to evaluate my JSON string .
The scenario was simple : we were getting back JSON strings that represent complex objects from the server side .
Most of them were arrays that contained objects , and it worked perfectly , like demonstrated in my favourite tool jrunscript below :
js > var jsonEmployees = " [ { name : ' Ray ' , role : ' Fixer ' } , { name : ' Rayzor ' , role : ' Cutter ' } ] " ;
js > var employees = eval ( jsonEmployees ) ;
js > employees.
length
2.0
js > employees [ 0] .name
Ray
js > employees [ 0].role
Fixer
However when the JSON string is not an array , but an object , like this , it barfs :
js > var jsonEmployee = " { name : ' Ray ' , role : ' Fixer ' } " ;
js > var employee = eval ( jsonEmployee ) ;
script error : sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.EcmaError : SyntaxError : missing ; before statement ( < STDIN >#1( eval ) # 1 ) in < STDIN ># 1 ( eval ) at line number 1
What happened ?
It says it ’s missing a “ ; ” .
So maybe we need a ; at the end of the object literal :
js > var jsonEmployee = " { name : ' Ray ' , role : ' Fixer ' } ; " ;
js > var employee = eval ( jsonEmployee ) ;
script error : sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.EcmaError : SyntaxError : missing ; before statement ( < STDIN >#1( eval ) # 1 ) in < STDIN ># 1 ( eval ) at line number 1
Hmmm .
Obviously not .
But why ?
I checked and rechecked the JSON syntax in the JSON site , it seemed to be correct .
Putting the object inside an array ( i.e. : “ [{ name : ‘ Ray ’ , role : ‘ Fixer ’ } ] ” ) always works , but why should n’t eval ( ) eval what seems to be a perfectly valid JSON syntax ?
( Actually , strictly speaking , no , it is not a valid JSON syntax although it is valid JavaScript syntax –I realized this later when I incorporated json.js into my app .
But that ’s not why eval ( ) failed .
Keep on reading . )
Ugh , Spec ! Expressions !
Ambiguity !
Have you ever read a language spec ?
I hate language specs ( especially C++’s ) .
But the answer to our question is buried deep somewhere inside the ECMAScript standard , 3rd edition , section 12.4 , about Expression Statement : “ Note that an ExpressionStatement cannot start with an opening curly brace because that might make it ambiguous with a Block . ”
Ahhh , so when we do this :
js > var jsonEmployee = " { name : ' Ray ' , role : ' Fixer ' } ; " ;
eval ( ) gets confused , because it is interpreting the “ { ” as the beginning of a block instead of an object literal !
Fortunately , there are a few ways to get around this .
The easiest one is to add parentheses around the expression .
That is :
js > var jsonEmployee = " ( { name : ' Ray ' , role : ' Fixer ' } ) " ;
js > var employee = eval ( jsonEmployee ) ;
js > employee.name + " , " + employee.role
Ray , Fixer
Alternatively , we can make it obvious to eval ( ) that the expression is an object initializer , by assigning it to a variable within the eval string :
js > var jsonEmployee = " var employee = { name : ' Ray ' , role : ' Fixer ' } ; " ;
js > eval ( jsonEmployee ) ;
js > employee.name + " , " + employee.role
Ray , Fixer
A Better But Picky eval ( ) That Wo n’t Evaluate My Object Literals
eval ( ) works well when used appropriately .
For instance , for the case of my app , using eval ( ) is fine , not evil , because we ’re only using it to parse JSON strings that come from a trusted server ( that is , our own server ) .
It ’s different when the string you ’re eval ( ) - ing ( JSON or otherwise ) comes from some untrusted source .
In that case , it ’s better to use a real JSON parser .
( Remember that JSON is a subset of JavaScript–a JSON parser only parses JSON , and not the rest of JavaScript .
Whereas eval ( ) parses everything .
That said , JSON parser is obviously slower since it has to check that only valid JSON can be eval ( ) - ed. )
Using the JSON parser is simple .
You do n’t even need to add parentheses to get the string parsed .
Just download Douglas Crockford ’s JSON JavaScript library here , include it in your page ( or load it if you ’re running in jrunscript ) , and you ’re set .
Note something about this parser though : it is REALLY strict .
It wo n’t parse perfectly OK object literals like { name : “ Ray ” , age : 31 } . Eval parses this without problems :
js > var jsonRay = " { name : ' Ray ' , age : 31 } " ;
js > var ray = eval ( " ( " + jsonRay + " ) " ) ;
js > ray.name
Ray
js > ray.age
31.0
But when we use the JSON library , only JSON - compliant strings are accepted .
Let ’s try it using jrunscript :
js > load ( " C:\\Documents and Settings\\schemer\\My Documents\\json.js " )
js > var jsonRay = " { name : ' Ray ' , age : 31 } " ;
js > var ray = jsonRay.parseJSON ( ) ;
script error : sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.JavaScriptException : [ object Error ] ( C: \Documents and Settings\schemer\My Documents\json.js#270 ) in C : \Documents and Settings\schemer \My Documents \json.js at line number 270
This string : “ { name : ‘ Ray ’ , age : 31 } ” is not valid JSON !
Check the specification again .
An object has to look like this to be JSON - compliant ( properties names have to be quoted , and with double quotations marks too ) :
{ " name " : " Ray " , " age " : 31 }
And indeed , now the string is parsed correctly into an object .
Note that unlike eval ( ) , we do n’t need to put parentheses around the object initialiser –the parseJSON ( ) method does it for us :
js > var jsonRay = " { \ " name\ " : \ " Ray\ " , \ " age\ " : 31 } " ;
js > var ray = jsonRay.parseJSON ( ) ;
js > ray.name
Ray
js > ray.age
31.0
The fact that the new json.js adds parseJSON ( ) as a method of String ( instead of the old approach of passing the string to JSON. parse ( ) ) changes the way you code , because obviously you ca n’t call parseJSON ( ) on a null or undefined variable .
This JSON library also adds toJSONString ( ) method to JavaScript datatypes , so we can do this :
js > ray.toJSONString ( )
{ " age " : 31 , " name " : " Ray "}
The Conclusion
Use eval ( ) when you can trust the string .
Use parseJSON ( ) otherwise .
( I know , I know , it ’s a lousy conclusion , like a fizzle after a pop or something .
But I ’m getting real sleepy , kay ?
Need to get some sleep . )
It ’s been said by more than one pundit , that Gravel is the “ Zell Miller of the left ” .
I ca n’t really say I disagree with that observation , but it is missing a crucial qualifier : Zell Miller was wrong about virtually everything , and Mike Gravel is absolutely right about virtually everything .
That ’s kind of important .
At least to me .
Gravel represents everything good in an American perspective post -9/11 Bush crime spree ; he ’s not crying –like Dick Durbin actually did when he apologized for rightly comparing the GOP to Brown Shirts - .
He ’s probably barely self - aware , so great is his passion for our reality long ago lost to a malignant media corporatocracy and those who ’ve been successfully hypnotized en-mass by it .
I was hoping Barack Obama would impress me .
I like the idea of the first black President .
I like the idea because I like the idea of a bunch of racist , war - mongering redneck knuckle - draggers from red states , being as angry and afraid of their own government as we have been for the last 6 years .
But Barak , contrary to Chris Matthew ’s obvious attempt to promote his candidacy out of Hillary contempt , did n’t cut it in my book .
He came off as “ thinking out loud ” and searching for answers he should have had .
I feel your pain Chris Matthews ; Hillary needs to be stopped .
She is the one sure fire chance for putting a Republican back in the White House .
I hate her too .
But is there REALLY going to be a dime ’s worth of difference between any of the so - called “ top tier ” candidates if elected ?
I do n’t think so .
Joe Biden is full of sh*t .
He ’s arrogant .
He ’s got verbal diarrhea .
He ’s not remotely honest .
But for some reason I can’t comprehend , I ca n’t help but like the guy .
He reminds me of some of those used car and appliance salesman from the 70’s who created spectacles while saying “ I guarantee it ! ” .
As bullshit artists go , the man has real skills .
Kucinich probably disappointed me more than any other candidate .
That ’s because given his courage and willingness to file articles of impeachment against the biggest traitor and war criminal of the century , he came off like an aging hippy too tired to be angry .
His utopian vision as stated would have done him in immediately had he by chance been a front runner .
He never will be .
The best line of the night ?
“ The only thing worse than soldiers dying in vain , is more soldiers dying in vain ” .

One of the biggest challenges in personal finance is figuring out ways to spend less money — and one of the best ways to accomplish that is to cut down on your monthly expenses .
Even though some of our regular bills might seem small and insignificant on their own , their cumulative effect can be enormous – and become a huge drain on our resources .
40 Ways to Cut Monthly Expenses
To minimize the damage caused on a monthly basis , many people look for ways to cut expenses that are both easy to implement and effective .
Here are a few ways to save money that you can try one by one without too much hassle , but offer the potential to save huge sums of cash over time .
How to Save Money on Transportation
Let ’s face it : Cars are money pits .
Not only does their value constantly go down , they also devour fuel by the gallon and require all kinds of pricey maintenance .
Between car payments and interest , insurance , gas , maintenance , and other costs , AAA estimates the price of owning a car to be over $ 8,600 a year – and that does n’t even include parking .
So how can we reduce the cost of automobiles in our monthly budget ?
1. Use public transportation .
If you have access to public transportation , you can save quite a bit of money on gas , parking , and maintenance over time .
For a small percentage of the cost of owning a vehicle , you can get from one side of town to the next , to work and back , and to most important events .
Each time you ’re able to leave the car behind , you ’ll be saving money .
And that ’s just the money you ’d save on gas and maintenance and the like — you ’ll save far more if you ’re able to forego buying a car completely .
Rideshare services like ZipCar , Lyft , and Uber make it easier than ever to live car - free in major cities , allowing you to rent a car or hire a ride for the occasional Costco run , night out , or day trip to the country .
I ’ve used this strategy myself : During my earlier days , I exclusively used public transportation to get around and save money , and it was downright painful to add a car to my monthly finances .
2 . Sell a vehicle .
If a vehicle you own is rarely used , consider selling it .
If nothing else , you ’ll save money on insurance .
If you ’re able to get market price for your vehicle , you could also use the proceeds to beef up your savings account or pay off high - interest debt .
3. Carpool to work .
If you have an opportunity to share a ride to and from work with someone else , you can significantly reduce wear and tear on your car , save on gas , and take advantage of carpooling lanes that might make it easier to get to work .
4 . Keep the tires on your automobiles properly inflated .
Once a month , stop by a local gas station that offers free air and check the air pressure in your car tires .
If they are n’t inflated to the optimal PSI , fill each one to the maximum recommended amount as stated in your manual .
Every two PSI of air you ’re able to add to your tires can improve your gas mileage by 1 % .
Ways to Save on Debt
Any time you can reduce how much money you owe , it will help lower your ongoing monthly expenses .
For starters , paying off debt means fewer monthly bills to pay , leaving you with more money to save .
Here are a few ways to cut down on debt and save money over time .
5 . Refinance your home and / or automobile .
If you think you might be eligible to refinance your mortgage at a lower rate , contact some lending institutions .
Locking in a lower interest rate can not only save you money over the life of the loan , but can also lower your monthly payment and increase your monthly cash flow .
Similarly , if your credit has improved a lot since you first purchased your car , you may now qualify for a far better interest rate , so it could be worth refinancing your auto loan as well .
6. Consolidate your student loans .
If your student loans are locked in at a high interest rate , figure out whether it makes sense to consolidate all or some of them .
While this is n’t the silver - bullet saver it used to be now that most federal loans have fixed rates , if you do find a good loan consolidation option , it could save you money every single month .
7. Consolidate your debts using a balance transfer card or personal loan .
If you ’re carrying debt with a high interest rate , a balance transfer might be a good option .
The best balance transfer cards offer perks such as 0 % APR for up to 18 months – and some even offer rewards programs .
Taking advantage of a 0 % APR offer can help you pay down your debt and save quite a bit of money on interest .
Just make sure to factor in the balance transfer fees , and pay down the entire transferred balance during the introductory period if possible .
If you have high balances on multiple credit cards , it can also make sense to utilize a debt consolidation loan .
These loans allow you to combine several high - interest debts into one personal loan , which ideally has a lower interest rate than your current debts and enables you to pay down your debt faster .
As with balance transfer cards , be sure to take into account any upfront fees and make your monthly payments on time .

8. Request a credit card rate reduction .
If you ’ve got a fairly large balance on your credit card , call up your credit card company and request a rate reduction .
If you pay your bill on time every month , they may be willing to negotiate .
If they wo n’t go for it , get a 0 % balance transfer onto another card with a lower rate .
If you have a history of late payments , a credit card for bad credit can help you rebuild your credit score and qualify for cards with better rewards and lower rates in the future .
9 . Sign up for automatic debt repayment plans .
Many installment plans , particularly those associated with student loans , offer an interest rate reduction if you sign up for automatic monthly billing .
You should never pass these up – not only do they save money automatically each month , they ’re also incredibly convenient and ensure you wo n’t miss a payment or incur a late fee .
If you have any installment payments ( particularly student loan debt ) , see if such an offer is available to you .
10 . Sell unused items .
Dig through your closets or attic and look for items you no longer use that may have value , then sell them on eBay or Craigslist .
You can then use the money you bring in to pay off debt and put it behind you once and for all .
I did this myself with a number of items , including my baseball card collection , when my debt load became almost unmanageable .
Ways to Cut Down on Energy Bills
From hot summers to cold winters and all the gadgets we plug in , Americans spend a lot of money on energy bills ; in fact , the average household spends about $ 2,060 a year .
Fortunately , technology has brought us a few effective ways to improve energy efficiency and lower that figure .
11 . Install CFL or LED light bulbs .
If you ’ve never updated the lightbulbs in your home , consider switching to either CFLs or , better yet , LEDs .
These bulbs are about four times more energy efficient than incandescent bulbs and last for many years .
One tip :
When comparing bulbs , use the lumens number to compare bulbs , not the equivalent wattages .
Lumens indicate the actual amount of light emitted by the bulb .
Remember also that under normal usage ( four hours a day ) and average electrical rates ( $ 0.12 per kilowatt hour ) , replacing a 60 - watt bulb with a 14 - watt CFL or LED saves about $ 0.66 per month .
Now multiply that by all the bulbs in your house to see how much you ’ll save every month .
Even switching just the five most - used light bulbs in your home could save you upwards of $ 40 a year on your electric bill .
12 . Install a programmable thermostat .
A programmable thermostat allows you to automatically change the heating and cooling of your home when you ’re not at home , when you ’re asleep , and so on , saving significantly on your heating and cooling bills .
You can also set it to heat or cool your home right before you arrive home from work .
13 . Unplug all unused electrical devices .
Are there any electrical devices around the house that stay plugged in , but that you rarely use ?
Most electronic devices constantly draw a small amount of electricity , a phantom charge , that can add up quickly when you consider just how many devices and small appliances you own .
To eliminate that usage , unplug any items or power strips you use infrequently .
14 . Utilize timers and power strips .
Along those lines , consider utilizing power strips and power timers to turn electrical devices on and off .
A power strip with a switch on it , when turned off , blocks the phantom charge on those devices ; a timer can automatically turn off the charge going to a power strip ( or anything plugged into it ) at a certain time each night .
“ Smart ” power strips can even manage electricity flow based on a control device — for instance , your DVD player will only receive power if the TV is turned on first .
These are all great ways to eliminate phantom charges on your home electronic equipment at night or when they ’re not in use .
15 . Lower the temperature on your hot water heater .
The hot water heater is a major energy drain in most homes , accounting for about 14 % of energy costs .
Often , the water is kept hotter than most people ever need , plus the heat is constantly lost to the environment , meaning you have to burn more energy than ever to keep the water so hot .
Solve both problems by dropping the temperature down to 125 - 130 degrees Fahrenheit ( around 60 degress Celsius ) and also installing a water heater blanket to keep in the heat – a blanket can pay for itself in about a year , after which you ’ll be saving money monthly .
While you ’re at it , insulate any exposed hot water pipes as well for additional savings .
16 . Air seal your home .
Air sealing your home can prevent drafts — common efficiency culprits in older homes .
The loss of cool air in the summer and the loss of warm air in winter can both increase your utility bills substantially .
Here ’s a great guide to this weekend project from the U.S. Department of Energy .
Reduce Your Entertainment Expenses
Many people look at entertainment as the first thing to cut when trying to trim costs , but they often forget to look at the regular expenditures that slowly eat away at your financial foundation month in and month out .
Here are some things to consider that you may have overlooked before .
17 . Cancel club memberships .
Look at expenses such your gym membership , your membership with the local country club , and so on .
How often do you really use these services ?
If you ’re using a gym membership less than once a week or a country club membership less than once a month , you ’re likely throwing away money .
Try canceling any memberships you ’re on the fence about , and see if you really miss them .
18 . Reduce or eliminate your cable bill .
Most people could find a cheaper way to gain access to their favorite shows if they tried hard enough .
Perhaps you could downgrade from premium to basic cable , or maybe you could even eliminate your cable bill entirely ( we finally did ) .
Cutting cable and watching less television can also cut down on your electricity bill and expose you to fewer commercials tempting you to buy stuff – a double savings whammy .
19 . Look for inexpensive entertainment options .
Do you take advantage of your local library ?
Do you attend local community events like music festivals and art fairs ?
Are you aware of local volunteer groups and organizations ?
Your community may offer plenty of options for inexpensive or free entertainment of all kinds .
And any money you save is money you do n’t have to spend on entertainment .
Fore more inspiration , here are more than 100 free things to do .
20 .
Find new ways to reduce travel expenses .
We live very far from our extended families , so we ’re well aware of the costs of travel .
To save as much as possible , we cut down on the amount of travel we do and use travel credit cards for everything from free hotel stays to airfare .
21 . Cancel newspaper and magazine subscriptions .
If you get a magazine or newspaper in the mail but simply do n’t read it , cancel that subscription when it comes up for renewal without a second thought .
An unread subscription is nothing more than expensive clutter .
If you need reading material , hit up your local library instead .
22 . Consider reducing / eliminating other regular paid services .
Look at the services you pay for each month and determine if the money you ’re spending is truly worth it .
If not , just drop the service and look for other options that can accomplish the same thing for less .
Have you examined your subscriptions lately ?
If you ’ve cut cable TV , it ’s great to take advantage of streaming services like Netflix , Hulu + , and Amazon Prime — but you probably do n’t need to be paying for all three at once .
Do you need your gym membership , or could you get by with a home exercise routine ?
Or if you pay someone to mow your lawn , could you eliminate that expense completely by mowing it yourself ?
There are even apps to help with this now — for example , TrueBill can review your purchase history and look for unused subscriptions and other recurring charges , and help you cancel them .
Ways to Save Money on Food
Food is one of the most common problem areas in the average American budget .
We either eat too much , spend too much on groceries , or eat out so often that it costs our budgets ( and waistlines ) to swell .
Here are some ways to save money on food and eliminate waste .
23 . Cook ( and pack ) your own meals at home .
When you cook at home , make a lot of whatever you ’re preparing so you can freeze some of it for future meals and , even better , take some leftovers into work for lunch .
Some people may shy away from leftovers , but there are some secrets to making any leftovers as good as the original .

24 . Reduce or eliminate eating out or getting take - out .
Take - out and dining out can be a nice luxury and huge time - saver for a busy family , but the expense can be tremendous .
Instead , look at other options to make dining at home more convenient — for example , prepare lots of meals at once and freeze them for easy cooking later .
Meanwhile , focus mostly on simple recipes , and choose recipes that use the fresh produce in season in your area .
25 . Buy nonperishable items in bulk and use coupons .
Many people never even bother to look at some of the larger packages of nonperishable items – they think it ’s just too much .
Try looking at the cost per unit of all of the sizes and choose the one that ’s the best deal .
Check for coupons and coupon codes for items you use all the time , and if a good enough coupon presents itself , buy it in bulk .
Spread out over months and over a lot of items ( think of all of the nonperishables in your home , from salt and sugar to soap and shampoo – food is just the beginning ) , this can add up to a lot of trimmed fat .
26 . Start a garden .
Vegetable gardening is a splendid hobby that can often turn a profit if done right .
Focus on vegetables that are easy to grow and produce abundant fruit , like tomatoes , and learn how to can and store the excess .
Opening up a jar of tomatoes in the winter that you grew yourself in the summer and canned in the fall is a wonderful experience – and it can really help with trimming the food bill .
If you ’re ready to start gardening , here are some good strategies for reducing your gardening start - up costs .
27 . Buy generic when you can .
Many products ( not just food ) are available in a store - brand or generic form for significantly less money .
Look carefully at the ingredients in generic and name - brand products to see how similar they are .
If they ’re close , go with the generic one on a regular basis to consistently trim money from your shopping bill .
I tend to try the generic version of a product at least once — and if I like it , I ’ll continue buying it .
( There are a few products where the generic version has n’t passed mustard for me , though . )
Ways to Cut Insurance Bills
We all need insurance to protect against the unexpected .
But when we overpay for insurance , we leave ourselves vulnerable in a different way .
Look into these options for ways to reduce your insurance premiums .
28 . Downgrade your health insurance .
Ask at work about the various options available to you that might reduce your insurance costs , and do n’t neglect to look into family options if you have children – if you do , all working members of the household should look at family coverage .
If you want a lower monthly premium , consider a high deductible health insurance plan — this is particularly fitting for people who do n’t rely on regular medications or go to the doctor all that much , and simply need coverage for a health emergency .
Just make sure to weigh the expected savings against the additional amount you may have to pay out - of - pocket each year .

29 .
Shop around for homeowners and auto insurance ( or bundle them together ) .
If you have n’t shopped around for homeowners or auto insurance lately , now ’s a good time to get a few quotes , especially if your credit is strong .
If you can save a substantial amount and maintain your current level of coverage , it ’s well worth switching to another provider — but give your current one a chance to match their quote .
Most insurance companies also offer a good discount if you bundle your homeowners and auto policies together .
If you currently use two separate insurers , ask what kind of discount each would offer if you bundled the policies together .

30 . Consider term life insurance .
If you ’re paying for whole life insurance or universal life insurance , consider a cheaper term policy instead .
The cost per year will be significantly less expensive – even if you buy similar coverage .
The only difference is , your policy will terminate eventually with term coverage — typically after you retire , when , presumably , your family is no longer so dependent on your work income — whereas whole life policies are for a lifetime .

31 . Raise your deductibles .
If you ’re paying a large premium in order to have a small deductible , you might want to consider switching that , particularly if your claims are infrequent .
Raising your deductible can often significantly reduce your annual premiums , easing the monthly strain on your bills .
Ways to Save Money on Everything Else
If you ’re still looking for ways to reduce your monthly expenses and save money , it ’s time to dig a little deeper .
These suggestions can help you find all of the potential savings in your monthly budget .
32 . Lower your cell phone bill .
Ask yourself how much you really use your cell phone ’s data plan .
If it ’s not all that much , look for ways to downgrade to a cheaper cell phone plan without all the bells and whistles .
If you do use it a lot , look at the features you ’re paying for on your bill and see if you can trim any of those .
Even a $ 10 / month savings — say , for a couple gigabytes less data per month — adds up to $ 120 a year .
33 . Consider cheaper childcare options .
We paid a lot of money for our childcare , but there were other good options available to us .
Compare childcare options in your area to see if a cheaper alternative would be a better value .
Or get creative in trying to cut back your existing childcare by a day or two — for instance , look into a nanny - share arrangement , or try working a later shift once a week so you can be home during the day .
If you ’re lucky enough to live near grandparents , they might be willing to watch the kids part - time while you work .
34 . Reduce or eliminate organized child activities .
The high cost of children ’s sports can spiral out of control if you do n’t keep it in check .
To minimize these costs , look at the real expenses involved with any sport or activity before you let your children sign up .
Meanwhile , keeping kids in only one activity at a time can also help you save as much as possible .
35 . Insource everything .
If you hire out household services to others , consider trimming back or eliminating them .
Instead , put aside some time each week to do them yourself – not only will you save money , but you ’ll find that many activities can get the whole family involved ( like housecleaning ) .
36 . Stop tithing , at least temporarily .
If your budget is bursting at the seams , consider cutting back on your religious tithing .
If this spiritually troubles you , talk to the leader of your religious group about the issue – they ’ll usually be very supportive of this if you need some time to get your own house in order .
Once you get back on your feet , you ’ll likely be in the position to give even more than you did before .
37 . Stop buying so much clothing .
I have a close friend who spends a significant amount of money on clothes each month .
I challenged her to trim her spending in half – and she ’s never looked back .
If you need to dress well for work , that ’s okay .
You can still save plenty by buying fewer but high - quality pieces and really utilizing the wardrobe you already own .
38 . Reduce grooming expenses .
Instead of having your hair cut and styled weekly , cut back to every other week .
If you have your nails done twice a month , cut back to monthly , or have manicure parties where you do it at home with your friends instead .
If you buy expensive shampoos , look at lower - cost options .
It does n’t have to cost a truckload to look good .
39 .
Reduce or eliminate consumable habits ( such as smoking , alcohol , etc. ) .
Any consumable habit , whether it be smoking or excessive drinking , can be a constant drain on a budget without any real benefit .
Give the habit a kick in the pants and your wallet will breathe a serious sigh of relief .
40 .
Move to a less expensive area .
Many people leave out this option when looking at trimming their budget , but if you can find work in another area , it may be worth considering .
Look around at other areas of the country where you can find employment , see what your salary would be there .
Then look at the housing costs and see how they stack up .
Quite often , you ’ll find yourself significantly ahead by looking at rural or suburban areas versus city options .
Trying a few of these strategies could lead to huge savings down the road .
Meanwhile , trying all of them could literally transform your financial future – one dollar at a time .
Study : 100 patients a day in USA wake up during surgery By Robert Davis , USA TODAY Anesthesia failure that allows a patient to wake up during surgery , paralyzed and unable to cry for help , occurs 100 times a day in the USA , a study reports Monday .
The rate is similar to those documented by previous international studies , but many doctors have long questioned the prevalence .
This is the first time in more than 30 years that the problem has been quantified in U.S. hospitals .
These findings , and the results of two similar trials also to be released today , led the Food and Drug Administration late Friday to broaden its approval of a device it says has reduced the risk of patients waking up during surgery .
The BIS monitor , which is used in one - third of U.S. hospitals , turns the brain 's EEG waves into a number that can tell anesthesiologists at a glance how deeply a patient is sedated .
Another study of 1,200 patients found that using the BIS monitor reduced the frequency of surgical awareness by 82 % .
Such study results are viewed as preliminary .
" Awareness is clearly a problem , " says Jeffrey Apfelbaum , professor and chairman of anesthesia and critical care medicine at the University of Chicago .
" But these studies have not been vetted through the peer - reviewed process .
We are all anxious to find a way to minimize the incidence of this problem , but we need to do it through sound science . "
The makers of the monitor , Aspect Medical Systems of Newton , Mass. , financed the studies , which are being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in San Francisco .
BIS stands for bispectral index technology .
Anesthesiologists have led the medical profession in patient safety efforts .
But many of them have resisted the use of BIS monitors , saying they do not need help determining whether their patients were adequately sedated .
" They have their head in the sand , " says the study 's lead investigator , Peter Sebel , a professor of anesthesiology at Emory University School of Medicine .
" They say they have never had a case in their career .
I think they may have , they just do n't know about it . "
His study of nearly 20,000 surgical patients found that for every 1,000 who receive general anesthesia , 1 to 2 people become aware of what is happening to them .
Half of them feel pain .
" I did not feel cutting , but I felt tremendous pulling , " says Carol Weihrer , who awoke during eye - removal surgery .
" It takes a lot of torque to get an eye out . "
Since her 45 - minute ordeal in 1998 , during which she felt surgical tools on her chest , listened to the music played in the surgical suite and felt like gagging because of the tube down her throat , she has become a patient advocate .
" It has been described as worse than rape or kidnapping in that you can't squirm or scream , " she says .
" There is no way to release your fear or your frustration . "
She and other patient advocates say patients should ask for a BIS monitor .
The legendary bull penis cane AKA
The bull dick cane is the most unique of all walking canes .
The perfect cane to make any cane collection complete , these walking canes are constructed of real bull organs , fully sterilized and prepared by a professional taxidermist .
The durable metal rod down the center of the penis cane ensures its longevity and reinforces its sturdy nature .
The most interesting part of using this cane is that no one has any idea what it is made out of until you tell them .
The bull organ has the appearance of natural wood because of its dark appearance and the shiny lacquer .

Walking sticks have been a wardrobe staple for centuries , used by farmers to herd animals and as protection against thieves while traveling .
Rulers have used canes to demonstrate power and justice .
Churches began using staffs with hooked ends as a symbol of drawing followers to service .
When bamboo and reeds began to be used to create the staffs , they became known as canes , a term we use today to describe most types of walking stick .
Celebrities have been using canes to accent their wardrobe for years .
Johnny Depp has walked the red carpet many times with a cane in his hand and Madonna made the cane a women 's accessory in the 1990s .
Brad Pitt carried a cane after injuring his ACL but managed to make it look like more of a fashion accessory than a medical device .
If you would like to add a cane to your wardrobe , you do n't want to settle for just any walking stick .
Instead , go for the truly unique with the bull penis cane .
An Extension of Style
Bull penis canes are more than just a walking stick , they are an extension of your style .
Each cane is constructed of real bull organs that have been fully sterilized and prepared by a licensed taxidermist .
Each cane has a durable metal rod in the center that gives it longevity and durability , while allowing the cane to remain true to its original form .
The skin of the bull is not stretched over the metal rod as the bull organ is naturally 36 ” or more long .
History of Bull Pizzle Canes
Bull penis canes , and those made from the organs of other animals , date back to the ancient Egyptians who created scepters that represented the goddess Worset , using them as symbols of power .
There are many hieroglyphs of pharaohs holding the canes , known as Was scepters .
In more recent history , legends such as Doc Holliday , Bat Masterson and Jack Dempsey owned canes made of bull penis .
Handmade with Care by a Professional Taxidermist
At Fashionablecanes.com , each bull dick cane is created by a licensed , professional taxidermist .
The organ is cleaned thoroughly and sterilized .
In some cases , the taxidermist may soak the bull penis in a salt brine solution while others treat the cane with formaldehyde .
A metal rod is inserted in the center for stability and weight bearing .
One end of the cane is bent and soaked in a preservative and the cane is then hung to dry .
Once it is dry , it is either varnished or coated in shellac .
A Shocking Gift That is Sure to Get a Reaction
Even if a cow penis cane is not your style , it can make the perfect gift for that hard - to - buy person on your list .
It makes the perfect “ over - the - hill ” or retirement gift .
If you have a friend or family member who loves the Old West , a bull penis cane is the perfect gift .
Many who own the canes do n't use them but display them in cases and as wall decorations .
However , each bull pizzle cane is strong enough for everyday use .
Bull Penis Cane Featured on House MD TV Show
Bull penis canes were brought into the spotlight on an episode of House MD .
In the episode entitled 1 Family , House visits an oddities shop where he eventually locates his Flame Cane .
While there , he encounters what the store owner calls a “ bull organ ” cane .
When told what it was , House replies that “ penis canes are murder ” and returns the cane to the shopkeeper .
The fact is that bull organ canes originated as a way to use the entire part of an animal after slaughter so that no part of the animal goes to waste .
Although , today , there may be other ways to use a bull penis creating a cane from the organ is definitely a way to create a conversation piece .
Types of Bull Dick Canes
There are several styles of bull penis canes available .
The Bull Penis Tourist Handle Walking Cane is available in sizes ranging from 34 ” to 37 ” and for people up to 200 pounds .
It is sealed with a protective lacquer and is adorned with a label indicating it was made from the reproductive organ of a bull .
Just above the label , a buffalo head nickel is embedded in the cane .
The Bull Penis Silver Hame Handle Walking

It 's For Our Own Good
Yesterday I supported two measures to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
These measures were considered against the backdrop of heightened concerns from our nation 's intelligence community abut the threat of international terrorism .
The ramifications of the two amendments before us last night were not political .
Instead they related to the urgent demands of national security .
I chose to heed those warnings .
We now have six months to work in earnest to bring full accountability to the process .
This distinction and the threats to national security were stated clearly by Admiral McConnell as well as four of the eight Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
These members , Senators Feinstein , Mikulski , Bayh , and Bill Nelson , have extensive experience on intelligence matters and are respected champions of civil rights and liberties .
They chose to give significant weight and deference to the intelligence community on FISA reform , and so did I .

Senator Lieberman advocates military strike on Iran David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Sunday June 10 , 2007 Print This Email This Senator Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) on CBS 's Face the Nation this morning laid out a case for the US taking military action against Iran .
" Iraq is now the main front in the long war we are fighting against the Islamist terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 .
In fact 90 % of the suicide bombers in Iraq today killing Iraqis and American soldiers are foreign Al Qaeda fighters .
Iran is training and equipping soldiers , Iraqis , to come in and kill American soldiers and Iraqis , " said Lieberman .
Host Bob Schieffer then asked Lieberman what the United States should do about Iran .
Lieberman said that Iran is at war with the US and " the moderates " and that while he supports sitting down and talking with the Iranian government , that might not be enough .
" If we 're going to sit and talk with the Iranians , tell them what we want them to do , which is to stop doing that because it 's killing Americans , we can't leave it at that .
I think we have to be prepared to take aggressive military action against the Iranians to stop them from killing Americans in Iraq , " he said .
" To me that would include a strike into , over the border into Iran where we have good evidence that they have a base at which they are training these people coming back into Iraq to kill our soldiers . "
" Let 's just stop right there , " said Schieffer .
" You 're saying that if the Iranians do n't let up that the United States should take military action . "
" I am , " replied Lieberman .
" If they do n't play by the rules we 've got to use our force and to me that would include taking military action to stop them from doing what they 're doing . "

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) --
The U.S. space agency NASA on Thursday confirmed it had discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station due to be carried up by the space shuttle Endeavour .
It launched an investigation after finding cut wires in a piece of computer equipment intended to transfer data from station sensors to the ground , the agency said .
NASA says it discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station .
NASA said it will try to launch Endeavour on August 7 for the spacecraft 's first mission in nearly five years .
Endeavour , fresh from a complete overhaul and the last of NASA 's three remaining shuttles to return to flight following the 2003 Columbia disaster , is due to carry out a construction mission to the $ 100 - billion space station .
It will be NASA 's second shuttle flight of the year .
Endeavour was almost totally rebuilt during its overhaul and was like a new space shuttle , shuttle program manager Wayne Hale told reporters at Kennedy Space Center in Florida , where the launch will take place .
" It 's like driving a new car off the showroom floor , " Hale said .
Endeavour 's seven crew members include teacher - astronaut Barbara Morgan , who trained 22 years ago as the backup to teacher - in - space Christa McAuliffe , one of the astronauts who died when Challenger blew up at liftoff in January 1986 .
Do n't Miss Earth observation satellites in peril
Endeavour will be carrying a new support beam for the half - finished space station and a replacement gyroscope needed to help the outpost maintain its position in space .
Among the shuttle 's upgrades is a new system that will enable the spacecraft to tap into the station 's electrical system and stay longer at the outpost .
If the power transfer system works properly , NASA plans to extend Endeavour 's mission from 11 to 14 days .
That will allow time for the crew to finish extra work preparing the orbital outpost for the arrival later this year and next year of laboratories built by Europe and Japan .
It also will carry a module loaded with about 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station crew .

Painting Away the Terror The Muralists of Baghdad
The erection of protection walls in Baghdad has proved highly controversial -- but for a group of artists they have provided novel giant canvases .
For the last month the muralists have been turning the gray concrete blocks into vivid works of art -- and hoping to bring a bit of joy to the lives of Iraqis .
Those sealed glossy packs of cheeses and lunchmeat on your grocer 's shelf can provide a particularly friendly home for nasty bugs that cause food poisoning , new research shows .
Vacuum - packed foods are deprived of oxygen to keep them fresh and boost their shelf life , but the same strategy is a boon for Listeria monocytogenes , a bacterium responsible for a kind of food poisoning that kills 25 percent of the people it infects .
Unlike many other food - borne germs , Listeria can grow even in the cold temperatures of refrigerators .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration notes that the microbe has been linked with foods such as raw milk ; ice cream ; soft - ripened cheeses such as feta , Brie and Camembert ; hot dogs ; raw and deli meats ; raw vegetables ; raw and cooked poultry ; and raw and smoked fish .
In experiments with guinea pigs , Technical University of Denmark researchers found oxygen - deprived Listeria gets mean — up to 100 times more invasive than when grown with ample supplies of oxygen , findings which are detailed June 14 in the online journal BMC Microbiology .
The germ normally likes to live inside the oxygen - deprived gut , so it makes sense that it becomes more invasive under similar conditions , Licht said .
" Avoiding vacuum packaging would lead to other problems with bacterial growth , so I 'm not advocating that , " food microbiologist Tine Licht told LiveScience .
" But our work does help devise models predicting risk of food - borne disease . "
Future research can determine genes key to the invasiveness of oxygen - deprived Listeria , Licht added .
This in turn could help devise new methods to fight the germ .
There are two coalition armies in Iraq : the official one , which fights the war , and the private one , which supports it .
This latter group of civilians drives dangerous truck convoys , cooks soldiers ' meals , and guards facilities and important officials .
They rival in size the US military force there , and thousands have become casualties of the conflict .
If this experience is any indication , they may change the makeup of US military forces in future wars .
Having civilians working in war zones is as old as war itself .
But starting with US military action in the Balkans and Colombia in the mid-1990s and accelerating rapidly in Afghanistan and Iraq , the number and activity of contractors has greatly increased .
Coming from dozens of countries , hired by hundreds of companies , contractors have seen their numbers rise faster than the Pentagon 's ability to track them .
Now , the challenges of this privatization strategy are becoming clear .
Everything from who controls their activities to who cares for them when wounded remains unresolved , say experts in and out of the military .
This has led to protests from families in the United States as well as concerns in military ranks about how contractors fit into the chain of command .
" This is a very murky legal space , and simply put we have n't dealt with the fundamental issues , " says Peter Singer , a foreign policy specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" What is their specific role , what is their specific status , and what is the system of accountability ?
We 've sort of dodged these questions . "
As the inevitable drawdown of US military forces in Iraq occurs , the importance of civilian workers there is likely to grow .
" In my view , the role of contractors is just going to continue to escalate , probably at an ever - increasing rate , " says Deborah Avant , a political scientist at the University of California , Irvine , whose research has focused on civil - military relations .
For example , the new US Embassy now being completed in Baghdad – 21 buildings on 104 acres , an area six times larger than the United Nations complex in New York – is likely to be a permanent fixture needing hundreds if not thousands of civilian contractors to maintain it and provide services .
In Iraq , up to 180,000 contractors
Estimates of the number of private security personnel and other civilian contractors in Iraq today range from 126,000 to 180,000 – nearly as many , if not more than , the number of Americans in uniform there .
Most are not Americans .
They come from Fiji , Brazil , Scotland , Croatia , Hungary , New Zealand , Pakistan , South Africa , Australia , and other countries .
" A very large part of the total force is not in uniform , " Scott Horton , who teaches the law of armed conflict at Columbia University School of Law , said in congressional testimony last month .
In World War II and the Korean War , contractors amounted to 3 to 5 percent of the total force deployed .
Through the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War , the percentage grew to roughly 10 percent , he notes .
" But in the current conflict , the number appears to be climbing steadily closer to parity " with military personnel .
" This represents an extremely radical transformation in the force configuration , " he says .
Until recently , there has been little oversight of civilian contractors operating in Iraq .
The Defense Department is not adequately keeping track of contractors – where they are or even how many there are , the Government Accountability Office concluded in a report last December .
This is especially true as military units rotate in and out of the war zone ( as do contractors ) and institutional memory is lost .
This lack of accountability has begun to change with a Democrat - controlled Congress .
As part of the 2007 National Defense Authorization
Act passed last year , Congress now requires that civilian contractors who break the law – hurt or kill civilians , for example – come under the legal authority of the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
So far , however , the Pentagon has not issued guidance to field commanders on how to do this .
Proposed bills in the House and Senate would require " transparency and accountability in military and security contracting . "
For example , companies would be required to provide information on the hiring and training of civilian workers , and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would have to issue rules of engagement regarding the circumstances under which contractors could use force .
Senior commanders acknowledge the value of contractors , especially those that are armed and ready to fight if attacked .
At his Senate confirmation hearing in January , Army Gen. David Petraeus , commander of the multinational force in Iraq , said that the " surge " by US forces in Iraq might not include enough American troops .
" However , there are tens of thousands of contract security forces and [ Iraqi ] ministerial security forces that do , in fact , guard facilities and secure institutions , " he added .
" That does give me the reason to believe that we can accomplish the mission in Baghdad . "
Still , many senior military officers worry about the impact that relying on so many civilian contractors – especially armed private security forces – will have on the conduct of future conflicts .
This past Christmas Eve , for example , a Blackwater USA contractor shot and killed an Iraqi security guard .
The contractor was fired and returned to the US .
The FBI and Justice Department are investigating .
The US military needs to take " a real hard look at security contractors on future battlefields and figure out a way to get a handle on them so that they can be better integrated – if we 're going to allow them to be used in the first place , " Col .
Peter Mansoor , a deputy to General Petraeus , recently told Jane 's Defence Weekly .
" I meet with a lot of O - 5s and O - 6s [ lieutenant colonels and colonels ] at the war colleges , and you hear a lot of that discomfort with how far it 's gone , " says Mr. Singer of Brookings .
Opinions differ over whether the trend in using more contractors is here to stay .
" Every war is unique , but the heavy use of private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan is likely to persist in future conflicts , " says military analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute in Arlington , Va .
" Relying on market sources is intrinsically more flexible than using government workers , and nobody seriously believes that the market will fail to respond to multibillion dollar opportunities even when danger is involved . "
" In addition , " says Dr. Thompson , " modern military technology often requires support that only the original makers can provide . "
A new military - industrial complex ?
Other observers also foresee an increase in military contractors – for darker reasons .
The " military - industrial complex " that former President Eisenhower warned of has been overshadowed by the " war - service industry , " says Dina Rasor , coauthor of the recent book " Betraying Our Troops : The Destructive Results of Privatizing War . "
The complex relied on the cold war to keep its budgets high , knowing that the weapons it produced probably would never be used .
The war - service industry , by contrast , " does n't build weapons but has to have a hot war or an occupation going on in order to keep its budgets high , " says Ms. Rasor .
Constituencies will be built within the military and in Congress to promote this growing industry , she predicts .
Lawrence Korb , a former assistant secretary of Defense , takes a different view .
He predicts that the number of contractors providing military logistics support will shrink , in part because the US effort in Iraq will wind down at some point and in part because the US plans to increase the armed forces by 92,000 soldiers and marines over the next five years .
Looking ahead to the need for peacekeeping and stabilization in future conflicts , Dr. Korb says , " I can't imagine doing it again without thinking it through . "
After trials of war , a lone helping hand in the US
Contrary to popular perception , most contractors are not the beefy , grim guys wearing scary sunglasses and carrying guns .
But in a war like Iraq , every one from mechanics to translators has become a target .
At least 916 contractors have been killed in the four - year war and more than 12,000 wounded , according to official statistics and Labor Department figures provided to the New York Times and Reuters .
An unknown number experience symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
But unless they have previous military service , contractors are not eligible for help from the US Department of Veterans Affairs .
Many have been denied treatment by insurance companies .
In some cases , the companies they worked for have successfully fought legal efforts to declare the firms liable for physical or mental injury resulting from work in Iraq .
Enter Jana Crowder , a " stay - at - home mom with four kids " who started a website for moral support during the seven months her husband was an engineering contractor in Iraq .
" I had no idea what I was getting into , " says Mrs. Crowder , who lives in Knoxville , Tenn .
" I found a whole different war zone out there – contractors coming home physically and mentally damaged .
I did n't even know what PTSD was , but I had guys calling me up saying they had nightmares , that they could n't sleep , that they were hallucinating and crying . "
Today , through her website ( www.americancontractorsiniraq.com), Crowder is a liaison between troubled contractors and those who can help them .
She organizes conferences and guides contractors through the bureaucratic and legal maze they face in filing workers ' compensation claims .
As Congress and government agencies look deeper into the use of US military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan , the families and supporters of civilian workers in the war zones are hopeful that their loved ones will get more and better treatment – especially for the mental and emotional shocks that remain .
Says Crowder , who 's grateful that her husband came home in good shape : " PTSD does n't know whether you 're wearing a uniform or not . "
WASHINGTON , July 2 — Seeking a legal path to shutting down the Guantánamo detention facility , senior advisers to President Bush are exploring whether the White House and Congress can agree to legislation that would permit the long - term detention of foreign terrorism suspects on American soil , Pentagon and administration officials say .
The idea of creating a new legal category for some foreign terrorism detainees , which is still in its early stages , faces daunting political , legal and constitutional difficulties .
But it is gaining support among some White House and national security officials as the most promising course to allow the president to close the site at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , that has generated intense criticism at home and abroad .
Essentially , the administration would propose legislation that would result in dividing the estimated 375 Guantánamo detainees into three legal categories .
The one that would call for legislative action would include detainees like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the mastermind of the September 2001 attacks , and others whose trials would risk exposing intelligence operations .
This group , estimated at two dozen to 50 , would be placed indefinitely in military brigs on American soil .
A second group would also be moved to the United States , most likely to face trial in military courts , but perhaps with more legal guarantees than in the current military tribunal system .
— When Garner police officers hit the streets armed with new rifles , they 'll be carrying a weapon that will extend the long arm of the law .
The Garner Police Department is purchasing semiautomatic rifles like those issued to U.S. troops .
The department aims for every officer to have a rifle while on duty .
Carrying the weapon will make officers more prepared in a world of shootings and terrorist threats , officials said .
" You 've seen many school shootings over the past couple of years , where 's it 's never going to happen in my city , it 's never going to happen in my town , " Sgt. Joe Binns , of the Garner PD , said .
" It 's all about being prepared . "
Police departments nationwide are investing in semiautomatic rifles because of their accuracy and ability to shoot over long distances , up to the length of 2 1 / 2 football fields .
While other police departments allow officers the option to carry a rifle , the Garner PD plans to arm every officer with a rifle .
The rifles cost around $ 850 each and are being paid for with tax dollars and grant money , officers said .
Each officer must train with a semiautomatic rifle for at least 24 hours before being allowed to carry one .
Garner police officers have fired their guns three times in the line of duty during the past seven years , officers said .
Senate has proposed raising fuel efficiency requirements on all vehicles , giving auto makers until 2020 to increase fuel economy for an average of 35 mpg for all cars , trucks and SUVs .
That is about 40 percent higher than the current average .
The proposal is a response to concerns about energy security without hurting domestic auto makers .
Under the new proposal released by Senators Daniel Inouye , of Hawaii , and Ted Stevens of Alaska , cars and trucks will have to meet a 4 % annual increase in efficiency after 2020 .

Scientists funded by the European Space Agency have measured the gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field for the first time in a laboratory .
Under certain special conditions the effect is much larger than expected from general relativity and could help physicists to make a significant step towards the long - sought - after quantum theory of gravity .
Just as a moving electrical charge creates a magnetic field , so a moving mass generates a gravitomagnetic field .
According to Einstein ’s Theory of General Relativity , the effect is virtually negligible .
However , Martin Tajmar , ARC Seibersdorf Research GmbH , Austria ; Clovis de Matos , ESA - HQ , Paris ; and colleagues have measured the effect in a laboratory .
Their experiment involves a ring of superconducting material rotating up to 6 500 times a minute .
Superconductors are special materials that lose all electrical resistance at a certain temperature .
Spinning superconductors produce a weak magnetic field , the so - called London moment .
The new experiment tests a conjecture by Tajmar and de Matos that explains the difference between high - precision mass measurements of Cooper - pairs ( the current carriers in superconductors ) and their prediction via quantum theory .
They have discovered that this anomaly could be explained by the appearance of a gravitomagnetic field in the spinning superconductor ( This effect has been named the Gravitomagnetic London Moment by analogy with its magnetic counterpart ) .
Small acceleration sensors placed at different locations close to the spinning superconductor , which has to be accelerated for the effect to be noticeable , recorded an acceleration field outside the superconductor that appears to be produced by gravitomagnetism .
“ This experiment is the gravitational analogue of Faraday ’s electromagnetic induction experiment in 1831 .
It demonstrates that a superconductive gyroscope is capable of generating a powerful gravitomagnetic field , and is therefore the gravitational counterpart of the magnetic coil .
Depending on further confirmation , this effect could form the basis for a new technological domain , which would have numerous applications in space and other high - tech sectors ” says de Matos .
Although just 100 millionths of the acceleration due to the Earth ’s gravitational field , the measured field is a surprising one hundred million trillion times larger than Einstein ’s General Relativity predicts .
Initially , the researchers were reluctant to believe their own results .
“ We ran more than 250 experiments , improved the facility over 3 years and discussed the validity of the results for 8 months before making this announcement .
Now we are confident about the measurement , ” says Tajmar , who performed the experiments and hopes that other physicists will conduct their own versions of the experiment in order to verify the findings and rule out a facility induced effect .
In parallel to the experimental evaluation of their conjecture , Tajmar and de Matos also looked for a more refined theoretical model of the Gravitomagnetic London Moment .
They took their inspiration from superconductivity .
The electromagnetic properties of superconductors are explained in quantum theory by assuming that force - carrying particles , known as photons , gain mass .
By allowing force - carrying gravitational particles , known as the gravitons , to become heavier , they found that the unexpectedly large gravitomagnetic force could be modelled .
“ If confirmed , this would be a major breakthrough , ” says Tajmar , “ it opens up a new means of investigating general relativity and it consequences in the quantum world . ”
The results were presented at a one - day conference at ESA ’s European Space and Technology Research Centre ( ESTEC ) , in the Netherlands , 21 March 2006 .
Two papers detailing the work are now being considered for publication .
The papers can be accessed on - line at the Los Alamos pre-print server using the references : gr-qc/0603033 and gr-qc/0603032 .

In the 1960s , huge projects diverted water from the world ’s fourth largest inland body of water to irrigate cotton and rice fields .
Within 20 years the flow of water into the Aral completely stopped .
The rapid disappearance of the sea in the former Soviet Union may be the most significant regional environmental disaster the world is facing but no plans exist for solving it .
By 2020 it is likely to be only 10 % of its original size

I just spent about ten minutes yelling at a friend of mine , a good friend , someone who 's stood by me when few people did .
I 'm not proud of that .
I feel like a heel .
But he asked thequestion , at thetime .
And to my answer , which was clearly not the answer he wanted or expected , everything he had to say from then on enraged me even further .
I started out yelling about other people , in front of him , but the gods forgive me , by the end of it I was yelling at him .
I 'd just gone with him and his wife to see( again , in my case ) .
On the way home in the car , one of the things she remarked on was how odd it seemed to her that The Captain , the fictional CEO of the thinly disguised R.J. Reynolds Tobacco company , was so obviously loved by the people of his home town , even the waiters at his private club .
I explained to them , in passing , something I observed in my own brief stay in Lexington , Kentucky , and that is that you dobad - mouth the tobacco companies in tobacco country .
From one end of Dixie to the other , there are people down there who know that tobacco is for all practical purposes the last economically viable crop of the small family farmer , that tobacco will stay in Dixie and pay the bills in Dixie long after everybody else has written them off for no good , that even people who do n't smoke and do n't work for the tobacco companies or on tobacco farms know which side their home town 's bread is buttered on .
But anyway , among the things this reminded one of them of was how little luck he's had getting people to bad - mouth tobacco in science fiction fandom , nationally , either .
It 's pet peeve of his ; he is the second - rudest smoke - nazi I 've ever met in my entire life .
Completely past rational on the subject .
No , it seemed to him , the only thing that science fiction fans could be persuaded to be intolerant of was his religion , Christianity .
( Another pet peeve of his . )
And having just come out ofI thought I 'd finally thought of the perfect metaphor that would finally explain to him why that was .
I told him that science fiction fandom , being a hot - bed of atheism and of non-Christian religion , is as sick of Christianity and as angry about constant exposure to Christianity as he is about frequent exposure to cigarette smoke , and for exactly the same reason .
We do n't get to pick whether or not somebody else shoves their Christianity into our space and down our throats .
And like the people who ask smokers to put their cigarettes out , we 're treated with great hostility by anybody around us when we object to it , like we 're the intolerant ones .
I told him that second - hand Christianity and second - hand smoking are , in fact , the exact same issue .
And , I confessed , while I 'm not the banning personal behaviors kind of guy ?
If I had to choose ?
If one of the two was going to disappear from this earth and never have existed , I 'd choose to keep tobacco and excise Christianity .
Christianity 's more obnoxious , done more harm , killed more people , and Christians are much less considerate about involuntary and unwelcome exposure to their religion than any smoker I know is about his or her smoke .
And the part that enraged me was the overt denial of reality that came next : both of them , bright people who really do respect their non-Christian friends , seemed to have never heard of the idea that anybody was involuntarily exposed to or inconvenienced by Christianity .
It seems to them that anybody in America is hardly ever exposed to Christianity , and certainly not in any kind of unpleasant or pernicious way .
And by sheer irony , they said this just as we were approaching my least favorite billboard on Interstate 170 -- a particularly weaselly , misleading billboard for Birthright , one of many " pregnancy counseling service centers " that the anti-abortion movement run that pretends to be a clinic long enough to get your name , address , and personal information so they can use it to blackmail you by threatening to use that information to ruin your life .
Why ?
Because protecting the " life " of a sixteen - cell growth the shape of a soccer ball on the inside of a woman 's uterine lining is so important , the majority religion in America assures us , that any malevolent , disgusting , or even illegal ( if anybody else did it ) tactic must be countenanced and openly tolerated , and if you object , it makesthe bigot againstreligious rights .
And that was just the example that came most readily to hand .
Had it not been after dark , we could n't have driven a mile on any stretch of interstate highway without seeing some random business with the Christian Fish logo in their advertising signage , either on the building or on their company vehicle .
And what message is that fish meant to send ?
" You can trust us , because we 're Christians .
Do n't trust the people who do n't have the fish , they 're not . "
I opined that nobody in America who works for a living can go half an hour of any workday without at least one reminder that non-Christians in general and atheists in particular ( as we were freshly reminded last week by a University of Minnesota survey , the only minority in America more hated than the Islamist fundamentalists that we 're actually at war with ) are second - class citizens , not full Americans , not even really people .
And we get even less choice whether or not to be exposed to their religious sentiments than he and his wife get over whether or not to be exposed to second - hand cigarette smoke , and thus have at least as much right to be cranky about Christianity as the right he claims to be cranky about tobacco smoke .
And what caused me to lose my cool altogether , was that even as I sat there rattling off example after example , from the vast number of political positions institutionalized in American law only because they 're uniquely Christian doctrines to the substantial barriers to entry in politics for non-Christians to one - sided proselytizing ( what do you think would happen to an atheist who went door - to - door inviting people to an anti-Bible study ? ) to businesses who only give Christian holidays off to businesses that refuse to hire or sell to or buy from non-Christians to athletic teams , schools , courts , and government bodies that open all meetings with Christian - specific prayers to ubiquitous billboards and bumper stickers aimed at reminding us of Christians ' privileged status to citizens everywhere from our stores to our own families who take it for granted that everybody in America is Christian and react with such disappointment to each counter example , they still kept insisting that it never happens .
I suggested to them that if some atheist went through their work week with some kind of digital voice recorder and kept a discrete record of every time that they were involuntarily exposed to Christian snubs against them , that it would exceed twice per hour .
I 'm retired , I do n't get out enough to get meaningful results .
Is anybody out there willing to at least carry one of those supermarket click - counters and keep a running count for me for a week of how many times they were exposed to toxic second - hand Christianity ?
The bodies were found in a basement deep freezer
The 42 - year - old host had invited guests for dinner at his home in the city of Verviers , 125 km ( 78 miles ) east of Brussels , prosecutors said .
A woman guest left the table to put leftovers in the freezer and alerted the authorities to the discovery .
Police said they were aware of domestic abuse issues between the wife and host .
' Ill at ease '
Christine Wilwerth , at the Verviers prosecutor 's office , said the suspect had indicated he had had a quarrel with his wife and she had been stabbed .
However , he had no initial explanation for the 12 - year - old boy 's death .
Ms Wilwerth said : " It was a lady who at the end of the meal at a friend 's house , and after washing the dishes ... decided to take the leftovers of the meal down to the basement to store in the deep freeze .
" Once she opened the deep freeze , she discovered the bodies . "
Guests then alerted police but refrained from telling the host .
He seemed " ill at ease " , Ms Wilwerth quoted the guests as saying .
" The couple was already known to police for domestic violence , " Ms Wilwerth said .
It was not immediately clear how or when the deaths occurred but Ms Wilwerth said the time of death could date back several weeks .

The psychiatrist who identified attention deficit disorder - the condition blamed for the bad behaviour of hundreds of thousands of children - has admitted that many may not really be ill .
Dr Robert Spitzer said that up to 30 per cent of youngsters classified as suffering from disruptive and hyperactive conditions could have been misdiagnosed .
They may simply be showing perfectly normal signs of being happy or sad , he said .
' Many of these conditions might be normal reactions which are not really disorders , ' he continued .
Dr Spitzer developed the bible of mental disorder classification in the 1970s and 1980s , which identified dozens of new conditions including ADD and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
Since then hundreds of thousands of children have been diagnosed with ADD , a behavioural disorder linked to poor attention span , and ADHD , which adds an element of hyperactivity .
The disorders describe disruptive and restless behaviour that results in children having difficulty focusing their attention on specific tasks .
ADHD is most commonly noticed at the age of five , and as many as one in 30 British children is said to have it .
It is often treated with drugs , with Ritalin being the most commonly prescribed .
Some scientists say ADHD is a genetic disorder that does not disappear with adulthood .
But sceptics believe the diagnosis is a ' biobabble ' label , which has evolved from a soundbite culture that is too prepared to medicalise anti-social human traits .
Dr Spitzer , professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York , now says the classification led to many people being diagnosed as medically disordered when their mood swings and behaviour were simply normal feelings of happiness and sadness .
In a BBC2 documentary series The Trap , which begins on Sunday , he says that between 20 and 30 per cent of mental disorder diagnoses may be incorrect .
His admission comes as figures show that the amount spent by the Health Service on drugs to treat ADHD and similar disorders in children trebled to £ 12 million in just five years , from 1999 - 2003 .
Almost 400,000 British children aged between five and 19 are believed to be on the drugs - despite doctors ' fears about side - effects .
That is the equivalent of every child in Britain each taking more than four doses of the drugs every year .
NHS guidelines recommend drug treatment for the most severely affected , although there have been reports of cardiovascular disorders , hallucinations and even suicidal thoughts .
There have been at least nine deaths reported to the UK's Medicinesand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency since Ritalin became available in the early 1990s .
But Dr Spitzer , who chaired the taskforce that compiled the international Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , said he is less concerned by wrong diagnoses and possible side - effects from drugs , than failing to prescribe them where needed .
' By and large the treatments for these disorders do n't have serious side effects , ' he told the Times Educational Supplement .
' I mean , some do , but they 're not that serious , whereas the failure to treat can often be very hard on the child and on the family . '
He acknowledged that some parents put pressure on doctors to diagnose ADHD and obsessive - compulsive disorder , and prescribe drugs .
' We do n't know to what extent that 's been happening inappropriately , ' he added .
Ian Graham , headmaster of Slindon College , an independent boys ' boarding school near Arundel , West Sussex , has 20 out of 100 pupils diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and a few more with related diagnoses such as oppositional - defiant disorder .
About 17 of the boys are prescribed drugs including Ritalin , while the remainder have their condition controlled through diets that exclude chocolate , sweets or gluten .
The school also employs therapy techniques , and the old - fashioned tactic of getting pupils to run off their energy in outdoor activities .
Mr Graham said : ' I 've never met a parent who is happy with the medication .
They would all prefer not to use them , but to a man and woman , they all say they can't believe the change in their sons ' ability to concentrate in lessons . '
抽象化ツールとしてのクロージャ
C++的なオブジェクトの世界では、オブジェクトの実体とは「ひとかたまりの構造体としてメモリ上に置かれたインスタンス変数の値」にすぎません。オブジェクトのポインタを取れば、それは事実上、その構造体へのポインタを持っていることになります。クロージャを「関数」中心で見ていると、その実体は「オブジェクト」の実体とは異質なもののように思えるでしょう。
確かにクロージャのナイーブな「実装」は、関数ポインタと環境へのポインタをくっつけたものです。しかし、クロージャをそのように実装する「必要」はありません。
クロージャの実装戦 略
C++的オブジェクトは、その歴史的いきさつ（端的に言えばC言語との互換性確保）のゆえに、インスタンス変数がメモリ上にひとかたまりで存在し、またその寿命もオブジェクト自身の寿命と一致する必要があります。たとえそのインスタンス変数が、ほんの一部のメソッドからしか触れられていなくても、あるいは一時的にしか使われなくても、です。C++の基になったCの構造体が、抽象的な複合型を表現するだけでなく、メモリ上のレイアウトの指定にも使われていた名残と言えます。
これに対しクロージャは、その中から参照している変数がどこに存在しても構いません（クロージャ自身が生きている間、本体から見えさえすれば）。例えば、初期化後に変更されないと分かっているローカル変数は、その初期化値をクロージャ内にコピーすることで消去可能です。mapに渡すクロージャのように、生存期間がローカル環境より短いことがはっきりしている場合は、ローカルスタックに置くこともできます。そして何より、クロージャが使われる個所が静的に（つまり、式を読み込んで内部ツリーに展開した時点で）すべて判明している場合は、本体をインライン展開してしまうことでクロージャそのものの存在を消去することさえ可能なのです。
部品としてのクロージャ
これらクロージャの最適化戦略は、関数型言語かいわいでは20〜30年ほど前に盛んに研究されたことで、いまでは暗黙の了解となっています。そのため、関数型言語のプログラマーはクロージャを書くときに、オブジェクトを「作っている」という感覚（例えばCのmallocや、C++/Javaのnewを呼ぶような感覚）をほとんど持ちません。結果として「何か」がアロケートされてしまうことはありますが、それは（1）どうやっても避けられないアロケーションか、もしくは（2）コンパイラが手を抜いているか、のいずれかなので、気にしても仕方がない*のです。
関数型言語のプログラマーにとっては、クロージャとはむしろ「穴の空いたコードのブロック」です。穴は仮引数であり、用途に応じて実際の値を埋め込む個所です。コードに似たようなパターンを見つけると、変化する部分を穴にして、共通部分を関数としてくくり出します。そして変化する部分を、実引数として与えてやるのです。
実例を見てみましょう。与えられた数の集合numbersをすべて足した値を返す関数sum-of-numbersは、リスト1のように書けます。一方、与えられた数の集合から、ある数値より大きいものだけを選ぶ関数more-thanは、リスト2のように書けます*。
( define ( sum - of - numbers numbers ) ( define ( loop sum nums ) ( if ( null ? nums ) sum ( loop (+ ( car nums ) sum ) ( cdr nums ) ) ) ) ( loop 0 numbers ) )
リスト1 与えられた数の集合numbersをすべて足した値を返す関数sum-of-numbers
( define ( more - than n numbers ) ( define ( loop out nums ) ( if ( null ? nums ) out ( loop ( if ( > ( car nums ) n ) ( cons ( car nums ) out ) out ) ( cdr nums ) ) ) ) ( loop '( ) numbers ) )
リスト2 与えられた数の集合から、ある数値より大きいものだけを選ぶ関数more-than
このように、ローカル関数loopで再帰するのは非常によく見るパターンです。両者を見比べると、リスト3のような共通構造があると分かります。本体内で変化する部分は、との部分のみです。それらを穴として引数で渡すことにすれば、共通構造を関数としてくくり出すことができます（リスト4）。
( define ( 名前 numbers ) ( define ( loop 経過 nums ) ( if ( null ? nums ) 経過 ( loop < 経過 と ( car nums ) を使った式 > ( cdr nums ) ) ) ) ( loop < 初期値 > numbers ) )
リ スト3 sum - of - numbers とmore - thanの共通構 造
( define ( fold proc seed lis ) ( define ( loop seed lis ) ( if ( null ? lis ) seed ( loop ( proc seed ( car lis ) ) ( cdr lis ) ) ) ) ( loop seed lis ) )
リ ス ト4 sum - of - numbers とmore - thanの 共通構造を関数としてくくり出した部品fold
この部品foldに、変化する部分を外から与えてやることで、元のsum-of-numbersとmore-thanを再構成できます*（リスト5）。これはほんの一例に過ぎません。同様にして、クロージャとはあらゆる個所で式を「部品化」してゆく手段なのです。
( define ( sum - of - numbers numbers ) ( fold ( lambda ( sum elt ) (+ sum elt ) ) 0 numbers ) )
( define ( more - than n numbers ) ( fold ( lambda ( out elt ) ( if (> elt n ) ( cons elt out ) out ) ) '( ) numbers ) )
リスト5 再構成したsum - of - numbers とmore - than
そもそも、基本的な部品化の手段であるローカル変数という概念自体を、Schemeの言語仕様はクロージャを用いて定義しています。ローカル変数x、yを導入するリスト6の式は、定義上、x、yを仮引数とするクロージャを作って直ちに初期値10、20を実引数として呼び出しているのと等価とされています（リスト7）。
( let ( (x 10 ) ← 変数x に10 を束縛（xを定義） ( y 20 ) ) ← 変数y に 20 を束縛（yを定義） ( sqrt (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) )
リスト6 ローカル変数x、yを定義する式（letという構文）
( ( lambda ( x y ) ( sqrt (+ (* x x ) (* y y ) ) ) ) 10 20 )
リスト7 let構文の定義による、リスト6のプログラムの「意味」
もちろん、多く のScheme処理系はlet構文を処理するためにクロージャの実体をアロケートしたりはしません（処理効率が悪くなるためです）。ただし、このようにクロージャを介した定義を行っておけば、クロージャ最適化のアルゴリズムを一様に適用できます。
クロージャによるオブジェクトの実装も同様です。プログラムの字面通りにクロージャの実体が生成される必要はありません。「クロージャによって（オブジェクトなどを）定義すれば、一般的な意味解析を適用できるようになる」という事実が、関数型のアプローチからは極めて有用なのです。

Good News , Bad News in Great Lakes Health Report
CHICAGO , Illinois , June 11 , 2007 ( ENS ) - Levels of many toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes are diminishing , yet at the same time new chemicals of concern are being detected , according to the latest joint report from the United States and Canada .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Environment Canada released the 2007 State of the Great Lakes Highlights Report at the International Joint Commission meeting Thursday in Chicago .
The commission is a inter- governmental agency that helps the two countries address boundary water issues .
The Great Lakes hold 20 percent of the Earth 's fresh surface water .

Beneath it is Lake Michigan , and to the right is Lake Huron .
Under Lake Huron is Lake Erie , left , and Lake Ontario , right .

The Highlights Report concludes that the chemical , physical and biological integrity of this ecosystem is a mixed bag .
Some conditions are improving while others are getting worse , the report documents .
Overall , there has been progress in reducing air pollution in the Great Lakes basin .
However , regional pollutants , such as ground - level ozone and fine particulates remain a concern , especially in the Detroit - Windsor - Ottawa corridor , the Lake Michigan basin , and the Buffalo - Niagara area .
Air quality will be further impacted by population growth and climate change .
Despite improvements in levels of contaminants in the Great Lakes , many biological components of the ecosystem are severely stressed , the report warns .
Populations of the native species near the base of the food web , such as zooplankton , are in decline in some of the Great Lakes .

Lake sturgeon are locally extinct in many tributaries and waters where they once spawned and flourished .
Habitat loss and deterioration remain the predominant threat to Great Lakes amphibian and wetland bird populations .
Pollution levels in Great Lakes fish have been dropping for 30 years due to controls on chemicals , and now more fish are safe to eat .
But a significant proportion of fish are still contaminated enough that they should be eaten in limited amounts or not at all .
People are working to reverse the damange says EPA Great Lakes National Program Office Director Gary Gulezian .
" As never before , legislators , managers , scientists , educators and the Great Lakes community are working together to understand and respond to Great Lakes environmental challenges , " he said .
These efforts to restore and preserve the Great Lakes are spotlighted in the 2007 State of the Great Lakes Highlights Report .
The good news is :
Over the past 30 years there has been a marked reduction in the levels of toxic chemicals in the air , water , plants , animals , and sediment .
Great Lakes continue to be a good source for treated drinking water .
In 2005 , 74 percent of monitored Great Lakes beaches in the U.S. and Canada were open more than 95 percent of the swimming season .
Significant natural reproduction of lake trout is occurring in lakes Huron and Superior .
New chemicals of concern , like polybrominated diphenyl ethers used as flame retardants , and various pharmaceutical and personal care products , are being detected more frequently .
Decline in contaminant concentrations has not eliminated the need for sport fish consumption advisories .
Non-native species ( zebra mussels , spiny water fleas ) continue to invade the Great Lakes and impair the food web .
Wildlife waste can be more of a contributing factor in bacterial contamination than previously thought .
Declines in the duration and extent of ice cover on the Great Lakes and declines in lake levels due to evaporation during the winter are expected to occur in future years .
Continuing wetlands loss and degradation results in loss of habitat for birds , amphibians , fish and wildlife .
Aquatic habitats on the coasts continue to deteriorate due to development , shoreline hardening and non-native species .

The United States and Canada are now in the process of deciding how to update their 1972 treaty , the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement , to reflect challenges such as climate change .
Less ice cover over the lakes has already resulted in more evaporation and lower water levels .
The public is invited by the Great Lakes Binational Executive Committee to submit comments on a draft binational report reviewing the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement .
The draft Agreement Review Report documents the first major review of the Agreement in nearly 20 years .
To read the draft , click here .
Comments are welcome until the close of the public comment period on July 14 , 2007 .

A thumb ’s up for “ I ’m good . ”
The rubbing of a pointed forefinger at another for “ shame on you . ”
The infamous and ubiquitous middle finger salute for — well , you know .
Such gestures that convey meaning without speech are used and recognized by nearly everyone in our society , but to someone from a foreign country , they may be incomprehensible .
The opposite is true as well .
Plop an American in a foreign land and he or she may be clueless to the common gestures of that particular culture .
This raises a provocative question — does culture influence the brain "
The answer is yes , reports Istvan Molnar - Szakacs , a researcher in the UCLA Tennenbaum Center for the Biology of Creativity , and Marco Iacoboni , director of the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Lab at the Ahmanson - Lovelace Brain Mapping Center of UCLA 's Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior .
Their research appears in the current issue of the journal PLoS ONE and is available online at http://www.plosone.org/doi/pone.0000626.
In their study , the researchers wanted to investigate the imprint of culture on the so - called mirror neuron network .
Mirror neurons fire when an individual performs an action , but they also fire when someone watches another individual perform that same action .
Neuroscientists believe this " mirroring " is the neural mechanism by which we can read the minds of other people and empathize with them .
When it comes to the influence of culture , they found that indeed , the mirror neuron network responds differently depending on whether we are looking at someone who shares our culture , or someone who does n’t .
The researcher ’s used two actors , one an American , the other a Nicaraguan , to perform a series of gestures -- American , Nicaraguan , and meaningless hand gestures , to a group of American subjects .
A procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) was used to measure the levels of so - called “ corticospinal excitability ” ( CSE ) — which scientists use to probe the activity of mirror neurons .
They found that the American participants demonstrated higher mirror neuron activity while observing the American making gestures compared to the Nicaraguan .
And when the Nicaraguan actor performed American gestures , the mirror neuron activation of the observers dropped .
“ We believe these are some of the first data to show neurobiological responses to culture - specific stimuli , ” said Molnar - Szakacs .
“ Our data show that both ethnicity and culture interact to influence activity in the brain , specifically within the mirror neuron network involved in social communication and interaction . ”
“ We are the heirs of communal but local traditions , ” said Iacoboni .
“ Mirror neurons are the brain cells that help us in shaping our own culture .
However , the neural mechanisms of mirroring that shape our assimilation of local traditions could also reveal other cultures , as long as such cross-cultural encounters are truly possible .
All in all , our research suggests that with mirror neurons our brain mirrors people , not simply actions . ”
Thus , it appears that neural systems supporting memory , empathy and general cognition encodes information differently depending on who ’s giving the information — a member of one ’s own cultural / ethnic in - group , or a member of an out - group , and that ethnic in - group membership and a culturally learned motor repertoire more strongly influence the brain ’s responses to observed actions , specifically actions used in social communication .
“ An important conclusion from these results is that culture has a measurable influence on our brain and , as a result , our behavior .
Researchers need to take this into consideration when drawing conclusions about brain function and human behavior , ” said Molnar - Szakacs .
The findings , the researchers note , may also have implications for motor skill and language learning , intergroup communication , as well as the study of intergroup attitudes toward other cultures .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A South Korean laboratory that produced the world ’s first cloned dogs is looking to get into the business of cloning canines , first by cloning drug - sniffing dogs , a lab official said on Tuesday .

REUTERS / Lee Jae-Won / Files
The laboratory at Seoul National University , implicated in a scandal for fabricating data in embryonic stem cell studies , has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Korea Customs Service to clone drug - sniffing dogs , said Kim Min - kyu , the researcher who heads the cloning project for the team .
“ However , this is taking place more on an investigative level , so we are n’t going to be making a profit from this deal , ” Kim said , adding : “ We have plans to clone dogs commercially in the future . ”
A customs service official confirmed it had reached a deal with the lab but would not offer details of the arrangement .
Although the lab , which is financed by the government , is focusing on cloning animals that provide services to humans , such as seeing - eye dogs or dogs who help law enforcement authorities , Kim said there is a possibility the team could look at cloning pets .
“ It is n’t worth being done commercially yet , ” he said .
“ There is n’t enough demand for cloning pets yet , although we expect the numbers to increase . ”
He estimated it would cost about 50 million won ( $ 54,310 ) to 100 million won to clone a pet dog .
Dogs are considered one of the most difficult mammals to clone because of their unpredictable reproductive cycle as well as difficulties in inducing ovulation and fertilizing eggs in the lab .
The team , once led by disgraced scientist Hwang Woo-suk , had been hailed as national heroes for bringing the country to the global forefront of cloning and stem cell studies .
It later was seen as an embarrassment after two landmark papers published by the team on cloned human embryonic stem cells were withdrawn by the publisher after an investigation panel found key data had been intentionally fabricated .
The team , however , did produce the world ’s first cloned dog in 2005 , the Afghan hound “ Snuppy ” , which has been verified by independent testing .
It has gone on to produce other cloned dogs and has cloned Korean grey wolves , an endangered species .
Former team leader Hwang is standing trial on charges of fraud , embezzlement and violating the country ’s bioethics laws .

Harry Reid has something to say about the multi- pronged bait - and - switch the Bush administration is trying to pull on the September progress report on Iraq :
" The White House ’s effort to prevent General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker from testifying openly and candidly before Congress about the situation in Iraq is unacceptable .
Not only does it contradict the law President Bush himself signed in May , but it appears to be yet another politically driven attempt to avoid giving Congress and the American people an honest and open assessment of a war we can all see is headed in the wrong direction .
" From the very beginning of this war , the Bush Administration has refused to level with the American people about its flawed policy .
It has instead done everything in its power to escape accountability and mislead us about the reality on the ground .
The result : an open - ended civil war that has taken nearly 4,000 American soldiers ’ lives and an Iraqi government that refuses to take responsibility for its own country .
" If the President is going to continue to ask American soldiers to fight in this civil war , ask taxpayers to spend $ 10 billion each month to fund this war and ask the American people for patience as he conducts this war , then those closest to the situation on the ground must give Congress and the American people a frank and honest account of this war free of White House political spin . "
The Raydiance USP laser obliterates molecules from inside the glass chunk .
Photo : Jonathan Snyder View Slideshow PETALUMA , California – Barry Schuler , the former CEO of AOL , has a laser he says can do it all .
It can cut metal , heal burns and kill cancer tumors – all without damaging heat .
All you need is one of his ultrashort pulse , or USP , lasers , he said .
To change the function , just change the software .
He 's so confident in the technology that he 's built his latest business venture , Raydiance , around it .
" Bits and blades are all going to be replaced by light , " says Schuler , who ran AOL after the Time - Warner merger .
In 10 years , he said , the technology will lead to a " smart " power tool that wo n't need sharpening and wo n't cause injuries .

Both Black & Decker and Johns Hopkins Could Use This Laser
Raydiance Labs : The Long Story of a Short Pulse
The technology can't do any of these things yet .
All Raydiance has is a small black box – but that 's no small feat .
The technology once filled a large room at Darpa until Raydiance scientists made it into a compact , tabletop unit .
Schuler said he hopes it will replace just about any cutting device you can think of , from a big metal saw to a precise surgical blade .
Scientists have long known that USP lasers could do cool things , literally , by cutting without generating heat .
But the lasers ' complexity and large size made the technology impractical .
Now that it 's a little bigger than a breadbox , researchers want to use them to kill cancer tumors , identify friend or foe during combat , and even remove tattoos .
The company has distributed about a dozen Raydiance units to researchers around the country , and hopes to have 30 in the field by the end of 2007 .
Raydiance is still tiny .
It has just 30 employees and an initial investment of $ 25 million from venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson .
( Schuler is managing director of the firm 's growth fund . )
About 25 other USP laser companies exist , but most focus on using the lasers in scientific research .
It 's a niche technology that seems to generate a lot of passion , perhaps because the technology has been around for about 25 years , but has been notoriously difficult to work with .
Now , many of the kinks have been worked out , and veterans like Bill Clark , CEO and co-founder of Clark - MXR , believe lasers are on the cusp of a boom .
" We 're like where we were in the '60s when the laser was first invented , " Clark said .
" People kept asking : ' It 's an interesting technology , but what problem is it going to solve ? '
Nowadays lasers are ubiquitous .
Everything we know about telecommunications is done with lasers .
I think we 're at the same threshold with USP lasers . "
The field saw a significant application breakthrough in 2005 when the FDA approved Intralase 's USP laser to perform the first part of LASIK eye surgery – cutting a flap to reveal the cornea .
The procedure was previously done only with a knife , and was the cause of most LASIK complications .
In March , Advanced Medical Optics acquired Intralase for $ 800 million .
Ron Waynant , an optics physicist at the FDA , has been working with lasers since 1962 , just two years after the first laser was invented .
He said he 's trying to be conservative about the promise of the Raydiance laser , but he believes it could have up to 100 medical uses – from removing tattoos to performing ultra-precise burn surgery .
The laser pulse is on for such a short time ( a femtosecond , or one - millionth of a nanosecond , or 10 to the negative 15th power ) , there 's no chance for heat conduction into the healthy tissue nearby .
The result is a clean cut that heals quickly .
" The short pulse is very effective in not damaging the tissue that 's left behind , " Waynant said .
Waynant envisions an even more precise laser eye surgery to replace the second phase of LASIK – removing tissue from the cornea – with less damage than today 's version .
He also imagines a light - activated glue to take the place of stitches , preventing distortion of the eye 's shape .
He said he 's also in talks with Johns Hopkins surgeons about using the technology to perform cornea transplants .
Ahamed Idris , professor of surgery and emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , wants to use the Raydiance laser for treating burns .
Now , scientists train 20 years to develop the skill required to treat a burn , which involves cutting away damaged tissue .
If any burned tissue is left behind , it will damage the surrounding healthy tissue .
It 's also extremely painful and usually requires general anesthesia .
But because burn patients are in such a delicate state , doctors must wait up to 72 hours for the patient to become stable enough for anesthesia and treatment .
The laser would be easy to use , and because it does n't give off heat , would be much less painful and likely not require general anesthesia – so treatment could begin right away .
That would be particularly useful on a battlefield , and Idris has a grant application in to the U.S. Army .
If it 's approved , he hopes to begin research in September .
When USP lasers hit skin or any other material , the material releases a vapor .
Each vapor has a unique spectrographic signature , which can serve as a marker for doctors to precisely pinpoint what type of tissue they 're aiming at , whether it be burned skin or a cornea .
" That 's important because we think that instantaneous analysis can be used to drive the laser with a computer , " Idris said .
Aimed at a tumor , software would use the spectrograph to zap the cancer but leave healthy tissue intact .
Controlling the laser with software is a key aspect of the Raydiance business model .
Schuler said he envisions a whole new field of software development evolving around his laser .
He also wants to sell the unit using a subscription model in which users rent the machine and can download updates through the internet .
Sound familiar ?
Here 's hoping Raydiance wo n't promote those updates with free CDs that fall out of magazines .

Scruffy says :
Well , I 'm half - russian , living in Estonia and I totally disagree with Kokoito .
It seem like you have a " tibla " brain .
Tibla does n't mean russian or russian speaking .
I know personally few estonians who could be a tibla .
Tibla stays more for a way to think and live .
It 's like a person who doe n't have a nation and behaves like worst kind of Homo Sovieticus .
Unfortunately lots of people that fits to this description are russian - speaking .
For the Second :
You telling about a people with flowers , yes there was people with flowers at the first they at deytime ... but the riots started by nighttime , when people with flowers went home or exchanged flowers against rocks .
For the Third :
It seems that you are only reading russian news ... 350 policemen resigned ... yes i remember that it came from russian news as a propaganda .
In fact i have a good friend working in estonian police and he told me that most of russian policemen in estonia , after they heard this " news " wanted to work more and show to the world that russian press lies !
And one more thing to you :
It wasnt 49 % , it was 51 % and it was n't percent of populace , it was percent of russian spoken people in Estonia .
With other word it was 1/6 of estonian population
About my opinion :
Actually knowing that this statue made a lots of pain for most of estonian people ( mostly because 1944 , when german troops recided , estonian people regenerated estonian goverment .
A week later came russian troops and aircraft and flatted a whole estonian capital .
They killed only civilians and later they started to call this day for freeing estonia from german nazis ...
Russians still denies , that this has happened ) I had nothing against it .
Actually i never paid an attention to this , for me it does n't matter if there was a statue of a soldier , king or a penis .
I believed that if there is a people who had relationship to this statue , let it be .
This was my opinion until two years ago .
Then I went of a bus ( actually there is a bus stop right on a graves ) and i was speaking to my estonian friend in estonian language .
I was n't thinking that this is a 9th may ( russians celebrate then end of WW2 ) .
There was lots of people , with red soviet flags and they was screaming and yelling , drinking vodka ( in Estonia its forbidden to drink alcohol in a public places ) and dancing ( in my knowledge this kind of behavior is not allowed on a graves in any culture ) .
I did n't payed attention and went my way and chatting with my friend , when suddenly ... somebody out of this mass of people started to pint at me and screaming " f..ing estonian nazis , kill them " .
After that a lot of a people started to scream loudly a f word to me and my friend .
We did n't payed attention and tryed to get out of there , when we noticed that some of a people started to hunt us and somebody throw an empty glass bottle .
After this day i totally changed my mind .
I started to understand better estonians misery and i started to hate really hardly those " Tiblad " .
To the end i want just say that i agree with estonian government : if this is a grave for a soldiers , then it should be placed on military graveyard and it should be treated as grave and memory place , not like a public pub !
Yes , I can't get over James Baker being the chairman of a civil commission on war and statecraft .
The first reason is that he is primarily responsible for American policy in the first Bush administration .
That policy was a strategic disaster and a moral enormity .
On Baker 's head rests almost all of the responsibility for Saddam Hussein surviving in power after the first Gulf war .
And , given that fact , also responsible for Saddam 's atrocities against the Shia and Kurds for which the deposed tyrant is at last being tried in the very context of this war .
James Baker is actually an accessory to war crimes of the Iraqi Baath Party in a war fought entirely against civilians .
The truth is that he trusted Saddam ... just as he seems to trust Bashar Assad and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be reasonable .
If he truly trusts them on anything he is , well , as gullible as Chamberlain .
i.e .
It 's all up to the president now .
. . .
That means the president will have to be , much more than he has been , his own general and strategist .
He will have to decide on his own that incremental measures , such as stepping up the pace of Iraqi training , will not make enough of a difference in a short enough time to prevent a collapse of American policy and of Iraq itself .
He will have to decide , contrary to the advice of many of his top advisers , that many more American troops need to be sent to Iraq , and as quickly as possible .
. . .
Now he needs to display a different kind of courage .
He has to take into his own hands the fate of Iraq and make his own decisions about what needs to be done .
Of course , he should listen to all his advisers .
But he must also know that his advisers , both civilian and military , have been failing him for the past three years .
American policy , if it is to have any hope of turning the tide , must change dramatically in the next month or two .
No one other than President Bush can make that change .
The Iraq Study Group 's report simply confirms , yet again , the bedrock truth of the war : the American Establishment has no intention of leaving Iraq , ever , and no intention of having anything but a pliant , cowed , bullied puppet government in Baghdad to carry out whatever the Establishment decides is in its best interests on any given day .
Iraq was invaded because large swathes of the American elite thought they could make hay of it one way or another ( financially , politically , ideologically or even psychologically , for those pathetic souls who get their sense of manhood or personal validation from their identification with a big , swaggering , domineering empire ) .
And U.S. troops will remain in Iraq , indefinitely , at some level , because the American elite think they can make hay of the situation one way or another .
The war is all about -- is only about -- what the American elite feel is in their own best interest , how it aggrandizes their fortunes , flatters their prejudices , serves their needs .
The one positive aspect of the Baker - Hamilton report is that the reactions it is provoking -- both positive and viciously negative -- have shed as bright a light as one could hope for on our current predicament .
Never before have the reasons we are in Iraq -- and staying indefinitely -- been as clear as they are now .
Most notable is the frothing intensity of the personal attacks on Jim Baker coming from the neoconservatives and other assorted warmongers .
Here is Marty Peretz , Editor of the very sober and serious foreign policy magazine The New Republic : To Peretz , the 1991 ejection of Iraq from Kuwait -- undertaken with U.N. approval and a genuine , worldwide coalition -- was " a strategic disaster and a moral enormity , " all because we did n't proceed to invade Iraq and occupy Baghdad .
But the current war in Iraq is noble and wise .
How much more extremist and out of touch can a person be ?
Beyond branding Baker as a war criminal , neonconservatives are also ( of course ) smearing him as an anti-Semite -- again .
Peretz , in a separate post , accuses Baker of using the Report to further wage what Peretz calls " Baker 's old war with the Israelis and with the Jews . "
Powerline 's Paul Mirgenoff compared Baker to the Hated Anti-Semite de Jour : " other than Jimmy Carter , I can't think of a major public figure I like less than James Baker . "
Rush Limbaugh accused Baker of leading the " Iraq Surrender Group , " and at Pajamas Media , Michael Ledeen called Rush 's epithet " elegant " and himself pronounced the B - H Report " disgusting " because it recommended talks with Israel 's enemies .
As I argued immediately after the election , the disaster of the Iraq War and the resulting rejection of Bush - Republican policies presents a real opportunity to isolate , and relegate back to the fringes , the neoconservatives and more generic crazed warmongers who have dictated our foreign policy over the last five years -- the Bill Kristols , Rush Limbaughs , John McCains , Charles Krauthammers , Joe Liebermans , American Enterprise Institutes and Rich Lowrys , who have an insatiable appetite for endless wars that degrade America 's credibility , resources , strength , security and national character .
At a time when most Americans have recognized that this war is a disaster and want to withdraw , this group of radical warriors continues to insist not only that the invasion of Iraq was the right thing to do , but that we need more of it -- more troops , more fighting , more threats , less diplomacy , less concern for world opinion , more regime change , more wars .
John McCain and Bill Kristol favor a policy -- , deploy as many more American troops as possible to Iraq -- which only a tiny percentage of Americans ( ranging from 8 % to 16 % ) support .
Although the media has yet to realize it , this group is already on the outer fringe of our political spectrum .
Hateful rants directed towards Baker like those from Peretz , Limbaugh and the AEI luminaries ( even as Baker endorsed an indefinite presence in Iraq ) illustrate just how radical they are .
And as they are now quite openly admitting , neoconservatives hate Jim Baker for three reasons -- Israel , Israel and Israel .
It is n't just that the B - H Report committed the crime of suggesting in passing that it might be beneficial for the U.S. to increase its efforts to forge an Israeli - Palestinian agreement .
Even worse ( to them ) , it also suggested that there might be benefits for the U.S. if we tried to achieve some sort of cooperative understanding with Israel 's two remaining formidable enemies -- Syria and Iran .
Treating Syria and Iran like anything other than new Nazi Germanys to be bombed and crushed is the greatest neoconservative sin there is .
We 're told that these two countries are so hateful and insane that the mere idea of doing anything other than bombing them into submission -- or , even better , out of existence -- is " unrealistic . "
Neoconservatives argue this even though , as Baker himself pointed out during his friendly chat with Larry King this week , Iran already cooperated with the U.S. in stabilizing Afghanistan ( because a stable Afghanistan was in their interests ) , and Syria was cooperative on multiple post - 9/11 fronts until the neoconservatives succeeded in convincing Bush to treat them like lepers , thereby forcing them into the arms of the Iranians .
It may ( or may not ) be true that Syria and / or Iran are intractable when it comes to hostility towards Israel ( those who argue this previously said the same about Egypt ) .
But it is clearly false -- empirically proven to be false -- that those countries are dedicated to " waging war " on the U.S. and would thus refuse to cooperate no matter how much their interests were served by doing so .
Those two countries are the implacable enemies of Israel , not the U.S. , but many neoconservatives want to abolish any such distinction .
At the same time , Baker and his friends are far from pure in their motives either .
Much of their bickering with the AIPAC warriors was driven not by some principled belief in the unfair plight of the Palestinians , but by their desire to forge business relationships with Arab governments .
As this generally pro-Israel , anti-Baker history of that period recounts , Bush 41 officials were eager to pursue arms sales and oil contracts in the Middle East , transactions that required a " realist " approach , meaning a willingness to do business even with the most brutal and suffocating Arab dictators who also happened to be Israel 's enemies .
In Syria and Iran , Baker , Frank Carlucci and company saw ( and see ) large oil fields and / or a large market for Boeing to be cultivated , while American neoconservatives saw ( and see ) enemies of Israel needing to be smashed .
As the events of this week revealed , neither Baker nor his neoconservative enemies have changed any .
Hence , Baker 's Report urges the privatization of Iraqi oil fields and negotiations with Israel 's enemies , while American neoconservatives see him as a surrender - happy anti-Semite .
All of this is so tiresome and dishonest that it really engenders a strong desire to ignore it all , which one could do if not for the fact that the Baker - Hamilton Report has virtually sealed the fate of our Iraq policy for the next two years -- stay the course with a few cosmetic alterations , at best -- and still greater dangers lie ahead .
The Baker - hating neoconseratives continue to agitate for more war , undeterred by their growing repudiation and loss of credibility because they believe they still possess the ultimate trump card -- namely , their ongoing ability to continue to sway the poor , besieged , increasingly isolated President with their visions of neoconservative grandeur .
Robert Kagan and Bill Kristol all but demanded a show of Bush 's manhood yesterday in their war - rallying column in The Weekly Standard , entitled " It 's Up to Bush " :
All of the American anti-war sentiment and Baker - Hamilton Reports in the world do not change the one fact on which neoconservatives and warmongers are ( understandably ) placing all of their war - hungry hopes and dreams -- namely , that the President , who is in fact still the Commander - in - Chief , will remain convinced that both his historical legacy and theological goodness depend upon Victory in the Epic War of Civilizations , the Great Challenge of the 21st Century .
Thus , unburdened and unrestrained by any future elections , they hope that Bush will continue to wage war , and will escalate those efforts -- in Iraq and beyond .
Yesterday , the President -- jarringly enough -- petulantly provoked an argument with Dick Durbin by making clear that he sees himself as Harry Truman , pressing forward with our grand , important wars even in the face of a lack of resolve on the part of Americans .
Bush believes he will be vindicated by history -- like Truman -- and anyone who thinks he is going to change course or moderate his aggression any simply has n't been paying attention to how he operates .
The opposite course -- a marked increased in aggression and military force in order to prove he still can -- is the far more likely outcome .
That is the truly bizarre and indescribably dangerous situation we face .
America has turned against these extremists and this warmongering sentiment , but the President ( and especially his closest advisor , the Vice President ) remains solidly in their camp .
They 're convinced that they will be vindicated by staying forever in Iraq , and possibly expanding our military force beyond Iraq .
And Jim Baker , having supported the war in the first place , all but ensured that this would happen ( even , admittedly , while forcing into the establishment dialogue some important observations ) .
It 's true that these extremists ( and , hopefully , the establishment institutions which have enabled them , beginning with the Beltway media ) are being marginalized as they become further and further removed from popular American sentiment .
And that could be a real long - term gain for the country .
But it 's also true that we are going to remain in Iraq ( at least ) through the Bush Presidency ( at least ) , and it's hard to see any benefit that could possibly compete with that tragic harm .
Chris Floyd captured the bottom line perfectly : I 've been persuaded by those who have argued here over the past couple days that the Baker - Hamilton Report is n't pure evil , because it so fundamentally undercuts the neoconservative narrative about the world .
That may be true .
But its effect of solidifying our ongoing presence in Iraq and transforming anti-withdrawal sentiment into the mainstream , centrist , bipartisan position vastly outweigh that .
As long as we stay as an occupying force in Iraq -- with all of the abuses and destruction and drain that inevitably goes with it -- it is difficult to imagine how we are going to reverse any of the damage that has been done to our country over the last six years .
The neoconservatives are being revealed as the ugly , crazed extremists that they are .
But they still remain more or less firmly in control in the form of George Bush , Dick Cheney and company .
And that control has not been loosened any by the Baker - Hamilton Report .
If anything , the opposite has occurred .
WASHINGTON , July 31 — Under pressure from President Bush , Democratic leaders in Congress are scrambling to pass legislation this week to expand the government ’s electronic wiretapping powers .
Democratic leaders have expressed a new willingness to work with the White House to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act to make it easier for the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on some purely foreign telephone calls and e-mail .
Such a step now requires court approval .
It would be the first change in the law since the Bush administration ’s program of wiretapping without warrants became public in December 2005 .
In the past few days , Mr. Bush and Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence , have publicly called on Congress to make the change before its August recess , which could begin this weekend .
Democrats appear to be worried that if they block such legislation , the White House will depict them as being weak on terrorism .
Republican presidential candidates back nuclear strike against Iran
By Patrick Martin
7 June 2007
Nine of ten candidates for the Republican presidential nomination explicitly or tacitly supported a US attack on Iran using nuclear weapons , in response to a question at Tuesday night ’s nationally televised debate in New Hampshire .
Despite the extraordinary character of these declarations — giving support to the first use of nuclear weapons in war since Hiroshima and Nagasaki , 62 years ago — there was virtually no US press coverage of these remarks and no commentary on their significance .
While the Republican candidates sought to present the military action as a limited one against Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons facilities , calling them “ tactical nuclear strikes , ” no one should misunderstand what this means .
The use of nuclear weapons , in whatever form , against a densely populated country of 75 million would be an act of mass murder .
These comments reflect the derangement and depravity of considerable sections of a ruling elite which believes it must make a “ success ” of its occupation of Iraq , even if it requires “ doubling its bet ” and attacking another major country in the Middle East — one which is three times larger than Iraq and with a long history of struggle for independence and against colonial - style rule .
The initial exchange came about half an hour into the debate , which was broadcast on CNN and moderated by CNN anchorman Wolf Blitzer .
After some initial discussion on the Iraq war , in which nine of the ten candidates vowed to persevere in the effort to control the oil - rich country , Blitzer asked Congressman Duncan Hunter of California , former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , about recent talks between US and Iranian officials in Baghdad .
He asked Hunter whether it was correct to negotiate with Iran , given Iran ’s alleged efforts to develop nuclear weapons .
When Hunter endorsed the talks , Blitzer followed up with this question :
Blitzer :
If it came down to a preemptive US strike against Iran ’s nuclear facility , if necessary would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons ?
Hunter : I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges .
Blitzer then turned to former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani , who currently leads in opinion polls of prospective Republican primary voters .
Blitzer :
What do you think , Mayor ?
Do you think if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb , which you say is unacceptable , you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons ?
Giuliani : Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power .
I think it could be done with conventional weapons , but you ca n’t rule out anything and you should n’t take any option off the table .
The same question was then posed to former Virginia Governor James Gilmore , and to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , the candidate with the most backing from Wall Street and other financial interests .
Gilmore criticized “ the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world , ” adding that while he supported negotiations with Iran , “ We ’re also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable .
They need to understand it .
And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance . ”
Questioned by Blitzer , Romney used the same formulation .
Blitzer : Governor Romney , I want to get you on the record .
Do you agree with the mayor , the governor , others here , that the use of tactical nuclear weapons , potentially , would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb ?
Romney :
You do n’t take options off the table .
These four candidates were the only ones directly asked the question , but five others — Senator John McCain , Senator Sam Brownback , Congressman Tom Tancredo , former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson , and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee — had ample opportunity to object or to distinguish their positions from this endorsement of mass murder .
Only one candidate chose to do so , Congressman Ron Paul of Texas , the former Libertarian presidential candidate .
Paul , a conservative politician who articulates the isolationist strain in American bourgeois politics , is a critic of the Iraq war .
He finally addressed the issue of using nuclear weapons an hour after it was raised , in response to a question from a college professor in the audience , who asked what each candidate thought was the most important moral issue facing the country .
Several of the Republican candidates gave predictable responses , citing abortion and the “ right to life , ” a right which they are not prepared to concede to the people of Iraq , Iran or any other country that stands in the way of American imperialism .
Congressman
Paul ’s response is worth quoting , since it demonstrates how far the “ mainstream ” of American bourgeois politics has gone in embracing mass killing as an instrument of state policy .
Blitzer : Congressman Paul , what ’s the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now ?
Paul : I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war .
I do not believe that ’s part of the American tradition ...
And now , tonight , we hear that we ’re not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security ! ”
These remarks were greeted with considerable applause , an indication that even among self - identified rank - and - file Republicans there is growing unease over the escalating militarism of the American ruling elite .
But in the corporate - controlled US media , there was little or no commentary about the endorsement of a nuclear strike against Iran .
CNN , which broadcast the debate , reported it in passing , and cited only Congressman Hunter ’s support for the use of tactical nuclear weapons .
The Washington Post reduced the issue to a single clause of a sentence towards the end of its report on the debate , in which , it claimed , McCain , Giuliani and Romney “ each had moments in which they shined . ”
The Post reporters did not say if they thought that Giuliani ’s and Romney ’s support for possible nuclear strikes on Iran was such a moment .
The entire treatment of the subject was limited to the following : “ The candidates said they would not remove the option of using nuclear weapons to prevent Iran from obtaining such weapons , and they also fielded questions about abortion , religion , health care and global warming . ”
The rest of the mainstream press did not even report this endorsement of an unprovoked US nuclear attack on Iran .
The New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , the Associated Press , Bloomberg News Service , ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox News all said nothing .
There is no politically innocent explanation for this silence .
One can only imagine the howling in the American media if a prominent official figure in China had threatened the use of nuclear weapons against Taiwan , or if a candidate to succeed Vladimir Putin in Russia had called for nuclear strikes against one of its pro-Western neighbors .
Outside the United States , the significance of the threats of nuclear attack on Iran was widely recognized .
The British news service Reuters led its report on the debate with the Iran comments , under the headline , “ Republicans : Iran Must Not Have Nuclear Arms . ”
The lead paragraph begins : “ Republican candidates for US president agreed on Tuesday that Iran must not develop atomic weapons even if a tactical nuclear strike is needed to stop it ... ”
The Israeli daily newspaper Ha’aretz also took note , commenting , “ One of the more memorable statements was made by former Governor Jim Gilmore , who said that all options were on the table in dealing with Iran , including the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons . ”
The bloodlust expressed in these remarks is not limited to the nine Republicans on the stage in New Hampshire .
Prospective candidate Fred Thompson , the former senator from Tennessee , gave a television interview immediately after the debate in which he solidarized himself with the call for a preemptive strike against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
As for the Democrats , nearly all of the party ’s presidential candidates , as well as the entire congressional leadership , are on record in support of escalating the US campaign of diplomatic pressure , economic sanctions and military saber - rattling against Iran , aimed at preparing public opinion in the United States for a new and even more terrible slaughter in the Middle East .
When yeast cells are infused with rat - sniffing genes , then linked to produce a fluorescent green protein , they light up when a component of TNT is around .
The technology could be used to detect dangerous explosive and chemical weapons .
Using yeast cells and rat genes , researchers have developed a new explosive - sniffing biosensor that could detect dangers ranging from landmines to sarin gas , according to a new study .
To create the biosensor , Danny Dhanasekaran and his team at Temple University School of Medicine inserted a rat ’s smelling genes into yeast cells — the same microbes used to make bread and beer — and also linked the genes to churn out a fluorescent green protein .
When the olfactory receptor " smells " the odor of explosive TNT , the biosensor glows green .
Dhanasekaran said the technology , detailed in the June issue of the journal Nature Chemical Biology , could be of “ immense value ” in turning up chemical weapons , even when not enough toxins are present to be lethal , as biosensors are cheaper , less cumbersome and more flexible than man-made sensors .
Now that the scientists have shown the biosensor works , shortening the time it takes to sniff out dangers is a top priority .
But the team also thinks it could be used for other applications with a bit of genetic tweaking .
“ This system could also be used to screen experimental medications , a crucial step in the development of new drugs , " said Dhanasekaran .
The study , produced by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and published online by the Lancet , claims the total number of deaths is more than 10 times greater than any previously compiled estimate .
The findings provoked an immediate political storm .
Within hours of its release , George Bush had dismissed the figures .
" I do n't consider it a credible report , " he told reporters at the White House .
" Neither does General Casey [ the top US officer in Iraq ] , neither do Iraqi officials . "
The Foreign Office also cast doubt on the findings , stating that the government preferred to rely on the body count of the Iraqi ministry of health , which recorded just 7,254 deaths between January 2005 and January 2006 .
But the US researchers have the backing of four separate independent experts who reviewed the new paper for the Lancet .
All urged publication .
One spoke of the " powerful strength " of the research methods , which involved house - to - house surveys by teams of doctors across Iraq .
The Johns Hopkins researchers published an earlier study in the Lancet in October 2004 , which caused similar shock waves .
They say the new work validates the old and shows an alarming escalation in violent deaths .
Nearly a third of the deaths ( 31 % ) were ascribed to the coalition forces .
Most of the deaths - 601,000 out of 655,000 - were due to violence and of those , 56 % were caused by gunshot wounds .
Air strikes , car bombs and other explosions accounted for a further 13 - 14 % .
For reasons involving their own safety , the doctors did not probe whether those who died were combatants or civilians .
Deaths due to disease have also risen as the conflict has damaged Iraq 's health services .
The authors say their discovery that the death rate in Iraq has more than doubled from 5.5 per 1,000 a year before the invasion to 13.3 per 1,000 a year since " constitutes a humanitarian emergency " .
" Although such death rates might be common in times of war , " write the authors , Professor Gilbert Burnham and colleagues , " the combination of a long duration and tens of millions of people affected has made this the deadliest international conflict of the 21st century and should be of grave concern to everyone .
" At the conclusion of our 2004 study we urged that an independent body assess the excess mortality that we saw in Iraq .
This has not happened .
" We continue to believe that an independent international body to monitor compliance with the Geneva conventions and other humanitarian standards in conflict is urgently needed .
With reliable data , those voices that speak out for civilians trapped in conflict might be able to lessen the tragic human cost of future wars . "
Yesterday the Foreign Office repeated the government 's criticism of two years ago .
" We will be looking at it in more detail but it is a fairly small sample they have taken and they have extrapolated across the country , " said a spokesman .
" We rely on the Iraqi government themselves .
They are producing their own figures these days .
Our position at the moment is that whatever figures we see , all these civilian deaths are a tragedy and of great concern to us .
The multinational forces and the international community have to support a democratically elected government which is trying to stamp out the violence . "
The US defence department said that it always regrets the loss of life anywhere .
" The coalition takes enormous precautions to prevent civilian deaths and injuries , " said its spokesman , Mark Ballesteros .
" By contrast , the enemy in Iraq takes no such precautions and deliberately targets innocent civilians .
" It would be difficult for the US to precisely determine the number of civilian deaths in Iraq as a result of insurgent activity .
The Iraqi ministry of health would be in a better position , with all of its records , to provide more accurate information on deaths in Iraq . "
The Lancet editor , Richard Horton , says in a commentary published online with the study that the work " corroborates the impression that Iraq is descending into bloodthirsty chaos " .
Plans by the Americans to reduce the number of troops in Iraq appeared yesterday to have been scuppered by the growing violence in the country .
General Peter Schoomaker , the US army chief of staff , said he was planning for troop numbers to stay at the present level through to 2010 .
" This is not a prediction that things are going poorly or better .
It 's just that I have to have enough ammo in the magazine that I can continue to shoot as long as they want us to shoot , " he said .
There are 141,000 American troops in Iraq , and the US government had hinted it would begin reducing numbers to 100,000 after the inauguration of the Iraqi government .
But these plans appear to have been jeopardised by increased insurgent attacks and sectarian killings .
Yesterday , Jan Egeland , the UN under - secretary for humanitarian affairs , warned : " Revenge killing seems to be totally out of control " and added that the " blunt , brutal violence " in Iraq was targeting all civilians .
But despite Dr Horton 's bleak assessment , he writes , " absolute despair would be the wrong response .
Instead , the disaster that is the west 's current strategy in Iraq must be used as a constructive call to the international community to reconfigure its foreign policy around human security rather than national security ...
Health is now the most important foreign policy issue of our time . "

One year after the beginning of its scientific operations , the high - capability infrared satellite AKARI continues to produce stunning views of the infrared Universe .
Launched in February 2006 , AKARI is making a comprehensive , multi- wavelength study of the sky in infrared light , helping to gain a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies , stars and planetary systems .
The mission is a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) project with ESA and international participation .
In the course of last year , AKARI performed all - sky observations in six wavelength bands .
More than 90 percent of the entire sky has so far been imaged .
The mission provides the first census of the infrared sky since the atlas made by its only infrared surveyor predecessor , the Anglo - Dutch - US IRAS satellite more than 20 years ago .
AKARI has studied about 3500 selected targets during pointed observations , with improved spatial resolution .
The latest results presented by JAXA today show the infrared sky with unprecedented spatial resolution and wavelength coverage and , in particular , many regions of active star formation .
The first two images presented in this article show the entire sky in infrared light at nine micrometres .
The bright stripe extending from left to right is the disc of our own Milky Way Galaxy .
Several bright regions corresponding to strong infrared radiation appear along or next to the Galactic Plane .
These regions are sites of newly born stars .
At the brightest region in the very centre of the image , towards the centre of our Galaxy , old stars crowd together .
AKARI observed the infrared radiation emitted from the heated interstellar dust .
The inscriptions indicate constellations and regions of intense star formation .
The data used to create this image have a spatial resolution of about nine arcseconds , several times finer than IRAS in 1983 .
Further detailed analysis of this data will help to learn more about the physical conditions of these star formation regions .
The bright spot on the lower - right of the image , indicated as the ‘ Large Magellanic Cloud ’ shows another galaxy close to our Milky Way , also undergoing active star formation .
Even though not visible at the current resolution of this image , there are many more galaxies in the Universe with intense star formation processes .
It is one of AKARI ’s prime targets to observe these galaxies and build up a comprehensive picture of the star formation history of the Universe .
AKARI ’s Far Infrared Surveyor ( FIS ) instrument also observed the Milky Way and the Orion region .
In this image , two views at visual light ( left ) and infrared light ( right ) are juxtaposed , both covering a region of about 30x40 square degrees .
AKARI ’s view is taken at 140 micrometres .
For the first time ever , AKARI provided coverage of the Orion region at infrared wavelengths longer than 100 micrometres at such fine resolution .
The right side of the image covers the constellation Orion while the left side shows the Monoceros .
The Galactic Plane is located from the top to bottom in the left side of the image .
Cold dust in the Galactic Plane appears as diffuse radiation over the entire image .
The very bright source just below the belt of Orion shows the famous Orion Nebula ( M42 ) , where many stars are being born .
Another major star - forming region including the Horse Head nebula can be seen on the left side of Orion 's belt .
In contrast to its appearance as a dark cloud in visible light , it is extremely bright in the infrared .
The bright extended emission seen in the middle - left part of the image is the so - called Rosette Nebula , yet another star - forming region .
Finally , the big circular structure centred at the head of Orion is clearly visible .
Apparently many massive stars were formed at the centre of the circle , causing a corresponding series of supernova explosions that has swept out the dust and gas in the region forming a shell - like structure .
The Orion Nebula is located about 1500 light years away from Earth ; the Rosetta nebula 3600 light years .
This false - colour composite was obtained by AKARI ’s Far Infrared Surveyor ( FIS ) instrument at 90 and 140 micrometres .
It shows star - forming regions in the constellation Cygnus , one of the brightest regions in the Milky Way .
The image covers 7.6 x 10.0 square degrees .
This region is in a direction along the so - called ‘ Orion arm ’ , one of the spiral arms of our Galaxy .
Many objects at distances of three thousand to ten thousand light years are projected on this small region .
The Galactic plane appears from the top - left to bottom - right .
The many bright spots in the image reveal regions where new stars are being born .
They heat up the dust and ionize the gas in their vicinity producing strong infrared radiation .
There are only a small number of regions in our Galaxy that exhibit so many massive star - forming regions over such a restricted area of the sky .
The large , dark hollows , also clearly visible on the image , developed from clusters of massive , high - temperature stars that have blown away the surrounding gas and dust by their strong radiation .

The administration of President Barack Obama appears to have succeeded in preventing Congress from enacting new sanctions against Iran before the next round of nuclear - related talks between the U.S. and other great powers and Tehran scheduled for Geneva Nov. 20 .
As a result , optimism that at least an interim deal may soon be achieved between … Continue reading “ Obama Gets More Time for Iran Nuclear Deal ”
The cover story of the December 9th issue of Science News , The Predator ’s Gaze , is about psychopathy .
The whole article is worth a read , but the brief description of psychopathy at the beginning got me thinking about something that Anil Dash wrote the other day .
He highlighted a review of a B&B made by a potential guest that was upset that his many attempts to persuade the owners to accept his expired gift certificate .
Anil labeled this person a sociopath :
As a public service , I offer you my analysis .
This quote is how you can tell this guy is a sociopath .
Not that he merely went online and vented to random strangers about his greediness .
No , rather , that he was willing to concede his own willful ignorance ( or illiteracy ? ) while complaining .
The web is littered with these chuckleheads who point out their own sociopathic behavior while complaining about others .
At dinner the other night , a group of us were talking about a particularly irksome message board contributor and the subject of sociopathy came up again .
This particular person seemed to be oblivious to the rules of the board , did n’t pick up on the social cues of other participants or moderators to modify his behavior , and was making public personal attacks against others while complaining that others were doing the same to him , even though they were not .
Anyone who runs a community site , has comments on their blog , or participates on a message board knows this guy — and it usually is a guy .
He ’s the fly in everyone else ’s ointment , screaming in the middle a quiet conversation , and then says things like “ if you hate me , I must be doing something right ” .
With that in mind , some quotes from the Science News article :
Psychopaths lack a conscience and are incapable of experiencing empathy , guilt , or loyalty .
People with psychopathy do n’t modify behaviors for which they ’re punished and do n’t learn to avoid actions that harm others , Blair proposes in the September Cognition .
As a result , they fail to develop a moral sense , in his view .
Blair ’s theory fits with previous observations that psychopaths have difficulty learning to avoid punishments , show weak physiological responses to threats , and do n’t often recognize sadness or fear in others .
He views psychopathic personalities as the product of an attention deficit .
Psychopaths focus well on their explicit goals but ignore incidental information that provides perspective and guides behavior , Newman holds .
Most other people , as they take action , unconsciously consult such information , for instance , rules of conduct in social settings and nonverbal signs of discomfort in those around them .
Sounds a lot like the fellow we were discussing at dinner .
I do n’t think most of the people that demonstrate antisocial behavior in comment threads are actually psychopaths or sociopaths ( there is a difference ) in real life .
Rather , interacting via text strips out so much social context and “ incidental information ” that causes some people to display psychopathic behavior online and fail to develop an online moral sense .
Thinking about disruptive commenters in this way presents an interesting challenge .
According to the article , psychopathy seems to be genetic in nature and curing people of this extreme antisocial behavior can be difficult .
An Australian study cited in the article found that boys with behavioral problems reacted better to rewards for good behavior than to punishments for bad behavior .
Maybe looking for ways to reward bad online community members for their good behavior as well as trying to replace some of the stripped away social context is the way forward .
( A quick idea for replacing some social context : add a graphic of eyes to the text - posting interface ? )
Chad Ross works at a Certain State Agency and is unable to send any emails to his client , Mr. Gookin .
The CSA 's content filter just keeps blocking Chad 's outgoing emails , complaining that they contain racist content .
More specifically , the filter finds Mr. Gookin 's last name to be particularly offensive .
Because the CSA 's IT administrator refuses to add “ Gookin ” to the filter 's safe word list , Chad is left with the daunting task of asking Mr. Gookin to change his last name to something a little less racist .
Now if only he could send out that email request to do so ...

The reaction to my previous article was overwhelming .
There was a huge discussion over on reddit , a great discussion continues on this blog , and I received a lot of email feedback from you guys .
The response was so overwhelming that it took down our servers in spectacular fashion .
( Hardware upgrades are currently in progress . :)
Clearly it struck a chord .
Thanks to all of you for energizing the conversation , being generous in your praise , and honest in your criticism .
Today I want to get specific about the One Approach a Day mission , and how a normal guy can significantly increase the flow of beautiful women in his life by being proactive .
Keeping Up Appearances
Many “ dating gurus ” will say that , when it comes to success with women , looks do n’t matter .
While this is somewhat true , it ’s a bit misleading .
Your genetic looks , for the most part , do n’t matter .
But if you ’re 100 lbs overweight , have a two - month - old Linux beard , and wear your favourite pair of ripped sweatpants everywhere you go , that bikini - clad blonde suntanning in the park is probably out of your league .
Women appreciate guys that dress well and keep good personal hygiene .
Here are some guidelines for making a good first impression :
Trim the fat .
A healthy body opens sexual doorways .
When I was 18 , I lost 55 lbs , so for anyone who thinks it ’s “ easy for me ” to talk about losing weight , realize that you probably have less work to do than I did .
For me , the secret was to eat a big breakfast , drink lots of water , taper my meals throughout the day , and stop eating after 7:00 PM .

Do n’t be a dirt road .
Personal hygiene is really important .
Make sure you ’re clean - shaven ( or your facial hair is well - kept ) , your teeth are clean , your hair is well - maintained , and you shower on a daily basis .

Wear your personality .
Learn to see fashion as “ art you wear ” , rather than purely utilitarian .
Choose threads that tell the world something about you .

Become a meathead .
Personally , I hate working out , so I do n’t .
But if you feel like you need some “ extra help ” in the looks department , even after applying the previous guidelines , the weightroom is the answer .
Obviously , losing weight and adding muscle can take several months , a year , or even longer .
But do n’t use that as an excuse to stay at home and rent a movie tonight .
Good grooming and a concerted wardrobe update will go a long way to increasing your animal magnetism .
Location , Location , Location
Where would your ideal woman hang out ?
The places you choose to meet people should be a reflection of your personality and interests .
Ideally you ’ll want to choose venues that offer a lot of women to talk to , and an easy exit strategy in case you get blown out .
Places I like :
Parks .
I find people in parks to be really open and friendly .

Bars and nightclubs .
The typical nightclub scene of going there with your buddies , talking about how hot the women are , drinking yourself into a stupid haze , and burping out cheesy pickup lines to disgusted beauties is not my thing .
But going in with a sober mission , chatting up the entire place , and hitting the dance floor at convenient intervals is amazingly fun .

House parties .
A little risker place to get blown out , but at the same time , you ’re much more likely to have some connection with the people there already , so crude behaviour is less likely .

Outdoor festivals .
Another activity that I enjoy for its own sake .
Montreal is one never - ending festival in the summertime .
Places I do n’t like :
Malls and stores .
Bookshops , pharmacies , clothing stores , etc .
I find it weird to go into stores or malls just to “ pickup girls ” .
Meeting people should be a natural part of your day , rather than grounds for a customer harassment lawsuit .

Cinemas .
Movie theatres are a logistical nightmare .
Not to mention that she ’s probably with her boyfriend .
How to be Flirtatious
Flirting is the verbal and non-verbal exchange of sexual tension .
It is not the time for logical conversation and questioning .
If you ’re feeling Casanovically Challenged ( TM ) , here are some principles to help you shine in the spotlight of female attention :
Anticipate acceptance .
Accept rejection .
Your state of mind will be reflected in your body language and tone of voice .
If a women senses weakness , she will pounce .
If you do get blown out though , get over it and move on to the next one .

If a women senses weakness , she will pounce .
If you do get blown out though , get over it and move on to the next one .
Do n’t interview her .
Where are you from ?
What do you study ?
How old are you ?
What do you do for fun ?
You might like using handcuffs , but do n’t act like a cop handing out a speeding ticket .

Do n’t be Spock .
Keep the serious logic to a minimum .
Save the deadpan political and career discussions until at least the second date .

Be playful .
Girls love to be teased .
It shows that you ’re a cool , fun guy with a personality of his own .
Go easy on joking about how she ’s “ such a dumb blonde ” though .
There ’s a fine line between rascally humour and miscalibrated insults .

Be unreactive .
A woman who is interested in you will constantly test you , in ways she may not even realize .
She ’s just trying to figure out where your words and actions meet ; not just what you say you are , but if you can stand up to her feline heat .
Relax .
If she throws a snide remark your way to see how you ’ll react , ignore it .
It ’s just her way of saying she likes you .
Be a Man of Action
The bottom line is that to flood your life with beautiful women you ’ve got to be willing to get out into the world and take massive action to meet them .
Prepare yourself with expressive outfits and good grooming .
Work on your body , but do n’t let it hinder you in the meantime .
Find the places where your dreamgirls hang out and start practicing your flirting ninjitsu .

Labour 's deputy leadership candidates are attempting to draw a line under the unpopularity of Tony Blair 's close relationship with George Bush , as they lay out their plans for renewing the government .
In a survey published by the Guardian today , cabinet ministers and other contenders criticised the record of the Bush administration on everything from Guantánamo Bay to climate change .
With only days to go before nominations close , the Guardian asked the six Labour politicians hoping to inherit John Prescott 's job to answer readers ' questions on key issues .
Most offered critiques of the US , demonstrating the party 's keenness to reconsider foreign policy .
Peter Hain , Northern Ireland secretary , said : " The challenge has been how we work with a very rightwing president ...
We must pursue a progressive internationalist foreign policy [ and ] strengthen and reform international institutions . "
Hilary Benn , the international development secretary , said the special relationship had stood Britain in good stead , but warned : " I do n't support the US position on the International Criminal Court , abstinence as a way of fighting HIV in Africa , Guantánamo Bay , or climate change . "
Harriet Harman , justice minister , added : " We need to draw the US closer to our politics , rather than embracing theirs .
Bush 's failure to plan for recovery and reconstruction in Iraq was a huge mistake which has only increased the threat of international terrorism . "
Only Hazel Blears , the Labour party chairwoman and ultra-loyalist , offered an uncritical defence of transatlantic relations .
All the other candidates acknowledged the importance of the relationship but stressed the need to be a " critical friend " .
Alan Johnson , education secretary , said : " The last few years have been testing for the transatlantic relationship , but ... it will always be about more than the temporary passage of presidents . "
At least five names will be on the ballot paper when nominations close on Thursday .
Ms Blears , Mr Hain and Ms Harman , have all published lists of the 44 or more MPs nominating them , while Mr Johnson and Jon Cruddas , MP for Dagenham , are known to have passed the threshold but have yet to announce their backers .
But Mr Benn yesterday acknowledged that he had yet to sign up the necessary names and was beset by fresh difficulties after it emerged that he held shares worth £ 233,000 in a company which works for his department .
Mr Benn said he declared the shares to the permanent secretary , Suma Chakrabarti , when he became minister and that there was no conflict of interest .
Part of an ongoing study into the impact of drinking milk after heavy weightlifting has found that milk helps exercisers burn more fat .
The study by researchers at McMaster University and published today in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , was conducted by the Department of Kinesiology ’s Exercise Metabolism Research Group , lead by Stuart Phillips .
The researchers took three groups of young men 18 to 30 years of age – 56 in total – and put them through a rigorous , five - day - per - week weightlifting program over a 12 - week period .
Following their workouts , study participants drank either two cups of skim milk , a soy beverage with equivalent amounts of protein and energy , or a carbohydrate beverage with an equivalent amount of energy , which was roughly the same as drinking 600 to 700 milliliters of a typical sports drink .
Upon the study ’s conclusion , researchers found that the milk drinking group had lost nearly twice as much fat – two pounds – while the carbohydrate beverage group lost one pound of fat .
Those drinking soy lost no fat .
At the same time , the gain in muscle was much greater among the milk drinkers than either the soy or carbohydrate beverage study participants .
“ The loss of fat mass , while expected , was much larger than we thought it would be , ” says Phillips , associate professor of kinesiology at McMaster .
“ I think the practical implications of these results are obvious : if you want to gain muscle and lose fat as a result of working out , drink milk . ”
Complete you certification with test king and get highest score in exam using testking 642-357 study guide and testking 646-656 exam dumps .
As reported in the first phase of the study , the milk drinking group came out on top in terms of muscle gain with an estimated 40 per cent or 2.5 pounds more muscle mass than the soy beverage drinkers .
In addition , this group gained 63 per cent or 3.3 pounds , more muscle mass than the carbohydrate beverage drinkers .
“ I think the evidence is beginning to mount , ” says Phillips .
“ Milk may be best known for its calcium content in supporting bone health , but our research , and that of others , continually supports milk ’s ability to aid in muscle growth and also promote body fat loss .
To my mind – with milk being a source of nine essential nutrients – it ’s a no brainer : milk is the ideal post - workout drink for recreational exercisers and athletes alike . ”

Lisa was falling behind at work .
Every morning she woke up nervous about the workday ahead of her .
Every evening she went home thinking of all the tasks she had n’t gotten around to .
Lisa is a 35 - year old engineer and project manager at a Danish IT company .
With business booming , keeping up had become a struggle – she felt she had to run really fast , to just to stay in place .
With her in - box overflowing and people all around her clamoring for assistance on their projects , she started to look at various productivity tools and systems and quickly settled on the one she ’d use .
As is typical for Lisa , once she ’s decided to do something , she does it , and with new ways of tracking time , improved todo - lists and prioritizing her work , she did notice that she was getting more work done .
But she still felt , that she could be more productive .
While she was thinking about her next step , it struck her :
Some of what she did , she hated doing .
While she generally enjoyed her job , especially helping people plan their projects and advising them on the best ways to move forward , some of her tasks were administrative in nature .
Tracking progress , updating various statics , generating reports , etc… .
They did n’t take up that much of her time – but they were a lot less fun .
Let ’s face it : to Lisa , they were boring as hell .
She talked to her boss about it , and they decided to give those tasks to a project secretary .
This freed up a little time for Lisa , but mostly it allowed her to work on those parts of her job that she really liked .
Consequently Lisa became a lot happier at work – and THAT’S when her productivity sky - rocketed .
Now she had the energy to connect with her people and the creativity to think up and implement new ideas .
Instead of feeling stressed and harried , she was optimistic and positive .
While her productivity system had definitely helped her get more done , the productivity boost she got from being happy at work was many times bigger .
Lisa is now working way less hours – and getting much more done .
And most importantly , she ’s enjoying work a lot more !
If you want to get more done at work , the productivity gurus out there will tell you that it ’s all about having the right system .
You need to prioritize your tasks , you must keep detailed logs of how you spend your time , todo - lists are of course essential , you must learn to structure your calendar and much , much more .
But that ’s not where you should start .
You should start by liking what you do .
The single most efficient way to increase your productivity is to be happy at work .
No system , tool or methodology in the world can beat the productivity boost you get from really , really enjoying your work .
I ’m not knocking all the traditional productivity advice out there – it ’s not that it ’s bad or deficient .
It ’s just that when you apply it in a job that basically does n’t make you happy , you ’re trying to fix something at a surface level when the problem goes much deeper .
Here are the 10 most important reasons why happiness at work is the # 1 productivity booster .
1 : Happy people work better with others
Happy people are a lot more fun to be around and consequently have better relations at work .
This translates into :
Better teamwork with your colleagues
Better employee relations if you ’re a manager
More satisfied customers if you ’re in a service job
Improved sales if you ’re a sales person
2 : Happy people are more creative
If your productivity depends on being able to come up with new ideas , you need to be happy at work .
Check out the research of Teresa Amabile for proof .
She says :
If people are in a good mood on a given day , they re more likely to have creative ideas that day , as well as the next day , even if we take into account their mood that next day .
There seems to be a cognitive process that gets set up when people are feeling good that leads to more flexible , fluent , and original thinking , and theres actually a carryover , an incubation effect , to the next day .
3 : Happy people fix problems instead of complaining about them
When you do n’t like your job , every molehill looks like a mountain .
It becomes difficult to fix any problem without agonizing over it or complaining about it first .
When you ’re happy at work and you run into a snafu – you just fix it .
4 : Happy people have more energy
Happy people have more energy and are therefore more efficient at everything they do .
5 : Happy people are more optimistic
Happy people have a more positive , optimistic outlook , and as research shows ( particularly Martin Seligman ’s work in positive psychology ) , optimists are way more successful and productive .
It ’s the old saying “ Whether you believe you can or believe you can ’t , you ’re probably right ” all over again .
6 : Happy people are way more motivated
Low motivation means low productivity , and the only sustainable , reliable way to be motivated at work is to be happy and like what you do .
I wrote about this in a previous post called Why “ motivation by pizza ” does n’t work .
7 : Happy people get sick less often
Getting sick is a productivity killer and if you do n’t like your job you ’re more prone to contract a long list of diseases including ulcers , cancer and diabetes .
You ’re also more prone to workplace stress and burnout .
One study assessed the impact of job strain on the health of 21,290 female nurses in the US and found that the women most at risk of ill health were those who did n’t like their jobs .
The impact on their health was a great as that associated with smoking and sedentary lifestyles ( source ) .
8 : Happy people learn faster
When you ’re happy and relaxed , you ’re much more open to learning new things at work and thereby increasing your productivity .
9 : Happy people worry less about making mistakes – and consequently make fewer mistakes
When you ’re happy at work the occasional mistake does n’t bother you much .
You pick yourself up , learn from it and move on .
You also do n’t mind admitting to others that you screwed up – you simply take responsibility , apologize and fix it .
This relaxed attitude means that less mistakes are made , and that you ’re more likely to learn from them .
10 : Happy people make better decisions
Unhappy people operate in permanent crisis mode .
Their focus narrows , they lose sight of the big picture , their survival instincts kick in and they ’re more likely to make short - term , here - and - now choices .
Conversely , happy people make better , more informed decisions and are better able to prioritize their work .
The upshot
Think back to a situation where you felt that you were at peak performance .
A situation where your output was among the highest and best it ’s ever been .
I ’m willing to bet that you were working at something that made you happy .
Something that you loved doing .
There ’s a clear link between happiness at work and productivity .
This only leaves the question of causation :
Does being productive make us happy or does being happy make us productive ?
The answer is , of course , yes !
The link goes both ways .
But the link is strongest from happiness to productivity – which means that it if you want to be more productive , the very best thing you can do is focus on being happy with what you do ?
So how do you get to be happy at work ?
There are two ways , really :
Get happy in the job you have .
There are about a million things you can do to improve your work situation – provided you choose to do something , rather than wait for someone else to come along and do it for you .
Find a new job where you can be happy .
If your current job is not fixable , do n’t wait – move on now !

What ?
Am I really suggesting we should reach out to ... conservatives ?
Well , yes ... some of them .
Absolutely .
Indeed , this is the only possible way to win an overwhelming victory .
Not for liberals or Democrats or even moderates .
But for America .
Ponder this absolute lesson of history .
The surest way to achieve success - in war or peace or politics - is to break up your foe ’s alliance .
To strip away his supporters .
In this case , by showing some of them that they ’re more at home in our Big Tent .
At least this time around .
At least long enough to save America .
Yes , I know this will be hard .
It can feel so satisfying to demonize others with a single , strawman image .
( Do n’t they do it to us ? )
Alas , though , it is also self - indulgent and stupid .
Suppose we could succeed in shattering Rove ’s coalition , would that not be worth applying a little nuance to our oversimplified stereotype of " conservatives ?
The potential benefit ?
It would not only end the Bush era in a landslide .
We might also permanently discredit the neoconservative " revolution " and help to end the bitter , artificial Culture War that was deliberately concocted to tear our country apart .
That final point is crucial .
For , if Culture War continues , even after a Democratic victory , then any Hillary Clinton presidency ( for example ) will be ashes in our mouths .
Sure , law and openness and respect for truth will return .
Great .
But we will also endure nothing less than a bitter resumption of the regional hatreds that sparked American Civil War .
Not her fault , you say ?
You say that " culture war " was foisted on us by cynical manipulators ?
So ?
We ’ll still be consigned to four or eight years of living hell .
Think Whitewater and Monica ... multiplied by a hundred .
We do n’t just need victory for one electoral side , kicking out a set of bums .
We need a victory for the very concept of decency and openness and accountability .
And , for that to happen there must be a seismic change on the right .
The dream we should hold out to our neighbors is the restoration of a conservatism that is worth talking to .
A version no longer tied to jibbering loonies and an outright criminal gang .
If we reach out and steal " decent conservatives " from Rove ’s Big Tent , we will not only weaken the monstrous , undead thing called neoconservatism , but we may even ( to our own surprise ) gain new friends .
Neighbors we can argue and negotiate with sensibly , like adults .
Indeed , possibly fellow citizens who ( though conservative ) may have a good idea or two .
.
Using this handy guide to waking - up a Republican ostrich .
This essay is long and thorough , making it useful as a reference for any of you militant - moderates looking for " ostrich ammo . "
Do NOT send your favorite " decent conservative " here saying " read this ! "
All they ’ll see is another online tirade .
This chore must be done in person .
One on one .
Said one experienced ostrich converter : " You need to make firm contact with the bit that 's in the sand rather than what 's poking up above it .
Engage them on their terms .
Do n't harangue . "
Ask them : " what it is that makes them believe the GOP and Bush are better for America ?
"
You can then focus your counter - arguments on what 's important to your ostrich , by their own admission .
Yes , relentless pursuit is necessary , while your ostrich is in denial !
But if you do make headway , there will come a time when they run out of excuses and face the uncomfortable fact they ’ve been wrong .
Let them come to terms with that in their own way .
Resist backsliding and your own urge to gloat !
( After all , the left had its own era of foolish association with monsters , and it may again .
Admit it ! )
Be supportive ... but ... do ... not ... let ... go .
.
So , you ask -
" HOW do I help break up the Rove big - tent conservative coalition ? "
Here ’s how .
1 ) Recognize that Rove ’s " big tent " is filled with contradictions .
With people holding their noses .
With constituencies who have never actually received anything tangible from the Bushites , for all their loyalty .
With ( for example ) libertarians who despise religious fanaticism , but put up with raving fundies , because they imagine that -" the GOP is better for free markets than the Democrats would be . "
( Ha ! )
We must exploit these contradictions , using blatant truth as a wedge to pry apart groups that should n’t be allies in the first place .
2 ) Go ahead and be proud that moderate - liberalism has been responsible for most of the great American accomplishments of the last 100 years .
True enough .
Nevertheless , accept that there is a decent and honorable side to conservatism .
The Goldwater version - minus today ’s venality and bigotry - that always offered an important balance to the liberal urge to frantically meddle .
If we appeal to this better side - describing how Goldwater himself despised the neocon movement - and showing how the Bushites betray even conservative standards , then you may be listened - to .
Better than if you scream .
3 ) The key point .
You can do your part , at the grass roots , by choosing one or two " Ostrich Republicans " ... decent folks like your crewcut - wearing Uncle Jack , who has a good heart , but watches Fox News and wallows in the delusion that Democrats are ALL like that silly , postmodernist college professor that Bill O’Reilly railed at , last night on the boob tube .
( Um ... we ’re not ! )
Poor , deluded Uncle Jack , who actually believes that these thieving , lying , vicious , klepto manipulative neocon loons are " conservatives " ... just like him .
OSTRICH AMMO :
We ’ll break up this lengthy missive ( rant ? ;-) with small dollops of " ammo " to use on your favorite ostrich - uncle .
Later on - some Killer YouTube clips , for the 50 % of Americans who have mid-band .
( NONE of us has real " broadband . "
Ask any Korean . )
Your stereotypical ostrich sees himself as a stand - up guy .
Open .
Honest .
And he despises hypocrisy !
Except , of course , from his own " side . "
So stick some of these in front of him and do n’t let him turn away .

Bush attacking Clinton during the ( outstandingly successful ) Balkans Intervention : Victory means an exit strategy , and it ’s important for the president to explain to us what the exit strategy is .
and
I think it ’s also important for the president to lay out a timetable as to how long they will be involved and when they will be withdrawn .
http://www.cnn.com/...
Bush making at least twenty promises to the military men and women he has since betrayed .
Check out where he denounces the practice of " using our troops as nation - builders . "
But enough ammo for now .
Back to the main article .
.
" So , I ’ve chosen my Ostrich .
What do I say to him ? "
I ’ve spent years trying to refine this message .
Some attempts were too intellectual ... or steeped in history ...
... or offered detailed comparisons of the Iraq and Balkans wars , ( hint : Bill Clinton was vastly better at war than our current " leader . " )
Or exposing the weird - but indisputable - fact that Democrats guard our borders vastly better than republicans do , despite contradicting rhetoric .
If your ostrich likes that sort of fact - drenched discourse , you could dive deep into the roots of neoconservatism and see how this mad movement fits in the rogues gallery of enemies of freedom , right alongside communism .
If your ostich reads , point him or her to a recent article in the genuinely ( if flexibly ) conservative journal , The Economist , about reasons for the death spiral of the Republican Party .
EXCERPT :
" Many conservative activists would like to pin the blame [ for the decline of the Republican party ] on Mr Bush alone either because he pursued foolish policies ( the paleo - conservative version ) or because he pursued sensible policies in a cack - handed manner ( the neoconservative version ) .
In fact , the Republican Party in Congress is just as responsible as Mr Bush for most of the recent troubles .
The Republican majority routinely appropriated more spending than the president asked for .
It also larded spending bills with as much extra pork as possible .
The number of congressional earmarks for projects in members ' districts increased from 1,300 in 1994 , when the Republicans took over Congress , to 14,000 in 2005 .
The Republican majority also cheered Mr Bush all the way to Baghdad .
Add to this the corruption of congressmen like Tom DeLay , a conservative hero , and the semi corrupt institutional relationship that the Republicans formed with lobbyists , and you see that Mr Bush was only part of a much bigger problem .
...
It is a sign of weakness that the conservatives are retreating to their old posture as insurgents , and need a bogeywoman like Mrs Clinton to hold them together . "
Or , if you and your ostrich share a deliciously paranoid streak , you might ponder how deeply suborned the entire political process may have become , given basic flaws of human nature , and by bad men with unlimited resources .
( See :
http://www.davidbrin.com/...
Heck , explore together the comparison of two words ... " whitewater " and " blackwater " ... ( try Google ) ... and ask him which turned out to be scarier .
Lately though , I ’ve come to realize that what ’s needed is n’t very complicated .
In fact , it ’s simple .
Relentlessness !
If you do heed this call -- if you do pick a few decent - but - deluded Ostrich Americans to go after -- grab their lapels and do not let go !
.
Start with this :
" Let 's agree this is important .
As a patriotic citizen , you should be interested , because these accusations have little to do with normal , left right disputes .
" The issue is whether the country - and the conservative movement - have been hijacked by a criminal gang .
If a fifth of these things are true , then you , as a conservative , should be angrier than anybody !
" Decent conservatives like you need to rescue your movement , before it !( becomes irretrievably associated with monsters . "
.
Of course , once you 've said that , you have to follow up .
So heed this fundamental approach :
Learn the art of seeing the world through " decent conservative eyes " ...
AND THEN ATTACK THE NEOCON MONSTERS IN CONSERVATIVE TERMS !
Use facts that are obvious .
Facts that scream .
Like the fact that , in Bill Clinton 's day , we did not have to lower our recruitment standards , forcing our long - suffering Army to let in ex felons ... or offer $ 20,000 signing bonuses to bribe new " volunteers . "
A sure sign that the nation is not behind this " war . "
Or the fact that only two ( just two ! ) of our Army 's brigades are currently fully trained , equipped and ready for actual war to defend this country !
All the rest have been converted into counter insurgency urban swat teams .
( One general said " Bill Clinton 's U.S. Army could beat our present force with one hand tied behind its back . " )
If Bill Clinton was hiding so much , why did he cut government secrecy in half ?
If the Bushites are so responsible , why do they run from facts , from testifying , from oversight ?
Why have they multiplied government secrecy to levels ten times greater than when we were in a life death Cold War struggle against the Soviet KGB ?
In past wars , patriotic wealthy Americans stepped up , accepting the need to help pay for a struggle fought by other peoples ’ sons .
If we ’re now " at war , " how come the top neocon billionaires have just two priorities - increasing their tax cuts and getting no -bid , crony contracts to NOT deliver what ’s needed in Iraq ?
.
AMMO CAPSULE !
After inheriting surpluses from Clinton , Bush has run up over $ 3 TRILLION dollars in debt .
Bush 's FY2002 budget forecast understated the five - year deficit by $ 2.8 TRILLION dollars .
Federal spending as a percentage of GDP was 21.4 % when Clinton took office and 18.5 % when he left , but is now back up to 20.8 % .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 325 % during the Clinton years but only 27 % during the Bush years .
The S&P 500 increased of 309 % under Clinton and 9 % under Bush .
Economic growth was considerably higher under Clinton than under Bush and small businesses grew even faster than giant ones .
Is n’t that what we want ?
.
Oh , the list of conservative reasons to hate the Bush Gang goes on and on .
It 's not hard to find zingers and statistics .
But keep it simple .
Go right to the heart of what your ostrich already knows .
.
Try this list of supposedly basic conservative values :
.
Respect for professionalism ?
Fiscal prudence ?
Respect for the military officer corps ?
Emphasizing military readiness over foreign adventures in " nation building " ?
Respect for science ?
A belief in openness , transparency and accountability ?
A distrust of secrecy ?
Gentility and courtesy in argument and discourse ?
A dedication to small business ?
A belief in free markets where competition is fostered , and not catering to monopolies ?
Government contracts that are open and granted to competent low bidders , instead of cronies of the king ?
Saving for a rainy day ?
Skillful management ?
Caution in foreign entanglements ?
Maintaining our reserves and respecting the men and women of the National Guard ?
Respecting our allies and world opinion ?
Protecting our strategic petroleum reserves ?
Belief in leaving people alone in their homes .
Belief in a nation that is as clean in its habits as we are in our homes ?
Practicing what we preach - especially in family values ...
... and so on ...
Exactly which of these conservative values has not been diametrically reversed by these neocon lunatic traitors ?
Dare your ostrich to find one .
Find even one .
.
AMMO CAPSULE !

Another " in their own words " YouTube entry exposes a " Symphony of Lies " .
If your Ostrich is reachable at all , this will make him or her cringe .
Alas , YouTube only work where Americans have " broadband " - at best pathetic by world standards .
As we plummet toward 40th place in lifespan and 50th in student test scores and lose our knack for science , engineering and can - do professionalism , shall we make that decline an ostrich topic too ?
.
I could go on with this " Ostrich Manifesto " .
There are countless , countless zingers that can stick in the gut of your Uncle Jack ... and maybe shake him awake .
For example , try this line .
" What would you have said if Bill Clinton had --"
And then fill in the blank with something any conservative ought to find repulsive , if they did not have their head buried in the sand .
Like " losing " several billion dollars in cash , by the side of an Iraqi road .
Or " losing " a quarter of a million weapons in Iraq without even keeping their serial numbers .
Or " losing " several billion dollars worth of Iraqi oil per month ...
... which is vastly more than the right wing screamed about , during the so - called " Oil - For - Food " scandal .
Make a long list and demand -
" What would you have said if this happened under Clinton ?
If one thousandth of any of this had happened then ? "
Now tell them how strenuously the Bushites have striven to strengthen the Presidency and insulate it from all supervision , oversight or duty - not only to Congress but the people - sending secrecy skyrocketing far beyond anything we saw in the Cold War .
And ask this .
" Do you really want future Democratic presidents to have such power ?
Or do you feel that the Bushites are doing this because they do n’t intend to ever let that happen ? "
Ask them to ponder just how far loyalty to their side goes .
( Psychologically , this is the trait that keeps most conservatives standing by the GOP , despite all these listed betrayals and horrors . )
Do they really hate " liberals and moderates " so much that another conservative value respect for law and due process , can just be thrown away ?
Hammer home that no administration has been more universally detested by our military officers , or by the middle ranking officers of the intelligence community , or by government scientists , or - indeed - by almost any professional person in the United States of America , than our present band of frat - boy know - nothings .
***
To reiterate : these are all zingers that argue with your ostrich in conservative terms !
Again , do n’t even bother trying to remonstrate with him or her about pollution or torture or global warming or health care !
Their defenses against these issues are up , prepped by Fox News .
Those appeals will flow off their backs .
For heaven ’s sake , leave off social jabs about marriage , in all its newly varied forms .
( Unless you ’d like to compare the vastly different rates of messy divorce seen in top leaders of the two parties .
Or the rate at which party leaders are arrested for sexual perversion .
Ratios that are astronomically different !
So much for " family values . " )
No .
DON’T give in to jabs and jibes and invitations to argue with him or her across the sterotypical left - right divide .
Fox has armed him for that !
So keep it about conservatism .
ALL conservative stuff , all the way !
Where they are vulnerable -- where you can get through -- is by showing your ostrich that no decent conservative American should have anything to do with this gang of monstrous liars , morons and thieves ...
... or the awful , awful pack of guys ( with the exception of Ron Paul ) who are parroting the same crazy stuff , all over the country , right now , while vying for leadership over a party that has simply gone quite , jibbering mad .
***
Oh ... do n’t forget to lace your riffs with lots of patriotism !
And make it sincere , because it ought to be .
For too long , liberals have allowed conservatives to preen and pretend they own that word .
Remind your ostrich that this is about our country .
It ’s about America , the light of freedom and center of the Enlightenment .
The nation that embraced science and progress as no other ever did .
The one that first put law above men .
The first victor in war who showed kindness to the vanquished .
The first to lead a world by virtue and example , rather than force .
The one country that absorbed half of the refugees and immigrants who ever struggled to find new lives and better themselves and their children .
An America that is being hijacked , as we speak , by homegrown monsters who are every bit as dangerous as foreign communists once were .
If loyalty is the chief conservative virtue ... the glue keeping so many decent conservative Americans attached to a GOP gone - mad ... then USE LOYALTY to melt that bond !
Loyalty to something better , greater , more important than a political party .
Yes , mention humanity and the Earth and the future and posterity ... all the things that give liberals goosebumps ....
... but try adding loyalty to America , too .
Because America IS KEY to all those other things prospering !
Because , despite all our faults , this nation remains the light of the world and the best hope of humankind .
But , above all , because your ostrich just may listen to you then .
And perhaps even remember that liberals and moderates are Americans , too .
.
* CONCLUSION *
.
Want to know the real tragedy ?
It really is the Democratic Party ’s fault .
If they spent just a little time and effort on this kind of plan ...
... the way the early neocons did , at the Heritage Foundation ...
... there could emerge a fantastic web - based campaign reaching out to " decent conservatives " .
One of potentially staggering effectiveness .
As a side benefit - a huge one - such an effort could also encourage whistle - blowing by civil servants who are sick and tired of the neocon " War Against Professionalism . "
Even better , picture if some democratic candidate -- or a convention speaker -- were to take up this theme .
A stirring moment reaching across all our political divides , appealing for a coalition of the honest .
An alliance of the sane .
It could turn into the most potent gesture and effective move against political madness since the US Army ( in the person of JAG Joseph Welch ) finally turned on the infamous demagogue Sen.
Joseph McCarthy and demanded " At long last , Sir , have you left no sense of decency ? "
Thereupon sending THAT generation ’s right wing monster slinking away and letting the rest of us - ( conservatives too ) - get back to the business of civilization .
All of this could happen .
But only if we are willing to gird ourselves not to play Karl Rove ’s game .
He WANTS us to align ourselves left versus right .
That way , all people who see themselves as right - of - center MUST support him , even if they feel ashamed .
( Long ago , the communists tried this same trick on the moderate left , which proved smart enough to stand up and say no way !
But apparently it works fine on conservatives . )
We can thwart this vile scheme , but only if we make our Big Tent truly inclusive , welcoming .
A coalition fiercely focused upon a single issue that transcends cliches of left / right ..
Liberal vs conservative arguments - like health care - can and must wait .
We have one job now .
Not only to defeat and eject the criminal gang that has seized our nation , but to utterly repudiate it , forever , denying it even a sizeable base to hide in , licking its wounds and swearing vengeance upon the Age of Reason .
Let neoconservatism flutter away into kooky corners and archaic silliness , like communism , with which it shares so many dismal traits .
( Remember , the left once went mad , too . )
Sound good ?
Well , that repudiation can only happen if we enlist millions of decent citizens from all parts of America .
Including millions who happen to be " decent conservatives . "
Millions who will stand up for America , if we stay after them , politely refusing to let go , relentlessly asking that they lift their heads out of the sand and see what has been done to the honor of conservatism .
An honor that 's been stained and tainted , but that could still be restored ... there ’s time !
But only if they stand up soon .
If they rise up and join the rest of us .
Helping to rescue this threatened America , our beloved country .

" We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty .

Check out " comments " below , as other readers send in some of their own , favorite " great moments in hypocrisy . "
Fostering good relations between team members is particularly important in IT , whether you 're managing a group of programmers developing a product or running an assortment of professionals with a variety of technical skills .
But it must be confessed that IT tends to be composed of idiosyncratic and often downright odd people .
In the nearly 30 years I 've worked with computers , I 've had a chance to assume many roles on many different teams .
I 've also witnessed a variety of managers in their efforts to build something out of the irregular raw material that comprises most IT departments .
Perhaps it should n't need pointing out , but the subtitle of the article is a joke .
There is no IT monoculture , and assuming that your geeks are Star Trek geeks is a good way to have them write you off .
There is , unfortunately , no shortcut to knowing your particular crew .
“ We 're All Individuals ”
The good news is that the same basic rules apply for programmers as for other employees :
Treat them well individually and you 'll find them more willing to form bonds with others on the team .
Pit them against each other , throw them to the wolves when things get rough and demand they take responsibility for things ( while not giving them the actual power to do those things properly ) , and you 'll find no amount of team - building exercises will work .

When Team Bonding Falls Apart
As an egregious example , I once worked for a fellow who would randomly direct a tantrum at some employee .
This actually managed to create a kind of bond , the sort of post - traumatic stress disorder bond you might find among hostages .
It turned out not to be strong enough to sustain through the similarly random hirings and firings .
A less obvious example occurred in another company , where a group of new IT execs had signed on to implement one of those " Big Shiny New Systems That Solve All IT Problems Forever . "
They developed a hostility to the legacy system crew , who , they argued , made their job harder by continuing to extend the old system .
This got worse as the project was ( predictably ) delayed .
The split went all the way to the top , unfortunately , so there was no one to encourage the groups to work together .
As a result , a lot of work was duplicated and most of the crew from both teams were gone inside of a year .
Generic Happy Fun Time Activities
Many morale - and community - building activities employed by organizations do n't make much of an impact on IT personnel , and particularly on programmers .
It 's not necessarily that programmers are socially awkward , but often a kind of cynicism is prevalent .
For reasons that could take a book to investigate and articulate , IT staff tends to run toward a stoic cynicism ( with an occasional hyperdramatic diva case ) .
The upshot is that I 've never seen a companywide picnic , dinner , dance or potluck that actually strengthened an IT team .
Or perhaps the cause and effect is reversed :
It 's easy for IT to feel like it has to constantly justify its own existence and defend itself from users who have found that “ the computer is down ” is a good way to avoid work .
Generic companywide boosterism can have a hollow ring .
There 's also a wide variety of social comfort levels and workloads .
I 've attended several potlucks or company - sponsored luncheons where IT simply grabbed food and went back to work .
That does n't create much of a team feeling — but then neither does trying to force people who are uncomfortable or busy into socializing .
Little Things Mean a Lot
You may gather that I 've seen a lot of disasters in my day , but I 've also seen things that were effective .
Not surprisingly , the common thread among them is commonality .
In other words , to build a team , you have to build on shared ground .
( This is true in all cases ; it 's just that the IT department shares less common ground with other departments . )
Here are a few little things that can go a surprisingly long way .
You think Kirk vs. Picard is the ultimate geek debate ?
Try Mountain Dew versus Dr Pepper .
I 've heard far more conversations about caffeine , sugar and artificial sweeteners than I have about any TV show .
Does this mean that you need to provide free drinks ?
Not necessarily , though that 's a cheap way to generate goodwill , as will providing IT with its own stash area .
Free food is another cheap bonding mechanism .
I 'm sure there are programmers who do n't like pizza , but I 've never met one who admitted it .
I do n't quite understand why , but the only other group I 've run into that responds to free food in the same way as programmers is musicians .
It should come as no surprise to anyone that IT folk are idiosyncratic in terms of the hours they keep and the clothes they wear .
Of course , some ( especially larger ) companies are more conservative with what they allow , but you can be a hero of sorts by allowing whatever freedoms - from - conventions you can to your crew .
Passing around links , songs or videos , while seemingly trivial , creates a common “ culture . ”
Again , keep your eye on the final product .
A bunch of tech guys sitting around joking may seem like a waste , but it might just mean that things are going really smoothly .
Respect the team 's oddities .
For example , I prefer to work in low natural light or the dark .
This is n't unusual among programmers , though very often I 've found them reticent to turn off lights because some executives seem to think they 're filling a parental role .
( “ You 'll ruin your eyes ! ” )
Of course , some executives are just disturbed by anything different .
This tends to put them into opposition with the natural state of an IT department and perhaps explains why so many companies keep the computer guys in the basement or tucked away in some other hard - to - find places .
Your best defense against criticism is your crew 's productivity .
In some cases , this is vital .
One guy I worked with had serious concentration issues that he handled by constantly listening to TV or music through headphones while he worked .
Your crew 's productivity depends on you being able to shield them from irrelevancies .
Traditions
The above are passive , even somewhat defensive approaches that will nonetheless lay the groundwork for more active team building .
Let 's start by considering a traditional and widely misused team - building tool : the meeting .
A good meeting for an IT department is almost like football strategizing ( down to a whiteboard covered with arrows and squiggles ) .
It should be short and broad , covering only those things that everyone needs to be aware of , and not bogging down in details .
The more specific the team , the more detailed the meeting can be .
If you 're running a pure programming group , meetings can get into the minutiae of coding standards , complete with heated debates .
The main thing is to keep the meeting at the level of those who are attending :
Do n't bog down your hardware guys with discussions on indentation and do n't burden your programmers with the latest computer installation issues .
A list of all the things one can do wrong in a meeting — which should be one of the most basic and effective tools in your team - building chest — could fill a book .
I 'm only going to point out one major error here because I see it so often :
Do not berate your crew , either singly or en masse .
The only time I 've ever seen or heard of that working is in military and quasi-military situations .
Meetings should be more like pep rallies .
Besides the meeting , other traditional forms of socializing , like the potluck , can also work — especially if limited to IT and a few sympathetic coworkers .
This , again , is n't necessarily specific to IT : A companywide potluck for even a small company of 50 people can be a big deal , where one for a five - to 10 - person department is more casual and intimate .
My current team sometimes augments the occasional potluck with a movie showing , the selection of which is often hotly debated .
The movie itself is n't really all that important ( though it 's always something rather politically incorrect ) , but the debate is , as is the shared experience of having seen the film together ( no matter how many times you 've seen it before ) .
Getting Technical
The best IT crews have people who are passionate about tech .
The best managers appreciate their crew 's love of tech and keep an eye out for ways to foster that .
( Nontechnical managers usually do n't realize how much they profit from individuals ' pursuit of technical passions on their own time . )
One programming crew I worked with gave one employee time each Monday to prepare a presentation on technical issues for Tuesday .
Tuesday morning was spent eating bagels and discussing a concept related to programming .
For a very low cost , the company increased both community and skill , to say nothing of goodwill .
This type of thing is a little trickier to expand to a more diverse IT department but can be worthwhile even then .
Books on coding techniques , design philosophies and other esoteric topics can give programmers the opportunity to debate that they might not otherwise have .
Having been the sole programmer on more than one IT team , I can vouch for the loneliness of wrestling with interesting technical issues that nobody around me understood .
Programmers can introvert heavily when involved in some heavy problem , and having common books to refer to can spur discussion and reverse that tendency .
For other techs , you can get a similar effect by having gadgets , devices and little things that may or may not immediately impact the job .
One of my bosses in a seasonal business very cleverly spent the off - season encouraging investigation of all gadgets and software that might impact the business positively .
If you have a mixed team , techs and programmers may be able to combine their talents on a device in a way that turns an idle interest into a revolutionary asset .
On the other end of the spectrum , another boss gave out little remote controlled cars for Christmas , resulting in some chaotic fun as the little things raced around the office .
It did n't result in anything revolutionary , but it did build the team .
( There 's a reason ThinkGeek sells so many toys . )
Another not particularly productive , low - cost team - building activity is LAN gaming .
While not all techs are gamers , quite a few are , and this sort of activity acts much in the same way a company baseball team does , without uniforms and sweating .
( Sports teams can work as well , but I 've never seen a tech team where enough people had an aptitude for the same sport . )
Higher cost activities can include things like attending user group meetings or even conventions .
Industry - specific conventions are all right , but IT conventions are probably going to be more exciting to the team .
If you 're in certain high - tech areas , a convention can be a day trip and does n't need to be expensive .
In a similar vein , if you have remote locations , road trips can serve the purpose of reminding those bound to a central office of the bigger picture , but in my experience , whether that builds the team up depends a lot on how they feel about traveling .
Wrap It Up
Programmers and techs tend to be very bottom - line oriented .
Not on money , but on getting results .
And they respect others who can recognize that and disregard the oddities and trivialities .
While I 've outlined a few key dos and don'ts , and mentioned a few activities , your best bet is to look at what your department is , and what it needs .
Remember :
It is n't hard to make a small gesture that goes a long way .

“ D- Day is going to happen in May 2009 , and I think people are seriously going to start panicking next year , as citizens actually face the very real possibility of being summoned , and then have to go into this very strange environment , speak in front of authority figures and actually be questioned about their own opinions , ” Mr. Precht said .
“ And I ’m concerned that ’s going to freak people out . ”
With those concerns in mind , some Japanese are trying to teach their compatriots how to argue .
In Hitachiota , a town that is a two - hour ride from Tokyo and is surrounded by rice paddies , a local theater group decided to put on a play that would dramatize the jury experience .
Finding nothing in Japanese , the group ’s leader , Fusako Kimura , 73 , chose “ 12 Angry Men . ”
Ms. Kimura strongly supports the new system .
“ But , really , I wondered , can Japanese really express what they believe in , ” she said .
“ Can they really express their opinions ? ”
“ To this day , we value harmony , ” she said , and , referring to a haiku by Basho , Japan ’s greatest poet , she added , “ In Japan , to not speak is considered a virtue . ”
In the new system , judges and jurors , with one vote each , will decide cases by a simple majority .
Jurors can ask questions in the courtroom , and through their numbers can effectively overrule the judges .
Even though all three judges may rule that a defendant is guilty in a case , a not - guilty ruling by at least five of the jurors will prevail .
The only exception involves a guilty ruling : even if all six jurors vote guilty , the ruling will not stand unless at least one of the three judges shares that verdict .
Judge Tomonao Onizawa , who is the councilor general at the Supreme Court and is participating in a national education campaign , said the new system was in keeping with wider changes to deregulate industries and unleash creativity in Japan .
“ Indeed , instead of simply submitting to authority , it ’s important for each individual ’s abilities to shine , and release this creative energy , ” Judge Onizawa said .
“ In short , to think for oneself and build a reinvigorated Japan . ”

The bark beetle outbreak was responsible for the death of 4.8 m lodgepole pines in Colorado last year , up from 1 m in 2005 .
The infestation has spread across 1,000 square miles of forest - nearly half the total in the state .
Forty three per cent of the state 's lodgepole pines have died as a result of the infestation .
But it is not limited to Colorado : the beetles have munched their way through the western US and Canada , affecting 36,000 square miles of forest .
" I knew we would have an infestation , " says Jan Burke , a silviculturist for Colorado 's White River national forest , " but I never remotely imagined this .
Nobody predicted this . "
She looks up at the mountains behind the ski resort of Vail , sweeping hillsides of pine pockmarked with the orange stain of dead trees and the delicate feathery grey of aspens .
" I guess we 're the lucky ones because in our lifetime we got to see these forests .
Our children wo n't .
For many that 's a bitter pill to swallow . "
The results of the infestation in Colorado appear catastrophic for the pine forests that are familiar to thousands of visitors each year , many of them Britons heading for ski resorts including Aspen , Breckenridge and Beaver Creek , as well as Vail .
If the image of Colorado in the holidaymaker 's mind is of snowcapped peaks and pine - covered slopes , those notions will have to change .
As the lodgepole pines die , the dominant tree species will be aspen , its grey bark and light foliage replacing the dark green of the pine .
For now , the hillsides look familiar , with snow covering the dramatic slopes west of the Rockies .
But even a cursory inspection reveals the devastation caused by the beetle .
Among the green of the pines , the orange patches indicate beetle infestation and dead trees , what Burke calls " microsites of mortality " .
Forestry officials calculate that for every orange - brown pine that can be seen by the naked eye , another five to 10 are infected .
Once the beetle gets to the tree , nothing can be done .
Scientists , environmentalists , ski resort managers and forestry officials agree that by the time the beetle has finished , it will have killed 80 - 90 % of the mature lodgepoles in Colorado .
Mature trees account for 90 % of the lodgepoles .
While beetle infestations are part of the natural order of the forest , the current infestation defies all expectations .
" We 're two to three years from seeing virtually the death of mature lodgepole pines , " says Burke .
" To the casual observer it will look like all of them .
It 's wholesale mortality .
It 's difficult to watch these really beautiful stands die .
It just makes you want to go home . "
The beetle behind the infestation , the half - centimetre long Dendroctonus ponderosae , is indigenous to the area , and has been responsible for epidemics in the past , most recently in 1983 .
The beetle only attacks mature pines , boring through the bark to lay eggs inside the tree .
When the larvae reach maturity they in turn bore a hole out and leave the tree en masse for the next host , where they will lay their eggs .
But unlike previous infestations , which experts view as part of the forest 's system of self - management , this time a combination of factors has conspired to propel the beetle population to epidemic proportions .
Almost the entire stock of lodgepole pines in Colorado is mature , a result of the settlement and logging of much of the area 100 years ago .
Consequently , the beetles have an abundant source of food .
A long - term drought has put the trees under stress and deprived them of one of their defences against the bugs , the ability to exude sap and expel the insects .
Warmer weather - a recent study showed that over the last 50 years Colorado 's average high temperature had risen by nearly half a degree Celsius and the average low temperature by nearly one degree - has accelerated the growth of the insects and enabled them to survive the winters .
Normally Colorado would expect to experience a sustained period of cold weather during the winter months .
But the week or more of temperatures lower than - 10C has not materialised .
" The current outbreak is so far along that there 's nothing much that can be done , " says Bill Romme , professor of fire ecology at Colorado state university and lead author of a report into the infestation published in November .
" If we get a period of bitter cold temperatures , that could cause the outbreak to collapse .
But we 're not getting the temperatures .
Usually an insect outbreak will go on for one to three decades .
We 're about a decade into this one but at the rate they 're moving they could run out of food before then . "
Romme is reluctant to attribute the outbreak to global warming .
" We can't say that the current outbreak is the product of global warming , " he says , " but we can say that this is a harbinger of what could be produced by global warming . "
The devastation has caused much soul - searching among those who manage the forest , as well as those who have pursued a dream of moving to the pine - covered slopes of Colorado .
" It 's not so much an ecological challenge as a social and economic challenge , " says Don Carroll , acting supervisor of the White River forest , who heads the Colorado Bark Beetle Cooperative .
" If it was n't for all the people that lived here it would n't be much of an issue . "
He reels off a list of the safety issues raised by the death of the pines , from the fire hazards caused by dead trees to the possibility of timber falling on homes or power lines and the threat posed to the water table .
He is also concerned about extracting the fallen timber from the forest , from trees that have died and fallen and from those that have been logged to prevent them falling .
" We do n't have the industry to handle this stuff , " he says .
" We 're not going to get 2x4s out of these trees in the future , so we 're looking at new technologies to utilise biomass fuels . "
But the forest service has met opposition from those who are against the large - scale felling of trees and it has been difficult to persuade communities - some of them among the US 's richest - of the need for mass logging .
Vail has committed $ 1.5 m ( £ 770,000 ) to logging trees in the hope that it will be able to retain some of its green mountainside .
" I fail to see how a massive outbreak of logging will do any good , " says Rocky Smith , forest watch coordinator for the environmental group Colorado Wild .
While not opposed to logging to protect populated areas , he thinks the forest service is going too far .
" Logging in the back country is n't going to achieve much , " he says .
" They really ought to prioritise a little more than they are . "
Jan Burke gestures beyond the skiers enjoying the spring snow among the pines in Vail .
" It does n't look so infested , " she says , " but you 're looking at millions of dollars of work .
They want to hang on to the green forest as long as they can but it's too little , too late . "
Burke retains a sense of determined optimism .
" You can drive around and it does look like a thermonuclear device has hit , " she says , " but in two to three years it will start to regenerate .
It 's not going to look like a moonscape .
Some areas will , but only in the very short term .
There will be a flush of flowers and then we 'll see a lot more aspen . "
They may never know it , but U.S. air travelers and others set off silent terrorist warning alarms nearly 20,000 times in 2006 when their names matched against the government 's centralized terrorist watch list , according to a statistic buried in a Department of Justice document .
The number represents a 27 percent jump over 2005 , and points to the growth in the federal Terrorist Screening Center , a joint FBI and DHS operation that controls the government 's master list of suspected terrorists .
Agencies from the FBI to the NSA nominate names to the database and assign threat level codes to each name .
The criteria for inclusion is considered classified .
The list now reportedly includes more than 500,000 names , according to a similar document reported on by ABC News in June .
( The Justice Department has since removed that document from its website . )
The State Department queries the list before issuing visas , customs and border agents use it to vet incoming travelers and a subset of the list is exported to airlines for their passenger rating systems .
More than 800,000 local and state police can also query the database when they pull over a speeding car or run a detained person 's name through their computer system .
Officers who encounter a person on the watch list are put in contact with an employee at the center , who then directs the officer to arrest the person or to try to get valuable details that can be reported back to intelligence agencies .
The Justice Department 's proposed budget for 2008 reveals for the first time how often names match against the database , reporting that there were 19,967 " positive matches " in 2006 .
The TSC had expected to match a far fewer number 14,780 .
The watch list matched people 5,396 and 15,730 times in 2004 and 2005 respectively .
The report defines a positive match as " one in which an encountered individual is positively matched with an identity in the Terrorist Screening Data Base , or TSDB . "
It 's not clear from the report whether those numbers include individuals whose names only coincidently match one of those on list , such as when Sen .
Ted Kennedy was confused with a former IRA terrorist also named Kennedy .
The watch list has been hounded by these mismatches , which have included small children , former presidential candidates , and Americans with common names such as David Nelson .
The effect of those matches is also unclear , since the FBI wo n't reveal the number of people who have been arrested or denied visas , boarding passes or entry to the country due to the watch list system .
Airlines use portions of the list to create the " No Fly " list , which dictates who is allowed to get a boarding pass .
Persons who are on the government 's watch list , but who are not considered a serious threat to aviation , are called " selectees , " and have their boarding pass marked with the " SSSS " code that directs screeners to initiate a pat - down search .
Repeated SSSS may indicate that you are on , or match against , a name on the watchlist .
Getting off the terrorist watch list is not a simple procedure , given the government wo n't confirm if a person is on a list or not , and the TSC does n't take responsibility for names placed on the list by a law enforcement or intelligence agency .
But a traveler who suspects the watch list is wrongly snagging them at airports or the border can try to use DHS ' online redress site , known as DHS TRIP .
The center is asking for a $ 1.3 million budget increase in 2008 to fund additional employees , including some who will vet names submitted to the agencies .
The TSC also wants to station an agent at Chicago 's O'Hare airport to help clear up mismatches .
New York 's JFK , Washington Dulles , Miami and Los Angeles already have such agents .
Currently the TSC employs 108 employees , including 17 FBI agents , with a budget of $ 103 million .
A TSC spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment on the new statistics .
Really really cool .
I wish there was an infographic such as this , but for the UK .
Breast milk contains nutrients that babies need
Howard Cohen hopes it will boost his immune system and help him fight off his prostate cancer .
The California 's Mothers ' Milk Bank in the US says it has supplied about 28 adults with doctors ' prescriptions in the past four years .
But cancer experts are sceptical and say there is no evidence that it works and might be risky for patients .
That is because drugs and viruses can be transmitted through breast milk , they said .
It does n't taste all that pleasant .
It 's a bit oily and there 's an after - taste .
Howard Cohen
Mr Cohen , who has a PhD in theoretical physics , read up on his cancer when he was diagnosed in 1999 and came across a piece of literature by scientists who had killed cancer cells in the laboratory using an ingredient of breast milk .
The team at Lund University in Sweden found a compound , called human alpha - lactalbumin made lethal to tumour cells , killed brain tumour cells in the test tube .
Further studies showed the same compound appeared to treat warts caused by a virus linked to cancer of the cervix .
" My wife breast - fed all of our children and we are great proponents of its benefits .
" Breast - fed babies have lower risks of cancer , allergies and infections than babies who are not breast - fed . "
He found a milk donor through an ex-colleague .
" His wife was nursing an eight month old , and she herself was a cancer survivor .
She agreed to pump her breast milk for me .
A bottle a day
" For the next 11 months I was getting milk from her .
I would go over about once a week and get the frozen milk .
For a while I was drinking a 3.5 ounce bottle a day .
" When she decided to wean her child , my wife and I looked for another source . "
They approached the California Milk Bank , which agreed to sell them the milk with a prescription .
It 's a bizarre claim with no evidence for it having any clinical value or use .
David Kerr , professor of clinical pharmacology and cancer therapeutics at Oxford University
Mr Cohen said his urologist refused to prescribe the milk .
He went to see other doctors who also refused him , but eventually found an internist with an interest in alternative medicine who wrote the prescriptions .
He now drinks about two bottles per week and hopes to cut back more , but plans to drink it for life .
" I see it as an adjunct to the vitamins and minerals that I take .
He says he is convinced that it is doing some good .
He said he refused to have surgery , radiation or hormonal therapy because he did not want to risk the potential side effects .
" They will always be available to me if the mother 's milk does n't work forever and it comes to that , " he said .
When asked what it tastes like , he said : " It does n't taste all that pleasant .
It 's a bit oily and there 's an after - taste .
" I mix it with fruit and tofu and yoghurt into a smoothie to mask the taste as well as get other good things into my diet . "
Scepticism
Cancer specialists in the US and the UK said there was no proof that breast milk could help cancer patients .
Dr John Stevens of the American Cancer Society said : " It has not been tested in any scientific fashion .
" On a plausibility basis , it is hard to envisage how it might be working . "
David Kerr , professor of clinical pharmacology and cancer therapeutics at Oxford University , said : " This is a tiny number of anecdotes with no proof whatsoever underpinning it .
" It 's a bizarre claim with no evidence for it having any clinical value or use . "
Pauline Sakamoto from the Mothers ' Milk Bank in California said : " Part of it could be placebo effect .
" No one really knows .
It 's an area that needs a lot of study .
" Some patients truly believe this is the way to go for their cancers . "
Gillian Weaver , of the UK Association for Milk Banking , welcomed more research .
She said even if there were evidence in the future that it did help , resources of donor milk in the UK were so scarce that the priority would be for premature and sick babies .

If people object to wind farms cluttering up the countryside , one answer might be to put them in the air
IF IT ever seems windy where you live , be thankful you do not live 10 km up in the air .
At that height , the jet - stream winds blow stronger and more constantly than ground level winds , carrying up to a hundred times more energy .
So , just as oil companies are drilling deeper and in more remote locations in search of new reserves , pioneer wind - power engineers are looking higher in the sky for new sources of energy .
Conventional turbines will not take them there — the highest to date is just over 200 metres tall .
So they are trying to invent a whole new technology for harvesting wind : electricity generators that fly .
One of the most ambitious ideas has been developed by Sky WindPower , a company based in San Diego and led by Dave Shepard .
Mr Shepard began his career cracking Japanese military codes during the Second World War , then developed machines for reading written text .
His work led to the squared - off numbers still seen on bank cards today .
Mr Shepard 's flying generator looks like a cross between a kite and a helicopter .
It has four rotors at the points of an H - shaped frame that is tethered to the ground by a long cable .
The rotors act like the surface of a kite , providing the lift needed to keep the platform in the air .
As they do so , they also turn dynamos that generate electricity .
This power is transmitted to the ground through aluminium cables .
Should there be a lull in the wind , the dynamos can be used in reverse as electric motors , to keep the generator airborne .
Mr Shepard estimates these rigs could produce power for as little as two cents a kilowatt hour .
That is cheaper than the three to five cents conventional energy generation costs .
It is an attractive idea , but a flying generator is difficult thing to build — and there is a limit to how helpful existing helicopter technology will be .
Aircraft require maintenance after a few days of operation , if not sooner .
To operate cost - effectively , wind turbines will need to keep turning for many months without upkeep .
Mr Shepard , however , thinks he has a way out .
Stabilising and directing a conventional helicopter requires that the pitch of the individual blades be adjusted with every rotation — up to a thousand times a minute .
That puts massive stress on the turning mechanism and wears it out rapidly .
On a four - rotor arrangement , you can achieve the same effect by changing the pitch of one or two whole rotors , rather than adjusting the pitch of individual blades .
Mr Shepard reckons that this will make a big difference , and will increase the periods between maintenance enough to make the project viable .
Exploiting the jet stream represents the zenith ( both literally and figuratively ) of aerial wind - engineers ' ambitions .
Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution who has worked with Sky WindPower , estimates that harvesting just 1 % of its energy would produce enough power for the whole of civilisation .
But even at lower altitudes , the winds are stronger than they are at the surface , and that has attracted the attention of other inventors .
In Canada a company called Magenn Power has developed a proposal for a wind generator filled with helium .
It turns around a horizontal axis , rather like a water mill , and could fly at an altitude of up to 1 km .
The firm sees its system as an alternative to diesel generators in remote locations where ground - level wind is insufficient for a normal windmill .
Meanwhile , Wubbo Ockels of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has been developing another approach to airborne wind generation at lower altitude , with backing from Royal Dutch Shell and Nederlandse Gasunie , a natural - gas company .
Dr Ockels 's idea is that a kite ( without rotor blades ) be launched from a ground station , turning a generator as it rises to an altitude of several hundred metres .
When it reaches its full height , it alters its shape to catch less wind , and can thus be reeled back in using much less power than it produced when it was being paid out .
An arrangement of two or more of these kites could act together to produce a steady supply of power .
When one kite was being released , part of the electricity produced would reel the other kite back in , and vice versa .
The whole system would thus remain in surplus , and if well designed could deliver a constant current .
This system has the advantage that it requires only simple parts — generators , kites and cables — and should thus be much cheaper to build than a conventional turbine .
Controlling it , however , would be a different matter .
Dr Ockels is working on kites with wings and rudders , which look much more like a plane than anything you might see flying in the park .
The wings and rudders themselves would be under computer control — a technology already well established for flying aircraft without too much interference from a human pilot .
To test the idea , Dr Ockels 's team is building a 100 kW prototype .
He hopes to start testing a full - scale device , which would generate 10 MW , within five years .
That would be large enough to power around 10,000 homes .
He believes the system should be capable of generating electricity at a cost of just 1 cent a kilowatt hour .
Any promise of such cheap energy has to be treated with scepticism , and all these projects are still a long way from the full - scale test rigs needed to prove they will succeed .
No - one denies that it will be hard to build a flying generator that can make money .
However , the political impetus behind renewable energy is growing and space is limited at ground level .
Perhaps it is time for the wind power industry to reach for the sky .

Issue # 104 • March / April , 2007
It seems like every winter there are news stories of people getting stranded for weeks in bad weather while driving through the many remote areas of our country .
In fact , this past winter , our nation held its breath waiting for news of James Kim and his family who got lost traveling the snowy roads of Josephine County in Oregon , not far from where this magazine is published .
While his wife and daughters , who stayed with their vehicle , were eventually found alive , he succumbed to the cold as he hiked through snow looking for help for his family .
And there are also many cases of people trapped for days in their vehicles after skidding over a bridge embankment , even though they were only a few hundred feet from a busy highway .
I have written many articles about how to prepare your home for a power outage or national emergency , but today I want to address how to be prepared for an emergency when traveling in your car or truck .
A 10 - day supply of dehydrated food and drink mixes , medical supplies , and cooking equipment fits easily in a small plastic cooler .
Keeping warm and safe
Warmth , of course , is a major concern in cold climate and snow emergencies .
Since you ’ll be with your car , you ’ll have that as protection against the elements .
but extra clothing ( preferably wool ) , some blankets , and a sleeping bag will keep you warm if you are stranded for several days .
Store these items in a plastic trash bag in your trunk or behind the seat of your pickup .
I recommend wool clothing because it sheds moisture , just in case you have to leave your car during wet or snowy weather .
It ’s no fun being stranded and cold , and hypothermia is a real danger in cold weather .
If stranded , you may not want to run your vehicle heater for very long so you can conserve gasoline .
But if you do run your car engine to operate the car heater , be sure you are n’t breathing in carbon monoxide fumes from the exhaust .
In a snow emergency , you must make certain that the car ’s exhaust pipe is not clogged with snow , and be sure the exhaust is not being sucked into the car through an open window at the rear of the vehicle .
Opening a front window a bit will help admit fresh air into the passenger compartment .
You ca n’t smell carbon monoxide , so do n’t rely on your nose .
Finding supplies
Once you ’ve ensured you and your family will be warm during a car emergency situation , you need to ensure you ’ll have enough food and drinking water .
I realize that not everyone lives near a camping or sporting goods store stocked with all kinds of really great fold - up and lightweight camping equipment .
Substitutes for many of the specialized camping equipment and freeze - dried foods you will need can be found in most grocery stores , if you know what to look for .
A “ 6 - Pack ” size cooler makes a perfect emergency food storage container for your car or truck .
The two biggest complaints I hear from people when it comes to buying emergency supplies are the high cost for items they may never actually use and the need to replace out - of - date food that was never eaten .
Yes , those tasty freeze - dried , ready - to - eat meals from most camping stores are expensive , and yes , many may never actually be used .
But that is also true of buying a fire extinguisher , as you do n’t intend to ever actually use it either , but it ’s a real life saver if you do .
To address these high - cost concerns and the difficulty to locate camping stores that stock hard - to - find survival equipment , I decided to assemble a 10 - day emergency food supply by shopping only in a typical chain grocery store , and I kept the total cost under $ 25 .
This is very cheap insurance if you travel through areas where you would not want to be stranded , and you will not be out that much if you have to occasionally replace items that have reached their expiration date .
Drinking water supply
A person can actually live many days without any food , but your body must have drinking water .
This is easy to solve by tossing a few plastic gallons of bottled water in your vehicle ’s trunk , but these will not last long during an extended crisis , so an additional source of water is available by using purification tablets to treat any available surface water .
For less than $ 5 you can purchase a bottle of tablets that will completely transform almost any water source into safe drinking water .
Unless you are stranded in a desert , you can usually find water somewhere , even if it ’s from a drainage ditch , creek , lake , or melting snow .
You can use one of the empty gallon water containers to hold the collected surface water while you add the tablets , which will kill off all the bacteria and harmful organisms in about 30 minutes .
Food and drink mixes
When it comes to stored emergency food , you want meals that are easy to prepare , use little or no cooking equipment , and tastes good .
Since you could be injured or trapped , you want to keep it very simple .
You may have limited trunk space and may have to carry this emergency food supply some distance if you must leave your vehicle , so you want to keep its size and weight to a minimum .
This means you need to buy foods that are highly concentrated and only require hot water to prepare .
There are many drink mixes and dehydrated food packs that are inexpensive and can be found in any large grocery store , although they are not actually advertised or sold as emergency or camping supplies .
Be sure to check all expiration dates and purchase only the newest stock .
Most of these recommended products can provide good nutrition and taste variety over many days .
The packaged meals I am recommending are sold in individual moisture - proof foil pouches and require only a cup of very hot water to reconstitute into a tasty hot meal that will serve two people .
Select only dehydrated foods that can be prepared by adding hot water .
As you start shopping for the food items I have listed , you may find different items you would like to add or change .
Just make sure they only require hot water to prepare and still provide a good variety .
You may also want a few things to eat that do not require any hot water or cooking .
Several small sealed packages of beef jerky and trail mix or candy bars are a good choice .
However , avoid any foods or snacks that contain ingredients like chocolate , which can melt when stored in a heated car trunk .
Heating foods and drinks
No matter what brands and types of “ instant ” meals and drink mixes you purchase , you will need an easy way to heat water .
The water can come from gallon jugs of bottled water you hopefully remembered to bring along in your trunk , or from creek water or snow you heated or chemically treated with the purification tablets .
Since most of these meal packets are sized for one to two servings , each will require only one or two cups of hot water .
It would be nice if you could find enough dry twigs and sticks lying around to actually build a campfire each night , but this will be impossible in a blizzard or heavy rainstorm .
Since you would be living out of your car or truck cab during this emergency , you will need a simple way to boil water inside or outside the vehicle .
Your emergency food supply should include a large handful of “ strike - anywhere ” kitchen matches , but these are becoming very hard to find due to endless government safety regulations , so you will probably only be able to buy “ safety ” matches that must be struck on the side of the matchbox .
Camping stores offer all kinds of low - cost fire starting and cooking products , but again , I am assuming you are only able to buy supplies from a nearby grocery store .
Place your matches in a discarded prescription drug bottle or empty baby food jar to keep them dry .
Those lucky enough to find “ strike - anywhere ” matches can dip the heads in melted candle wax , which makes them virtually waterproof .
For heating water inside your vehicle or on a car hood , you will need a metal container of “ canned ” heat , typically sold at grocery stores to keep food serving trays hot .
If you have the space , keep several handy , but one should last several days and is reusable , thanks to an air - tight cap .
Please use good common sense when burning canned heat inside any vehicle , small tent , or storm shelter , and make sure it is placed on a solid , non-flammable surface .
You must leave a window open enough to prevent asphyxiation , and keep clear of any other fuel containers or gasoline leaks .
Medical supplies you may need including water purification tablets , toilet tissue , band aids , and travel - size hygiene supplies .
I found a small , lightweight saucepan that cost $ 5 and an enameled - metal coffee cup for $ 4 at a Wal - Mart , and either will serve our purpose .
Make sure any water - heating container you buy has a sturdy handle that will allow holding over an open flame without burning your hand , as you will not have a stove - type surface or fire grate .
I was able to heat a large cup of cold water to more than 180° F in just six minutes using the inexpensive enameled - metal coffee cup and canned heat as shown in the photo .
It was not that hard to hold the cup for this length of time , and the handle remained fairly cool .
Camping stores sell fold - up metal supports for this canned heat , but these supports are not usually stocked in grocery stores .
And I really like the stainless steel cups with long sturdy fold - up handles that will keep your fingers away from the flame , but again , these are sold only in camping supply stores .
You need only one or two cups of water at a time , so you will not want to hold a large pan full of water over a fire for very long .
Your saucepan or metal cup will most likely also serve as your “ plate ” to eat from after preparing a dehydrated food packet .
However , if you have extra trunk space , it ’s really nice to have some paper plates and paper towels along , which store forever if kept dry .
Most dehydrated food packaging uses strong Mylar or plastic coated aluminum - foil construction , and some brands may even allow adding the hot water right into the pouch .
You must carefully cut off the top and support the pouch on a solid surface to prevent tipping over .
Do not try to hold a food pouch in your hand while pouring in boiling hot water or you may scald yourself .
Most pre-packaged meals require the water to be extremely hot , so you may need to stir the mixture and let slightly cool for a few minutes before eating .
Since you can heat only one cup of water at a time , you may want to prepare your meal first .
You can then refill the cup with water after eating to make hot water for coffee , tea , or hot cocoa to sip as you try to relax while waiting for the storm to end or rescuers to arrive .
Non -food items needed
Canned heat and an enameled - steel cup is all you need to boil water .
Your emergency food pack will need a few items you should already have around the house or farm that you can re-use .
These include some eating utensils and a really good locking - blade pocket knife or small kitchen knife .
I also suggest taking a discarded prescription medicine bottle and filling it with a mixture of aspirin , Tylenol , Unisom , Benadryl , and Advil caplets , which should get you through most minor medical emergencies .
If you really want comfort , for another $ 5 you can purchase travel - size packages of toothpaste , shampoo , hand lotion , toilet tissue , bar soap , hand sanitizer , some first - aid supplies , and a disposable razor .
While you are putting your emergency pack together , save up all those free packets of salt , pepper , and condiments they toss into the bag at every drive - through restaurant , as these will also come in handy for emergencies .
If you do n’t have a spare flashlight , purchase one of the new small LED - type flashlights that use three AAA - size batteries .
These flashlights are small and very bright , and will operate weeks on these tiny batteries .
A 50 - foot roll of 1/8 inch nylon rope and a 10 × 10 ft. plastic sheet are very handy for many emergencies .
And finally , do n’t forget that roll of duct tape .
You will need a container to keep your emergency food supply clean and protected from all those field mice that manage to get into any car or truck that contains food .
You want a container that is fairly inexpensive and sturdy , includes a carry - handle , and could have other emergency uses like something to carry water .
I recommend buying a small “ 6 - pack ” style plastic insulated cooler .
Their small size and durable construction are perfect for keeping foods safe in a car trunk or behind a truck seat .
Be sure to duct tape the lid shut , as most do not include a latch .
Finally , toss in a few self - tie kitchen - size plastic trash bags .
They take up almost no room , and are a great way to store your discarded food and trash , which will reduce problems with waste smells and insects .

![ The 37 Signals Panel ] ( building_of_basecamp_1.jpg ) !
[ Jason gesturing to ... something .]( building_of_basecamp_2.jpg ) !
[ A screen capture on the projector .
The mass of hair is ... Ryan , I think . ]( building_of_basecamp_3.jpg )
I ’ve been putting off posting about The Building of Basecamp because I was trying to get my hands on a picture .
Neither Joe nor I thought to bring a camera , and the workshop was the first thing we did in Chicago , before Joe bought a disposable to shoot this great panaroma from the top of the Sears Tower .
Anyway , I ca n’t find a decent picture ( Update : Jason let me use a few of his ) , so here goes —
The biggest thing I pulled out of the workshop is that you do n’t have to follow all “ the rules ” to make something great .
When you think about companies delivering services over the Web , you think about ... org charts , support staff , call centers , requirements documents , functional specifications , etc .
37 Signals will blow this perception apart pretty quickly .
There are just three guys : Jason , Matt , and Ryan .
That ’s it .
They do n’t even have a full - time programmer .
David works for them part - time .
From Denmark .
They do n’t have bug tracking , or trouble ticketing .
They have two folders in AppleMail : “ fixed , ” “ not fixed . ”
Jason spends a couple hours a day answering support emails .
Most of all , these guys are laid back .
Not to the point of irresponsibility , but to the point where it ’s obvious they can maintain a creative groove amidst the ridiculous grind of supporting software .
They talk about Basecamp as if they know they ’ve already done something wonderful ( and they have – if you do n’t believe me , believe these people ) , and everything from here on out is just gravy .
They built Basecamp the way they wanted to .
All of you guys stuck in the corporate software trenches , can you imagine that – building software the way you think it should be built , without stupid restrictions ?
Can you imagine turning out something that was less a product of the corporate machine , and more a ... craft , that you put together with pride like the prototypical old artisan in some rural town ?
As you can tell , it ’s been a while for me .
The bottom line is that they built what they wanted to in the way they wanted to .
They did n’t get hung up on logistial or technical hurdles – they just kept working towards a goal as if it was completely reasonable and normal for three guys in a shared office with no programmer to build something like this .
Thank goodness no one told them they were being ridiculous .
Which brings us to the workshop .
It was packed with good information .
So much so , that I wish it had been a bit longer .
A day - and - a half would have been good , but I think we were displacing some workers from the company they office - share with , so we ran from 10 a.m. to about 6 p.m. and glossed over some stuff towards the end .
They divided the day up into sessions : Marketing , Programming , User Interface Design , etc .
They spoke for a while , then presented some FAQs on that subject , then opened it up for questions .
The four of them ( three guys from 37 Signals , plus the programmer who flew in from Denmark ) handled it as a panel discussion .
They got high marks on the presentation ( done in Keynote , no less ) .
They were very Larry Lessig - ish , in that each slide was just a sentence or two and they spoke from there .
No reading of bullet points , thank goodness .
Questions were plentiful .
The audience was thick with geeks ( only one woman , interestingly ) , and they did n’t hold back .
Most of the questions were very intelligent , as were the answers , though sometimes the questioner was asking something expecting a very pat answer , when the truth was a little more nebulous .
Here ’s a sampling of some of the topics they covered .
I ’m just scratching the surface here , as there ’s too much to cover and I do n’t want to steal their thunder for the next time they offer this :
Develop a set of “ mantras ” or rules for how you want things to work .
Whenever you develop something , “ test ” it against the rules .
For instance , “ less software ” or “ project management is mainly about communication . ”
Make sure you stick to your own rules and your own principles .
Say “ no ” by default to any feature request .
Make a feature work very hard to be implemented .
Remember that there are significant hidden costs with new features .
Besides the actual time to code there ’s ( 1 ) time spent supporting it , ( 2 ) unforseen changes that result because of it , ( 3 ) time spent documenting it , ( 4 ) the overall degradation of the user experience if it makes things more complicated , etc .
Sometimes , the coding time is just the tip of the iceberg .
Start everything with the screen design .
The screen IS the application .
The screen drives the functionality , not the other way around .
The screen design is the requirements document .
( I know , I know – the hair on the back of your neck just stood on end ... )
Get something built quickly .
Iterate , iterate , iterate .
Release early and often .
Plan a major feature upgrade within 30 days of release .
When designing a screen , find the epicenter – the main section of the screen where the user ’s eye will be drawn first .
Design that and work outwards .
Be honest with pricing .
Clearly display the price , and avoid any hidden fees .
Avoid preferences .
Preferences can be cop-outs to tough problems .
Whenever you have the user set a preference , you ’re having them make a decision ( Joel Spolsky ’s book is big on this too ) .
It ’s more challenging to come up with a solution , and mandate it .
As a result , Basecamp requires something like four fields to be completed and it ’s ready to go .
You get the idea – there was enough of this that Joe filled up a dozen pages in a legal pad .
One of the more valulable bits was at the end when the showed us their mistakes .
They had a half - dozen dead ends and time wasters that they fessed up to , including what they called a “ billing fiasco ” into which they sunk a dozen hours of work without checking with their credit card processor as to the validity of what they were planning to do .
It turned out the processor would n’t let them do it , and they lost a dozen hours of the programming as a result .
Any complaints ?
A few :
The chairs sucked .
I ’m 6 ’ 4 ” , 280 lbs. and that chair was so small it damn - near gave me a wedgie .
And no tables – just rows of geeks trying to balance laptops on their ... well , laps .
Early on , I found a table in the back with a more comfortable seat .
It was hot in the room .
Forty people in one room will do that , and I kept wanting to crack a window .
While they presented frequently asked questions that they had hyped in the promotional materials , they did n’t always answer them soundly .
But , in retrospect , I do n’t know what I expected .
For instance , when it came to which platform to program in , I guess I was expecting a sound answer – do it in this platform .
Looking back , this was just an unrealisitic expectation .
What they did was tell us what they did and why , which is really all you can ask for .
Again , the workshop was a bit too short .
If it had been another half day , the attendees would have come back on the second day with so many questions that occured to them overnight .
I thought up a dozen on the plane ride home .
It was hard to hear from the back .
They did it sans sound equipment , which is fine , but the Metro train went by the window just to my right about once every 10 minutes .
I should have said something .
But I ’m nit -picking now .
None of this detracted from what was otherwise a great presentation .
Finally , this discussion would n’t be complete without talking about the office : very cool for a hick from South Dakota .
All painted brick , open spaces , and hardwood floors .
The prototypical “ loft ” office space .
The trendiness of it all was a little over - whelming .
( Joe made a very astute comment when one of them started talking about business mistakes of the past .
He said , “ I find it ironic that he ’s talking about the evils of the dot - com era while he ’s standing in front of a foosball table ... ” )
37 Signals and their office mates are big , big Mac users .
I did n’t see a single PC , and theatre displays were the norm .
They had gorgeous equipment lying around everywhere .
It goes without saying that they had an open wi - fi node running .
There was one bathroom , which meant there was a line , but it was worth it when you got inside .
The walls were lined with chalkboards .
The topic of the discussion was “ Rejected Names for Basecamp . ”
Additionally , several people had written backwards on the board behind the mirror so you could read it normally in the reflection .
Clever , no ?
Lunch , incidentally , was fantastic .
I had a turkey and avocado sandwich on a hard roll that about made me cry .
( And you wonder why I was too big for the chairs ... )
All in all , an excellent seminar on two levels : ( 1 ) the actual information presented , and ( 2 ) the vibe you got from 37 Signals in general .
I came away with a very , “ if they can do it , so can we ” attitude which will perhaps be the biggest benefit of all in the next few months .
Something is coming from Sling & Rock .
Stay tuned .
The legislation to tighten no - knock raid requirements here in Georgia has passed through committee :
The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved changes that require police officers to meet a stiffer standard to get the special warrants , which are intended to prevent suspects from getting rid of evidence and to protect officers from potentially violent suspects .
Critics say the warrants are sometimes abused by police , who currently must prove to a judge that there ’s “ reasonable suspicion ” before granted the power to enter a home without knocking first .
The measure would require them to prove a “ probable cause , ” a standard that ’s one step higher in Georgia criminal law .
“ Every citizen ought to be safe and secure in their own home , ” said state Sen.
Vincent Fort , the Atlanta Democrat who wrote the bill .
“ There ’s no higher right . ”
[…]
“ It ’s an officer ’s safety issue and a safety issue for other occupants that may be in a dwelling , ” said Terry Norris , the group ’s director .
“ I just do n’t feel like â€ ” and the sheriffs do n’t feel like â€ ” there ’s a need for the legislation . ”
The arguments failed to sway members of the Republican - controlled committee , which described it as a property rights issue .
“ No - knock warrants are about as great an abrogation of the privacy of the home as you can get , ” said Sen . Seth Harp , R - Midland .
“ We need for people to be protected in their homes . ”
“ We need for people to be protected in their homes . ”
Kate Hudson is fed up of seeing her friends ' penises .
The ' You , Me And Dupree ' actress - who is married to Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson - has revealed her house is constantly overrun by crazy musicians who love to flash their genitals .
She confessed to Britain's OK !
magazine : " I enjoy a lively house .
I enjoy weird characters .
There are two English musician friends of ours and I have seen their penises one too many times .
I say , ' Why is it necessary for you to be walking around my house naked ? ' or ' Why do you think it 's funny to flash me your penis ? '
But they keep doing it .
" Hudson , daughter of Hollywood legend Goldie Hawn , also thinks her two - year - old son Ryder is growing up to be a " bitter musician " .
She revealed : " He is always singing and trying to find the notes himself .
He already wants to be good .
He 'll put on costumes and he will get really upset if I 'm not being serious .
I think he will end up a method actor or a bitter musician . "

Geopolitics A New Pearl Harbor By Ryan McGreal
Published October 05 , 2006
( This blog entry has been updated )
In July , 2001 , a lightweight legacy playboy from Texas was President after an ugly legal battle , and he was just smart enough to surround himself with some very smart people who really , really knew what they wanted to accomplish .
They wanted to rebuild the US military in a big way , dump hundreds of billions of dollars into it , modernize the equipment , streamline operations , and achieve " full spectrum dominance " based on overwhelmingly superior firepower and high tech communications .
They also wanted to position the US a lot more aggressively in global geopolitics .
They could see threats on the horizon - anti-hegemonic coalitions of minor powers with the audacity to think they should be allowed to manage their own affairs - and they believed the US needed to be proactive about preventing these coalitions from even aspiring to a larger global or regional role .
They were nervous about the long - term availability of the cheap , abundant petroleum on which the US economy is utterly dependent .
Many of them were energy industry executives themselves , and they believed the Caspian region was shaping up to be a major energy supplier .
They were determined that the US , and not Russia , Iran , or China , should call the shots there , so they pushed aggressively to establish forward bases , cosy up to former KGB dictators , and invest lots of American money to develop local industries .
As part of their drive to marginalize those potential rivals , the new government planners had to set up energy trade routes that bypassed those rivals completely and left the energy under the control of the US and its local proxies .
Some key logistical linchpins , like Afghanistan , which is smack - dab in the middle of any viable trade route around Iran , were unreliable partners , run by volatile thugs with funny ideas about self - determination .
Critical Energy Providers
The critical energy providers also had to be whipped into shape .
Iraq was a major headache , because the thug running things there hated America and had signed agreements with Russian and European companies to rebuild its oilfields .
Clearly , he had to go .
Luckily , Iraq was disarmed and defenseless , and feeble after a decade of punitive sanctions , so they figured it would be a cakewalk to take over the place .
Iran was a much bigger problem .
Unlike Iraq , it was able to defend itself from conventional attack , it had the world 's second largest oil reserves , and it was busy signing reciprocity contracts with places like Russia and China to supply oil in exchange for more military technology .
It would take a lot of pressure to isolate Iran , but one of the nice side - effects of taking over Iraq is that it would send a clear message to other players in the region not to get in the way of US interests .
Saudi Arabia was a headache .
Officially , it was an ally , and plenty of personal and business connections tied Saudi Arabia and the US together , but the local culture was quite hostile to US involvement in the Middle East , and the ruling family had to make a lot of compromises and juggle a lot of competing interests to stay in power .
After the US moved in and set up permanent military bases during the first Gulf War , the CIA - trained guerillas who drove the USSR out of Afghanistan were up in arms again about these crusader forces in the holy land .
They tried to blow up the World Trade Centre back in 1993 , and since then they took potshots at US embassies and even dared to attack a US Navy destroyer when it was harboured in Yemen .
What 's more , they were being funded by some of the rulers in Saudi Arabia , and they had cozied up closely to the thugs running things in Afghanistan .
Opportunity Knocks
Still , the people surrounding the new US President were very smart , and where others saw trouble , they saw opportunity .
They knew their plan to overhaul the military and topple uncooperative regimes like Iraq was n't going to sit well with the public , and having a scary bad guy out there could only help matters .
( Remember Pearl Harbor ?
Before that , Americans wanted nothing to do with that war over in Europe .
After the attack , they dove in headfirst .
If there 's one thing Americans hate , it 's having their noses rubbed in it . )
The issues that gripped the President 's strategists were too complicated for the public to understand , anyway .
Much better to frame it as an old - fashioned , good guys vs. bad guys kind of thing .
Keep it nice and simple , and let the clever planners carry the burden of pulling off their great designs .
Savvy analysts understand that it is very difficult to achieve the kind of consensus that the President 's planners sought unless facing a major , direct external threat , as existed during WWII and the Cold War .
In fact , as propagandists have long known , the easiest way to drag the public into war is to convince them that they are being attacked and to question the loyalty of those who dissent .
What better way to generate the unquestioning loyalty they needed than to stand aside and let a real terrorist attack happen ?
Distant Early Warning
In July , the US intelligence community noticed a major increase in chatter among terrorist communities .
They were up to something , and it sounded like it was going to be a doozy .
There was talk about an attack in the US itself , talk about airlines and hijackings .
The spies were nervous and the President 's antiterrorist advisor was going ballistic .
The CIA director tried to discuss the matter with the National Security Advisor , but she ignored him .
The President 's planners had bigger fish to fry , and another terrorist attack could only help them .
On August 2 , 2001 , the President set off for a month of mountain biking and brush clearing at his family 's summer estate in Crawford , Texas , confident that his smart advisors would take care of things and keep him in the loop .
Every day the President received briefings from the intelligence community .
On his fourth day of vacation , he listened to a memo saying those crazy terrorists who blew up the Cole were planning some kind of attack in the US involving airports , recruits in New York , airplane hijackings , and surveillance of federal buildings .
The President smirked at the poor functionary who had to deliver his briefing .
" All right , You 've covered your ass , " the President drawled , and sent him on his way .
9/11
The warnings continued to escalate , the President and his planners continued to dismiss them , and a little over a month later , all hell broke loose .
Those terrorists who were planning to hijack airplanes and attack the US did just that , and the President and his planners suddenly had precisely the mandate they needed to pursue their objectives , free of domestic opposition .
Hanlon 's Razor holds , " Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity , " and this has often been used to lend support to the official story about the September 11 , 2001 attacks : that they were the result of vast incompetence by a lazy , sloppy government bureaucracy .
Well , maybe .
However , it stretches credulity to think the leaders of the US government could read a briefing that a known and well - funded terrorist plans to attack the United States by hijacking airplanes , listen to the director of the CIA warn that a major terrorist attack is in the works , and then do absolutely nothing about it out of mere incompetence .
Unfortunately , the leading conspiracy theory about September 11 is that it was an inside job , executed or at least planned by the US government itself , in the vein of the Northwoods Project .
However , the possibility that a conspiracy of this magnitude could be kept under wraps is even harder to swallow than the official story .
But what if the chief planners in the US government , the ones who spent the decade deciding how they would reorganize the world once they were back in power , the ones who determined that they could not achieve their objectives without a " new Pearl Harbor " to mobilize the public and silence dissent , learned just enough about a planned attack to see that it would give them the perfect opportunity ?
In the lead - up to the original Pearl Harbor , the US government undertook several calculated provocations against Japan , hoping to goad the Japanese into an attack that would provide the US with a pretext to enter World War II .
Why create the illusion of a terrorist attack when you can have the real thing ?
Creating Reality
The US is an empire now , and its leaders believe they have the power to create their own reality , to impose their definitions on the world and to make them stick .
Obviously , we have no way of knowing just how much the President and his strategists knew about the planned attacks , but we do know that those strategists were eager to set the US on a much more aggressive footing with the rest of the world , and they they believed their job would be much easier if the US public believed they were under attack .
We also know they were warned in August that a known terrorist group was planning a major attack against the US , and they did nothing to prevent it , despite the advice of the government 's chief anti-terrorism advisor .
( Within hours of the attack , the Secretary of Defense was already asking his staff to draw up plans for an invasion of Iraq . )
That leaves us with an incomplete puzzle , and we are left weighing the comparative plausibility of a few different stories that purport to fit the available evidence .
Based on this government 's pathological mendacity and its relentless efforts to twist reality to serve their goals , I find myself leaning toward the conclusion that they had some idea what was coming and let it happen .
I just hope I 'm still around in 25 years when the secret files of this administration are declassified and we get to learn the rest of the story .

Caspase - 12 is a molecule with a death - wish .
Found only in people of African descent , this protein shuts down our body 's immune system , opening the door to potentially lethal infections .
In a groundbreaking new study published in the prestigious journal Nature this week , the team that first discovered the role of caspase - 12 in humans has now uncovered the mechanism by which it sabotages us , allowing researchers to develop methods to counter its damaging effects .
Caspase - 12 is found in around 20 % of people of African descent , but was entirely lost from all other ethnicities around 60,000 years ago .
" It 's a mystery why only African populations retained this enzyme , " says Dr. Maya Saleh , a medical scientist in the Critical Care Division at the MUHC and assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at McGill University .
It 's possible that in Africa the protein could once have had a protective function fighting autoimmune diseases or perhaps parasites , like malaria ; today caspase - 12 provides no benefit to those who carry it , and often leaves the body more vulnerable to life - threatening infections and sepsis ( ' septic shock ' ) .
" Only by investigating the mechanisms by which caspase - 12 works can we hope to inhibit its destructive effects , " says Dr. Saleh .
Dr. Saleh and a research team from Merck and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology in San Diego conducted laboratory experiments using mice deficient in the caspase - 12 gene .
" We discovered that caspase - 12 blocks the body 's inflammatory response to infection by blocking the activity of another useful enzyme , " says Dr. Saleh .
" It 's kind of like the bad leading the good astray . "
Dr. Saleh 's discovery is a major step forward and will allow researchers to develop treatments that may help strengthen the immune system of those people unfortunate enough to have the caspase - 12 gene product .
This research was funded by a fellowship from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research ( CIHR ) , the MUHC and McGill University to Dr. Saleh .
A huge thank you to everyone who has been so supportive over the past week as we ’ve been hit by the stunning ruling on webcast rates .
It ’s very heartening for us to see how much people care about this , and how willing listeners are to pitch in .
And how many of you there are !!
There has been an enormous groundswell of opposition to this decision , and we ’ve been hard at work on how to best channel the energy in the right direction .
Because the webcasting community does not have an entrenched and powerful lobbying presence in DC , grassroots legislative pressure – constituents contacting their representatives – is clearly our biggest ally .
Internet radio is hostage to a blatantly discriminatory double standard that was written into the federal statute governing webcasting several years ago , following an intensive lobbying effort by the RIAA .
We need to redress this , and create a more level playing field – one that of course rewards musicians for their work ( I spent years in a band van myself and have always been driven by a desire to lift up musicians ) , and one that also understands the business realities , and benefits of online radio .
While we figure this out , below are a few of the more informative write ups we ’ve seen in the past week .
We also suggest that you visit and sign this petition put together by a collection of webcasters .

Thanks again for your support .

The quality of Pentagon - propaganda is really deteriorating .
The War Dept .’s latest fraud appeared in this week ’s newspapers under the ominous - sounding headline :
" US Kills Mastermind of Iraq Shrine bombs "
The article is similar to hundreds of other stories we ’ve seen in the passed few years boasting of the murder of an " alleged " terrorist kingpin whose evil deeds have prevented democracy from flourishing in Iraq .
Oh , please .
CNN : " Coalition troops killed the al Qaeda terrorist who masterminded the February 2006 attack on Samarra 's al - Askariya mosque and set off continuing violence and reprisal killings between Sunnis and Shiites , the U.S. military said Sunday . "
Snip " Haitham Sabah al - Baderi , the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra , was killed Thursday east of Samarra , said Rear Adm.
Mark Fox during a news conference " .
snip " Eliminating al - Baderi is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra , " Fox said .
" We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban - like state in Iraq . " ( CNN )
In truth , CNN has no idea who al - Baderi really was or whether he belonged to Al Qaida or not .
They just jot down whatever the Pentagon spokesman tells them and then pass it off later as news .
It ’s the same with the rest of the media .
They do n’t care .
They build their stories on statements from government officials and do n’t bother looking for evidence .
All they know is that al - Baderi is another unlucky victim in Bush ’s war on terror who has been subsumed into the Pentagon ’s propaganda war against the American people .
That ’s it .
So why bother publishing a crazy story like this ?
It does n’t change public opinion on the war or convince people that al Qaida is the main enemy in Iraq .
So what good is it ?
It 's just an attempt to show progress in a losing cause by holding up another enemy scalp .
But , that ’s not public relations --- it ’s barbarism .
Do n’t the Pentagon big - wigs know that ?
They think the American people relish the idea of assassinating enemy " suspects " without any proof of wrongdoing or judicial oversight .
But they ’re wrong .
People were sickened by it .
Ca n’t they see that ?
What is gained by fabricating another goofy story before the dust has even settled on the Tillman fiasco ?
Why not let the public fully - digest the last " Big Lie " before moving on to the next one ?
Remember Tillman --- the outspoken NFL star who figured out the war was a fake and started blasting the Bush administration ’s lies ?
Well , he took three bullets to the head ---" gangland style " --- in what the Pentagon dubbed " friendly fire " .
What a joke .
Is the Pentagon trying to destroy what little credibility it has left ?
Apparently .
THIS WEEK’S BIG LIE
I ’ve done a lot of research on both bombings of the Golden Dome Mosque and I can tell you that THE MILITARY HAS NEVER CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED .
Never .
That means the CNN headline is just more empty blather .
The few eyewitness accounts that appeared in Iraqi blogs and web sites strongly suggest that US Intelligence agencies and Iraqi troops from the Interior Ministry may have been involved .
The theories connecting Al Qaida to the incident are pure speculation with no factual basis .
And yet , here ’s what Bush said in a speech just days after the first bombing : " Al Qaida terrorists and Sunni insurgents … blew up one of the holiest shrines in Shia Islam — the Golden Mosque of Samarra — in a calculated effort to provoke Iraq ’s Shia population to retaliate .
Their strategy worked .
Radical Shia elements ; some supported by Iran , formed death squads .
And the result was a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continues today . "
How does Bush know who it was ?
He never ordered an investigation and he does n’t have a crystal ball .
If there ’s proof --- show us !
Otherwise we should assume that he is just trying to blame someone else for turning Iraq into a charnel house .
Those are n’t Al Qaida ’s B - 1 Bombers dropping cluster bombs and Daisy Cutters on Iraqi cities .
And , that is n’t al - Baderi kicking down doors and dragging off civilians to be tortured in some god - forsaken hell - hole .
Those are Bush ’s planes and Bush 's troops !
He ’s the one who ’s responsible .
Here ’s an excerpt from an article I wrote just a few months ago after the last bombing in Samarra :
" Less than 4 hours after the explosion , the Bush public relations team cobbled together a statement that the bombing was the work of Sunni extremists or al Qaida terrorists .
But , they ’ve never produced a scintilla of evidence to support their claims .
It may be that the administration simply saw the bombing as an opportunity to twist the facts to suit their own purposes .
After all , the incident has been a propaganda - bonanza for the Bush team .
They ’ve used it to support their theory that Iraq is " the central battle in the war on terror " and that " we must fight them there if we do n’t want to fight them over here " .
It ’s been used as one of the main justifications for the occupation ; implying that the US military is needed as a referee to keep the warring factions from killing each other .
It ’s all just nonsense that ’s designed to advance the administration ’s political agenda .
If there had been an investigation , it would have shown whether or not the perpetrators were experts by the placement of the explosives .
They might have found bomb - residue which could have determined the composition of the material used .
Forensics experts could have easily ascertained whether the explosives came from Iraqi munitions - dumps ( as suggested ) or from outside the country ( like the USA , perhaps ? )
The incident may well have been a " false flag " operation carried out by US intelligence agencies to provoke sectarian violence and , thus , reduce the number of attacks on American troops .
( That is what the vast number of Sunnis and Shiites believe )
In any event , as soon as the mosque was destroyed the media swung into action focusing all of its attention on sectarian violence and the prospect of civil war .
The media ’s incessant " cheerleading " for civil war was suspicious , to say the least .
In the first 30 hours after the blast , more than 1,500 articles appeared on Google News providing the government version of events without deviation and without any corroborating evidence ; just fluff that reiterated the Pentagon ’s account verbatim and without challenge .
1500 !
Now that ’s a well - oiled propaganda system !
Most of the articles were " cookie cutter - type " stories which used the same buzzwords and talking points as all the others ; no interviews , no facts , no second opinions ; simple , straightforward stenography - nothing more .
The story was repeated for weeks on end never veering from the same speculative theory .
Clearly , there was a push to convince the American people that this was a significant event that would reshape the whole context of the war in Iraq .
In fact , the media blitz that followed was bigger than anything since 9 - 11 ; a spectacular display of the media ’s power to manipulate public opinion .
There were a few articles that did n’t follow the party - line , but they quickly disappeared into a cyber - " black hole " or were dismissed as conspiracy theories .
One report in AFP said that the bombing a href = " http://www.uruknet.info/?p=m20998 " >" was the work of specialists " and the " placing of explosives must have taken at least 12 hours " .
Ah-ha !
The article said : " Construction Minister Mohammed Jaafar said , ' Holes were dug into the mausoleum ’s four main pillars and packed with explosives .
Then charges were connected together and linked to another charge placed just under the dome .
The wires were then linked to another charge placed just under the dome .
The wires were then linked to a detonator which was triggered at a distance . "
Of course , what does that prove ?
Perhaps , al Qaida has skilled explosives experts ?
But why not investigate ?
After all , if this was the " catalyzing event " which thrust the country towards civil war ; why not have the FBI come in and take a look - around ?
A professional team of investigators could have quickly determined whether highly - trained saboteurs were operating in the area .
( which meant that American troops would be at greater risk )
Is n’t that worth checking out ?
Nope .
The Pentagon did nothing .
There was no effort at all to find out who might have been involved .
It was an open and shut case ; wrapped up before the dust had even settled in Samarra .
Very strange .
Apparently , there was at least one witness who was interviewed shortly after the bombing .
He said that he heard cars running outside the mosque " the whole night until morning " but , he was warned " to stay in your shop and do n’t leave until morning " .
At 6:30 AM the next morning , the vehicles outside the mosque left .
10 minutes later the bombs exploded .
None of the people living in the vicinity of the mosque were ever questioned .
Likewise , the Construction Minister Mohammed Jaafar has never resurfaced in the news again .
I expect that his comments in the newspaper may have had something to do with his sudden disappearance , but then maybe not .
( Bush ’s War on Perception ; the bombing of the Golden Mosque , Mike Whitney )
Here ’s an excerpt from another article titled " Information Warfare , Psy- ops and the Power of Myth "
New Clues in the Bombing
New clues have surfaced in the case of the bombing of the Golden Mosque which suggests that the claims of the Bush administration are false .
An article by Marc Santora , ( " One Year Later , Golden Mosque still in Ruins " , New York Times ) provides eyewitness testimony of what really took place one year ago :
" A caretaker at the shrine described what happened on the day of the attack , insisting on anonymity because he was afraid that talking to an American could get him killed .
The general outline of his account was confirmed by American and Iraqi officials .
The night before the explosion , he said , just before the 8 p.m. curfew on Feb. 21 , 2006 , on the Western calendar , men dressed in commando uniforms like those issued by the Interior Ministry entered the shrine .
The caretaker said he had been beaten , tied up and locked in a room .
Throughout the night , he said , he could hear the sound of drilling as the attackers positioned the explosives , apparently in such a way as to inflict maximum damage on the dome " .
( NY Times )
Clearly , if the men were men dressed in " commando uniforms like those issued by the Interior Ministry " , then the logical place to begin an investigation would be the Interior Ministry .
But there 's never been an investigation and the caretaker has never been asked to testify about what he saw on the night of the bombing .
However , if he is telling the truth , we cannot exclude the possibility that paramilitary contractors ( mercenaries ) or special - ops ( intelligence ) agents working out of the Interior Ministry may have destroyed the mosque to create the appearance of a nascent civil war .
Is n’t that what Bush wants ---- to divert attention from the occupation and to show that the real conflict is between Shiites and Sunnis ?
It 's unlikely that the mosque was destroyed by " Sunni insurgents or Al Qaida " as Bush claims .
Samarra is predominantly a Sunni city and the Sunnis have nearly as much respect for the mosque as a cultural icon and sacred shrine as the Shiites .
The Times also adds , " What is clear is that the attack was carefully planned and calculated " .
True again .
We can see from the extent of the damage that the job was carried out by demolition experts and not merely " insurgents or terrorists " with explosives .
Simple forensic tests and soil samples could easily determine the composition of the explosives and point out the real perpetrators .
The Times even provides a motive for the attack : " Bad people used this incident to divide Iraq on a detestable sectarian basis . "
Bingo !
The administration has repeatedly used the incident to highlight divisions , incite hostilities , and prolong the occupation .
The Times also notes the similarities between 9 - 11 and the bombing of the Golden Mosque : " I can describe what was done as exactly like what happened to the World Trade Center . " ( NY Times )
In fact , the bombing of the Golden Mosque is a reenactment of September 11 .
In both cases an independent investigation was intentionally quashed and carefully - prepared narrative was immediately provided .
The administration ’s version of events has been critical in creating the rationale for an extended US military occupation of Iraq , but is it true .
Probably not .
The so - called " deeply ingrained sectarian animosity between Sunnis and Shiites " has no historical precedent .
It is an invention of propagandists in the intelligence services who intend to fragment the Iraqi state so that precious resources can be more easily controlled .
" Divide and rule " continues to be the driving force behind America ’s aggressive counterinsurgency strategy .
THE SECOND BOMBING OF THE GOLDEN DOME MOSQUE
Here ’s excerpt from another article which outlines some of what we know about the second bombing of the Golden Dome Mosque a year later : ( The Battle of Gaza )
Graham Bowley ( " Minarets on Shiites Shrine in Iraq Destroyed in Attack " NY Times ) clarifies some of the important details of what took place at the site of the Mosque just prior to the second bombing .
He says : " Since the attack in 2006 , the shrine had been under the protection of local — predominantly Sunni — guards .
But American military and Iraqi security officials had recently become concerned that the local unit had been infiltrated by Al Qaeda forces in Iraq .
A move by the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad over the last few days to bring in a new guard unit — predominantly Shiite — may have been linked to the attack today . "
No reference is made to the sudden and unexplained changing of the guards at the mosque in future accounts in the mainstream press .
And , yet , that is the most important point .
The minarets were blown up just days after the new guards took charge .
They cordoned off the area , placed snipers on the surrounding rooftops , and then blew up the minarets in broad daylight .
The first explosion took place at 9:30 AM .
Ten minutes later the second bomb was detonated .
Al Qaeda ?
Not likely .
The Golden Dome mosque has been heavily guarded ever since it was blown up in 2006 .
The four main doors have been bolted shut and not a tile has been moved in over a year .
The reason for this is that the Shiites consider it a " crime scene " which they intend to investigate more thoroughly when the violence subsides .
The Shiites never accepted the official US - version of events that " al Qaeda did it " .
Many believe that US Special Forces were directly involved and that it was a planned demolition carried out by experts .
There is considerable proof to support this theory including eye witness accounts from the scene of the crime as well as holes that were drilled in the floor of the mosque to maximize destruction .
This was not a simple al Qaeda - type car - bombing but a technically - demanding demolition operation .
The damning information in the New York Times article has been corroborated in many other publications including an official statement from the Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq ( AMSI ) .
According to the AMSI , Prime Minister Nouri al Mailiki replaced the Sunnis who had been guarding the site for over a year with Shiite government forces from the Interior Ministry .
Their statement reads : " Security forces arrived yesterday afternoon from Baghdad Tuesday for the receipt of the task of protecting two tombs instead of the existing force there .
Somehow they obtained a scuffle followed by gunfire lasted two hours over control of security forces coming from Baghdad . "
So , the Sunni guards were replaced ( after a scuffle ) with goons from the Interior Ministry .
The next day the minarets blow up .
Coincidence ?
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki immediately issued statement where he claimed that the al Qaeda was responsible for the attack .
At the same time , however , he arrested all 12 of the guards he sent from the Interior Ministry .
Why ?
Was he afraid they would talk to the media ?
The Association of Muslim Scholars said that " last year ’s explosion happened after a severe political crisis between blocs involved in the political process to the occupation .
After the elections , the establishment of the government was blocked at that time .
It is quite similar to the political crisis faced by the government and parliament today " .
The AMSI is right .
The destruction of the Golden Dome Mosque took place soon after the Iraqi parliament rejected the US - plan for dividing Iraq . ( " Federalism " )
This time , the parliament has voted - down the US - plan to transfer control of Iraq ’s vast petroleum reserves to the American oil giants via the " oil laws " .
The AMSI sees the bombing as a desperate attempt by the US occupation to break the logjam in Parliament over the oil laws and to conceal the failures of the " surge " by inciting sectarian violence .
The only difference this time is that the Shiite militias have been less responsive to US manipulation .
In fact , Shiite cleric Muqtada al Sadr has tried to stop his Mahdi Army from attacking Sunni areas and he has decried the bombing as another plot by US - Israeli intelligence agents operating in Iraq .
He said that the incident reveals " the hidden hand of the occupier . "
He added , " This is what the occupiers brought to Iraq : a disintegration plot and fanning the flames of sectarian violence .
Destroying the Askariya shrine goes exactly with the insurgents ' beliefs . "
Among Shiites , there ’s nearly unanimous agreement that the US was behind the bombing .
Middle East expert Juan
Cole reports on his blog - site " Informed Comment , that protests have broken out in India , Pakistan , the Caucasus , Bahrain , Iran and other locations where there are high concentrations of Shiites .
The consensus view is that the minarets were blown up as part of a larger US - Israeli strategy for controlling the Middle East .
But why would the Bush administration want to unleash a fresh wave of sectarian violence when they can’t even establish security in Baghdad ?
Here ’s what the AMSI says : " Sectarian violence is an effective means to enable the militias to fully impose their control on ( Sunni ) neighborhoods and cities as it did after the bombings of Samarra … .
The government is also trying to control the capital of Baghdad ; seeking to extend its power over other cities that reject the occupation , especially the cities of Baquba and Samarra " .
This is what is gained by the bombings — further ethnic cleansing of the Sunni neighborhoods and greater control over the public through a campaign of terror .
It ’s all part of a broader neocon strategy that centers on " creative destruction " rather than the traditional US policy of " regional stability
Final Comment
The bombing of the Golden Dome Mosque is a psychological operation ( psy- ops ) that evolved from the theories of former Counselor at the State Dept , Philip Zelikow , ( Zelikow was also executive director of the 9 - 11 Commission and author of the National Security Strategy NSS ) Zelikow " is an expert in " the creation and maintenance of ' public myths ’ or ' public presumptions ’ , which he defines as beliefs thought to be true although not necessarily known to be true with certainty , shared in common with the relevant political community .
He has taken a special interest in ' searing ’ or ' molding ’ events that take on ' transcendent ’ importance and , therefore , retain there power even as the experiencing generation passes from the scene " .
( " Thinking about Political History " Miller Center report ; winter 1999 ) " In the Nov -Dec 1998 issue of Foreign Affairs he co-authored an article called ' Catastrophic Terrorism ’ in which he speculated that if the 1993 bombing of the World Trade center had succeeded ' the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to describe it .
Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event in American history .
' It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America ’s fundamental sense of security , as did the Soviet bomb test in 1949 .
The US might respond with draconian measures scaling back civil liberties , allowing wider surveillance of citizens , detention of suspects and use of deadly force .
More violence could follow , either future terrorist attacks or US counterattacks .
Belatedly , Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently " .
( Wikipedia ) Zelikow ’s theories help us understand how " catastrophic events " are being used to shape public consciousness and create a narrative that advances the political objectives of the people in power .
The actual facts about the bombing of the shrine are have been suppressed while the prevailing theory — that we are fighting Al Qaida in Iraq — has been meticulously maintained with a solid wall of disinformation .
The media has played a central role in this process by disseminating the official storyline from every outlet and newspaper without challenging the basic " uncorroborated " assertions .
All government policy is now legitimized in terms of particular " catastrophic events " .
History , legal precedent and even cultural tradition have been brushed aside in an effort to rationalize a new world order in which state repression , autocratic rule and aggressive war are deemed the requisite components of national security .
The entire human experiment --- dating back tens of thousands of years -- is now conveniently divided into two parts : pre-9 - 11 and post 9 - 11 .
The bombing of the Golden Dome Mosque has been used the same way as 9 - 11 .
A " unifying myth " has been build around a " catastrophic event " in a way that serves the overall goals of the political establishment .
As we have seen , the facts do n’t matter as long as the illusion that we are fighting terrorists is maintained .
( According to Anthony H. Cordesman , an Iraqi specialist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , al Qaida ’s attacks make up only 15 per cent of the total in Iraq though they launch 80 - 90 per cent of the suicide bombings " .
Patrick Cockburn ) .
In reality , the US is engaged in a brutal colonial war that has destroyed a sovereign nation that posed no threat to American national security .
That obvious fact never finds its way into America ’s " free press " .
The Bush administration and their enablers in the Pentagon ’s " Dept. of Strategic Information " will continue to promote their threadbare narrative of " foreign fighters and terrorists " until the Iraq mission collapses and the troops are withdrawn .
Until then , many more lives will be sacrificed to preserve the myth of a war on terror .
Haitham Sabah al - Baderi was one such victim .
His assassination has helped to conceal the fact that 700,000 Iraqis have been butchered without cause in their own country by Bush ’s army .
DIGG THIS
When politicians are not promising new benefits to citizens , they continually remind citizens what they owe the government .
From their first years in government schools , children are indoctrinated with the notion that government provides them some grandiose benefit .
This seed often produces a harvest of servility in later life .
But few people stop and try to accurately calculate this supposed debt .
What does the citizen owe the state ?
Or , more accurately , what does the citizen owe the politicians and bureaucrats who claim to represent and embody the state ?
Every extension of the welfare state results , directly or indirectly , in politicians and bureaucrats feeling entitled to demand more obedience from people .
What does the government do for citizens that citizens could not do as well or better for themselves ?
This is the first question that must be answered before gauging how much obedience people might owe a government .
Insofar as government busies itself doing things worse for the citizen than he could have done himself , the citizen is justified in viewing government as a nuisance and a poacher .
In the vast majority of cases , governments possess only what they first seize from private citizens .
How can citizens owe government when practically everything the government has it first took from them ?
The fact that people are forced to pay for certain goods and services indirectly , by taxation , cannot create an ineradicable debt to the people who seized their paychecks .
People who are government dependents have a debt not so much to the government itself , but to their fellow citizens who earn the money the government seizes and then renders to them .
Some statists insist that the citizen should be grateful for such government services as mail delivery .
Yet , the government is more vigilant in attacking private threats to its monopoly over first - class mail delivery than in expediting the mail .
First - class mail service is significantly slower than it was 40 years ago , in part because of an intentional policy of reducing next - day mail deliveries .
In areas in which the postal service competes directly with private companies , such as overnight express mail and parcel post , the government has been whupped shamelessly .
Citizens cannot be indebted to the government for mail service when it is federal restrictions that prohibit a far wider array of private services .
Public schools
Others will insist that people are indebted to government for public schools .
But the parents of most children pay more in taxes than government spends educating their kids .
Besides , despite sharp increases in government spending for education in the last 15 years , American high - school students score at the rock bottom in math and science compared with students in other countries .
The government routinely effectively confiscates parents ’ money to pay for schools and then fails to educate their kids , yet faces no liability for its de facto breach of implied contract .
An investigation by the New Jersey State Department of Education concluded ,  The Newark School District has been at best flagrantly delinquent and at worst deceptive in discharging its obligations to the children enrolled in public schools . 
Public high schools graduate an estimated 700,000 functionally illiterate teenagers each year .
Regardless of how badly school officials fail to serve students , parents are left no recourse but to file complaints with the same unresponsive bureaucracy .
As law professor Judith Berliner Cohen observed ,
No plaintiff to date has been able to convince a court that a school owes him or her any more than a chair in a classroom .  …
Insofar as they have been deluded  into believing that it is not necessary to find alternate means of education , the students are arguably worse off than they otherwise would have been .
Without quasi- monopoly public schools , a far more extensive network of private schools would be available — schools that would be responsive to parents ’ desire for their children to learn .
The rapid spread of the home - schooling movement ( whose students consistently outscore public - school students on standardized tests ) vivifies how parents can do better on their own .
Government - provided roads
Nor are citizens indebted to government for providing goods such as roads .
Despite heavy federal taxes levied on gas buyers , politicians are allowing more and more of the Interstate Highway System to deteriorate to Third World road conditions .
Roughly three - fifths of all interstate highways are in poor or mediocre condition , according to the Federal Highway Administration .
Drivers pay more than $ 140 billion in gas taxes each year , but only about half of that money is actually spent on maintaining and building roads ; the rest is spent on other political wish lists .
Roads are a good example of the contempt that government shows for citizens in the services it forces them to finance .
As road expert and author Gabriel Roth observed , U.S. roads suffer from the typical command economy characteristics : poor maintenance , congestion , and insensitivity to consumer needs .
Because traffic jams cost government employees nothing , government agencies scorn sound traffic - control measures .
Federal Highway Administration traffic - safety engineers Samuel Tignor and Davey Warren concluded in a 1990 study that most speed zones were posted 15 m.p.h. below the maximum safe speed ; that , on average , speed limits are set too low to be accepted as reasonable by most drivers , and that the posted speeds make violators out of motorists who drive reasonably and safely . 
Politicians profit from unnecessarily low speed limits because of the increase in the number of drivers eligible for speeding tickets .
Accidents and traffic jams result from policemen ’s fixation on ticketing drivers who pose no threat to public safety .
Will Rogers suggested long ago ,  The way to deal with traffic congestion is to have business provide the roads and government the cars . 
But though this has n’t been done , politicians still expect thanks from citizens , despite potholes as far as the eye can see .
Police protection
Do citizens owe a vast debt to the state for keeping the peace ?
Many big -city police departments have effectively abandoned serious efforts to solve robberies and other cases of nonlethal violence ; the District of Columbia police , for instance , make arrests in fewer than 10 percent of burglaries and robberies .
But D.C. police have set records for arresting citizens detected drinking alcohol on their front porches .
They have also been valiant in cracking down on drivers with unfastened seatbelts .
Insofar as government prohibits people from owning or carrying weapons for self - defense , it is scant consolation that a policeman arrives after the crime to chalk off the body .
There are more than twice as many private security guards as uniformed policemen in the United States .
More citizens than ever before are living in gated communities or relying on home alarm systems .
Private citizens use guns to defend themselves more than 2 million times a year , according to Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck .
After comparing the effects of more people carrying guns with other popular reforms , economist John Lott concluded that of all the methods studied so far by economists , the carrying of concealed handguns appears to be the most cost - effective method for reducing crime . 
Military defense
The one area in which it is most plausible that government could provide a unique service is national defense .
However , if a government busies itself making enemies , and then praises itself for pledging to protect citizens from the enemies it makes , there is less than a transcendent benefit .
The war in Iraq will very likely cost Americans more than a trillion dollars — a high price for Bush ’s May 1 , 2003 , victory strut aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln .
What have politicians given to the citizenry that they did not originally take from them ?
This is the bottom line that must permeate all thinking about the goods  or services  that government provides to the citizenry .
In reality , in the vast majority of cases , politicians give back far less in value than they take .
The more the government takes , the less the citizen owes to the government .
Insofar as the government takes from the citizen more than it renders to the citizen , the citizen owes the state the same contempt that he would have for any other con artist .
Citizens cannot be indebted to the state for any political promise that the government fails to fulfill — just as any citizen ’s obligation to fulfill a private contract is dissolved by the other party ’s failure to fulfill his obligations .
Nor can people owe obedience to government for any activity that the people could have done better themselves .
It is the government that owes obedience to the citizens , rather than citizens who owe obedience to the government .
But the bigger government becomes , the more difficult it is to make it heel .

The Patent Reform Act Of 2007
Section - By - Section
Sec. 1 . Short Title ; Table of Contents .
This Act may be cited as the Patent Reform Act of 2007 .
Sec. 2 . Reference to Title 35 , United States Code .
All references to sections are to title 35 , United States Code .
Sec. 3 . Right of the First Inventor to File .
In general . —
The United States stands alone among Nations that grant patents in giving priority for a patent to the first inventor , as opposed to the first to file a patent application for a claimed invention .
The result is a lack of international consistency , and a complex and costly system in the United States to determine inventors ’ rights .
The United States Patent Office ( “ USPTO ” ) currently uses an interference proceeding to determine which party was first to “ invent ” the claimed invention , where competing claims arise .
The determination is intensely fact - specific and costly to resolve .
By contrast , a first - to - file system injects needed clarity and certainty into the system .
This section converts the United States ’ patent system into a first - to - file system , giving priority to the earlier - filed application for a claimed invention .
Interference proceedings are replaced with a derivation proceeding to determine whether the applicant of an earlier - filed application was not the proper applicant for the claimed invention – such a proceeding will be faster and less expensive than were interference proceedings .
This section also encourages the sharing of information by providing a grace period for publicly disclosing the subject matter of the claimed invention , without losing priority .
Specifically , this section makes the following amendments to implement the first - to - file system :
Subsection ( a ) . – § 100 is amended to include definitions for terms necessary for the conversion to first - to - file .
Subsections ( b ) & ( c ) . – § 102 is replaced and § 103 is amended , as follows .
A patent may not issue for a claimed invention if the invention was patented , described in printed material , or in public use ( 1 ) more than a year before the filing date or ( 2 ) anytime prior to the filing date if not through disclosure by the inventor or joint inventor .
A patent also may not be issued if the claimed invention was described in a patent or patent application by another inventor filed prior to the filing date of the claimed invention .
A grace period is provided for an inventor or joint inventor that discloses the subject matter of the claimed invention .
Further , an exception is made for claiming an invention if the subject matter previously disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint invention or if the subject matter was owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person .
The CREATE Act is preserved by including an exception for subject matter of a claimed invention made by parties to a joint research agreement .
Subsections ( d ) & ( e ) . – § 104 ( requirements for inventions made abroad ) and § 157 ( statutory invention registration ) are repealed , as part of the transition to first - to - file .
Subsection ( f ) . – Amends § 120 related to filing dates to conform with the CREATE Act .
Subsection ( g ) . – Makes various conforming amendments for first - to - file transition .
Subsections ( h ) , ( i ) & ( j ) .
– Repeals the interference proceeding authorized in § 291 and creates a new “ derivation proceeding ” in § 135 ( a ) , designed to determine the inventor with the right to file an application on a claimed invention .
An applicant requesting a derivation proceeding must set forth the basis for finding that an earlier applicant derived the claimed invention and without authorization filed an application claiming such invention .
The request must be filed within 12 months of the date of first publication of an application for a claim that is substantially the same as the claimed invention .
The party making the request ( 1 ) must have filed an application not later than 18 months after the effective filing date of the opposing application or patent and ( 2 ) must not have filed an application , within one year of the earliest effective filing date of the application , containing a claim that is substantially the same as the invention claimed in the earlier filing application .
The Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( the “ Board ” ) shall determine the right to patent and issue a final decision thereon .
Decisions of the Board , in general , may be appealed to the Federal Circuit .
Sec. 4 . Inventor ’s Oath or Declaration .
In general . —
The section streamlines the requirement that the inventor submit an oath as part of a patent application .
An applicant may submit a substitute statement in lieu of the inventor ’s oath in certain circumstances , including if the inventor is unable or unwilling to make the oath .
Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will not be a basis for invalidity or unenforceability of the patent if the failure is remedied by a supplemental and corrected statement .
An assignee of an invention , or a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest , may file an application for the patent .
Sec. 5 . Remedies for Infringement and Affirmative Defenses Thereto .
Relationship of Damages to Improvements over the Prior Art. —
As products have become more complex , often involving hundreds or even thousands of patented aspects , litigation has not reliably produced damages awards in infringement cases that correspond to the value of the infringed patent .
This section , therefore , preserves the current rule that mandates that a damages award shall not be less than a “ reasonable royalty ” for the infringed patent , and further requires the court to conduct an analysis to ensure that , when a “ reasonable royalty ” is the award , it reflects only the economic value of the patent ’s “ specific contribution over the prior art ” , i.e. the truly new “ thing ” that the patent reflects .
The court also has to identify the factors that will be considered in determining a reasonable royalty , ensuring that the record is clear on what the judge or jury looked at in awarding damages .
The court must also consider any non-exclusive marketplace licensing of the invention , if there is such a history , in determining a reasonable royalty .
Finally , the court is instructed to consider any other relevant law , which is included to ensure that the significant body of judge - made law on the topic of damages awards in infringement cases is preserved .
Willful infringement .—
A willful infringer of a patent is liable for treble damages .
The current definition of willful infringement , however , perversely discourages parties from reviewing issued patents to determine whether a patent exists .
This section provides that a court may only find willful infringement if the patent owner shows , by clear and convincing evidence , that ( 1 ) the infringer , after receiving written notice from the patentee , performed one of the acts of infringement , ( 2 ) the infringer intentionally copied the patented invention with knowledge that it was patented , or ( 3 ) after having been found by a court to have infringed a patent , the infringer engaged in conduct that again infringed on the same patent .
An allegation of willfulness is subject to a “ good faith ” defense .
Prior user rights .—
The defense to infringement for patents involving a “ method of doing or conducting business ” based on the alleged infringer ’s having reduced the subject matter to practice one year prior to the filing date is amended to apply to all patents and require only that the subject matter be commercially used ( or substantial preparations be made for commercial use ) prior to the effective filing date of the claimed invention .
Sec. 6 . Post - Grant Procedures .
In general . —
After a patent issues , a party seeking to challenge the validity and enforceability of the patent has two avenues under current law : by reexamination proceeding at the USPTO or by litigation in federal district court .
The former is used sparingly and is considered not very effective ; the latter , district court litigation , is unwieldy and expensive .
This section therefore creates a new , post - grant review that provides an effective and efficient system for considering challenges to the validity of patents .
Addressing concerns that a post - grant review procedure could be abused by cancellation petitioners , this section requires the Director to prescribe rules for abuse of discovery or improper use of the proceeding .
In addition , it bars successive petitions in either the first or second window , and prohibits a party from reasserting claims in court that it raised in post - grant review .
Reexamination procedures .—
Amends the reexamination procedures of § 303 ( a ) to provide that , within three months of a request for reexamination of a patent by the patent owner , or at any time on the Director ’s own initiative , the Director may determine whether a substantial new question of patentability is raised by patents discovered by him or cited by any other person .
Post - grant review procedures . —
§ 321. – Permits a person who is not the patent owner to file a “ petition for cancellation ” before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board based on any ground that might be raised under section 282 ( a ) ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .
The Director shall establish fees to be paid by the person requesting the proceeding .
§ 322 . –
The petition for cancellation can only be filed ( 1 ) within 12 months of the patent ’s issue or reissue ( known as the “ first window ” ) , or ( 2 ) if there is substantial reason to believe that the continued existence of the challenged claim is likely to cause the petitioner significant economic harm , the petitioner has received notice from the patent holder alleging infringement by the petition , or the patent owner consents to the proceeding in writing ( known as the “ second window ” ) .
§ 323 . – Certain procedures are required , including setting forth the basis for the petition .
§ 324 . – Successive petitions under either the first or second window are prohibited , unless the patent owner consents in writing .
§ 325 . – The Director may not institute a post - grant review proceeding unless the Director determines that the information presented provides sufficient grounds to proceed .
§ 326 . – The Director shall establish rules and standards for post - grant review , which should result in a final decision within 12 months .
Rules for discovery may , and sanctions for abuse of process shall , be prescribed by the Director .

The Board is charged with reviewing adverse decisions of examiners upon applications and reexamination proceedings , determining priority and patentability , and presiding over the new post - grant review proceedings .
Sec. 8 . Study and Report on Reexamination Proceedings .
The Director shall , not later than 3 years after the date of enactment , conduct a study on the effectiveness of the different forms of review under title 35 , and submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the results of the study , along with any suggested amendments .
Sec. 9 . Submissions by Third Parties and Other Quality Enhancements .
In general . —
This section is designed to improve patent quality by creating a mechanism for third parties with knowledge of the subject matter of a claimed invention to submit relevant information about prior art to the USPTO .
Subsection ( a ) . – § 122 ( b ) ( 2 ) , which provides confidentiality to patent applications for an applicant who is not filing in another country , is repealed .
Subsection ( b ) . – Creates a mechanism in § 122 for third parties to submit timely , pre-issuance information relevant to the examination of the application .
Sec. 10 . Venue and Jurisdiction .
In general . —
This section addresses two litigation issues unique to the patent world .
Subsection ( a ) deals with venue .
A venue section specific to patent infringement cases exists in 28 U.S.C. § 1400 ( b ) .
A change in the general venue provision , 28 U.S.C. § 1391 , was later read into the patent venue provision .
The result has been forum shopping , which this subsection addresses .
Subsection ( b ) makes patent reform litigation more efficient by providing the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over interlocutory orders in what have become known as Markman orders , in which the district court construes claims of a patent .
The contours of the claim are crucial to resolution of the patent litigation , and authorizing interlocutory appeals will add predictability at an earlier stage of litigation .
Subsection ( a ) . –
The jurisdiction and venue provision for patent cases is amended to specify that any action brought related to patents , other than an action for declaratory judgment or seeking review of a decision of the Board , must be brought in the district where either party resides or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular place of business .
For purposes of this section , a corporation resides either where its principal place of business is located or where it is incorporated .
Subsection ( b ) . – The Federal Circuit is given jurisdiction over interlocutory orders regarding claim constructions .
Sec. 11 . Regulatory Authority .
The Director is granted rulemaking authority “ to carry out the provisions of this title or any other law applicable ” to the PTO or that is necessary to govern the operation and organization of the office .
Sec. 12 . Technical Amendments .
Sec. 13 . Effective Date .
Except as otherwise provided , this Act takes effect 12 months after the date of enactment and applies to any patent issued on or after that effective date .
Well a break from the norm today guys in that this really is n't a recipe that i would expect any of you to ever make .
Since i started this site I 've had a couple of requests to send sample videos to TV execs for commisioning a TV series .
They gave me the brief that i could cook anything i wanted so instead of doing something very fancy i thought i'd be a real smart ass and make a cheese sandwich .
The logic being that if I could make that sound interesting then i could make anything sound interesting !
On the other hand they could see the video and think that I 'm a nutcase who needs locking up , you decide for yourself !!
Ingredients
You must be joking right ?
When I was young , my mother used to say that however things were at midnight on New Year ’s Eve , that was how they would be for the rest of the year .
And so , she would push us all to clean up , tidy up ourselves and the house before that magic stroke of midnight .
Of course , it never really worked , because there is no special magic in the moment when a goal is achieved or even set .
The only grain of truth in my mother ’s midnight madness is this : how you do anything is how you do everything .
Therefore , the life you ’re living at midnight on New Year ’s Eve is likely the same life that you ’ll be living the rest of the year .
In my mother ’s case – and all too often in mine – that means being in the midst of some cycle between letting things go and going all out to bring them back in line .
So , yes , how things are on New Year ’s Eve is how they ’ll be all year , unless you actually change something .
As I ’ve suggested in previous articles , however , most behaviors are not changed by simple decisions , and not all decisions are created equal .
A resolution to change a damaging behavior for the sake of a positive benefit is the most shallow kind of decision and the quickest to collapse in the face of pressure .
Tonight , though , I do n’t want to get into a bunch of stuff about the decision parts of change .
I ’ve written a lot about that already , and still have more to write in the future .
What I particularly want to write about tonight , before the magic hour , is this simple but radical truth : life is every moment .
In “ The Island Within ” , I wrote about the old saw that it ’s “ the journey , not the destination . ”
I ’ve never really liked that saying , as I ’m not somebody who especially likes journeys .
Frankly , I ca n’t wait till we have practical teleportation !
So I ’ve been trying to come up with a better way to express my new understanding about the nature and quality of life , and so here is my working hypothesis .
Life is every moment .
There is no future moment at which we will be fulfilled .
Every setback and every victory is just one moment .
Imagination and memory allow you to “ copy ” those moments into other moments , but the moment itself stands alone .
The thoughts I play back or project in this moment determine my experience now , in this moment , and my entire life is an ongoing series of such moments .
In this way , I literally create my entire life from my habits of thought and behavior .
In the absence of changes to the contrary , I will continue to play out the same dramas over and over again in my life – and how many people do you know who are doing the same ?
In this moment , I feel frustrated because I do n’t know how to say what I really mean .
It ’s like waking up and realizing , ohmygod , I ’m actually running this crazy show called life .
Sort of like in the movie The Truman Show , only in reverse .
Maybe more like Vanilla Sky or The Matrix .
Like discovering the “ man behind the curtain ” is you .
But that ’s a sidetrack that does n’t help me explain the idea , really .
Let me try another metaphor : life is a fractal , repeating the same theme at an infinite number of levels , controlled by the equation of your habitual thoughts .
This is not a mystical concept ; even if you view it as a purely psychological and subjective phenomenon , it works .
How you do anything , is how you do everything
Maybe an example will help .
I tend to do things in batches .
Laundry and dishes tend to pile up until they reach a certain critical level , and I then feel stressed and do them .
At its most fundamental level , this behavior is the consequence of a concept in my mind .
Not a specific concept about dishes or laundry or whatever , but a general set of concepts about time and accomplishment .
To be more specific , I seem to believe on some level that there exists some future time that will be a “ good ” time to do these things – and also that until I “ have to ” do them , I “ do n’t have to ” do them .
These two simple concepts are the equations that control the expansion of the fractal pattern as it unfolds itself in every moment of my life .
Knowing that , it ’s not hard to see that somebody who believes those things is going to lead a rather stressful life .
The things he or she “ does n’t have to ” do yet will produce a constant level of moderate stress , punctuated by occasional periods of high stress followed by collapse and a brief period of relief .
Of course , during the relief period , it then seems like “ too much trouble ” to keep things in their caught - up state , especially since you ’ve so recently worked so hard on them .
And so the cycle begins again ; the fractal loops back on itself , not quite touching the places where it was before , but just filling more and more space in your life as it zigzags around again , just different enough to keep you from noticing that nothing is really changing .
A key characteristic of these fractal beliefs is that they are self - sustaining .
A person who ’s stuck in a fractal will always create the same pattern whenever they try to break out of it !
In my case , for example , I attempt to break the cycle of “ being behind ” by “ getting ahead ” .
That is , by trying to work extra hard on the things that I “ have to ” do , so that I will then be “ caught up ” .
But this is n’t really a change !
It ’s just running around the same track .
It ’s like when my friend Ty and I were talking about trying to get better at shifting from thought to action , and I said , “ Yeah , I need to think about some more ways to do that , ” cracking both of us up at the irony of the statement .
The Process is the Product
Every problem and non-problem in your life is exactly like this .
You are stably stuck in whatever state you ’re in because it ’s a side - effect of whatever process you are doing .
You can not change your state , any more than I can “ catch up ” from “ putting things off ” – catching up is just the flip side of putting them off ; it ’s described by the same equations .
It only looks like it ’s something different .
Another example : weight loss .
In the roughly three weeks since I wrote about Seth Roberts ‘s breakthrough theory linking the flavor - calorie association to the body ’s “ set point ” for fat accumulation , I ’ve lost just under 6 pounds by making some very minor adjustments to my diet .
However , I probably would n’t have persisted for this long if I had n’t done one very important additional thing .
I ’ve been tracking my weight using the exponential smoothing algorithm described in The Hacker ’s Diet .
This tool makes it easier to see a steady drop in weight even on days when the scale fluctuates up a few pounds .
It helped shift my mental focus from “ losing N pounds ” to “ losing a few tenths of a pound a day ” .
Weight , like life , is in every moment .
If you look , you will see that everything is in every moment .
The circumstances of your life are a direct reflection of the equations that guide your behavior in each moment , and they are both simpler ( in their expression ) and more complex ( in their realization ) than you would ever have believed .
The complexity of these patterns ’ realization disguises their simplicity , and makes us believe that one moment is different than another .
We rationalize that “ this time ” will be different , but it will not be different unless we are different , and we will only be different if we are different in every moment .
This is why shallow resolutions fail ; our conscious minds are entirely too flighty and easily distracted to focus on behaving differently in every single moment of every single day .
To succeed , we need to get more of our minds involved , by changing the fundamental equations beneath our behaviors .
For example , by changing the flavor factor in my diet , I ’ve leveraged other levels of mind so that I do n’t need to take any conscious actions to continue losing weight , because my body has adjusted my appetite .
In the same way , changing our fundamental beliefs about life makes behavior change more automatic .
There ’s No Such Thing As “ Going To ”
But the first step is to realize that whenever you say “ I ’m going to ” , you ’re lying .
There is no such thing as starting , and no such thing as stopping .
The difference , for example , between “ quitting smoking ” and “ being a non-smoker ” is immense .
It is literally a quantum leap ; there is no way to gradually change an axiomatic equation about your behavior .
( Or maybe there is , but why would you want one ? )
When your equations change , so do you , and so does your life , because the equations determine your outlook and response to everything that happens .
They determine what your decisions and actions will be when you ’re not consciously paying close attention to them .
Think of them as the rules you ’ve given your administrative assistant for how things should be done when you ’re busy .
Your conscious mind can barge in and micromanage all you want , but sooner or later you wo n’t be there and your “ staff ” will play by the established rules of your deepest beliefs , not by the rules of some self - improvement program you ’ve consciously embarked upon .
The great thing about this , though , is that if you change the rules , your “ staff ” starts acting on them pretty much at once , as happened with my Self 2.0 change .
It also means you should n’t worry if your conscious attempts at self - improvement have failed before or are failing now ; you may be the “ boss ” of you , but you wo n’t really succeed in changing your “ organization ” without changing the system – what gets rewarded and what gets punished .
No , I do n’t mean that you need to use behavioral conditioning .
It might work , but it ’s a pain to set up and manage .
It ’s micromanaging yourself .
Effective managers can change an organization just by changing what gets measured and how the scores are calculated .
When you begin to manage your mind , you ’ll see that the fractal equations controlling your “ organization ” are the rules that assign values to outcomes .
For example , if you put something off , is it to avoid something ?
Gain something ?
What ?
What do you perceive as the value of the thing you ’re avoiding ?
In addition to these direct value - assignment rules , your beliefs about what is possibile , and about the relationship between your actions and their consequences , will also affect how you “ score ” a candidate action .
All your day - to - day decisions get made based on weighted scores on a variety of metrics .
You probably have social metrics that evaluate your actions in terms of how other people will perceive you , as well as metrics for fear , convenience , pleasure , rebellion , and justabout anything else that might be important for you to get or avoid .
The Real Reason Your Resolutions Do n’t Stick
So , when you think about your “ resolutions ” , consider your existing metrics carefully .
The dirty little secret about our “ problems ” is this : whatever it is we ’re doing now is exactly what our current values say we should be doing in the moment when we do it .
Our want of change is just our conscious mind trying to have its cake and eat it too ; satisfy one set of values without having to give up another .
This is why congruent decisions are absolutely essential to change .
You have to be willing to give up whatever goodies you ’re getting from your “ misbehavior ” – either you change the rules such that you no longer value what you used to get , or you change them such that you actually value something else more .
So , if you want to change something in 2006 ( or whatever year you ’re reading this in ) , start by realizing that your life does n’t lie .
In every moment your experience of life reflects the balance of whatever your real values are .
Do n’t blame life , and do n’t blame yourself – either one is just shooting the messenger .
Just investigate what the messenger has to say , and then you can go about the real process of change : shifting your values to produce the life you want , in every moment .
Windmill tilting time again I ’m afraid .
Blame chromatic and David A. Black .
What is it that characterizes domain specific languages ?
Before you trot out something like “ Programs written in them read like domain experts talk ” , take a look at some examples of code written in domain specific languages :

Take the Drill - Baby - Drill Challenge : Can You Guess Right ?
You know the story .
When Obama took office :
Gasoline cost $ 1.95 / gallon and oil , $ 45
But now ( 12/9/2014 )
Gasoline costs $ 2.67 / gallon and oil , $ 65
Incredible .
And we “ understand ” — because our smart and honest politicians explained it to us , like so …
We should ’ve drilled .
But Obama and his EPA stopped us .
So the supply of oil went down .
And , that pushes the price up , and high oil prices cause high gas prices .
If we had drilled , supply would be up and the price would be down .
Maybe down to $ 1.00 / gal like under Clinton ( March 1999 ) .
So I dare you to guess which Obama scenario on the graph above is correct .
Do n’t cheat .
Guess before you click to see the answer .
Do n’t believe it ? —
See for yourself where the data comes from .
Shocking but true :
We did “ drill baby drill ” — like never before .
Obama did n’t stop us .
Just ask the upset Sierra Club .
The US supply of oil went up the most since 1970 .
Under Obama , drilling has skyrocketed as never before , and the price of gas went from $ 1.95 to $ 3.95 ( April 1 , 2012 ) .
There ’s a reason .
More surprising facts :
METAIRIE , La. , July 16 — Speaking for the first time since he acknowledged a connection to the so - called D.C. Madam a week ago , Senator David Vitter of Louisiana appeared briefly before reporters here Monday to apologize again and attack “ political enemies ” he said had spread falsehoods about him .
Mr. Vitter dropped out of public view a week ago after admitting that his phone number had appeared in a list of clients ’ numbers kept by Deborah Jeane Palfrey , who is accused of running a prostitution ring in Washington .
He missed major votes on Iraq in the Senate and made no public appearances , even as accounts of other relationships with prostitutes multiplied in the New Orleans news media .
After his initial apology , a woman convicted of running a brothel on Canal Street said Mr. Vitter had been a client , and another woman , identified by The New Orleans Times - Picayune as a prostitute named Wendy Cortez , came forward to say that she , too , had had a relationship with him when the senator was in the State Legislature in the 1990s .
These reports echoed longstanding rumors in Louisiana — which Mr. Vitter had vehemently rejected in the past — that he had had encounters with prostitutes .
Mariah Carey ’s Saudi Arabia Album Covers
Images purporting to show Saudi Arabian versions of Mariah Carey 's album covers have recently appeared on the web .
Mediabum.com says that " Because of the laws over there her album covers had to be touched up to be made less sexy . "
Maybe .
It sounds like something that would be done in Saudi Arabia .
However , the lack of a clear source for these images makes me suspicious .
They could equally well have been created by somebody playing around with photoshop .
( And why is there no arabic script on these Saudi Arabian covers ? )
( And incidentally , I just read that Mariah Carey has 17 Number One singles , tying the number that Elvis had .
This is odd because I 'm unable to name a single song by her .
With 17 # 1 songs , I figured I 'd know at least one of them . )
Do n't feel bad , I would n't know that was Mariah Carey if ya had n't said so .
Posted by Citizen Premier in spite of public outcry on Thu Dec 22 , 2005 at 11:34 PM
suprisingly ... elvis died before i was born ... so i cant name one of his # 1 singles too .
i still respect the guy for his achievements

I can definitly believe this .
I was stationed in Qatar during the first half of 2003 , and I went to a mall over there .
Well , in the CD store , they had American music , and it was in English .
( not sure about Saudi , but there 's quite a bit of British citizens in Qatar ) Anyway , tons of cd's had different covers on them , to make them less " sexy " I guess you could say .
If it was photoshopped , it was probably done on purpose by the companies who sell the cd's .

My mother worked at a distribution centre of a mail order firm .
She says she spent hours with a marker pen blacking out women's bare arms and legs , crucifixes and bottles of alcohol in catalogues bound for Saudi and places with similar restrictions .
Women 's underwear pages were ripped out completely .

The website is extremely slow .
In the above images the retouching looks very poor , but that does n't necessarily mean the images are hoaxes , just that they were done cheaply , and they might be semi-official bootlegs .
My personal feeling is that if Island records was going to do this kind of thing it would be quicker and more effective to find simply crop out Mariah 's body and zoom in on her face .
Indeed , the majority of the album covers on the front page of Megastar use this format ; they are close - ups of the artist 's faces .
And the Arabic music CDs I have seen are much the same , close - ups of people 's face .
I assume the album covers were originally done with Photoshop , and it would be the work of a moment to modify them .
I also assume it would be cheaper to print off a few thousand CD booklets than it would be to hire some temps to airbrush the booklets .
Nonetheless , reading through :
http://users.aol.com/saudijobs/detail.html
( might not work in Mozilla ) it does seem reasonable that Mariah 's arms and legs would be covered up ; i.e. it seems reasonable that this would happen in Saudi Arabia , not that it seems reasonable per se .
Famously , women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia , not even tourists .
There actually is a Saudi Arabian music store called Megastar , and it does sell Western CDs although I could n't find any Mariah Carey ones :

My impression is that , regardless of the album covers , the content of Mariah Carey 's recordings ( like that of many other Western pop stars ) is not the type of thing the Saudi censors would be likely to permit .
Maybe you can get get away with selling such records in English ( as opposed to Arabic ) , though .

Actually , I think she looks better in the covered up pictures .
She looks like a slut in the real ones .
I 've never been impressed with her .
I find her extremely annoying .
I agree with you Alex , I find it hard to believe she 's had that many No.1 hits , although I can recall a few of them that I 'd like to forget .
Posted by Glamcat on Fri Dec 23 , 2005 at 08:20 PM
You would think that if the record commpanies had changed it , that the photoshopped pics would be better quality , or that they would use different covers for the Saudi niece of the market .

I worked for Lockheed in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia for 5 years .
I can attest to the fact that the cd covers are altered , but the pics shown here are way too detailed .
99.9 % of the time , the " offending " body part or object was just blacked out with a permanent magic marker .
No one there would take the time to put any effort into making the " offending " item seem like part of the picture .
People working for the " mutawah " ( religious police ) would do this afetr the product arrived in country .

It seems very odd that altering these for such a conservative culture would still leave the skin - tight effect .
Surely deliniated breasts are offensive even if the garment seems to have a high neck and long sleeves ?

I live in Saudi Arabia , although I am a British citizen .
I am not sure if the Mariah Carey CD covers are genuine , but the government over hear does insist that Cd covers , as well as videos , books and magazines , to name but a few , have to be " cleaned up " .
Even boxes containing swimming accessories have to have any women in swim suits blacked out .
I think the photos are true

Everyone should admire , if not respect Mariah Carey 's artistic abilities .
She has written all of her number ones with the exception of " I 'll be there " Elvis can't claim that .
She also releases one CD every year , or every couple of years , when in older times they were released almost quarterly .
Another thing to realize is that she gained acclaim solely on her voice , where as Elvis had the hip shaking and the Beatles had the Novelty of being foreign .
It was only AFTER her first and second album that she began touring and concerts and things like that .
And it was not until 1997 , a full 7 years after her premire than she started dressing " sexier " .
So any claims that detract from her artistic ability have to be refuted .
She has had no formal vocal training , and yet writes and performs hit after hit .
She also has the beatles and Elvis beat as far as talent goes .
Let 's be honest , could any of the beatles outsing her ?
Is Elvis ' voice better than Mariah's ?
The answer is a resounding HELL NO .
So when it comes to pitting her with these people , she more than deserves her rank as legendary .
Some of Elvis hits were posthumous .. this is not to say that Elvis and the Beatles are n't incredible , but give her credit .
Let 's not forget the fact that not only is she black , but she 's mixed too .
Go Mariah ...

People there is no need to be abusive .
Whether or not you like her music is not what this is about .
It is about whether the Saudis change cd covers , and yes they do , I live in Saudi .
As for the insults I find them totally unacceptable , if you had decent vocabularies you would n't need to resort to crude language .

I 'm a designer by trade , and these are clearly fakes .
The image artifacts caused by photographing the design are identical in both versions .
the only changes are :
1. editing of clothing
2. adding / subtracting fold lines

this picture of a Britney Spears album cover .
Compared with the On the " megastar " website above , I noticedCompared with the original picture , a less revealing shirt has obviously been photoshopped in , although it was done slightly better than the Mariah Carey covers .
So there you go .

I have to admit , Mariah does look a lot better when she is covered .
Though im not a fan , she does n't need to show the amount of skin she does show , she has a great voice

These covers are genuine .

I can attest to the fact that the cd covers are altered , but the pics shown here are way too detailed .
99.9 % of the time , the " offending " body part or object was just blacked out with a permanent magic marker .
No one there would take the time to put any effort into making the " offending " item seem like part of the picture .

Well , the REAL Mariah Carey album covers are almost completely Photoshop paintings anyway .
The only difference is that they 're BETTER paintings than these Saudi coverups .
Posted by rokusan on Sun Apr 22 , 2007 at 05:56 AM
Yes , Mariah Carey has had that many number one singles .
She 's an incredibly talented singer with an 8 octave range , although much of the material she performs is quite forgettable and for some reason sounds uninspiring .
She has sold more records than the previous queen of pop / soul ( Diana Ross ) , however I do n't think she 's sold more records than Madonna .
Madonna is currently the queen as fas as record sales go .
The only thing I find difficult to believe about these retouching jobs is how bad they are .
They look pretty cheesy , but I can definitely imagine a country like Saudi Arabia only permitting album covers with subdued or altered graphics of the originals

I was once a regular customer of the Megastar store here in Jeddah Saudi Arabia .
It does sell Western Music like Ashley Pomeroy said .
The store was located in Heraa Mall .
The Best of wham tape I had right now was actually manufactured by one of Megastar 's companies here in Saudi Arabia .

June 18 , 2007  --
All of us have those days at the office -- you know , the ones where you break a heel , or spill coffee all over yourself , or forget about an important meeting .
Well , the next time you feel like Alexander in Judith Viorst 's " Alexander and the Terrible , Horrible , No - Good , Very Bad Day , " just think of Popular Science 's Top 10 Worst Jobs in Science and be thankful that you 're not the person analyzing maggots on decaying bodies , neutering wild elephants or sailing the high seas in search of whale feces .
" When you ask these people about their work , they do n't think of themselves as having bad jobs .
They think it 's fascinating and they can't even imagine why anyone would think otherwise , " Popular Science deputy editor Jake Ward told ABC News .
" That 's part of why they 're so good at it , they just bring a level of objective interest to their work that makes them great at it . "
For the past four years , his magazine has scanned labs , morgues , sewers and even institutes of higher learning across the United States to compile its annual list of the year 's Worst Jobs in Science .
These careers require not only an iron stomach , but also an incredible amount of precision , dedication and passion .
So , what exactly are this year 's most unappealing professions ?
Here 's the list , along with Ward 's assessment of what it takes to complete these careers .
10 . Whale - Feces Researcher : Talk about a job that " stinks . "
With help from a few well - trained sniffer dogs , Rosalind Rolland , a senior researcher at the New England Aquarium based in Boston , spends her days in Nova Scotia 's Bay of Fundy tracking elusive right whales and scooping up their excrement in order to bring it back to her lab and run tests on it .
" The difficulty of working with an endangered species of whale like the right whale is that you can't exactly kill it and take it apart , " said Ward .
" You have to learn about its insides any way you can , so with their feces , you can learn about bio - toxins in their system , you can learn whether they are pregnant , you can learn about genetics and their lineage , and you can tell individuals apart by gender , by group , by mother and daughter .
It 's almost as good as dissecting a whale . "
Thanks to Rolland 's data , scientists have gained invaluable information about the right whale species -- their environment , their mating habits , and even their stress levels .
9. Forensic Entomologist :
As a result of the success of such television shows as " CSI , " the forensics field has undergone a dramatic overhaul in the eyes of the public .
But do n't be fooled , forensic entomology is not for the faint of heart , the squeamish , nor the insectophobic .
These scientists spend their days basking in the florescent light of the city or county morgue analyzing bugs on decaying corpses .
They check maggots , larvae , blowflies and anything that breeds off of decaying human flesh in order to determine the " postmortem interval , " or the gap between the time of death and time of the body 's discovery .
" It 's incredibly gross , " Ward said .
" The people who handle [ forensic entomology ] are a whole other species of human , as far as I can tell , but these people see the grossest thing you can see , the most horrifying thing you can see , and it just leads them into their career , they love it and move forward into it so it 's just amazing to watch . "
8. Olympic Drug Tester :
Although they do not have to endure the smell of whale waste or the sight of decaying flesh , professional athletics drug testers are constantly stuck in a tough position .
" If you bust an athlete , you are ruining their career , you are up - ending their countries ' prospects for gold , but , if you do n't nail them and you do n't do your job properly , you get absolutely nailed in the media .
It 's just a lose - lose situation for these guys , " Ward explained .
Aside from constantly feeling like a tattle - tale , Olympic drug testers are also expected to keep up to speed on the ever changing performance enhancing supplements .
" Drug testers are always going to be behind , are always going to be playing catch - up , so it 's a very , very frustrating job , " he said .
7. Gravity Research Subject :
One of the first things every kid learns at camp is sleeping overnight with your head downhill leads to one major headache .
Now imagine getting paid to spend three weeks lying perfectly still at a negative 6 degree angle .
Ouch .
Well , that is exactly what researchers at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston are asking test subjects to do , as a way of simulating the effects of weightlessness on the human body .
" As the blood rushes to their heads , over the course of that time , they get the puffy face , the shifted organs , all the symptoms of weightlessness which allows these researches to find out more about it , " Ward said .
" Not only are they stuck in that position , they are subjected to a centrifugal test … every day they are spun around to get blood down to their feet and get the effects of heavy G [ forces ] . "
But the job is not totally without its perks .
They endure weeks of excruciating pain and discomfort , but NASA 's gravity guinea pigs are handsomely rewarded with a $ 6,000 pay day .
6. Microsoft Security Grunt :
These are the people behind the Microsoft Security Response Center , who sift through the approximately 100,000 e-mails a year sent to secure@microsoft.com .
Once compared to the last line of defense at the Alamo , these techies ward off hackers , repair kinks in each of Microsoft 's bestselling products , from Windows to Internet Explorer and Office , and , generally , protect the company from its many foes .
" To the millions of hacker 's around the world , Microsoft is like the Death Star in ' Star Wars ' and they see themselves as the rebel force .
So they 'll do anything to exploit security loopholes , get in there and worm something in there , so these guys are under assault all the time , " said Ward .
5. Coursework Carcass Preparer : Picture a ninth grade biology class , and it 's frog dissection day .
Odds are you can still smell the formaldehyde .
Now imagine spending your entire career working in those fumes .
That is exactly how coursework carcasses preparers spend their days -- killing , pickling , and bottling everything from frogs and fetal pigs to cats , pigeons and even sharks .
" A biological supply preparer is responsible for every frog or snake you 've ever cut apart in biology class , " said Ward .
" It 's definitely suited to a particular kind of person .
If you 're interested in biology and you 've got a strong stomach , it 's definitely quite pleasant work .
A lot of people quit immediately and the rest are lifelong employees who really enjoy it . "
4. Garbologist : A term invented by Stanford University professor William Rathje , " garbology , " as its name suggests , is the archaeological and anthropological study of garbage .
Rathkje 's work " involves going to landfills , digging out a deep well into the piles of refuse , and then analyzing what he finds . "
Since 1973 , Rathje estimates he has sifted through , cataloged , and analyzed approximately 250,000 pounds of waste .
" A garbolobist is trying to analyze modern consumption patterns and how long it takes for refuse to break down .
It 's an important consideration in an increasingly populist society , " said Ward . " [ Rathje 's ] found quite a lot of really interesting relationships .
Evidently there 's a correlation between cat ownership and being a reader of the National Enquirer , based on what they 've found of kitty litter and its proximity to the National Enquirer . "
3. Elephant Vasectomist : Mark Setter , head veterinarian at Disney 's Animal Kingdom in Florida , recently invented a tool that will solve the predicament of overpopulation of elephants in Africa .
However , using his tool lands Setter and his invention at No. 3 on Popular Science 's list .
Setter 's 4 - foot - long fiberoptic laparoscope is attached to a video monitor to help scientists to see inside the randy bull elephant as they remove its testicles .
The procedure itself is simple enough .
But , before going under the knife , scientists must first track , sedate and hoist the pachyderm four feet off the ground with a crane .
" They have to remove the testicles , which involves going through muscle and fat , and then removing these really large organs before the elephant can wake up , get angry , and take it out on anyone around them .
So , it requires bravery , speed , precision , and a lot of humility , " said Ward .
2. Oceanographer : Oceanographers ' jobs are " getting harder and harder every year , " said Ward .
Faced with the predictions that by 2048 seafood will no longer exist , coral reefs will vanish in the next decade and that an ever expanding mass of garbage the size of Texas in the North Pacific has caused irreparable damage to the world 's water supply , these scientists are charged not only with protecting the health of the ocean , but also with turning the prognosis around .
" Oceanographers are really tasked with just analyzing sad facts on deoxygenating oceans , increased pollution , whole masses of garbage swirling in the middle of the ocean .
What it really is , is a testament to how devoted and loyal a bunch of people they are .
" They 're working extremely hard on a very difficult problem , but they also are very optimistic people .
They believe that we can turn it around and the ocean is a very dynamic living environment and they feel that with the proper care , we can turn it around , but so far that has not been the case , " said Ward .
1. Hazmat Diver : Finally , the worst science job of 2007 .
If you like scuba diving and hazardous waste , then you 've found your dream job .
Hazmat divers are the craziest of the crazies , or the toughest of the tough -- depending on how you looking at it .
These men and women risk their lives every day and literally jump head first into their work -- choosing to swim in a vat of hazardous materials like pig feces , an oil spill or a sewer rather than sit behind a desk .
" Of all the bad jobs we looked at this year , the worst without question has to be hazardous materials divers .
These guys are made of the sternest stuff around , " Ward said .
" They 're paid no more than your average accountant , yet they risk their lives every day in the most unimaginable horrible circumstances to get the job done . "
RICHMOND , Va. 
A gun-rights organization is planning to hold a " gun giveaway " this week inside a Fairfax County , Va. , government building to protest Mayor Bloomberg 's efforts to crack down on illegal gun sales in Virginia .
On Thursday at the Mason District Government Center in Annandale , the Virginia Citizens Defense League will hold a drawing for a semiautomatic pistol , a hunting rifle , and ammunition to raise money for two gun shops that Bloomberg has filed suit against .
And because it 's Virginia , many people at the " Bloomberg Gun Giveaway " will probably be armed .
League members routinely lobby the Virginia General Assembly with guns on their hips .
Fairfax County officials are furious about a gun event staged in a government building but say they can't do much to stop it because the General Assembly wo n't allow local governments to ban the possession of guns in public buildings .
" These people have concealed - weapons permits , and we know they are packing , but they are legal , " said Fairfax Supervisor Penelope Gross , a Democrat of Mason .
" I swore to uphold the law , whether I like it or do n't , and I do n't . "
Under Virginia law , a person 21 or older can obtain a permit for carrying a concealed handgun .
No permit is needed if someone 18 or older wants to carry a gun in plain sight .
The league , which says it has 3,300 members , sent out an e-mail this past week reminding members that " lawful gun carry is optional at the Bloomberg Gun Giveaway . "
The Citizens Defense League is trying to raise money for Bob Moates Sport Shop in Richmond and Old Dominion Gun and Tackle in Danville , two of the six Virginia dealers New York has sued .
The legal challenges stem from Bloomberg 's effort to prove that Virginia is a major contributor to violent crime in New York .
Convinced that Virginia gun dealers are selling weapons illegally , Mr. Bloomberg sent undercover agents to the stores to conduct " straw purchases , " in which one person fills out a form and buys a gun for someone else .
According to a lawsuit filed a year ago in federal court in Brooklyn , the city alleges that Bob Moates and Old Dominion Gun illegally sold guns to Mr. Bloomberg 's agents .
Philip Van Cleave , president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League , said , " We are trying to protect the gun stores that Bloomberg attacked . "
He called the Republican mayor " a vigilante .
He has come into Virginia and taken the law into his own hands . "
Bloomberg spokesman Jason
Post responded : " We will not for one second back away from our tough law enforcement efforts against illegal guns , which have made New York the safest big city in the country .
We caught gun dealers on videotape flagrantly violating the law . "
To help pay the gun dealers ' legal fees , the defense league has encouraged people to buy weapons from the Moates and Old Dominion stores .
Those who spend more than $ 100 will have their names entered into Thursday 's drawing .
Winners will be able to view the guns at the meeting but will take possession of their weapon at a gun shop after filling out the paperwork , Mr. Van Cleave said .
When she learned of the event last week , Ms. Gross intervened to see whether the drawing was legal .
Ms. Gross concluded that the county cannot prohibit a group from using community meeting rooms because of its political views .
And because the organizers wo n't be selling tickets at the meeting , Ms. Gross said it appears that the group is not violating state or local laws regulating raffles .
Even so , Del. Adam Ebbin , a Democrat who represents parts of Alexandria and Fairfax County , called the event " embarrassing . "
" I guess this group wants to rub salt in the wound and prove we can't stop firearms in our buildings , " Mr. Ebbin said .
" It would be nice if they put their energy into making sure people who should n't have guns do n't , instead of passing around extra guns . "
The gun giveaway is turning off some sportsmen groups .
" It really gives legitimate gun owners and shooters a bad name when you see something like this , " said Fairfax resident Bob Ricker , executive director of the American Hunters and Shooters Association .
Fairfax has been pushing for state legislation that would allow local governments to ban the possession of firearms in county buildings , police stations and public libraries .
The Republican - controlled General Assembly has killed the bills , demonstrating the disconnect between Northern Virginia and the rest of the state on gun-control issues .
Del. C.L. " Clay " Athey Jr. , a Republican of Warren , said law - abiding citizens who carry guns should n't have restrictions placed on where they can go .
" The reality is , it may be helpful for someone who is qualified to carry a concealed weapon to be there in a public building in case some [ shooting ] occurs , " said Mr. Athey , noting that many retired police officers have concealed - weapons permits .
The Virginia Citizens Defense League was formed in 1994 to fight for the rights of people who want to carry concealed weapons .
BEIJING – Chopped cardboard , softened with an industrial chemical and made tasty with pork flavouring , is a main ingredient in batches of steamed buns sold in one Beijing neighbourhood , state television said .
The report , aired late Wednesday on China Central Television , highlights the country 's problems with food safety despite government efforts to improve the situation .
Countless small , often illegally run operations exist across China and make money cutting corners by using inexpensive ingredients or unsavoury substitutes .
They are almost impossible to regulate .
China Central Television 's undercover investigation features the shirtless , shorts - clad maker of the buns , called baozi , explaining the contents of the product sold in Beijing 's sprawling Chaoyang district .
Baozi are a common snack in China , with an outer skin made from wheat or rice flour and a filling of sliced pork .
Cooked by steaming in immense bamboo baskets , they are similar to but usually much bigger than the dumplings found on dim sum menus familiar to many North Americans .
In the Chinese television report , a hidden camera follows a man , whose face is not shown , into a ramshackle building where steamers are filled with the fluffy white buns .
The surroundings are filthy , with water puddles and piles of old furniture and cardboard on the ground .
" What 's in the recipe ? " the reporter asks .
" Six to four , " the man says .
" You mean 60 per cent cardboard ?
What is the other 40 per cent ? " asks the reporter .
" Fatty meat , " the man replies .
The bun maker and his assistants then give a demonstration on how the product is made .
Squares of cardboard picked from the ground are first soaked to a pulp in a plastic basin of caustic soda – a chemical base commonly used in manufacturing paper and soap – then chopped into tiny morsels with a cleaver .
Fatty pork and powdered seasoning are stirred in .
Soon , steaming servings of the buns appear on - screen .
The reporter takes a bite .
" This baozi filling is kind of tough .
Not much taste , " he says .
``Can other people taste the difference ? "
" Most people can't .
It fools the average person , " the maker says .
" I do n't eat them myself . "
The police eventually show up and shut down the operation .

Dating study suggests it was n't the makers of the Clovis culture .
The Clovis culture is characterized by sophisticated stone weapons .
Center for the Study of the First Americans , Texas A&M University
For decades many archaeologists have believed that the first Americans belonged to what is called the Clovis culture — hunter - gatherers who lived in parts of North America roughly 13,000 calendar years ago .
A new study counters this notion by showing that the Clovis culture is nearly 500 years younger than previously thought , and may have lasted for as little as 200 years .
There is evidence of other cultures in the Americas well before this new date .
The Clovis culture is characterized by sophisticated stone weapons , first found in Clovis , New Mexico .
They would have been used to hunt mammals , including mammoths and mastodons .
The ' Clovis - first ' model posits that the original Americans crossed a land bridge linking Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age , and headed south down the eastern side of the Rockies through a gap in the two ice sheets that covered Canada .
When they got beyond the ice , they dispersed rapidly , reaching the southern tip of South America roughly a thousand years later , and carrying the Clovis culture as far as central America .
This picture has been challenged in recent years , most notably by the discovery of archaeological remains in Chile and Wisconsin that have been dated to over 14,000 years ago .
Mainstream thinking has shifted away from the Clovis - first model , says Vance Holliday , a geoarchaeologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson : " But the debate is still out there . "
Updating the dating
Michael Waters of Texas A&M University in College Station and geochemist Thomas Stafford Jr of Stafford Research Laboratories in Boulder , Colorado , have now re-evaluated the age of Clovis artefacts , many of which were dated in the 1960s and 70s using carbon - dating techniques that are now obsolete .
The duo re-dated the artefacts using a technique called accelerator mass spectrometry .
Like standard radiocarbon dating , this method measures the ratio of different forms of carbon in a sample .
But it requires much less material and delivers more precise results .
Clovis technology turns out to be younger than previously thought — 13,100 years old , rather than 13,600 — and to have lasted only 200 to 350 years .
That 's not long enough for people to reach the southern tip of the Americas , says Waters .
Models suggest that the 14,000 - kilometre journey would take 600 - 1,000 years .
Instead , Waters believes that the Clovis culture spread through a pre-existing population .
" The old Clovis - first model would have had the Clovis culture marching down into unpopulated South America , all the way to the southern tip , " he says .
" But our data are showing that these two populations are contemporaneous . "
The findings are reported this week in Science .
1
Fast movers ?
The re-analysis is a landmark finding , says archaeologist Donald Grayson of the University of Washington in Seattle .
But , he adds , Waters and Stafford 's arguments would be stronger if they had analysed material from more sites — many were excluded out of concern for the quality of the artefacts .
" The bigger your sample , the wider the spread of dates is going to become , " says Grayson .
" As long as their sample is only 11 sites , it stands to reason that the time period is more constrained than it could be if we had more sites . "
The exclusion of the Aubrey site in Texas — believed to be one of the oldest Clovis sites — is particularly worrying , says C. Vance Haynes of the University of Arizona , Tucson , who has studied Clovis culture for more than 40 years .
Waters and Stafford excluded that site because the samples may have been contaminated .
Haynes agrees with this decision , but points out that excluding the site might have affected the results .
ADVERTISEMENT
Geological analyses of Clovis sites support the idea that the culture was relatively short - lived , says Haynes .
But he still thinks that people , driven by curiosity and an abundance of game , would have taken much less than 600 years to infiltrate the Americas .
" This is exploration of a new world by a fairly sophisticated group , " says Haynes .
" I do n't believe other people who say it takes hundred of years for this culture to spread . "

Afghans protested for a third day at alleged civilian deaths
They say that women and children were among the victims .
US - led forces have said that at least 135 Taleban fighters were killed in the clashes in the district of Shindand on Sunday and Friday .
On Monday the US said it had used land and air strikes in Shindand and had no reports of any civilian casualties .
' Various sources '
Afghan officials and local people have told the BBC's Pashto service that more than 30 civilians died in the exchanges .
And Herat police chief Mohammad Shafiq Fazli told the AFP news agency : " There were at least 30 civilians including women and children among those killed in Shindand 's fighting . "
He said his information was based on " reports from various sources " from the area .
Shindand Governor Khodadad Erfani also said there were civilians among the dead , " but we do n't have the number " .
Meanwhile in the eastern city of Jalalabad , there has been a third day of protests against the alleged killing of civilians by US - led forces .
Hundreds of people - mostly students - briefly blocked a main road into the provincial capital and repeated calls for President Hamid Karzai to step down .
' Carelessness '
The death of civilians has been a major issue in Afghanistan , with Nato saying in January that its biggest mistake in 2006 had been the killing of innocent people .
The alliance has been accused of carelessness over civilian lives when attacking Taleban fighters .
In December President Karzai tearfully accused coalition forces of " killing our children " .
Nato said afterwards that efforts were under way to reduce civilian deaths in military operations .
But it said that it killed far fewer people in 2006 than the Taleban , who launched more than 100 suicide attacks .

Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) said Thursday morning his push to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney is gaining support among the American people as he collects petitions with more than 100,000 signatures supporting the impeachment drive .
“ I made it very clear that I was not alone , ” Kucinich said .
“ Today I am proud to see that hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined this effort . ”

Fox pundit : Cheney in ' secured undisclosed bunker of his mind ' David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Sunday June 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Fox News Sunday held a round table discussion this morning regarding Dick Cheney 's assertion that he is not part of the executive branch and should thus not be subject to an executive order concerning the handling of classified information by executive offices .
Host Chris Wallace wondered why the Vice President would have decided to stop complying with the executive order in 2003 , since he had complied with it prior to then , and former Vice President Al Gore also complied with it .
Conservative pundit Bill Kristol replied that the measure was a " pain in the neck " for the executive staff and argued that there is no reason for archivists from the National Archives to " come investigate the security procedures of the Vice President 's office . "
" Maybe they have a reason because he stopped complying with the law , " shot back panel member Juan Williams .
" There 's no law , " insisted Kristol .
" Yes .
There 's an executive order , " said Williams .
" What you have is , not only is it that there is classified documents , we do n't know where they go , what happens to them , emails disappear in this White House , and you say , ' Well , what happened to the emails ? '
' Oh no , we have a private account . '
This is all a dodge , this is a game in order to keep Dick Cheney in , I guess , some sort of secured undisclosed bunker of his mind . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox News Sunday , broadcast on June 24 .

Question to ponder :
What does Google ’s G : Drive do to P2P and file sharing in general ?
Before G : Drive becomes a reality Google has some deep thinking to do in terms of how it handles issues like copyright and illegal file sharing .
Google has already hinted that G : Drive will be more than just a personal online storage system .
They ’ve talked about ‘ Lighthouse ’ which I ’ve previously speculated might be an online file management system , but notably , talked about how it was tied to the notion of an “ access list ” .
Which tends to suggest that you will be able to share files on your G : Drive , which let ’s face it , must be half the attraction and point to such a service .
Now , such a set - up is a file sharing wet dream .
No downloading that latest episode of Lost painfully from your machine to mine , just flick it across our G : Drive partitions and we ’re done .
In fact , if Google were to be really clever about it they might even introduce “ virtual ” copies of files .
Think about it .
If you and I have the exact same file on our G : Drives , Google does n’t need to store it twice .
They just tag it as being included on our respective virtual drives and it appears in both our G : Drives as if we own it .
Imagine how much redundant storage requirements across the globe have been created by P2P .
Obviously , Google is going to have to place restrictions on which files you can give access to , to anyone .
Or else it will have essentially created anotherNapster .
However , much more difficult to police will be the sharing of files between , firstly friends , but then , if allowed to germinate , file sharing networks .
If I have ten friends I share files with who each have ten friends they share files with and so on and son on , imagine how large and powerful that network could quickly become in allowing for the rapid
dissemination of files .
I ’m suddenly seeing Orkut in a whole new light !
Now , Google ’s not going to want this to happen .
They ’re going to be in the video , audio , multimedia distribution game and they ’re going to want you to pay .
So we imagine , it ’s high on their priority that they ’ll want to develop a way to identify files that infringe copyright and keep them off of G : Drive .
And hence will begin a technological battle between the hackers , finding ways to disguise files and beat those protection mechanisms and Google ’s DRM soldiers .
As is proven time and time again , the hackers also win .
As such , it ’s going to be fascinating to watch how this evolves .
Who knows which way it ’s going to go ?
Maybe , by the time , Google figures this stuff out , we ’ll have such big pipes that P2P works efficiently enough that all this becomes mute anyway .
The only thing you can be certain of , it ’s that it ’s going to be the topic of much debate , controversy and intrigue .
The enzyme seemed to repair memory function
US scientists increased the activity of an enzyme called Uch - L1 which is involved in memory function .
They then tested the mice and found that they had regained the ability to form new memories .
Writing in the journal Cell , the team said the work was in its early stages , but could help the development of therapies for the debilitating disease .
We injected the mice with this enzyme , and we found we were restoring their memories
Dr Ottavio Arancio
The scientists used transgenic mice that had Alzheimer 's disease .
Like humans with the condition , the mice had plaques of protein amyloid beta in their brain and damaged synapses ( the site where brain cells communicate with each other ) , and they also suffered from memory loss .
The researchers injected the mice with a substance which boosted levels of the enzyme Uch - L1 .
They then tested the mice 's memory by putting them into a cage where they were exposed to a very mild shock from the cage floor .
Mice with normal memories stay still when they are placed in the cage for a second time , to avoid the shock , whereas mice with Alzheimer 's do not because they cannot remember their first visit .
The researchers found that when they placed the mice with boosted Uch - L1 levels into the cage , they stayed still like the normal mice .
Dr Ottavio Arancio , an author on the paper from Columbia University 's Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer 's Disease and Aging , said : " We injected the mice with this enzyme , and we found we were restoring their memories . "
He said further investigation revealed the enzyme also seemed to repair the synapse function of the mice .
Possible therapies
Michael Shelanski , another author on the paper from Columbia University , said : " While amyloid beta is certainly a key player in Alzheimer 's disease - and efforts to reduce it remain a worthy goal - our results show that , even in the presence of the plaque , damage to memory can be reversed . "
The authors propose that the enzyme could be targeted to look for new therapies for Alzheimer 's disease ; however they cautioned that the research is in its early stages .
Dr Shelanski said : " While this discovery is very promising , its proven effectiveness is limited to animal models and it will take some time before it could lead to therapies in humans .
" We continue to work towards that crucial goal . "
In an accompanying commentary , Peter Lansbury , a neurobiologist from Harvard Medical School , Massachusetts , said : " Understanding the molecular mechanism of memory is one of the most compelling and complex challenges for the next generation of scientists .
" [ The researchers ] identify a protein that may be involved in both normal memory function and the type of memory loss characteristic of early Alzheimer 's disease . "
Harriet Millward , deputy chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " This is a very encouraging piece of research that could potentially open up a new front in the battle against Alzheimer 's disease .
" It is fair to say though , that at this stage a cure is still a long way off .
More research is needed to see if this result could eventually be extrapolated from mice to men . "

BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) -
The light from the cell phone screens allowed surgeons to complete an emergency appendix operation during a blackout in a city in central Argentina , reports said on Saturday .
Leonardo Molina , 29 , was on the operating table on July 21 , when the power went out in the Policlinico Juan D. Peron , the main hospital in Villa Mercedes , a small city in San Luis province .
“ The generator , which should have been working correctly , did n’t work , ” a hospital spokesman , whose name was not given , told TN television news station .
“ The surgeons and anesthetists were in the dark ...
A family member got some cell phones together from people in the hallway and took them in to provide light , ” he said .
Ricardo Molina , 39 , Leonardo ’s brother , told La Nacion newspaper that the lights were out for an hour and his brother ’s anesthesia was wearing off .
Hospital Director Dario Maurer told La Nacion the surgery was without light a maximum of 20 minutes .
After years working his fingers to the bone on his own IT business , Phil was enjoying the relative tranquillity of work at a City of London bank .
However , he was shocked by the number of " light arms " in the IT department , who did n't do a stroke of useful work all day , and became animated only when the magical hour of 5 PM approached ...
The Light Arms Brigade
Kishor , the IT director , looked up from his notes .
“ We do n’t have many people working for us here ” he said , and flung the file on his desk with some exasperation .
I had learned rapidly , in my new career as an underling , never to contradict anyone senior to me .
Instead , I mutely stared out over the vast sea of cubicles in the huge open - plan office , and scratched my head in puzzlement .
“ I suspect it depends on your definition of the word many ” I suggested placatingly .
“ No it effing does n’t ” he spat out “ it depends on your definition of the word work . ”
I had come to the IT department of a major London Bank as a refugee , having run my own IT business for some years , and I was enjoying the increased pay and tranquillity .
It had , however , come as a complete surprise to find myself surrounded by members of the IT staff who did n’t do a stroke of useful work all day , and became animated only when the magical hour of 5 PM approached .
I ’d never come across such a thing before .
In the IT world of the SMEs , we were all caught up in the never - ending struggle to survive .
We worked all the hours we could in order to deal with impossible workloads .
I had to agree with Kishor that we had more than our fair share of idlers in the staff .
We called them the light arms ( low calibre , small bore , needed to be fired ) .
One such character confessed to me how he was able to catch up on his sleep while at work .
His amazing talent was being able to doze off with his eyes open , whilst staring at the screen and tapping the CAPS key .
If resting after the exertions of ones night - life was n’t to your taste , then there were other diversions to while away the time .
The Finance Director happened to be looking through the small - ads in the local paper and came across a phone - number that looked curiously familiar .
It was for a professional accountant .
Puzzled , he phoned the number and was put through to one of his managers a few desks away who was running a firm of accountants ‘ on the side ’ .
Therefore , I sympathised with Kishor , and helped him to refine his list of the ‘ light arms ’ members of the department .
It was n’t hard to do , as the programmers leaked like sieves on the subject of the ‘ time - servers ’ .
However , it seemed to me a bleak and hopeless task to motivate such people , and I knew immediately how difficult it would be to sack them .
I felt that the only way forward was to try to encourage these people by a mixture of flattery and jobrole - change .
As it happened , Kishor never asked for my advice , but I suspected he had a plan .
Kishor always had a plan .
For some time before I came to work for him , I ’d heard of his exploits , and his cunning .
I once met him in the course of business , when he first started out in IT ; a young serious - minded Systems Analyst , working for a software house .
He ’d come a long way since .
Within a few days , the department secretary announced that some of the ‘ high fliers ’ in the department were to go on a training course at the company ’s expense , to learn C#. Various people were picked to go on this course , and there were dark mutterings of discontent from some of the excluded technical die - hards , mainly about how they ’d had to learn the language themselves , in the evenings .
Kishor told the few managers who protested to him at the choice of several ‘ light arms ’ candidates that it was a way of inspiring them to change their attitude to work , giving them a fresh start with a different technology .
The C# course came and went .
As I suspected , I did n’t need to arrange cover for any of the participants in my department .
Neither did anyone else .
Soon afterwards , the participants started to hand in their notice .
The trickle increased to a rush , and it soon became apparent that they had all been head - hunted by a rival bank , The Imperial Bank ( not it ’s real name ) .
Kishor conducted a stormy staff meeting soon afterwards .
The gossip had swept the city that the Imperial Bank had scooped up the entire group of high - fliers from our department .
Evidently , a list of the participants in the course had somehow got into the hands of the Imperial Bank .
Kishor tearfully railed at the iniquity of our rivals and we all shook our heads in sorrow at the disloyalty of our staff , and the chicanery of the person who had leaked the list .
We were particularly incensed that we ’d trained them in valuable skills at our company ’s expense .
When the extent of the duplicity became apparent , we became objects of pity in the wider world of IT .
It even got a mention in one of the computer papers that we ’d lost an entire ‘ year ’ of graduate entrants to the other bank .
Still mulling over this dramatic turn of events , I retreated to one of our favored City Pubs , where I was sipping a pint of fine ale , and enduring a certain amount of good - natured ribbing from one of the managers from the Imperial Bank ’s IT department .
It was at this exact moment that it dawned on me what Kishor had done .
I suddenly recalled , with complete clarity , walking through the City streets one evening that summer , just after the training course was announced , and catching sight of Kishor in this very same establishment .
The grey - suited customers spilled out into the street clutching their beer - glasses and talking loudly .
In the thick of the mêlée was Kishor , surrounded by IT people .
Here and there , like jackals around a campsite , I had noted the sharp attire and haircut that marked out an IT employment agent .
Kishor had ‘ accidentally ’ let slip to one of these IT agents the fact that he was sending all his most talented staff on a training course , knowing full well that the agent would subsequently inveigle the list from one of the more ‘ malleable ’ of the light arms candidates .
From there , it was but a short hop for the list , into the hands of the agent ’s best client – the Imperial Bank !
I smiled in awe and wonder at the subtlety of Kishor ’s plan , and its implications .
Suddenly , the pint of Landlord Bitter in my hand , bought for me by an Imperial Bank manager whose conscience had been troubling him , tasted twice as sweet .
After a few months , of course , the IT department of the Imperial Bank realized that all was not quite as they ’d hoped .
They ’d expected a swift recouping of the expense of their golden handshaking .
It did n’t happen like that and they began to detect the deadening lethargy of their new recruits .
I was even drawn to one side by a senior manager at the Imperial Bank and asked what on earth our low - fliers were like .
I merely smiled and said that so much employee productivity was bound up in the whole ethos of the workplace and our skilled management techniques .
Not only had Kishor cleared out all the dead wood from our department but he had transferred it to the rival bank in such a way as to inflict maximum expense and damage to them .
We had , as well , all emerged as the innocent victims .
It was at that point that I realised I would never make it to the top rank of IT managers .
Something else was necessary ; a talent I did n’t possess .
Kishor had it .
In subsequent jobs , I learned quickly that the light arms brigade tend to nestle in the crooks and crannies of all large international enterprises and government departments .
In one particularly memorable case , I spent three months in a government department working on a database audit , and sharing a desk with a Systems Analyst who was running a society magazine for Rural Field Sports .
He was supposed to be maintaining several ‘ legacy systems ’ but this took only the occasional five minutes out of his busy life amongst the ferrets , grouse and salmon .
It ’s at these times that I remember the lessons I learned from Kishor .
His talent , and his encyclopaedic knowledge of the goings - on in all the City of London IT departments , had seen him rise from the shy , serious programmer I ’d first known , to the youngest IT director ever in the City of London .
It was comforting to me to reflect that at least some of the knowledge that had driven him there had been gained in one of our beloved City of London pubs , where IT people congregated , and where Kishor gathered intelligence over a glass of orange juice .

Most restaurant patrons only see the “ front of the house . ”
The dining room .
But if you push on past the hushed tones , obsequious smiles , and culinary kabuki , you ’ll find yourself backstage .
This is where the real work of a restaurant is done .
A rabbit warren of kitchens , prep areas , and offices ; littered with boxes , cabling , and equipment , the “ back of the house ” is usually a hot , exotic smelling , linguistically varied , and loud place .
Now after reading my blog a lot of you think us waiters spend our time contemplating the mysteries of the universe or waxing philosophically about God and the nature of man .
Wrong .
Here ’s a sample of some back of house conversations .
Be warned .
It ai n’t Shakepeare .

“ Hey , Carlos wants to know how old you were when you lost your virginity . ”
Armando , translating for Carlos our dishwasher , asks me .
I look at Carlos , a little Guatemalan man sporting a sly little smile , waiting for his answer .
“ Tell him I do n’t know .
But if he asks his Mom she might remember , ” I shoot back .
The kitchen guys roar with laughter .
Carlos shakes his head .
He set himself up for that one .

“ Hey Boloni , ” Fluvio says , beckoning me over to him .
“ What ? ” I reply .
( “ Boloni ” is how Fluvio addresses me when he ’s exasperated with something I ’ve done – which is basically all the time . )
“ The guy on table three is a producer with HBO . ”
“ So ? ” I huff .
I ’m really busy .
“ I pitched him on idea for a reality TV show set in a restaurant . ” Fluvio continues .
‘ It ’s been done , ” I say loading my arms up with platters of food .
“ Yeah , but my show would focus on the waiters not the chef .
Why do they do what they do ?
How do they handle the stress ? ” he elaborates .
“ Drugs , drugs and more drugs , ” I reply .
“ You think you could write the TV show ? ” Fluvio asks .
He is an avid reader of my blog .
“ Sure I can , ” I reply confidently .
“ Good . ” Fluvio snorts .
“ One thing though . ”
“ What ? ”
“ You die in the end , ” I say smiling .
“ Fuck you . ”
“ Yeah , you get it in the bunker scene , ” I say running away .
“ I think I kill you first ! ” Fluvio calls after me .

“ Why is there an ice bucket on twenty six ? ” Fluvio asks .
It ’s a good question .
The couple is drinking an expensive red wine .
A 1995 Bertani Amarone .
“ Guy said the wine was too warm . ” I reply .
“ So he put it one ice ? ” Fluvio asks disgustedly .
“ Yep . ”
“ Amateur .
It ’s been stored at the perfect temperature . ”
I shrug .

“ Did you know that ‘ puttanesca sauce ’ translates to ‘ sauce of the whore ? ’ ” Shlomo , one of our waiters , asks me .
“ I did not know that . ” I reply .
“ Yeah , the tavernas would make that sauce for the hookers .
The smell was supposed to attract male customers and the dish kept the ladies warm on a cold night . ”
“ You do n’t say . ”
“ It became so popular everyone started eating it , not just the hookers . ”
“ Hey Armando , ” I call over to the sous chef , “ Does puttanesca sauce really mean sauce of the whores ? ” I want confirmation .
Armando is from Italy .
He ’ll know .
“ Puttana means whore in Italian , so yes it does , ” Armando replies .
Hell , I learn something new every day .
“ But if you serve it to the nobility it ’s called “ Sauce Bella Donna ’ or ‘ Sauce for the Pretty Lady ’ , ” Armando continues .
“ You ca n’t call the lady of the house a whore , ” Shlomo adds .
“ I guess not , ” I say .
“ We could put that dish on the specials . ” Armando says grinning .
“ Good evening madam .
In honor of the getup you ’re wearing we have a lovely special – linguine in a sauce for the whore , ” I say pretending to address a table .
“ You might get fired for that , ” Sholmo chuckles .
“ You think ? ” I say walking away .
Everyone here is nuts .

State - sanctioned teams of computer hackers were able to break through the security of virtually every model of California 's voting machines and change results or take control of some of the systems ' electronic functions , according to a University of California study released Friday .
The researchers " were able to bypass physical and software security in every machine they tested , " said Secretary of State Debra Bowen , who authorized the " top to bottom review " of every voting system certified by the state .
Neither Bowen nor the investigators were willing to say exactly how vulnerable California elections are to computer hackers , especially because the team of computer experts from the UC system had top - of - the - line security information plus more time and better access to the voting machines than would - be vote thieves likely would have .
" All information available to the secretary of state was made available to the testers , " including operating manuals , software and source codes usually kept secret by the voting machine companies , Matt Bishop , UC Davis computer science professor who led the " red team " hacking effort , said in his summary of the results .
The review included voting equipment from every company approved for use in the state , including Sequoia , whose systems are used in Alameda , Napa and Santa Clara counties ; Hart InterCivic , used in San Mateo and Sonoma Counties ; and Diebold , used in Marin County .
Election Systems and Software , which supplied equipment to San Francisco , Contra Costa , Solano and Los Angeles counties in last November 's election , missed the deadline for submitting the equipment , Bowen said .
While their equipment will be reviewed , Bowen warned that she has " the legal authority to impose any condition " on its use .
Bowen said in a telephone news conference Friday that the report is only one piece of information she will use to decide which voting systems are secure enough to use in February 's presidential primary election .
If she is going to decertify any of the machines , she must do it by Friday , six months before the Feb. 5 vote .
More for you News Makers of voting machines battle critics over UC study
A day - long hearing in Sacramento on Monday will give the UC investigators a chance to present their finding and allow the various voting machine companies to present a response .
The hearing also will be open for comments from the public .
The study was designed to discover vulnerabilities in the technology of voting systems used in the state .
It did not deal with any physical security measures that counties might take and " made no assumptions about constraints on the attackers , " Bishop said .
" The testers did not evaluate the likelihood of any attack being feasible , " he added .
Some county elections officials in the state were among the most critical of the study , saying they worry that they could be forced to junk millions of dollars in voting machines if Bowen decertifies them for the February election .
Letting the hackers have the source codes , operating manuals and unlimited access to the voting machines " is like giving a burglar the keys to your house , " said Steve Weir , clerk - recorder of Contra Costa County and head of the state Association of Clerks and Election Officials .
The study also determined that many voting systems have flaws that make it difficult for blind voters and those with other disabilities to cast ballots .
During her election campaign last year , Bowen made it clear she had little confidence in the security of electronic voting machines and vowed to review their use in the state .
" Voting systems are tools of our democracy , " she said Friday .
" We want to ensure that the voting systems used in the state are secure , accurate , reliable and accessible to all .
This ( study result ) is not a big deal to me .
It 's a big deal for everyone in the country . "
Vendors and other advocates of electronic voting machines have suggested that because of Bowen 's well - publicized concerns , she has her thumb on the scale when it comes to reviewing the systems .
But the secretary of state said she purposely avoided the scientists doing the study .
Bowen admitted that she 's " enough of a geek " that she would have enjoyed working closely with the study , but " I 've stayed out of the way ...
It 's not my review , " she said .
" I did n't want ( the researchers ) to be influenced by my questions . "
Weir said the UC study " is only a hologram of what could be done technically without considering the real - world mitigation , " the locks , access cards and other physical security measures typically used .
The study found " absolutely no evidence of any malicious source code anywhere , " he added .
" They found nothing that could cast doubt on the results of elections . "
Bishop , however , said he was surprised by the weakness of the security measures , both physical and electronic , protecting the voting systems .
His team of hackers found ways to get into the systems not only through the high - tech equipment in election headquarters but also through the machines in the polling places .
If the testers had had more time , they would have found more flaws , he added .
" The vendors appeared to have designed systems that were not high assurance ( of security ) , " said Bishop , a recognized expert on computer security .
" The security seems like it was added on . "
DIGG THIS
We ’ve all suspected that the market economy has a civilizing effect on people , but I ’ve rarely seen such a poignant example .
Here I was returning a rental car to the dealer , and some confusion set in about the keys .
The attendant asked for them back , and I handed them over even as I was pulling bags and things out of the car .
The attendant hopped in the driver ’s seat to check the mileage , and left the keys in the car .
He shut the door , I shut another , even as one more bag remained insider .
But there was a hitch : the car was now locked .
We all looked at each other with a sense of : what were we thinking ?
Now the car was locked , and it was the only set of keys .
This is n’t one of those old - fashioned cars that were easy to crack open .
No sir , this was a new car with all the security features we ’ve come to expect .
It surely could n’t be broken into .
I was imagining that we would have to throw a brick through the window , and we would be arguing for weeks about liability .
Then something amazing happened .
The attendant , who did n’t look like a pillar of the community , called over some of his rough - looking buddies — authentic archetypes of street thugs — and gave them a special signal .
They reached into their little bag of tricks and pulled out four little items :
A business card
A crowbar
A squeegee stick
A clothes hanger
I watched with intense interest , and then astonishment .
One person slid the business card between the top of the door and the car .
Another stood next to him and began to work the crowbar between the card and the door until it began to move outward .
He gave it a bit of a twist , and a third person made the gap wide with the squeegee stick .
The tools moved here and there until they locked into place and a clean gap separated the doorframe and the car body .
Next , one person bent the clothes hanger in a curved way , and put a loop at the bottom .
He inserted it and with surgeon - like precision , he lifted the lock .
The door opened right up , the tools were removed , and all was well .
The car alarm did not sound , and there was not a single scratch on the car .
No evidence remain that the car had been hacked .
Total time that it took to open this door : about 20 seconds .
The operation was a marvel , and it proved to me something I did not know : namely , that cars only appear to be locked .
In the hands of these guys , every car was only superficially secure .
The owner of the rental place came over to see what had been happening , and he too was rather shocked .
" If one of my cars ever turns up missing , " he said in a gruff way , " I ’ll know who took it ! "
Then he smiled and winked : " Good job , men . "
Now , it is possible that this skill was one learned on the job .
Possible , but doubtful .
They were too accomplished at it .
And one confirmed to me that this was the first time in memory that a set of keys had ended up being locked in the car .
So what do we have here ?
A skill gained from , mostly likely , years spent doing things they should not have been doing , now put to service in a way that is beneficial and profitable to the human community of civilized people .
It ’s hardly the only example .
We can think of the number of computer hackers now serving large companies to the benefit of everyone , or toughs who might otherwise be hurting people who play sports , or people with a penchant for guns and violence now serving as security guards or bouncers .
There are many ways in which skills associated with criminality can serve a productive purpose .
Imagine a world without market - based opportunities to serve .
These people would be social parasites instead of producers who are valued by others for their contribution .
The more the division of labor expands , and capital is accumulated in a context of the freedom to trade , the more opportunities there are for civilizing what would otherwise be destructive impulses .
There are the effects of markets that are impossible to quantify but they have a grand impact on the culture in turning people away from crime and toward peaceful forms of human engagement .
They can also teach us a few things about security holes that exist in the world we inhabit .
In the same way that a hacker can provide a good test against holes in program code , the crowbar kids at the rental place showed me something important : if you are worried about the security of your automobile , you need to do more than lock your car .

Those of us who opposed the expansion of NATO in 1999 ( admitting Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic ) and 2004 ( Slovenia , Slovakia , Bulgaria , Romania , and the former Soviet republics of Latvia , Estonia , and Lithuania ) warned that it would lead to problems with Russia .
Those problems have arrived .
A resurgent Russia  flush with oil revenues and a strong leader who is using accumulated anti-U.S. resentments to become even more autocratic  has just suspended the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty in retaliation for U.S. abrogation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty and U.S. plans to put components of a missile defense system into Poland and the Czech Republic .
The Russians now say they reserve the right to redeploy tanks and heavy artillery on their western and southern borders and will stop allowing inspectors to verify their compliance with the treaty .
The tit - for - tat Russian action is rooted in suspicions that have their origins in America ’s violation of the so - called Two Plus Four Treaty .
Signed with the Soviet Union after the Eastern Bloc fell , the treaty was intended to allow for the unification and integration of Germany into the West .
After two bloody world wars against Germany and a Cold War with a hostile NATO , Russia wanted some guarantees that a NATO substantially strengthened by a unified Germany would not pose a security risk .
As a result , in negotiations for the Two Plus Four Treaty , signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and George H.W. Bush in 1990 , the United States pledged not to station foreign troops or nuclear weapons in the eastern part of Germany and not to expand NATO eastward .
Since then , in violation of the treaty , NATO has added 10 new countries .
And the United States would like to add more , including Ukraine , Russia ’s largest and most powerful neighbor .
No wonder Russia is beginning to feel encircled .
One need not have an affinity for Russia , Russians , or their autocratic leader to realize that the United States is principally to blame for the current tensions .
What has the United States gotten for its imperial expansion into eastern and central Europe ?
Only future headaches and potential conflicts .
In the NATO Treaty , an attack on one alliance member is considered an attack on all  meaning the United States has essentially pledged to provide security for an additional 10 nations in proximity to Russia .
In fact , protection from Russia is the reason these small countries wanted to join NATO in the first place .
In 1999 and 2004 , however , U.S. politicians thought such paper commitments would never have to be fulfilled and that expanding the alliance would help “ stabilize ” the former Eastern Bloc .
Only now is it becoming apparent that such U.S. security guarantees , handed out promiscuously , might someday have to be honored in a potential tangle with a strengthened , more assertive , nuclear - armed Russia .
In fact , the recent surliness of the Russian bear originates from having sand kicked in its face over a number of years by this U.S. encirclement in Europe  not merely from U.S. plans to install a limited , anti-Iranian missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Even during the Cold War , the United States did n’t try to roll back Soviet control of Eastern Europe .
The United States took this position for several reasons , not the least of which was the fact that the region was n’t regarded as strategic to the United States .
Moreover , the United States recognized that the Soviet Union had a legitimate security interest in the region , which controls the routes which , historically , invading powers have used to reach the motherland .
After all , the Russians lost 13 million people in World War II in bitter fighting on their own soil , far more than any other country , so it is understandable that they would want such a security buffer .
The disagreement over missile defenses is a symptom of a troubled U.S. - Russian relationship that the United States has helped create .
The underlying cause , however , is Russia ’s understandable fear of encirclement .
U.S. politicians would do well to cancel the planned deployment of missile defenses in the former Eastern Bloc , and to end the NATO expansion .
Neither is needed for U.S. security , and these plans will only exacerbate tensions with a nuclear - armed and increasingly hostile Russia .

Turns out JetBlue got about 1,200 emails from the mouthbreathers .
That 's it .
1,200 .
It takes that little pressure to force an airline to cower under its own seats in fear .
Now they 'll tell those on our side who email them that they have , in fact , not pulled their sponsorship .
In part , that 's true .
O'Reilly and his minions were n't able to kill the sponsorship .
They were just able to turn the airlines in knots and twist it so fully that it is now talking out of both sides of its mouth .
To the wingnuts , it claims it has nothing to do with YearlyKos , and to progressives who email them , they claim they are still sponsors .
The reality : yes , they are sponsors , but they demanded Yearly Kos take the JetBlue logo off the convention 's website .
They can't withdraw their ticket contribution at this point , so they hope no one notices they are associated with us DFHs ( dirty f'ing hippies ) .
Someday , this will be a case study in MBA and marketing programs in how NOT to respond to spurious political pressure .
In any case , for good measure , here is that contact info again :

Eric Boehlert has written extensively about the right - wing blogosphere 's attempt to destroy the credibility of AP 's war reporting by insisting that their source was non-existent ( and , needless to say , then became the immediate target of a campaign of personal attacks , assaults on his integrity , and childish name - calling ) .
And within the last twelve hours , multiple people have written comprehensively about the profound and long overdue humiliation which these right - wing bloggers just suffered .

And within the last twelve hours , multiple people have written comprehensively about the profound and long overdue humiliation which these right - wing bloggers just suffered .
Greg Sargent re-caps how this incident exposes - yet again - the complete lack of credibility of the reckless , truth - free lynch mobs that compose the " right - wing blogosphere " and which hilariously see themselves as watchdogs over the media even though they traffic in the most reckless innuendo , gossip , and rank , error - plagued speculation that exists .
To this superb commentary I want to add but one point -- there is nothing new , unique or surprising about this incident .
Exactly this has happened repeatedly , time and again .
This is what the right - wing blogosphere does .
It is who they are and how they function .
The only difference here is that they were so shrill and relentless in their attacks on AP , having prattled on about it for weeks without pause , that they actually pushed their accusations against AP into the national media .
And , to their great credit , AP -- which continues to aggressively defend its imprisoned - without - charges Iraqi photojournalist Bilal Hussein ( whom right - wing bloggers
And they are wrong over and over and over -- and not just in error , but embarrassingly so , because so frequently their claims are transparently , laughably absurd , and they spew the most righteous accusations without any sort of evidence at all .
The New Republic has its Stephen Glass and The New York Times has its Jayson Blair .
But those are one - off incidents .
The right - wing blogosphere is driven by Jayson Blairs .
They are exposed as frauds and gossip - mongerers on an almost weekly basis .
The only thing that can compete with the consistency of their errors is the viciousness of their accusations and their pompous self - regard as " citizen journalists . "
As Terry Welch Christian Science Monitor in
The check on blogs is other blogs . . . .
Because blogs operate in a reputation - based environment , nobody minds a bias .
But they expect you to be honest about your facts .
And if you get a reputation for not being honest about your facts , people pay lots of attention to you .
These right - wing bloggers love to piously masquerade around as " media watchdogs , " keeping a watchful eye on the " MSM " and compelling them to adhere to facts .
And ever since their involvement in the use by Dan Rather of fraudulent documents , and then heightened by Charles Johnson's
But they are nothing of the sort .
Nobody is less interested in media accuracy than they are .
Correcting media mistakes is so plainly not their agenda .
They are nothing more than hyper - partisan hysterics who jump on any innuendo or rumor or whispered suspicion as long as it promotes their rigid ideological views and political loyalties and hatreds .
They have a long , shameful and really quite pitiful history of incidents filled with ones like this Jamil Hussein debacle , including :
, Dave Neiwert documents but a fraction of the false accusations they made against AP , and during the controversy itself , he made the excellent point that this whole " controversy " was based on denials by the " Iraqi Government " and the U.S. military of Jamil Hussein 's authenticity -- military and government denials which they mindlessly ingested and accepted as True like the good little authoritarians that they are .

And , to their great credit , AP -- which continues to aggressively defend its imprisoned - without - charges Iraqi photojournalist Bilal Hussein ( whom right - wing bloggers repeatedly accused of being a Terrorist ) -- fought back against these accusations .
And now the right - wing blogosphere stands revealed as what they are -- a pack of gossip - mongering hysterics who routinely attack any press reports that reflect poorly on their Leader or his policies , with rank innuendo , Internet gossip , base speculation , and wholesale error as their most frequent tools of the trade .
They operate in packs , constantly repeating each other 's innuendo and expanding on it incrementally , and they then cite to each other endlessly in one self - feeding , self - affirming orgy of links , as though that constitutes proof .

As Terry Welch points out on his Nitpicker blog , Glenn Reynolds toldin its article about the " watchdog " role of blogs :
These right - wing bloggers love to piously masquerade around as " media watchdogs , " keeping a watchful eye on the " MSM " and compelling them to adhere to facts .
And ever since their involvement in the use by Dan Rather of fraudulent documents , and then heightened by Charles Johnson 's oh - so- monumental observation that a Reuters photograph of Lebanon had been photoshopped to give the appearance of more smoke during an Israeli air strike on Beirut , the media has largely recited this storyline .
But they are nothing of the sort .
Nobody is less interested in media accuracy than they are .
Correcting media mistakes is so plainly not their agenda .
They are nothing more than hyper - partisan hysterics who jump on any innuendo or rumor or whispered suspicion as long as it promotes their rigid ideological views and political loyalties and hatreds .
They have a long , shameful and really quite pitiful history of incidents filled with ones like this Jamil Hussein debacle , including :
accusing AP photographer Bilal Hussein of abetting terrorism on the ground that he photographed a hostage in Iraq immediately prior to his execution and also after , even though the photograph in question only showed the corpse of the hostage ;
accusing Bilal Hussein of photographing an ongoing execution on the streets of Baghdad , even though he had nothing to do with those photographs ;
The New York Times travel section of jeopardizing the lives of Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld by including photos of their vacation homes Times photographer sought and obtained permission to take the photos beforehand , ( b ) other media outlets , including right - wing ones ( such as Newsmax and Fox ) , had published the same information long before and ( c ) the whole notion that such photographs could jeopardize the security of the most - well - guarded officials in the world was beneath the level of judgment of which an average 8 - year - old is capable ;

insisting that the Iranian legislature enacted a law requiring Jews and other religious minorities to wear color - designated clothing identifying them as such , and continuing to repeat the claim after the story was revealed as a total hoax ;
repeatedly claiming -- from the mouth of Glenn Reynolds -- that we have not taken military action against Iran because they are blackmailing us with the nuclear weapons they already secretly possess , a claim repeated by Reynolds as recently as yesterday ;
Michelle Malkin going on Fox News the night of the midterm elections to announce that blogger Dan Riehl has " called the race for George Allen , " prompting a smirking , condescending Brit Hume to observe -- correctly -- that when you have a blog , you can say whatever you want , and that it does n't matter if you 're right or wrong .
Hume did n't know how insightful that observation was , or how perfectly chosen was the receipient of his observation .
These right - wing bloggers operate at a level several beneath the National Enquirer , literally .
They simply fabricate facts and recklessly and maliciously launch serious accusations against the media whenever doing so advances their political agenda .
They leap on any innuendo or gossip from the Internet swamps and tout it as fact whenever doing so bolsters their ideological view or can be enlisted to destroy the credibility of a journalist who reports unpleasant facts .
They desperately seek out any basis for attacking media reports that cast doubt on their Leader and his policies .
They repeat government and military claims as fact and then accuse the media of " lying " whenever their reporting contradicts Official Statements from Our Leaders .
They operate in a credibility - free zone where there are never any consequences for their mistakes because the partisans who read them will always dismiss every one of these unfair smears on the media as well - intentioned ( one of the bloggers on Malkin 's Hot Air site

None of this is to mention the more general attacks over the last several years on media credibility in order to prevent the truth about their Leader and their War from emerging , as illustrated by several years ( and ongoing ) of posts from Glenn Reynolds and Charles Johnson , among others , claiming that the Media is On The Side Of Terrorists because they keep lying that the Glorious , Successful War in Iraq is not going well and that the Peaceful , Democratic Nirvana we created there is violent and chaotic .
In order to discredit the media and stories reflecting poorly on their political movement , they even go so far as to insist that it is the media that is our " enemy , " post satellite photographs of the homes of prominent publishers , accuse the media of being on the side of Terrorists , and even assert that they are legitimate war targets who deserve to be attacked .

As it turns out -- and as AP itself had the great pleasure of reporting ( and then rubbing in the face of its irresponsible , taunting accusers ) -- the Iraqi Government , which previously denied it , now acknowledges that Jamil Hussein does exist and he is a police officer in Iraq , just as AP reported accurately .

there 's another potential fiasco belching in the furnace of the right blogosphere perhaps birthing an even bigger embarrassment of riches .

LAST AND FIRST MEN
A STORY OF THE NEAR AND FAR FUTURE
by
Olaf Stapledon
PREFACE
This is a work of fiction .
I have tried to invent a story which may seem a possible , or at least not wholly impossible , account of the future of man ; and I have tried to make that story relevant to the change that is taking place today in man 's outlook .
To romance of the future may seem to be indulgence in ungoverned speculation for the sake of the marvellous .
Yet controlled imagination in this sphere can be a very valuable exercise for minds bewildered about the present and its potentialities .
Today we should welcome , and even study , every serious attempt to envisage the future of our race ; not merely in order to grasp the very diverse and often tragic possibilities that confront us , but also that we may familiarize ourselves with the certainty that many of our most cherished ideals would seem puerile to more developed minds .
To romance of the far future , then , is to attempt to see the human race in its cosmic setting , and to mould our hearts to entertain new values .
But if such imaginative construction of possible futures is to be at all potent , our imagination must be strictly disciplined .
We must endeavour not to go beyond the bounds of possibility set by the particular state of culture within which we live .
The merely fantastic has only minor power .
Not that we should seek actually to prophesy what will as a matter of fact occur ; for in our present state such prophecy is certainly futile , save in the simplest matters .
We are not to set up as historians attempting to look ahead instead of backwards .
We can only select a certain thread out of the tangle of many equally valid possibilities .
But we must select with a purpose .
The activity that we are undertaking is not science , but art ; and the effect that it should have on the reader is the effect that art should have .
Yet our aim is not merely to create aesthetically admirable fiction .
We must achieve neither mere history , nor mere fiction , but myth .
A true myth is one which , within the universe of a certain culture ( living or dead ) , expresses richly , and often perhaps tragically , the highest admirations possible within that culture .
A false myth is one which either violently transgresses the limits of credibility set by its own cultural matrix , or expresses admirations less developed than those of its culture 's best vision .
This book can no more claim to be true myth than true prophecy .
But it is an essay in myth creation .
The kind of future which is here imagined , should not , I think , seem wholly fantastic , or at any rate not so fantastic as to be without significance , to modern western individuals who are familiar with the outlines of contemporary thought .
Had I chosen matter in which there was nothing whatever of the fantastic , its very plausibility would have rendered it unplausible .
For one thing at least is almost certain about the future , namely , that very much of it will be such as we should call incredible .
In one important respect , indeed , I may perhaps seem to have strayed into barren extravagance .
I have supposed an inhabitant of the remote future to be communicating with us of today .
I have pretended that he has the power of partially controlling the operations of minds now living , and that this book is the product of such influence .
Yet even this fiction is perhaps not wholly excluded by our thought .
I might , of course , easily have omitted it without more than superficial alteration of the theme .
But its introduction was more than a convenience .
Only by some such radical and bewildering device could I embody the possibility that there may be more in time 's nature than is revealed to us .
Indeed , only by some such trick could I do justice to the conviction that our whole present mentality is but a confused and halting first experiment .
If ever this book should happen to be discovered by some future individual , for instance by a member of the next generation sorting out the rubbish of his predecessors , it will certainly raise a smile ; for very much is bound to happen of which no hint is yet discoverable .
And indeed even in our generation circumstances may well change so unexpectedly and so radically that this book may very soon look ridiculous .
But no matter .
We of today must conceive our relation to the rest of the universe as best we can ; and even if our images must seem fantastic to future men , they may none the less serve their purpose today .
Some readers , taking my story to be an attempt at prophecy , may deem it unwarrantably pessimistic .
But it is not prophecy ; it is myth , or an essay in myth .
We all desire the future to turn out more happily than I have figured it .
In particular we desire our present civilization to advance steadily toward some kind of Utopia .
The thought that it may decay and collapse , and that all its spiritual treasure may be lost irrevocably , is repugnant to us .
Yet this must be faced as at least a possibility .
And this kind of tragedy , the tragedy of a race , must , I think , be admitted in any adequate myth .
And so , while gladly recognizing that in our time there are strong seeds of hope as well as of despair , I have imagined for aesthetic purposes that our race will destroy itself .
There is today a very earnest movement for peace and international unity ; and surely with good fortune and intelligent management it may triumph .
Most earnestly we must hope that it will .
But I have figured things out in this book in such a manner that this great movement fails .
I suppose it incapable of preventing a succession of national wars ; and I permit it only to achieve the goal of unity and peace after the mentality of the race has been undermined .
May this not happen !
May the League of Nations , or some more strictly cosmopolitan authority , win through before it is too late !
Yet let us find room in our minds and in our hearts for the thought that the whole enterprise of our race may be after all but a minor and unsuccessful episode in a vaster drama , which also perhaps may be tragic .
Any attempt to conceive such a drama must take into account whatever contemporary science has to say about man 's own nature and his physical environment .
I have tried to supplement my own slight knowledge of natural science by pestering my scientific friends .
In particular , I have been very greatly helped by conversation with Professors P. G. H. Boswell , J. Johnstone , and J. Rice , of Liverpool .
But they must not be held responsible for the many deliberate extravagances which , though they serve a purpose in the design , may jar upon the scientific ear .
To. Dr. L. A. Reid I am much indebted for general comments , and to Mr. E. V. Rieu for many very valuable suggestions .
To Professor and Mrs. L. C. Martin , who read the whole book in manuscript , I cannot properly express my gratitude for constant encouragement and criticism .
To my wife 's devastating sanity I owe far more than she supposes .
Before closing this preface I would remind the reader that throughout the following pages the speaker , the first person singular , is supposed to be , not the actual writer , but an individual living in the extremely distant future .

INTRODUCTION BY ONE OF THE LAST MEN
This book has two authors , one contemporary with its readers , the other an inhabitant of an age which they would call the distant future .
The brain that conceives and writes these sentences lives in the time of Einstein .
Yet I , the true inspirer of this book , I who have begotten it upon that brain , I who influence that primitive being 's conception , inhabit an age which , for Einstein , lies in the very remote future .
The actual writer thinks he is merely contriving a work of fiction .
Though he seeks to tell a plausible story , he neither believes it himself , nor expects others to believe it .
Yet the story is true .
A being whom you would call a future man has seized the docile but scarcely adequate brain of your contemporary , and is trying to direct its familiar processes for an alien purpose .
Thus a future epoch makes contact with your age .
Listen patiently ; for we who are the Last Men earnestly desire to communicate with you , who are members of the First Human Species .
We can help you , and we need your help .
You can not believe it .
Your acquaintance with time is very imperfect , and so your understanding of it is defeated .
But no matter .
Do not perplex yourselves about this truth , so difficult to you , so familiar to us of a later aeon .
Do but entertain , merely as a fiction , the idea that the thought and will of individuals future to you may intrude , rarely and with difficulty , into the mental processes of some of your contemporaries .
Pretend that you believe this , and that the following chronicle is an authentic message from the Last Men .
Imagine the consequences of such a belief .
Otherwise I cannot give life to the great history which it is my task to tell .
When your writers romance of the future , they too easily imagine a progress toward some kind of Utopia , in which beings like themselves live in unmitigated bliss among circumstances perfectly suited to a fixed human nature .
I shall not describe any such paradise .
Instead , I shall record huge fluctuations of joy and woe , the results of changes not only in man 's environment but in his fluid nature .
And I must tell how , in my own age , having at last achieved spiritual maturity and the philosophic mind , man is forced by an unexpected crisis to embark on an enterprise both repugnant and desperate .
I invite you , then , to travel in imagination through the aeons that lie between your age and mine .
I ask you to watch such a history of change , grief , hope , and unforeseen catastrophe , as has nowhere else occurred , within the girdle of the Milky Way .
But first , it is well to contemplate for a few moments the mere magnitudes of cosmical events .
For , compressed as it must necessarily be , the narrative that I have to tell may seem to present a sequence of adventures and disasters crowded together , with no intervening peace .
But in fact man 's career has been less like a mountain torrent hurtling from rock to rock , than a great sluggish river , broken very seldom by rapids .
Ages of quiescence , often of actual stagnation , filled with the monotonous problems and toils of countless almost identical lives , have been punctuated by rare moments of racial adventure .
Nay , even these few seemingly rapid events themselves were in fact often long - drawn - out and tedious .
They acquire a mere illusion of speed from the speed of the narrative .
The receding depths of time and space , though they can indeed be haltingly conceived even by primitive minds , cannot be imaged save by beings of a more ample nature .
A panorama of mountains appears to naive vision almost as a flat picture , and the starry void is a roof pricked with light .
Yet in reality , while the immediate terrain could be spanned in an hour 's walking , the sky - line of peaks holds within it plain beyond plain .
Similarly with time .
While the near past and the near future display within them depth beyond depth , time 's remote immensities are foreshortened into flatness .
It is almost inconceivable to simple minds that man 's whole history should be but a moment in the life of the stars , and that remote events should embrace within themselves aeon upon aeon .
In your day you have learnt to calculate something of the magnitudes of time and space .
But to grasp my theme in its true proportions , it is necessary to do more than calculate .
It is necessary to brood upon these magnitudes , to draw out the mind toward them , to feel the littleness of your here and now , and of the moment of civilization which you call history .
You can not hope to image , as we do , such vast proportions as one in a thousand million , because your sense - organs , and therefore your perceptions , are too coarse - grained to discriminate so small a fraction of their total field .
But you may at least , by mere contemplation , grasp more constantly and firmly the significance of your calculations .
Men of your day , when they look back into the history of their planet , remark not only the length of time but also the bewildering acceleration of life 's progress .
Almost stationary in the earliest period of the earth 's career , in your moment it seems headlong .
Mind in you , it is said , not merely stands higher than ever before in respect of percipience , knowledge , insight , delicacy of admiration , and sanity of will , but also it moves upward century by century ever more swiftly .
What next ?
Surely , you think , there will come a time when there will be no further heights to conquer .
This view is mistaken .
You underestimate even the foothills that stand in front of you , and never suspect that far above them , hidden by cloud , rise precipices and snow - fields .
The mental and spiritual advances which , in your day , mind in the solar system has still to attempt , are overwhelmingly more complex , more precarious and dangerous , than those which have already been achieved .
And though in certain humble respects you have attained full development , the loftier potencies of the spirit in you have not yet even begun to put forth buds .
Somehow , then , I must help you to feel not only the vastness of time and space , but also the vast diversity of mind 's possible modes .
But this I can only hint to you , since so much lies wholly beyond the range of your imagination .
Historians living in your day need grapple only with one moment of the flux of time .
But I have to present in one book the essence not of centuries but of aeons .
Clearly we cannot walk at leisure through such a tract , in which a million terrestrial years are but as a year is to your historians .
We must fly .
We must travel as you do in your aeroplanes , observing only the broad features of the continent .
But since the flier sees nothing of the minute inhabitants below him , and since it is they who make history , we must also punctuate our flight with many descents , skimming as it were over the house - tops , and even alighting at critical points to speak face to face with individuals .
And as the plane 's journey must begin with a slow ascent from the intricate pedestrian view to wider horizons , so we must begin with a somewhat close inspection of that little period which includes the culmination and collapse of your own primitive civilization .
THE CHRONICLE
CHAPTER I. BALKAN EUROPE
1. THE EUROPEAN WAR AND AFTER
Observe now your own epoch of history as it appears to the Last Men .
Long before the human spirit awoke to clear cognizance of the world and itself , it sometimes stirred in its sleep , opened bewildered eyes , and slept again .
One of these moments of precocious experience embraces the whole struggle of the First Men from savagery toward civilization .
Within that moment , you stand almost in the very instant when the species attains its zenith .
Scarcely at all beyond your own day is this early culture to be seen progressing , and already in your time the mentality of the race shows signs of decline .
The first , and some would say the greatest , achievement of your own " Western " culture was the conceiving of two ideals of conduct , both essential to the spirit's well - being .
Socrates , delighting in the truth for its own sake and not merely for practical ends , glorified unbiased thinking , honesty of mind and speech .
Jesus , delighting in the actual human persons around him , and in that flavour of divinity which , for him , pervaded the world , stood for unselfish love of neighbours and of God .
Socrates woke to the ideal of dispassionate intelligence , Jesus to the ideal of passionate yet self - oblivious worship .
Socrates urged intellectual integrity , Jesus integrity of will .
Each , of course , though starting with a different emphasis , involved the other .
Unfortunately both these ideals demanded of the human brain a degree of vitality and coherence of which the nervous system of the First Men was never really capable .
For many centuries these twin stars enticed the more precociously human of human animals , in vain .
And the failure to put these ideals in practice helped to engender in the race a cynical lassitude which was one cause of its decay .
There were other causes .
The peoples from whom sprang Socrates and Jesus were also among the first to conceive admiration for Fate .
In Greek tragic art and Hebrew worship of divine law , as also in the Indian resignation , man experienced , at first very obscurely , that vision of an alien and supernal beauty , which was to exalt and perplex him again and again throughout his whole career .
The conflict between this worship and the intransigent loyalty to Life , embattled against Death , proved insoluble .
And though few individuals were ever clearly conscious of the issue , the first human species was again and again unwittingly hampered in its spiritual development by this supreme perplexity .
While man was being whipped and enticed by these precocious experiences , the actual social constitution of his world kept changing so rapidly through increased mastery over physical energy , that his primitive nature could no longer cope with the complexity of his environment .
Animals that were fashioned for hunting and fighting in the wild were suddenly called upon to be citizens , and moreover citizens of a world - community .
At the same time they found themselves possessed of certain very dangerous powers which their petty minds were not fit to use .
Man struggled ; but , as you shall hear , he broke under the strain .
The European War , called at the time the War to End War , was the first and least destructive of those world conflicts which display so tragically the incompetence of the First Men to control their own nature .
At the outset a tangle of motives , some honourable and some disreputable , ignited a conflict for which both antagonists were all too well prepared , though neither seriously intended it .
A real difference of temperament between Latin France and Nordic Germany combined with a superficial rivalry between Germany and England , and a number of stupidly brutal gestures on the part of the German Government and military command , to divide the world into two camps ; yet in such a manner that it is impossible to find any difference of principle between them .
During the struggle each party was convinced that it alone stood for civilization .
But in fact both succumbed now and again to impulses of sheer brutality , and both achieved acts not merely of heroism , but of generosity unusual among the First Men .
For conduct which to clearer minds seems merely sane , was in those days to be performed only by rare vision and self - mastery .
As the months of agony advanced , there was bred in the warring peoples a genuine and even passionate will for peace and a united world .
Out of the conflict of the tribes arose , at least for a while , a spirit loftier than tribalism .
But this fervour lacked as yet clear guidance , lacked even the courage of conviction .
The peace which followed the European War is one of the most significant moments of ancient history ; for it epitomizes both the dawning vision and the incurable blindness , both the impulse toward a higher loyalty and the compulsive tribalism of a race which was , after all , but superficially human .
2. THE ANGLO - FRENCH WAR
One brief but tragic incident , which occurred within a century after the European War , may be said to have sealed the fate of the First Men .
During this century the will for peace and sanity was already becoming a serious factor in history .
Save for a number of most untoward accidents , to be recorded in due course , the party of peace might have dominated Europe during its most dangerous period ; and , through Europe , the world .
With either a little less bad luck or a fraction more of vision and self - control at this critical time , there might never have occurred that aeon of darkness , in which the First Men were presently to be submerged .
For had victory been gained before the general level of mentality had seriously begun to decline , the attainment of the world state might have been regarded , not as an end , but as the first step toward true civilization .
But this was not to be .
After the European War , the defeated nation , formerly no less militaristic than the others , now became the most pacific , and a stronghold of enlightenment .
Almost everywhere , indeed , there had occurred a profound change of heart , but chiefly in Germany .
The victors on the other hand , in spite of their real craving to be human and generous , and to found a new world , were led partly by their own timidity , partly by their governors ' blind diplomacy , into all the vices against which they believed themselves to have been crusading .
After a brief period in which they desperately affected amity for one another they began to indulge once more in physical conflicts .
Of these conflicts , two must be observed .
The first outbreak , and the less disastrous for Europe , was a short and grotesque struggle between France and Italy .
Since the fall of ancient Rome , the Italians had excelled more in art and literature than in martial achievement .
But the heroic liberation of Italy in the nineteenth Christian century had made Italians peculiarly sensitive to national prestige ; and since among Western peoples national vigour was measured in terms of military glory , the Italians were fired , by their success against a rickety foreign domination , to vindicate themselves more thoroughly against the charge of mediocrity in warfare .
After the European War , however , Italy passed through a phase of social disorder and self - distrust .
Subsequently a flamboyant but sincere national party gained control of the State , and afforded the Italians a new self - respect , based on reform of the social services , and on militaristic policy .
Trains became punctual , streets clean , morals puritanical .
Aviation records were won for Italy .
The young , dressed up and taught to play at soldiers with real fire - arms , were persuaded to regard themselves as saviours of the nation , encouraged to shed blood , and used to enforce the will of the Government .
The whole movement was engineered chiefly by a man whose genius in action combined with his rhetoric and crudity of thought to make him a very successful dictator .
Almost miraculously he drilled the Italian nation into efficiency .
At the same time , with great emotional effect and incredible lack of humour , he trumpeted Italy 's self - importance , and her will to " expand . "
And since Italians were slow to learn the necessity of restricting their population , " expansion " was a real need .
Thus it came about that Italy , hungry for French territory in Africa , jealous of French leadership of the Latin races , indignant at the protection afforded to Italian " traitors " in France , became increasingly prone to quarrel with the most assertive of her late allies .
It was a frontier incident , a fancied " insult to the Italian flag , " which at last caused an unauthorized raid upon French territory by a small party of Italian militia .
The raiders were captured , but French blood was shed .
The consequent demand for apology and reparation was calm , but subtly offensive to Italian dignity .
Italian patriots worked themselves into short - sighted fury .
The Dictator , far from daring to apologize , was forced to require the release of the captive militia - men , and finally to declare war .
After a single sharp engagement the relentless armies of France pressed into North Italy .
Resistance , at first heroic , soon became chaotic .
In consternation the Italians woke from their dream of military glory .
The populace turned against the Dictator whom they themselves had forced to declare war .
In a theatrical but gallant attempt to dominate the Roman mob , he failed , and was killed .
The new government made a hasty peace , ceding to France a frontier territory which she had already annexed for " security . "
Thenceforth Italians were less concerned to outshine the glory of Garibaldi than to emulate the greater glory of Dante , Giotto and Galileo .
France had now complete mastery of the continent of Europe ; but having much to lose , she behaved arrogantly and nervously .
It was not long before peace was once more disturbed .
Scarcely had the last veterans of the European War ceased from wearying their juniors with reminiscence , when the long rivalry between France and England culminated in a dispute between their respective Governments over a case of sexual outrage said to have been committed by a French African soldier upon an Englishwoman .
In this quarrel , the British Government happened to be definitely in the wrong , and was probably confused by its own sexual repressions .
The outrage had never been committed .
The facts which gave rise to the rumour were , that an idle and neurotic Englishwoman in the south of France , craving the embraces of a " cave man , " had seduced a Senegalese corporal in her own apartments .
When , later , he had shown signs of boredom , she took revenge by declaring that he had attacked her indecently in the woods above the town .
This rumour was such that the English were all too prone to savour and believe .
At the same time , the magnates of the English Press could not resist this opportunity of trading upon the public 's sexuality , tribalism and self - righteousness .
There followed an epidemic of abuse , and occasional violence , against French subjects in England ; and thus the party of fear and militarism in France was given the opportunity it had long sought .
For the real cause of this war was connected with air power .
France had persuaded the League of Nations ( in one of its less intelligent moments ) to restrict the size of military aeroplanes in such a manner that , while London lay within easy striking distance of the French coast , Paris could only with difficulty be touched by England .
This state of affairs obviously could not last long .
Britain was agitating more and more insistently for the removal of the restriction .
On the other hand , there was an increasing demand for complete aerial disarmament in Europe ; and so strong was the party of sanity in France , that the scheme would almost certainly have been accepted by the French Government .
On both counts , therefore , the militarists of France were eager to strike while yet there was opportunity .
In an instant , the whole fruit of this effort for disarmament was destroyed .
That subtle difference of mentality which had ever made it impossible for these two nations to understand one another , was suddenly exaggerated by this provocative incident into an apparently insoluble discord .
England reverted to her conviction that all Frenchmen were sensualists , while to France the English appeared , as often before , the most offensive of hypocrites .
In vain did the saner minds in each country insist on the fundamental humanity of both .
In vain , did the chastened Germans seek to mediate .
In vain did the League , which by now had very great prestige and authority , threaten both parties with expulsion , even with chastisement .
Rumour got about in Paris that England , breaking all her international pledges , was now feverishly building giant planes which would wreck France from Calais to Marseilles .
And indeed the rumour was not wholly a slander , for when the struggle began , the British air force was found to have a range of intensive action far wider than was expected .
Yet the actual outbreak of war took England by surprise .
While the London papers were selling out upon the news that war was declared , enemy planes appeared over the city .
In a couple of hours a third of London was in ruins , and half her population lay poisoned in the streets .
One bomb , falling beside the British Museum , turned the whole of Bloomsbury into a crater , wherein fragments of mummies , statues , and manuscripts were mingled with the contents of shops , and morsels of salesmen and the intelligentsia .
Thus in a moment was destroyed a large proportion of England 's most precious relics and most fertile brains .
Then occurred one of those microscopic , yet supremely potent incidents which sometimes mould the course of events for centuries .
During the bombardment a special meeting of the British Cabinet was held in a cellar in Downing Street .
The party in power at the time was progressive , mildly pacifist , and timorously cosmopolitan .
It had got itself involved in the French quarrel quite unintentionally .
At this Cabinet meeting an idealistic member urged upon his colleagues the need for a supreme gesture of heroism and generosity on the part of Britain .
Raising his voice with difficulty above the bark of English guns and the volcanic crash of French bombs , he suggested sending by radio the following message : " From the people of England to the people of France .
Catastrophe has fallen on us at your hands .
In this hour of agony , all hate and anger have left us .
Our eyes are opened .
No longer can we think of ourselves as English merely , and you as merely French ; all of us are , before all else , civilized beings .
Do not imagine that we are defeated , and that this message is a cry for mercy .
Our armament is intact , and our resources still very great .
Yet , because of the revelation which has come to us today , we will not fight .
No plane , no ship , no soldier of Britain shall commit any further act of hostility .
Do what you will .
It would be better even that a great people should be destroyed than that the whole race should be thrown into turmoil .
But you will not strike again .
As our own eyes have been opened by agony , yours now will be opened by our act of brotherhood .
The spirit of France and the spirit of England differ .
They differ deeply ; but only as the eye differs from the hand .
Without you , we should be barbarians .
And without us , even the bright spirit of France would be but half expressed .
For the spirit of France lives again in our culture and in our very speech ; and the spirit of England is that which strikes from you your most distinctive brilliance . "
At no earlier stage of man 's history could such a message have been considered seriously by any government .
Had it been suggested during the previous war , its author would have been ridiculed , execrated , perhaps even murdered .
But since those days , much had happened .
Increased communication , increased cultural intercourse , and a prolonged vigorous campaign for cosmopolitanism , had changed the mentality of Europe .
Even so , when , after a brief discussion , the Government ordered this unique message to be sent , its members were awed by their own act .
As one of them expressed it , they were uncertain whether it was the devil or the deity that had possessed them , but possessed they certainly were .
That night the people of London ( those who were left ) experienced an exaltation of spirit .
Disorganization of the city 's life , overwhelming physical suffering and compassion , the consciousness of an unprecedented spiritual act in which each individual felt himself to have somehow participated -- these influences combined to produce , even in the bustle and confusion of a wrecked metropolis , a certain restrained fervour , and a deep peace of mind , wholly unfamiliar to Londoners .
Meanwhile the undamaged North knew not whether to regard the Government 's sudden pacificism as a piece of cowardice or as a superbly courageous gesture .
Very soon , however , they began to make a virtue of necessity , and incline to the latter view .
Paris itself was divided by the message into a vocal party of triumph and a silent party of bewilderment .
But as the hours advanced , and the former urged a policy of aggression , the latter found voice for the cry , " Viva l'Angleterre , viva l'humanité . "
And so strong by now was the will for cosmopolitanism that the upshot would almost certainly have been a triumph of sanity , had there not occurred in England an accident which tilted the whole precarious course of events in the opposite direction .
The bombardment had occurred on a Friday night .
On Saturday the repercussions of England 's great message were echoing throughout the nations .
That evening , as a wet and foggy day was achieving its pallid sunset , a French plane was seen over the western outskirts of London .
It gradually descended , and was regarded by onlookers as a messenger of peace .
Lower and lower it came .
Something was seen to part from it and fall .
In a few seconds an immense explosion occurred in the neighbourhood of a great school and a royal palace .
There was hideous destruction in the school .
The palace escaped .
But , chief disaster for the cause of peace , a beautiful and extravagantly popular young princess was caught by the explosion .
Her body , obscenely mutilated , but still recognizable to every student of the illustrated papers , was impaled upon some high park - railings beside the main thoroughfare toward the city .
Immediately after the explosion the enemy plane crashed , burst into flame , and was destroyed with its occupants .
A moment 's cool thinking would have convinced all onlookers that this disaster was an accident , that the plane was a belated straggler in distress , and no messenger of hate .
But , confronted with the mangled bodies of schoolboys , and harrowed by cries of agony and terror , the populace was in no state for ratiocination .
Moreover there was the princess , an overwhelmingly potent sexual symbol and emblem of tribalism , slaughtered and exposed before the eyes of her adorers .
The news was flashed over the country , and distorted of course in such a manner as to admit no doubt that this act was the crowning deviltry of sexual fiends beyond the Channel .
In an hour the mood of London was changed , and the whole population of England succumbed to a paroxysm of primitive hate far more extravagant than any that had occurred even in the war against Germany .
The British air force , all too well equipped and prepared , was ordered to Paris .
Meanwhile in France the militaristic government had fallen , and the party of peace was now in control .
While the streets were still thronged by its vociferous supporters , the first bomb fell .
By Monday morning Paris was obliterated .
There followed a few days of strife between the opposing armaments , and of butchery committed upon the civilian populations .
In spite of French gallantry , the superior organization , mechanical efficiency , and more cautious courage of the British Air Force soon made it impossible for a French plane to leave the ground .
But if France was broken , England was too crippled to pursue her advantage .
Every city of the two countries was completely disorganized .
Famine , riot , looting , and above all the rapidly accelerating and quite uncontrollable spread of disease , disintegrated both States , and brought war to a standstill .
Indeed , not only did hostilities cease , but also both nations were too shattered even to continue hating one another .
The energies of each were for a while wholly occupied in trying to prevent complete annihilation by famine and pestilence .
In the work of reconstruction they had to depend very largely on help from outside .
The management of each country was taken over , for the time , by the League of Nations .
It is significant to compare the mood of Europe at this time with that which followed the European War .
Formerly , though there had been a real effort toward unity , hate and suspicion continued to find expression in national policies .
There was much wrangling about indemnities , reparations , securities ; and the division of the whole continent into two hostile camps persisted , though by then it was purely artificial and sentimental .
But after the Anglo - French war , a very different mood prevailed .
There was no mention of reparations , no possibility of seeking security by alliances .
Patriotism simply faded out , for the time , under the influence of extreme disaster .
The two enemy peoples co-operated with the League in the work of reconstructing not only each one itself , but each one the other .
This change of heart was due partly to the temporary collapse of the whole national organization , partly to the speedy dominance of each nation by pacifist and anti-nationalist Labour , partly to the fact that the League was powerful enough to inquire into and publish the whole story of the origins of the war , and expose each combatant to itself and to the world in a sorry light .
We have now observed in some detail the incident which stands out in man 's history as perhaps the most dramatic example of petty cause and mighty effect .
For consider .
Through some miscalculation , or a mere defect in his instruments , a French airman went astray , and came to grief in London after the sending of the peace message .
Had this not happened , England and France would not have been wrecked .
And , had the war been nipped at the outset , as it almost was , the party of sanity throughout the world would have been very greatly strengthened ; the precarious will to unity would have gained the conviction which it lacked , would have dominated man not merely during the terrified revulsion after each spasm of national strife , but as a permanent policy based on mutual trust .
Indeed so delicately balanced were man 's primitive and developed impulses at this time , that but for this trivial accident , the movement which was started by England 's peace message might have proceeded steadily and rapidly toward the unification of the race .
It might , that is , have attained its goal , before , instead of after , the period of mental deterioration , which in fact resulted from a long epidemic of wars .
And so the first Dark Age might never have occurred .
3. EUROPE AFTER THE ANGLO - FRENCH WAR
A subtle change now began to affect the whole mental climate of the planet .
This is remarkable , since , viewed for instance from America or China , this war was , after all , but a petty disturbance , scarcely more than a brawl between quarrelsome statelets , an episode in the decline of a senile civilization .
Expressed in dollars , the damage was not impressive to the wealthy West and the potentially wealthy East .
The British Empire , indeed , that unique banyan tree of peoples , was henceforward less effective in world diplomacy ; but since the bond that held it together was by now wholly a bond of sentiment , the Empire was not disintegrated by the misfortune of its parent trunk .
Indeed , a common fear of American economic imperialism was already helping the colonies to remain loyal .
Yet this petty brawl was in fact an irreparable and far reaching disaster .
For in spite of those differences of temperament which had forced the English and French into conflict , they had co-operated , though often unwittingly , in tempering and clarifying the mentality of Europe .
Though their faults played a great part in wrecking Western civilization , the virtues from which these vices sprang were needed for the salvation of a world prone to uncritical romance .
In spite of the inveterate blindness and meanness of France in international policy , and the even more disastrous timidity of England , their influence on culture had been salutary , and was at this moment sorely needed .
For , poles asunder in tastes and ideals , these two peoples were yet alike in being on the whole more sceptical , and in their finest individuals more capable of dispassionate yet creative intelligence , than any other Western people .
This very character produced their distinctive faults , namely , in the English a caution that amounted often to moral cowardice , and in the French a certain myopic complacency and cunning , which masqueraded as realism .
Within each nation there was , of course , great variety .
English minds were of many types .
But most were to some extent distinctively English ; and hence the special character of England 's influence in the world .
Relatively detached , sceptical , cautious , practical , more tolerant than others , because more complacent and less prone to fervour , the typical Englishman was capable both of generosity and of spite , both of heroism and of timorous or cynical abandonment of ends proclaimed as vital to the race .
French and English alike might sin against humanity , but in different manners .
The French sinned blindly , through a strange inability to regard France dispassionately .
The English sinned through faint - heartedness , and with open eyes .
Among all nations they excelled in the union of common sense and vision .
But also among all nations they were most ready to betray their visions in the name of common sense .
Hence their reputation for perfidy .
Differences of national character and patriotic sentiment were not the most fundamental distinctions between men at this time .
Although in each nation a common tradition or cultural environment imposed a certain uniformity on all its members , yet in each nation every mental type was present , though in different proportions .
The most significant of all cultural differences between men , namely , the difference between the tribalists and the cosmopolitans , traversed the national boundaries .
For throughout the world something like a new , cosmopolitan " nation " with a new all - embracing patriotism was beginning to appear .
In every land there was by now a salting of awakened minds who , whatever their temperament and politics and formal faith , were at one in respect of their allegiance to humanity as a race or as an adventuring spirit .
Unfortunately this new loyalty was still entangled with old prejudices .
In some minds the defence of the human spirit was sincerely identified with the defence of a particular nation , conceived as the home of all enlightenment .
In others , social injustice kindled a militant proletarian loyalty , which , though at heart cosmopolitan , infected alike its champions and its enemies with sectarian passions .
Another sentiment , less definite and conscious than cosmopolitanism , also played some part in the minds of men , namely loyalty toward the dispassionate intelligence , and perplexed admiration of the world which it was beginning to reveal , a world august , immense , subtle , in which , seemingly , man was doomed to play a part minute but tragic .
In many races there had , no doubt , long existed some fidelity toward the dispassionate intelligence .
But it was England and France that excelled in this respect .
On the other hand , even in these two nations there was much that was opposed to this allegiance .
These , like all peoples of the age , were liable to bouts of insane emotionalism .
Indeed the French mind , in general so clear sighted , so realistic , so contemptuous of ambiguity and mist , so detached in all its final valuations , was yet so obsessed with the idea " France " as to be wholly incapable of generosity in international affairs .
But it was France , with England , that had chiefly inspired the intellectual integrity which was the rarest and brightest thread of Western culture , not only within the territories of these two nations , but throughout Europe and America .
In the seventeenth and eighteenth Christian centuries , the French and English had conceived , more clearly than other peoples , an interest in the objective world for its own sake , had founded physical science , and had fashioned out of scepticism the most brilliantly constructive of mental instruments .
At a later stage it was largely the French and English who , by means of this instrument , had revealed man and the physical universe in something like their true proportions ; and it was chiefly the elect of these two peoples that had been able to exult in this bracing discovery .
With the eclipse of France and England this great tradition of dispassionate cognizance began to wane .
Europe was now led by Germany .
And the Germans , in spite of their practical genius , their scholarly contributions to history , their brilliant science and austere philosophy , were at heart romantic .
This inclination was both their strength and their weakness .
Thereby they had been inspired to their finest art and their most profound metaphysical speculation .
But thereby they were also often rendered un - self - critical and pompous .
More eager than Western minds to solve the mystery of existence , less sceptical of the power of human reason , and therefore more inclined to ignore or argue away recalcitrant facts , the Germans were courageous systematizers .
In this direction they had achieved greatly .
Without them , European thought would have been chaotic .
But their passion for order and for a systematic reality behind the disorderly appearances , rendered their reasoning all too often biased .
Upon shifty foundations they balanced ingenious ladders to reach the stars .
Thus , without constant ribald criticism from across the Rhine and the North Sea , the Teutonic soul could not achieve full self - expression .
A vague uneasiness about its own sentimentalism and lack of detachment did indeed persuade this great people to assert its virility now and again by ludicrous acts of brutality , and to compensate for its dream life by ceaseless hard - driven and brilliantly successful commerce ; but what was needed was a far more radical self - criticism .
Beyond Germany , Russia .
Here was a people whose genius needed , even more than that of the Germans , discipline under the critical intelligence .
Since the Bolshevic revolution , there had risen in the scattered towns of this immense tract of corn and forest , and still more in the metropolis , an original mode of art and thought , in which were blended a passion of iconoclasm , a vivid sensuousness , and yet also a very remarkable and essentially mystical or intuitive power of detachment from all private cravings .
America and Western Europe were interested first in the individual human life , and only secondarily in the social whole .
For these peoples , loyalty involved a reluctant self - sacrifice , and the ideal was ever a person , excelling in prowess of various kinds .
Society was but the necessary matrix of this jewel .
But the Russians , whether by an innate gift , or through the influence of agelong political tyranny , religious devotion , and a truly social revolution , were prone to self - contemptuous interest in groups , prone , indeed , to a spontaneous worship of whatever was conceived as loftier than the individual man , whether society , or God , or the blind forces of nature .
Western Europe could reach by way of the intellect a precise conception of man 's littleness and irrelevance when regarded as an alien among the stars ; could even glimpse from this standpoint the cosmic theme in which all human striving is but one contributory factor .
But the Russian mind , whether orthodox or Tolstoyan or fanatically materialist , could attain much the same conviction intuitively , by direct perception , instead of after an arduous intellectual pilgrimage ; and , reaching it , could rejoice in it .
But because of this independence of intellect , the experience was confused , erratic , frequently misinterpreted ; and its effect on conduct was rather explosive than directive .
Great indeed was the need that the West and East of Europe should strengthen and temper one another .
After the Bolshevic revolution a new element appeared in Russian culture , and one which had not been known before in any modern state .
The old regime was displaced by a real proletarian government , which , though an oligarchy , and sometimes bloody and fanatical , abolished the old tyranny of class , and encouraged the humblest citizen to be proud of his partnership in the great community .
Still more important , the native Russian disposition not to take material possessions very seriously co-operated with the political revolution , and brought about such a freedom from the snobbery of wealth as was quite foreign to the West .
Attention which elsewhere was absorbed in the massing or display of money was in Russia largely devoted either to spontaneous instinctive enjoyments or to cultural activity .
In fact it was among the Russian townsfolk , less cramped by tradition than other city - dwellers , that the spirit of the First Men was beginning to achieve a fresh and sincere readjustment to the facts of its changing world .
And from the townsfolk something of the new way of life was spreading even to the peasants ; while in the depths of Asia a hardy and ever - growing population looked increasingly to Russia , not only for machinery , but for ideas .
There were times when it seemed that Russia might transform the almost universal autumn of the race into a new spring .
After the Bolshevic revolution the New Russia had been boycotted by the West , and had therefore passed through a stage of self - conscious extravagance .
Communism and naïve materialism became the dogmas of a new crusading atheist church .
All criticism was suppressed , even more rigorously than was the opposite criticism in other countries ; and Russians were taught to think of themselves as saviours of mankind .
Later , however , as economic isolation began to hamper the Bolshevic state , the new culture was mellowed and broadened .
Bit by bit , economic intercourse with the West was restored , and with it cultural intercourse increased .
The intuitive mystical detachment of Russia began to define itself , and so consolidate itself , in terms of the intellectual detachment of the best thought of the West .
Iconoclasm was harnessed .
The life of the senses and of impulse was tempered by a new critical movement .
Fanatical materialism , whose fire had been derived from a misinterpreted , but intense , mystical intuition of dispassionate Reality , began to assimilate itself to the far more rational stoicism which was the rare flower of the West .
At the same time , through intercourse with peasant culture and with the peoples of Asia , the new Russia began to grasp in one unifying act of apprehension both the grave disillusion of France and England and the ecstasy of the East .
The harmonizing of these two moods was now the chief spiritual need of mankind .
Failure to integrate them into an all - dominant sentiment could not but lead to racial insanity .
And so in due course it befell .
Meanwhile this task of integration was coming to seem more and more urgent to the best minds in Russia , and might have been finally accomplished had they been longer illumined by the cold light of the West .
But this was not to be .
The intellectual confidence of France and England , already shaken through progressive economic eclipse at the hands of America and Germany , was now undermined .
For many decades England had watched these newcomers capture her markets .
The loss had smothered her with a swarm of domestic problems , such as could never be solved save by drastic surgery ; and this was a course which demanded more courage and energy than was possible to a people without hope .
Then came the war with France , and harrowing disintegration .
No delirium seized her , such as occurred in France ; yet her whole mentality was changed , and her sobering influence in Europe was lessened .
As for France , her cultural life was now grievously reduced .
It might , indeed , have recovered from the final blow , had it not already been slowly poisoned by gluttonous nationalism .
For love of France was the undoing of the French .
They prized the truly admirable spirit of France so extravagantly , that they regarded all other nations as barbarians .
Thus it befell that in Russia the doctrines of communism and materialism , products of German systematists , survived uncriticized .
On the other hand , the practice of communism was gradually undermined .
For the Russian state came increasingly under the influence of Western , and especially American , finance .
The materialism of the official creed also became a farce , for it was foreign to the Russian mind .
Thus between practice and theory there was , in both respects , a profound inconsistency .
What was once a vital and promising culture became insincere .
4. THE RUSSO - GERMAN WAR
The discrepancy between communist theory and individualist practice in Russia was one cause of the next disaster which befell Europe .
Between Russia and Germany there should have been close partnership , based on interchange of machinery and corn .
But the theory of communism stood in the way , and in a strange manner .
Russian industrial organization had proved impossible without American capital ; and little by little this influence had transformed the communistic system .
From the Baltic to the Himalayas and the Behring Straits , pasture , timber lands , machine - tilled corn-land , oil fields , and a spreading rash of industrial towns , were increasingly dependent on American finance and organization .
Yet not America , but the far less individualistic Germany , had become in the Russian mind the symbol of capitalism .
Self - righteous hate of Germany compensated Russia for her own betrayal of the communistic ideal .
This perverse antagonism was encouraged by the Americans ; who , strong in their own individualism and prosperity , and by now contemptuously tolerant of Russian doctrines , were concerned only to keep Russian finance to themselves .
In truth , of course , it was America that had helped Russia 's self - betrayal ; and it was the spirit of America that was most alien to the Russian spirit .
But American wealth was by now indispensable to Russia ; so the hate due to America had to be borne vicariously by Germany .
The Germans , for their part , were aggrieved that the Americans had ousted them from a most profitable field of enterprise , and in particular from the exploitation of Russian Asiatic oil .
The economic life of the human race had for some time been based on coal , but latterly oil had been found a far more convenient source of power ; and as the oil store of the planet was much smaller than its coal store , and the expenditure of oil had of course been wholly uncontrolled and wasteful , a shortage was already being felt .
Thus the national ownership of the remaining oil fields had become a main factor in politics and a fertile source of wars .
America , having used up most of her own supplies , was now anxious to compete with the still prolific sources under Chinese control , by forestalling Germany in Russia .
No wonder the Germans were aggrieved .
But the fault was their own .
In the days when Russian communism had been seeking to convert the world , Germany had taken over England 's leadership of individualistic Europe .
While greedy for trade with Russia , she had been at the same time frightened of contamination by Russian social doctrine , the more so because communism had at first made some headway among the German workers .
Later , even when sane industrial reorganization in Germany had deprived communism of its appeal to the workers , and thus had rendered it impotent , the habit of anti-communist vituperation persisted .
Thus the peace of Europe was in constant danger from the bickerings of two peoples who differed rather in ideals than in practice .
For the one , in theory communistic , had been forced to delegate many of the community 's rights to enterprising individuals ; while the other , in theory organized on a basis of private business , was becoming ever more socialized .
Neither party desired war .
Neither was interested in military glory , for militarism as an end was no longer reputable .
Neither was professedly nationalistic , for nationalism , though still potent , was no longer vaunted .
Each claimed to stand for internationalism and peace , but accused the other of narrow patriotism .
Thus Europe , though more pacific than ever before , was doomed to war .
Like most wars , the Anglo - French War had increased the desire for peace , yet made peace less secure .
Distrust , not merely the old distrust of nation for nation , but a devastating distrust of human nature , gripped men like the dread of insanity .
Individuals who thought of themselves as wholehearted Europeans , feared that at any moment they might succumb to some ridiculous epidemic of patriotism and participate in the further crippling of Europe .
This dread was one cause of the formation of a European Confederacy , in which all the nations of Europe , save Russia , surrendered their sovereignty to a common authority and actually pooled their armaments .
Ostensibly the motive of this act was peace ; but America interpreted it as directed against herself , and withdrew from the League of Nations .
China , the " natural enemy " of America , remained within the League , hoping to use it against her rival .
From without , indeed , the Confederacy at first appeared as a close - knit whole ; but from within it was known to be insecure , and in every serious crisis it broke .
There is no need to follow the many minor wars of this period , though their cumulative effect was serious , both economically and psychologically .
Europe did at last , however , become something like a single nation in sentiment , though this unity was brought about less by a common loyalty than by a common fear of America .
Final consolidation was the fruit of the Russo - German War , the cause of which was partly economic and partly sentimental .
All the peoples of Europe had long watched with horror the financial conquest of Russia by the United States , and they dreaded that they also must presently succumb to the same tyrant .
To attack Russia , it was thought , would be to wound America in her only vulnerable spot .
But the actual occasion of the war was sentimental .
Half a century after the Anglo - French War , a second - rate German author published a typically German book of the baser sort .
For as each nation had its characteristic virtues , so also each was prone to characteristic follies .
This book was one of those brilliant but extravagant works in which the whole diversity of existence is interpreted under a single formula , with extreme detail and plausibility , yet with amazing naïveté .
Highly astute within its own artificial universe , it was none the less in wider regard quite uncritical .
In two large volumes the author claimed that the cosmos was a dualism in which a heroic and obviously Nordic spirit ruled by divine right over an un-self - disciplined , yet servile and obviously Slavonic spirit .
The whole of history , and of evolution , was interpreted on this principle ; and of the contemporary world it was said that the Slavonic element was poisoning Europe .
One phrase in particular caused fury in Moscow , " the anthropoid face of the Russian sub-man . "
Moscow demanded apology and suppression of the book .
Berlin regretted the insult , but with its tongue in its cheek ; and insisted on the freedom of the press .
Followed a crescendo of radio hate , and war .
The details of this war do not matter to one intent upon the history of mind in the Solar System , but its result was important .
Moscow , Leningrad and Berlin were shattered from the air .
The whole West of Russia was flooded with the latest and deadliest poison gas , so that , not only was all animal and vegetable life destroyed , but also the soil between the Black Sea and the Baltic was rendered infertile and uninhabitable for many years .
Within a week the war was over , for the reason that the combatants were separated by an immense territory in which life could not exist .
But the effects of the war were lasting .
The Germans had set going a process which they could not stop .
Whiffs of the poison continued to be blown by fickle winds into every country of Europe and Western Asia .
It was spring - time ; but save in the Atlantic coast - lands the spring flowers shrivelled in the bud , and every young leaf had a withered rim .
Humanity also suffered ; though , save in the regions near the seat of war , it was in general only the children and the old people who suffered greatly .
The poison spread across the Continent in huge blown tresses , broad as principalities , swinging with each change of wind .
And wherever it strayed , young eyes , throats , and lungs were blighted like the leaves .
America , after much debate , had at last decided to defend her interests in Russia by a punitive expedition against Europe .
China began to mobilize her forces .
But long before America was ready to strike , news of the widespread poisoning changed her policy .
Instead of punishment , help was given .
This was a fine gesture of goodwill .
But also , as was observed in Europe , instead of being costly , it was profitable ; for inevitably it brought more of Europe under American financial control .
The upshot of the Russo - German war , then , was that Europe was unified in sentiment by hatred of America , and that European mentality definitely deteriorated .
This was due in part to the emotional influence of the war itself , partly to the socially damaging effects of the poison .
A proportion of the rising generation had been rendered sickly for life .
During the thirty years which intervened before the Euro - American war , Europe was burdened with an exceptional weight of invalids .
First - class intelligence was on the whole rarer than before , and was more strictly concentrated on the practical work of reconstruction .
Even more disastrous for the human race was the fact that the recent Russian cultural enterprise of harmonizing Western intellectualism and Eastern mysticism was now wrecked .
CHAPTER II .
EUROPE'S DOWNFALL
1. EUROPE AND AMERICA
Over the heads of the European tribes two mightier peoples regarded each other with increasing dislike .
Well might they ; for the one cherished the most ancient and refined of all surviving cultures , while the other , youngest and most self - confident of the great nations , proclaimed her novel spirit as the spirit of the future .
In the Far East , China , already half American , though largely Russian and wholly Eastern , patiently improved her rice lands , pushed forward her railways , organized her industries , and spoke fair to all the world .
Long ago , during her attainment of unity and independence , China had learnt much from militant Bolshevism .
And after the collapse of the Russian state it was in the East that Russian culture continued to live .
Its mysticism influenced India .
Its social ideal influenced China .
Not indeed that China took over the theory , still less the practice , of communism ; but she learnt to entrust herself increasingly to a vigorous , devoted and despotic party , and to feel in terms of the social whole rather than individualistically .
Yet she was honeycombed with individualism , and in spite of her rulers she had precipitated a submerged and desperate class of wage slaves .
In the Far West , the United States of America openly claimed to be custodians of the whole planet .
Universally feared and envied , universally respected for their enterprise , yet for their complacency very widely despised , the Americans were rapidly changing the whole character of man 's existence .
By this time every human being throughout the planet made use of American products , and there was no region where American capital did not support local labour .
Moreover the American press , gramophone , radio , cinematograph and televisor ceaselessly drenched the planet with American thought .
Year by year the aether reverberated with echoes of New York 's pleasures and the religious fervours of the Middle West .
What wonder , then , that America , even while she was despised , irresistibly moulded the whole human race .
This , perhaps , would not have mattered , had America been able to give of her very rare best .
But inevitably only her worst could be propagated .
Only the most vulgar traits of that potentially great people could get through into the minds of foreigners by means of these crude instruments .
And so , by the floods of poison issuing from this people 's baser members , the whole world , and with it the nobler parts of America herself , were irrevocably corrupted .
For the best of America was too weak to withstand the worst .
Americans had indeed contributed amply to human thought .
They had helped to emancipate philosophy from ancient fetters .
They had served science by lavish and rigorous research .
In astronomy , favoured by their costly instruments and clear atmosphere , they had done much to reveal the dispositions of the stars and galaxies .
In literature , though often they behaved as barbarians , they had also conceived new modes of expression , and moods of thought not easily appreciated in Europe .
They had also created a new and brilliant architecture .
And their genius for organization worked upon a scale that was scarcely conceivable , let alone practicable , to other peoples .
In fact their best minds faced old problems of theory and of valuation with a fresh innocence and courage , so that fogs of superstition were cleared away wherever these choice Americans were present .
But these best were after all a minority in a huge wilderness of opinionated self - deceivers , in whom , surprisingly , an outworn religious dogma was championed with the intolerant optimism of youth .
For this was essentially a race of bright , but arrested , adolescents .
Something lacked which should have enabled them to grow up .
One who looks back across the aeons to this remote people can see their fate already woven of their circumstance and their disposition , and can appreciate the grim jest that these , who seemed to themselves gifted to rejuvenate the planet , should have plunged it , inevitably , through spiritual desolation into senility and age - long night .
Inevitably .
Yet here was a people of unique promise , gifted innately beyond all other peoples .
Here was a race brewed of all the races , and mentally more effervescent than any .
Here were intermingled Anglo - Saxon stubbornness , Teutonic genius for detail and systematization , Italian gaiety , the intense fire of Spain , and the more mobile Celtic flame .
Here also was the sensitive and stormy Slav , a youth - giving Negroid infusion , a faint but subtly stimulating trace of the Red Man , and in the West a sprinkling of the Mongol .
Mutual intolerance no doubt isolated these diverse stocks to some degree ; yet the whole was increasingly one people , proud of its individuality , of its success , of its idealistic mission in the world , proud also of its optimistic and anthropocentric view of the universe .
What might not this energy have achieved , had it been more critically controlled , had it been forced to attend to life 's more forbidding aspects !
Direct tragic experience might perhaps have opened the hearts of this people .
Intercourse with a more mature culture might have refined their intelligence .
But the very success which had intoxicated them rendered them also too complacent to learn from less prosperous competitors .
Yet there was a moment when this insularity promised to wane .
So long as England was a serious economic rival , America inevitably regarded her with suspicion .
But when England was seen to be definitely in economic decline , yet culturally still at her zenith , America conceived a more generous interest in the last and severest phase of English thought .
Eminent Americans themselves began to whisper that perhaps their unrivalled prosperity was not after all good evidence either of their own spiritual greatness or of the moral rectitude of the universe .
A minute but persistent school of writers began to affirm that America lacked self - criticism , was incapable of seeing the joke against herself , was in fact wholly devoid of that detachment and resignation which was the finest , though of course the rarest , mood of latter - day England .
This movement might well have infused throughout the American people that which was needed to temper their barbarian egotism , and open their ears once more to the silence beyond man 's strident sphere .
Once more , for only latterly had they been seriously deafened by the din of their own material success .
And indeed , scattered over the continent throughout this whole period , many shrinking islands of true culture contrived to keep their heads above the rising tide of vulgarity and superstition .
These it was that had looked to Europe for help , and were attempting a rally when England and France blundered into that orgy of emotionalism and murder which exterminated so many of their best minds and permanently weakened their cultural influence .
Subsequently it was Germany that spoke for Europe .
And Germany was too serious an economic rival for America to be open to her influence .
Moreover German criticism , though often emphatic , was too heavily pedantic , too little ironical , to pierce the hide of American complacency .
Thus it was that America sank further and further into Americanism .
Vast wealth and industry , and also brilliant invention , were concentrated upon puerile ends .
In particular the whole of American life was organized around the cult of the powerful individual , that phantom ideal which Europe herself had only begun to outgrow in her last phase .
Those Americans who wholly failed to realize this ideal , who remained at the bottom of the social ladder , either consoled themselves with hopes for the future , or stole symbolical satisfaction by identifying themselves with some popular star , or gloated upon their American citizenship , and applauded the arrogant foreign policy of their government .
Those who achieved power were satisfied so long as they could merely retain it , and advertise it uncritically in the conventionally self - assertive manners .
It was almost inevitable that when Europe had recovered from the Russo - German disaster she should come to blows with America ; for she had long chafed under the saddle of American finance , and the daily life of Europeans had become more and more cramped by the presence of a widespread and contemptuous foreign " aristocracy " of American business men .
Germany alone was comparatively free from this domination , for Germany was herself still a great economic power .
But in Germany , no less than elsewhere , there was constant friction with the Americans .
Of course neither Europe nor America desired war .
Each was well aware that war would mean the end of business prosperity , and for Europe very possibly the end of all things ; for it was known that man 's power of destruction had recently increased , and that if war were waged relentlessly , the stronger side might exterminate the other .
But inevitably an " incident " at last occurred which roused blind rage on each side of the Atlantic .
A murder in South Italy , a few ill - considered remarks in the European Press , offensive retaliation in the American Press accompanied by the lynching of an Italian in the Middle West , an uncontrollable massacre of American citizens in Rome , the dispatch of an American air fleet to occupy Italy , interception by the European air fleet , and war was in existence before ever it had been declared .
This aerial action resulted , perhaps unfortunately for Europe , in a momentary check to the American advance .
The enemy was put on his mettle , and prepared a crushing blow .
2. THE ORIGINS OF A MYSTERY
While the Americans were mobilizing their whole armament , there occurred the really interesting event of the war .
It so happened that an international society of scientific workers was meeting in England at Plymouth , and a young Chinese physicist had expressed his desire to make a report to a select committee .
As he had been experimenting to find means for the utilization of subatomic energy by the annihilation of matter , it was with some excitement that , according to instruction , the forty international representatives travelled to the north coast of Devon and met upon the bare headland called Hartland Point .
It was a bright morning after rain .
Eleven miles to the north - west , the cliffs of Lundy Island displayed their markings with unusual detail .
Sea - birds wheeled about the heads of the party as they seated themselves on their raincoats in a cluster upon the rabbit - cropped turf .
They were a remarkable company , each one of them a unique person , yet characterized to some extent by his particular national type .
And all were distinctively " scientists " of the period .
Formerly this would have implied a rather uncritical leaning toward materialism , and an affectation of cynicism ; but by now it was fashionable to profess an equally uncritical belief that all natural phenomena were manifestations of the cosmic mind .
In both periods , when a man passed beyond the sphere of his own serious scientific work he chose his beliefs irresponsibly , according to his taste , much as he chose his recreation or his food .
Of the individuals present we may single out one or two for notice .
The German , an anthropologist , and a product of the long - established cult of physical and mental health , sought to display in his own athletic person the characters proper to Nordic man .
The Frenchman , an old but still sparkling psychologist , whose queer hobby was the collecting of weapons , ancient and modern , regarded the proceedings with kindly cynicism .
The Englishman , one of the few remaining intellectuals of his race , compensated for the severe study of physics by a scarcely less devoted research into the history of English expletives and slang , delighting to treat his colleagues to the fruits of his toil .
The West African president of the Society was a biologist , famous for his interbreeding of man and ape .
When all were settled , the President explained the purpose of the meeting .
The utilization of subatomic energy had indeed been achieved , and they were to be given a demonstration .
The young Mongol stood up , and produced from a case an instrument rather like the old - fashioned rifle .
Displaying this object , he spoke as follows , with that quaintly stilted formality which had once been characteristic of all educated Chinese : " Before describing the details of my rather delicate process , I will illustrate its importance by showing what can be done with the finished product .
Not only can I initiate the annihilation of matter , but also I can do so at a distance and in a precise direction .
Moreover , I can inhibit the process .
As a means of destruction , my instrument is perfect .
As a source of power for the constructive work of mankind , it has unlimited potentiality .
Gentlemen , this is a great moment in the history of Man .
I am about to render into the hands of organized intelligence the means to stop for ever man 's internecine brawls .
Henceforth this great Society , of which you are the elite , will beneficently rule the planet .
With this little instrument you will stop the ridiculous war ; and with another , which I shall soon perfect , you will dispense unlimited industrial power wherever you consider it needed .
Gentlemen , with the aid of this handy instrument which I have the honour to demonstrate , you are able to become absolute masters of this planet . "
Here the representative of England muttered an archaism whose significance was known only to himself , " Gawd 'elp us ! "
In the minds of some of those foreigners who were not physicists this quaint expression was taken to be a technical word having some connexion with the new source of energy .
The Mongol continued .
Turning towards
Lundy , he said , " That island is no longer inhabited , and as it is something of a danger to shipping , I will remove it . "
So saying he aimed his instrument at the distant cliff , but continued speaking .
" This trigger will stimulate the ultimate positive and negative charges which constitute the atoms at a certain point on the rock face to annihilate each other .
These stimulated atoms will infect their neighbours , and so on indefinitely .
This second trigger , however , will stop the actual annihilation .
Were I to refrain from using it , the process would indeed continue indefinitely , perhaps until the whole of the planet had disintegrated . "
There was an anxious movement among the spectators , but the young man took careful aim , and pressed the two triggers in quick succession .
No sound from the instrument .
No visible effect upon the smiling face of the island .
Laughter began to gurgle from the Englishman , but ceased .
For a dazzling point of light appeared on the remote cliff .
It increased in size and brilliance , till all eyes were blinded in the effort to continue watching .
It lit up the under parts of the clouds and blotted out the sun-cast shadows of gorse bushes beside the spectators .
The whole end of the island facing the mainland was now an intolerable scorching sun .
Presently , however , its fury was veiled in clouds of steam from the boiling sea .
Then suddenly the whole island , three miles of solid granite , leaped asunder ; so that a covey of great rocks soared heavenward , and beneath them swelled more slowly a gigantic mushroom of steam and debris .
Then the sound arrived .
All hands were clapped to ears , while eyes still strained to watch the bay , pocked white with the hail of rocks .
Meanwhile a great wall of sea advanced from the centre of turmoil .
This was seen to engulf a coasting vessel , and pass on toward Bideford and Barnstaple .
The spectators leaped to their feet and clamoured , while the young author of this fury watched the spectacle with exultation , and some surprise at the magnitude of these mere after - effects of his process .
The meeting was now adjourned to a neighbouring chapel to hear the report of the research .
As the representatives were filing through the door it was observed that the steam and smoke had cleared , and that open sea extended where had been Lundy .
Within the chapel , the great Bible was decorously removed and the windows thrown open , to dispel somewhat the odour of sanctity .
For though the early and spiritistic interpretations of relativity and the quantum theory had by now accustomed men of science to pay their respects to the religions , many of them were still liable to a certain asphyxia when they were actually within the precincts of sanctity .
When the scientists had settled themselves upon the archaic and unyielding benches , the President explained that the chapel authorities had kindly permitted this meeting because they realized that , since men of science had gradually discovered the spiritual foundation of physics , science and religion must henceforth be close allies .
Moreover the purpose of this meeting was to discuss one of those supreme mysteries which it was the glory of science to discover and religion to transfigure .
The President then complimented the young dispenser of power upon his triumph , and called upon him to address the meeting .
At this point , however , the aged representative of France intervened , and was granted a hearing .
Born almost a hundred and forty years earlier , and preserved more by native intensity of spirit than by the artifices of the regenerator , this ancient seemed to speak out of a remote and wiser epoch .
For in a declining civilization it is often the old who see furthest and see with youngest eyes .
He concluded a rather long , rhetorical , yet closely reasoned speech as follows : " No doubt we are the intelligence of the planet ; and because of our consecration to our calling , no doubt we are comparatively honest .
But alas , even we are human .
We make little mistakes now and then , and commit little indiscretions .
The possession of such power as is offered us would not bring peace .
On the contrary it would perpetuate our national hates .
It would throw the world into confusion .
It would undermine our own integrity , and turn us into tyrants .
Moreover it would ruin science .
And , -- well , when at last through some little error the world got blown up , the disaster would not be regrettable .
I know that Europe is almost certainly about to be destroyed by those vigorous but rather spoilt children across the Atlantic .
But distressing as this must be , the alternative is far worse .
No , Sir !
Your very wonderful toy would be a gift fit for developed minds ; but for us , who are still barbarians , -- no , it must not be .
And so , with deep regret I beg you to destroy your handiwork , and , if it were possible , your memory of your marvellous research .
But above all breathe no word of your process to us , or to any man . "
The German then protested that to refuse would be cowardly .
He briefly described his vision of a world organized under organized science , and inspired by a scientifically organized religious dogma .
" Surely , " he said , " to refuse were to refuse the gift of God , of that God whose presence in the humblest quantum we have so recently and so surprisingly revealed . "
Other speakers followed , for and against ; but it soon grew clear that wisdom would prevail .
Men of science were by now definitely cosmopolitan in sentiment .
Indeed so far were they from nationalism , that on this occasion the representative of America had urged acceptance of the weapon , although it would be used against his own countrymen .
Finally , however , and actually by a unanimous vote , the meeting , while recording its deep respect for the Chinese scientist , requested , nay ordered , that the instrument and all account of it should be destroyed .
The young man rose , drew his handiwork from its case , and fingered it .
So long did he remain thus standing in silence with eyes fixed on the instrument , that the meeting became restless .
At last , however , he spoke .
" I shall abide by the decision of the meeting .
Well , it is hard to destroy the fruit of ten years ' work , and such fruit , too .
I expected to have the gratitude of mankind ; but instead I am an outcast . "
Once more he paused .
Gazing out of the window , he now drew from his pocket a field - glass , and studied the western sky .
" Yes , they are American .
Gentlemen , the American air fleet approaches . "
The company leapt to its feet and crowded to the windows .
High in the west a sparse line of dots stretched indefinitely into the north and the south .
Said the Englishman , " For God 's sake use your damned tool once more , or England 's done .
They must have smashed our fellows over the Atlantic . "
The Chinese scientist turned his eyes on the President .
There was a general cry of " Stop them . "
Only the Frenchman protested .
The representative of the United States raised his voice and said , " They are my people , I have friends up there in the sky .
My own boy is probably there .
But they 're mad .
They want to do something hideous .
They 're in the lynching mood .
Stop them . "
The Mongol still gazed at the President , who nodded .
The Frenchman broke down in senile tears .
Then the young man , leaning upon the window sill , took careful aim at each black dot in turn .
One by one , each became a blinding star , then vanished .
In the chapel , a long silence .
Then whispers ; and glances at the Chinaman , expressive of anxiety and dislike .
There followed a hurried ceremony in a neighbouring field .
A fire was lit .
The instrument and the no less murderous manuscript were burnt .
And then the grave young Mongol , having insisted on shaking hands all round , said , " With my secret alive in me , I must not live .
Some day a more worthy race will re-discover it , but today I am a danger to the planet .
And so I , who have foolishly ignored that I live among savages , help myself now by the ancient wisdom to pass hence . "
So saying , he fell dead .
3. EUROPE MURDERED
Rumour spread by voice and radio throughout the world .
An island had been mysteriously exploded .
The American fleet had been mysteriously annihilated in the air .
And in the neighbourhood where these events had occurred , distinguished scientists were gathered in conference .
The European Government sought out the unknown saviour of Europe , to thank him , and secure his process for their own use .
The President of the scientific society gave an account of the meeting and the unanimous vote .
He and his colleagues were promptly arrested , and " pressure , " first moral and then physical , was brought to bear on them to make them disclose the secret ; for the world was convinced that they really knew it , and were holding it back for their own purposes .
Meanwhile it was learned that the American air commander , after he had defeated the European fleet , had been instructed merely to " demonstrate " above England while peace was negotiated .
For in America , big business had threatened the government with boycott if unnecessary violence were committed in Europe .
Big business was by now very largely international in sentiment , and it was realized that the destruction of Europe would inevitably unhinge American finance .
But the unprecedented disaster to the victorious fleet roused the Americans to blind hate , and the peace party was submerged .
Thus it turned out that the Chinaman 's one hostile act had not saved England , but doomed her .
For some days Europeans lived in panic dread , knowing not what horror might at any moment descend on them .
No wonder , then , that the Government resorted to torture in order to extract the secret from the scientists .
No wonder that out of the forty individuals concerned , one , the Englishman , saved himself by deceit .
He promised to do his best to " remember " the intricate process .
Under strict supervision , he used his own knowledge of physics to experiment in search of the Chinaman 's trick .
Fortunately , however , he was on the wrong scent .
And indeed he knew it .
For though his first motive was mere self - preservation , later he conceived the policy of indefinitely preventing the dangerous discovery by directing research along a blind alley .
And so his treason , by seeming to give the authority of a most eminent physicist to a wholly barren line of research , saved this undisciplined and scarcely human race from destroying its planet .
The American people , sometimes tender even to excess , were now collectively insane with hate of the English and of all Europeans .
With cold efficiency they flooded Europe with the latest and deadliest of gasses , till all the peoples were poisoned in their cities like rats in their holes .
The gas employed was such that its potency would cease within three days .
It was therefore possible for an American sanitary force to take charge of each metropolis within a week after the attack .
Of those who first descended into the great silence of the murdered cities , many were unhinged by the overwhelming presence of dead populations .
The gas had operated first upon the ground level , but , rising like a tide , it had engulfed the top stories , the spires , the hills .
Thus , while in the streets lay thousands who had been overcome by the first wave of poison , every roof and pinnacle bore the bodies of those who had struggled upwards in the vain hope of escaping beyond the highest reach of the tide .
When the invaders arrived they beheld on every height prostrate and contorted figures .
Thus Europe died .
All centres of intellectual life were blotted out , and of the agricultural regions only the uplands and mountains were untouched .
The spirit of Europe lived henceforth only in a piece - meal and dislocated manner in the minds of Americans , Chinese , Indians , and the rest .
There were indeed the British Colonies , but they were by now far less European than American .
The war had , of course , disintegrated the British Empire .
Canada sided with the United States .
South Africa and India declared their neutrality at the outbreak of war .
Australia , not through cowardice , but through conflict of loyalties , was soon reduced to neutrality .
The New Zealanders took to their mountains and maintained an insane but heroic resistance for a year .
A simple and gallant folk , they had almost no conception of the European spirit , yet obscurely and in spite of their Americanization they were loyal to it , or at least to that symbol of one aspect of Europeanism , " England . "
Indeed so extravagantly loyal were they , or so innately dogged and opinionated , that when further resistance became impossible , many of them , both men and women , killed themselves rather than submit .
But the most lasting agony of this war was suffered , not by the defeated , but by the victors .
For when their passion had cooled the Americans could not easily disguise from themselves that they had committed murder .
They were not at heart a brutal folk , but rather a kindly .
They liked to think of the world as a place of innocent pleasure - seeking , and of themselves as the main purveyors of delight .
Yet they had been somehow drawn into this fantastic crime ; and henceforth an all - pervading sense of collective guilt warped the American mind .
They had ever been vainglorious and intolerant ; but now these qualities in them became extravagant even to insanity .
Both as individuals and collectively , they became increasingly frightened of criticism , increasingly prone to blame and hate , increasingly self - righteous , increasingly hostile to the critical intelligence , increasingly superstitious .
Thus was this once noble people singled out by the gods to be cursed , and the minister of curses .
CHAPTER III .
AMERICA AND CHINA
1. THE RIVALS
After the eclipse of Europe , the allegiance of men gradually crystallized into two great national or racial sentiments , the American and the Chinese .
Little by little all other patriotisms became mere local variants of one or other of these two major loyalties .
At first , indeed , there were many internecine conflicts .
A detailed history of this period would describe how North America , repeating the welding process of the ancient " American Civil War , " incorporated within itself the already Americanized Latins of South America ; and how Japan , once the bully of young China , was so crippled by social revolutions that she fell a prey to American Imperialism ; and how this bondage turned her violently Chinese in sentiment , so that finally she freed herself by an heroic war of independence , and joined the Asiatic Confederacy , under Chinese leadership .
A full history would also tell of the vicissitudes of the League of Nations .
Although never a cosmopolitan government , but an association of national governments , each concerned mainly for its own sovereignty , this great organization had gradually gained a very real prestige and authority over all its members .
And in spite of its many short - comings , most of which were involved in its fundamental constitution , it was invaluable as the great concrete focusing point of the growing loyalty toward humanity .
At first its existence had been precarious ; and indeed it had only preserved itself by an extreme caution , amounting almost to servility toward the " great powers . "
Little by little , however , it had gained moral authority to such an extent that no single power , even the mightiest , dared openly and in cold blood either to disobey the will of the League or reject the findings of the High Court .
But , since human loyalty was still in the main national rather than cosmopolitan , situations were all too frequent in which a nation would lose its head , run amok , throw its pledges to the winds , and plunge into fear - inspired aggression .
Such a situation had produced the Anglo - French War .
At other times the nations would burst apart into two great camps , and the League would be temporarily forgotten in their disunion .
This happened in the Russo - German War , which was possible only because America favoured Russia , and China favoured Germany .
After the destruction of Europe , the world had for a while consisted of the League on one side and America on the other .
But the League was dominated by China , and no longer stood for cosmopolitanism .
This being so , those whose loyalty was genuinely human worked hard to bring America once more into the fold , and at last succeeded .
In spite of the League 's failure to prevent the " great " wars , it worked admirably in preventing all the minor conflicts which had once been a chronic disease of the race .
Latterly , indeed , the world 's peace was absolutely secure , save when the League itself was almost equally divided .
Unfortunately , with the rise of America and China , this kind of situation became more and more common .
During the war of North and South America an attempt was made to re-create the League as a Cosmopolitan Sovereignty , controlling the pooled armaments of all nations .
But , though the cosmopolitan will was strong , tribalism was stronger .
The upshot was that , over the Japanese question , the League definitely split into two Leagues , each claiming to inherit universal sovereignty from the old League , but each in reality dominated by a kind of supernational sentiment , the one American , the other Chinese .
This occurred within a century after the eclipse of Europe .
The second century completed the process of crystallization into two systems , political and mental .
On the one hand was the wealthy and close - knit American Continental Federation , with its poor relations , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , the bedridden remains of Western Europe , and part of the soulless body that was Russia .
On the other hand were Asia and Africa .
In fact the ancient distinction between East and West had now become the basis of political sentiment and organization .
Within each system there were of course real differences of culture , of which the chief was the difference between the Chinese and Indian mentalities .
The Chinese were interested in appearances , in the sensory , the urbane , the practical ; while the Indians inclined to seek behind appearances for some ultimate reality , of which this life , they said , was but a passing aspect .
Thus the average Indian never took to heart the practical social problem in all its seriousness .
The ideal of perfecting this world was never an all - absorbing interest to him ; since he had been taught to believe that this world was mere shadow .
There was , indeed , a time when China had mentally less in common with India than with the West , but fear of America had drawn the two great Eastern peoples together .
They agreed at least in earnest hate of that strange blend of the commercial traveller , the missionary , and the barbarian conqueror , which was the American abroad .
China , owing to her relative weakness and irritation caused by the tentacles of American industry within her , was at this time more nationalistic than her rival , America .
Indeed , professed to have outgrown nationalism , and to stand for political and cultural world unity .
But she conceived this unity as a Unity under American organization ; and by culture she meant Americanism .
This kind of cosmopolitanism was regarded by Asia and Africa without sympathy .
In China a concerted effort had been made to purge the foreign element from her culture .
Its success , however , was only superficial .
Pigtails and chopsticks had once more come into vogue among the leisured , and the study of Chinese classics was once more compulsory in all schools .
Yet the manner of life of the average man remained American .
Not only did he use American cutlery , shoes , gramophones , domestic labour - saving devices , but also his alphabet was European , his vocabulary was permeated by American slang , his newspapers and radio were American in manner , though anti-American in politics .
He saw daily in his domestic television screen every phase of American private life and every American public event .
Instead of opium and joss sticks , he affected cigarettes and chewing gum .
His thought also was largely a Mongolian variant of American thought .
For instance , since his was a non-metaphysical mind , but since also some kind of metaphysics is unavoidable , he accepted the naïvely materialistic metaphysics which had been popularized by the earliest Behaviourists .
In this view the only reality was physical energy , and the mind was but the system of the body 's movements in response to stimulus .
Behaviourism had formerly played a great part in purging the best Western minds of superstition ; and indeed at one time it was the chief growing point of thought .
This early , pregnant , though extravagant , doctrine it was that had been absorbed by China .
But in its native land Behaviorism had gradually been infected by the popular demand for comfortable ideas , and had finally changed into a curious kind of spiritism , according to which , though the ultimate reality was indeed physical energy , this energy was identified with the divine spirit .
The most dramatic feature of American thought in this period was the merging of Behaviorism and Fundamentalism , a belated and degenerate mode of Christianity .
Behaviourism itself , indeed , had been originally a kind of inverted Puritan faith , according to which intellectual salvation involved acceptance of a crude materialistic dogma , chiefly because it was repugnant to the self - righteous , and unintelligible to intellectuals of the earlier schools .
The older Puritans trampled down all fleshy impulses ; these newer Puritans trampled no less self - righteously upon the spiritual cravings .
But in the increasingly spiritistic inclination of physics itself , Behaviorism and Fundamentalism had found a meeting place .
Since the ultimate stuff of the physical universe was now said to be multitudinous and arbitrary " quanta " of the activity of " spirits , " how easy was it for the materialistic and the spiritistic to agree !
At heart , indeed , they were never far apart in mood , though opposed in doctrine .
The real cleavage was between the truly spiritual view on the one hand , and the spiritistic and materialistic on the other .
Thus the most materialistic of Christian sects and the most doctrinaire of scientific sects were not long in finding a formula to express their unity , their denial of all those finer capacities which had emerged to be the spirit of man .
These two faiths were at one in their respect for crude physical movement .
And here lay the deepest difference between the American and the Chinese minds .
For the former , activity , any sort of activity , was an end in itself ; for the latter , activity was but a progress toward the true end , which was rest , and peace of mind .
Action was to be undertaken only when equilibrium was disturbed .
And in this respect China was at one with India .
Both preferred contemplation to action .
Thus in China and India the passion for wealth was less potent than in America .
Wealth was the power to set things and people in motion ; and in America , therefore , wealth came to be frankly regarded as the breath of God , the divine spirit immanent in man .
God was the supreme Boss , the universal Employer .
His wisdom was conceived as a stupendous efficiency , his love as munificence towards his employees .
The parable of the talents was made the corner - stone of education ; and to be wealthy , therefore , was to be respected as one of God 's chief agents .
The typical American man of big business was one who , in the midst of a show of luxury , was at heart ascetic .
He valued his splendour only because it advertised to all men that he was of the elect .
The typical Chinese wealthy man was one who savoured his luxury with a delicate and lingering palate , and was seldom tempted to sacrifice it to the barren lust of power .
On the other hand , since American culture was wholly concerned with the values of the individual life , it was more sensitive than the Chinese with regard to the well - being of humble individuals .
Therefore industrial conditions were far better under American than under Chinese capitalism .
And in China both kinds of capitalism existed side by side .

County buys new voting system
By Katie Klingsporn
San Miguel County ’s days of oldfangled , pencil pushing , counting - machine elections are over .
The County Commissioners approved the purchase of a new electronic voting system on Wednesday – one with all of the bells and whistles that make it compliant with federal law .
This system will do away with the paper ballot system that San Miguel County has historically employed to conduct elections , and at the same time will bring the county in compliance with the Help Americans Vote Act ( HAVA ) , which was passed in the wake of the disorderly and disputed 2000 presidential election .
HAVA aims to avoid election debacles by phasing out old systems that may be confusing or insecure , and it applies to every county in the nation .
What Do You Want to Be Free to Choose ?
By Bryan Caplan
Here ’s a question for libertarians ( though of course others should feel free to answer ) :
What currently illegal thing do you personally really want to be free to do ?
Set aside “ not pay taxes ” ; that ’s too easy .
For me , anyway , the truth is that I ’m so bourgeois that I ’m already free to do almost everything that I want to do .
What about you ?
P.S. My answer : I want to be free to hire people from other countries .
My sympathy and my self - interest point in the same direction .

Facebook HAVANA ( AP )  Eight Americans who graduated from a Cuban medical school say they will put the education paid for by Fidel Castro 's communist government to use in hospitals back home .
Four New Yorkers , three Californians and a Minnesotan , all from minority backgrounds , have studied in Havana since April 2001 , forming the first class of American graduates from the Latin American School of Medicine .
One other American previously graduated from the school after transferring from a U.S. university , but the six women and two men graduating Tuesday were the first Americans to complete the entire six - year program since Castro offered the free medical training to U.S. students .
The offer followed a meeting a delegation from the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus .
The students said that much of what they learned in Cuba matched the curriculum at American medical schools , but that instructors here placed a special emphasis on preventative care .
" I will be heading back to the United States with a great advantage over the American students who have stayed there , " said Wing Wu , from Minneapolis , Minnesota .
" I 've learned that medicine is not a business , it 's social , it 's humane , " said Toussaint Reynolds , a graduate from Massapequa , New York .
" I will be a better doctor in the United States for it . "
The 80 - year - old Castro has not been seen in public since last July 31 , when he announced that emergency intestinal surgery was forcing him to step down in favor of his younger brother Raul , the 76 - year - old defense minister .
Vice President Carlos Lage and other top Cuban leaders attended a graduation ceremony Tuesday evening at Havana 's Karl Marx theater .
Wearing white robes , the Americans were among more than 2,100 students from about 25 countries who received diplomas .
More than 10,000 students now attend the Latin American School , which opened in 1999 to provide free medical training to foreign students from disadvantaged families .
Washington 's 45 - year - old embargo prohibits most Americans from traveling to Cuba and chokes off nearly all trade between the countries .
But the U.S. State Department has not opposed the medical school program , saying American policy hopes to encourage contact between ordinary Cubans and Americans .
U.S. authorities have suggested that it is unclear whether Americans who receive Cuban medical training can meet licensing requirements in the United States .
The graduates will have to pass two exams to apply for residency at American hospitals , then eventually pass a third .
But the U.S. transfer student who graduated from the Cuban school recently began his residency at a New York City hospital .
His experience gave hope to Tuesday 's graduating class .
" Do I think there will be prejudices against us when we go back to the States and are looking for residences ?
Yes , it 's inevitable , " said Kenya Bingham , from Alameda , Calif .
" I think there will be just due to the simple fact that there are political differences between the two countries . "
The students held a news conference with the Rev. Lucius Walker , leader of the U.S. non-profit Pastors for Peace .
He has worked closely with the graduates .
He said about 100 other Americans are currently enrolled at the Latin American School , and another 18 are starting next month .
Michael Moore's hit documentary Sicko praised Cuba 's universal health care system , featuring scenes where the filmmaker brought ailing Sept. 11 rescue workers to the island for treatment .
Graduate Carmen Landau , 30 , of Oakland , noted in an e-mail that chronic shortages of medicine and equipment in Cuba — much of it caused by the embargo — make health care here far more complicated than Moore 's documentary suggested .
" This is a highly flawed system , " Landau wrote .
" After six years here I could go on and on regarding things that I think should be different . "
But she also praised Sicko , saying " it may be what we need to reform a system that is broken in the United States . "

I highlighted an
a few days ago about the possibility that we are now in a world wide economic bubble .
If it is true then we are in for scary times .
Today I found another article that hints at the same problem .
This time it is the Governor of Bank of Canada , David Dodge that has expressed concern .
Mr. Dodge indicated he was more concerned about the global liquidity glut and its fuelling of takeover activity by private - equity funds .
Private equity pools and hedge funds " seem to have an inexhaustible supply " of liquidity behind them , driving a trend to " take companies out of the public domain , " Mr. Dodge said .
A glut of liquidity will tend to drive the up the price of real assets .
Raghuram G. Rajan explained this in a speech in indonesia :
The mismatch between unabated global desired savings and lower realized investment , between the amounts available for finance and the flow of hard assets to absorb it , has led to a liquidity glut which has pushed long term real interest rates the world over lower .
This has spilt over into markets for existing real and financial assets — real estate , high - risk credit , private equity , art , commodities , etc — pushing prices higher .
Indeed , casual empiricism suggests that the most illiquid markets , where typically there are few transactions , and small infusions of liquidity can have substantial effect , have been pushed the highest .
Shorter version : Assets prices rise when there is too much money around .
Sounds like this talk of a a global economic bubble sounds a bit more real .
Here is another
:
Worldwide , an abundance of liquidity has lured investors into riskier assets in search of higher returns .
Though there is no agreement on how to measure liquidity , using the global supply of dollars as a proxy , The Economist estimates that in the past four years it has risen by an annual average of 18 % , probably the fastest pace ever .
And Alan Greenspan has also warned of
.
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned on Wednesday a global glut in liquidity would result in a fall in asset prices .
Greenspan , speaking to a financial conference in Seoul via satellite , ... said the market value of assets worldwide had been rising faster than nominal gross domestic product globally due to a decline in real long - term interest rates over the years and a significant fall in real equity premiums .
“ A good part of this expansion is a direct function of the decline in real equity premiums , ” Greenspan said .
“ That can not go on indefinitely . ”
He said asset prices would begin to fall , but did not predict when that would happen .
“ I am reasonably certain that what we are looking at today is an abnormal situation , ” he said ...
Conclusion :
We are in an asset price bubble so big and so broad that we could the forest for the trees .
Shorter Conclusion : Oh Shit .
Illustration by Mark Matcho 1 . Galileo's balls
Contrary to what your teachers told you , Galileo Galilei likely did not drop balls from the Tower of Pisa ; he conducted the gravity experiment in the laboratory of his mind .
His 16th - century peers believed heavier objects fell faster than light ones .
So Galileo imagined a heavy ball attached by a string to a light ball .
Would the light ball create drag and slow the heavy one down ?
Nope , he concluded , they would hit the ground simultaneously .
__2 . Schrödinger 's cat __
A cat is trapped in a box with radioactive material , a Geiger counter , and a mechanism rigged to release poison if particle decay is detected .
According to Erwin Schrödinger , the cat exists in two probable states .
But that does n't track with reality ( cats are not both alive and dead ) .
Proposed in 1935 , the postulate illustrates that some quantum concepts just do n't work at nonquantum scales .
Also that Schrödinger was a dog person .
3. Searle 's room
A man sits alone in a room .
Someone slips paper with Chinese writing on it under the door .
The man does n't read Chinese , but with a set of instructions he 's able to manipulate the symbols and respond .
To an observer , the man appears to understand the language .
Philosopher John Searle devised the scenario in 1980 to make a point about computers .
CPUs , like his man , lack comprehension and thus can't have humanlike intelligence .
_ _4 . Hawking 's turtles __
The 1988 book A Brief History of Time begins with the story of a scientist giving a lecture on astronomy .
At the conclusion of his talk , a woman insists he 's wrong : Earth is a flat plate carried on the back of a giant turtle .
The scientist asks what the turtle is standing on , and the woman says , " It 's turtles all the way down ! "
Stephen Hawking used the story to caution fellow cosmologists against piling one unproven theory upon another .
5. Einstein 's light beam
When he was 16 , Albert Einstein daydreamed about chasing after a beam of light until he caught up to it .
At that point , young Einstein reasoned , the light wave would appear frozen .
The problem :
This was impossible according to the thinking back in 1895 .
Somehow , this little glitch led Einstein right to the theory of special relativity .
Lost ?
Do n't worry .
Physicists still debate exactly how this mental exercise got him there .

Borel 's monkeys
Variations go back to Aristotle , but the modern version of the infinite - monkey theorem was introduced in 1913 by French mathematician Émile Borel .
You know the deal :
An infinite number of monkeys pecking at typewriters for an infinite length of time will " almost surely " produce the complete works of Shakespeare .
Seems unlikely , because our minds have a hard time grasping the infinite .
Mathematically , it 's true .
7. Maxwell 's demon
In 1867 , James Clerk Maxwell pictured two chambers , A and B , each filled with gas at the same temperature and with a door between them .
Theorists later had a demon open the door ( without doing any work ) to let the fastest - moving molecules pass from A into B , and the slowest from B to A .
Over time , the speed of the atoms ( and therefore the temperature ) increases in B — a violation of the second law of thermodynamics .

Parfit 's teleporter
Philosopher Derek Parfit is famous for basing thought experiments on sci-fi .
In 1984 , he envisioned a teleporter malfunction , like the one that made two James T. Kirks in an episode of Star Trek .
Teleporters annihilate every particle in you , then rebuild them from scratch .
What happens if the original is n't destroyed ?
Which is the real you ?
Parfit says both .
Evil Kirk would disagree .

When E. Howard
Hunt died a few months ago , there was speculation that he would leave behind a confession .
At first , it appeared he had not , but now Rolling Stone is running with a story based on a confession Hunt made to his son , Saint John Hunt ( who fucking names their kid “ Saint ” ?
A fucking narcissistic fuckhead , that ’s who ) .
The confession is compelling , but Hunt is a well - known liar .
Indeed , his confession is his own version of a limited hang out .
He claimed to have refused to take part in the plot , but his own lies tripped him up , as he also claimed to know the command structure ( from LBJ on down ) and who was the the marksman on the grassy knoll .
It ’s pretty clear he was up to his ears in this thing .
My favorite part of the Rolling Stone piece is when Hunt ’s son shreds his dad ’s alibi like grated cheese :
“ And then , like an epiphany , I remember ’ 63 , and my dad being gone , and my mom telling me that he was on a business trip to Dallas .
I ’ve tried to convince myself that ’s some kind of false memory , that I ’m just nuts , that it ’s something I heard years later .
But , I mean , his alibi for that day is that he was at home with his family .
I remember I was in the fifth grade .
We were at recess .
I was playing on the merry - go - round .
We were called in and told to go home , because the president had been killed .
And I remember going home .
But I do n’t remember my dad being there .
I have no recollection of him being there .
And then he has this whole thing about shopping for Chinese food with my mother that day , so that they could cook a meal together . ”
His father testified to this , in court , on more than one occasion , saying that he and his wife often cooked meals together .
St. John pauses and leans forward .
“ Well , ” he says , “ I can tell you that ’s just the biggest load of crap in the fucking world .
He was always looking at things like he was writing a novel ; everything had to be just so glamorous and so exciting .
He could n’t even be bothered with his children .
That ’s not glamorous .
James
Bond does n’t have children .
So my dad in the kitchen ?
Chopping vegetables with his wife ?
I ’m so sorry , but that would never happen .
Ever .
That fucker never did jack - squat like that .
Ever . ”
It is pretty funny , imagining him at home with the wife , helping out with the cooking .
Hah !
This guy was a misogynist asshole , not Julia Child .
If he ever used a knife for something it was to cut somebody ’s fingers off , not make a dainty meal for the kids .
Anyway , that ’s not to say his confession is unimportant .
Even a partial confession is vastly more than what we had before : denials , denials , denials .
His history as a liar makes it suspect , of course , but I think St. John ’s story is compelling .
He alone knew how to extract this information from his father ( read the whole thing for Kevin Costner ’s half - assed attempt ) .
This has to be one of the biggest bombshells in recent memory .
These revelations will make the cover of every major news - magazine and the headline of every newspaper , right ?
Wrong .
The story is over a week old and no major media have picked up on it yet .
And they wo n’t .
I ’ve been telling people for years that the mainstream media is utterly controlled by the Oligarchy .
If this example does n’t make that clear , I do n’t know what else to tell you .
I mean , it ’s not like the allegation / confession even has to be true to be newsworthy .
The media has covered all the people claiming to be the father of Anna Nicole Smith ’s orphaned daughter .
They ca n’t all be right ( the parade of people claiming to have fucked Anna Nicole is like one of those clown cars at the circus ) .
This is newsworthy .
That is not really up for debate .
If somebody confesses to murdering the president , that ’s fucking newsworthy .
So why the deafening silence ?
The media is part of the conspiracy , that ’s why .
The media was one of the biggest parts of the cover - up right after the fact ( and some would say , before it ) .
Shooting the president is fairly easy .
Getting away with it is damn near impossible … unless you control the levers of power .
The rich and powerful men who make up the Oligarchy are the same men who own and operate the mainstream media .
These levers of power are known by many names : Time , Newsweek , The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , etc .
But they all serve the same master .
Is there anything else the Media is n’t telling you ?
( and how would you know ? )

Tomgram : Reflecting Hubris
The Billion - Dollar Gravestone
Reflections on Memorializing the Dead of 9/11
By Tom Engelhardt
Recently , a number -- one billion -- in the New York Times stopped me in my tracks .
According to a report commissioned by the foundation charged with building Reflecting Absence , the memorial to the dead in the attack on the World Trade Center , its projected cost is now estimated at about a billion dollars and still rising .
According to Oliver Burkeman of the British Guardian , " Taking inflation into account , $ 1bn would be more than a quarter of the original cost of the twin towers that were destroyed in 2001 . "
For that billion , Reflecting Absence is to have two huge " reflecting pools " -- " two voids that reside in the original footprints of the Twin Towers " -- fed by waterfalls " from all sides " and surrounded by a " forest " of oak trees ; a visitor will then be able to descend 30 feet to galleries under the falls " inscribed with the names of those who died . "
There is to be an adjacent , 100,000 square - foot underground memorial museum to " retell the events of the day , display powerful artifacts , and celebrate the lives of those who died . "
All of this , as the website for the memorial states , will be meant to vividly convey " the enormity of the buildings and the enormity of the loss . "
Not surprisingly , the near billion - dollar figure does not even include $ 80 million for a planned visitor 's center or the estimated $ 50 - 60 million annual cost of running such an elaborate memorial and museum .
So what is Reflecting Absence going to reflect ?
For one thing , it will mirror its gargantuan twin , the building that is to symbolically replace the World Trade Center -- the Freedom Tower .
As the Memorial is to be driven deep into the scarred earth of Ground Zero , so the Freedom tower is to soar above it , scaling the imperial heights .
To be precise , it is to reach exactly 1,776 feet into the heavens , a numerical tribute to the founding spirit of the Declaration of Independence and the nation which emerged from it ; its spire will even emit light -- " a new beacon of freedom " -- for all the world to see and admire .
Its observation deck will rise a carefully planned 7 feet above that of the old World Trade Center ; and with spire and antennae , it is meant to be the tallest office building on the planet ( though the Burj Dubai Tower , whose builders are holding its future height a tightly guarded secret , may quickly surpass it ) .
The revelation of that staggering billion - dollar price tag for a memorial whose design , in recent years , has grown ever larger and more complex , caused consternation in my city , led Mayor Michael Bloomberg to suggest capping its cost at $ 500 million , caused the Times to editorialize , " The only thing a $ 1 billion memorial would memorialize is a complete collapse of political and private leadership in Lower Manhattan , " and became a nationwide media story .
Because the subject is such a touchy one , however , no one went further and explored the obvious : that , even in victimhood , Americans have in recent years exhibited an unseemly imperial hubris .
Whether the price tag proves to be half a billion or a billion dollars , one thing can be predicted .
The memorial will prove less a reminder of how many Americans happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time on that September day , or how many -- firemen , policemen , bystanders who stayed to aid others -- sacrificed their lives , than of the terrible path this country ventured down in the wake of 9/11 .
If the latest opinion polls are to be believed , Americans have grown desperately tired of that path and , as a result , the whole construction project at New York 's Ground Zero is likely to become emotionally obsolete long before either Reflecting Absence or the Freedom Tower make it onto the scene .
Memorials Built and Unbuilt
Let me offer a few framing comparisons :
1. Sometime in the coming week or two , the number of American soldiers killed in the Iraq and Afghan Wars will exceed the 2,752 people who died in or around the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 ( including those on the two hijacked jets that rammed into the towers ) .
With a combined death toll of 2,739 , the war dead have already crept within 13 of that day 's casualties in New York .
Here 's a question then :
Who thinks that the United States will ever spend $ 500 million , no less $ 1 billion , on a memorial to the ever - growing numbers of war dead from those two wars ?
2 . Or consider the prospective 9/11 memorial in this context :
The National World War II Memorial ( 405,000 American dead ) : $ 182 million for all costs .
The Vietnam Memorial ( 56,000 American dead ) : $ 4.2 million for construction .
The Korean War Veterans Memorial ( 54,000 American dead ) : $ 6 million .
The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor ( 2,390 American dead , 1,177 from the Arizona ) : $ 532,000 .
The Oklahoma City National Memorial ( 168 American dead ) : $ 29 million .
The 1915 USS Maine Mast Memorial at Arlington Cemetery ( 260 American dead ) : $ 56,147.94
The Holocaust Museum in Washington ( approximately 6 million dead ) : $ 90 million for construction / $ 78 million for exhibitions
The WTC Memorial ( 2,752 dead ) : $ 494 million - $ 1 billion .
3 . Or imagine a listing of global Ground Zeros that might go something like this :
Amount spent on a memorial for the Vietnamese dead of their Vietnam Wars ( approximately 3 million ) : $ 0 .
Amount spent on a memorial to the Afghan dead in the civil war between competing warlords over who would control the capital of Kabul in the mid-1990s ( unknown numbers of dead , a city reduced to rubble ) : $ 0 .
Amount spent on a memorial to the victims of the December 26 , 2004 earthquake and tsunami in the Pacific and Indian Oceans ( at least 188,000 dead ) : $ 0 .
Amount spent on a memorial to Iraqis confirmed dead , many with signs of execution and torture marks , just in the month of April in Baghdad alone ( almost 1,100 ) , or the Iraqis confirmed killed countrywide " in war - related violence " from January through April of this year ( 3,525 ) -- and both of these figures are certainly significant undercounts : $ 0 .
The WTC Memorial ( 2,752 dead ) : $ 494 million - $ 1 billion .
The Victors are the Victims
The dead , those dear to us , our wives or husbands , brothers , sisters , parents , children , relatives , friends , those who acted for us or suffered in our place , should be remembered .
This is an essential human task , almost a duty .
What could be more powerful than the urge to hold onto those taken from us , especially when their deaths happen in an unexpected , untimely , and visibly unjust way ( only emphasizing the deeper untimeliness and injustice of death itself ) .
But where exactly do we remember the dead ?
The truth is :
We remember them in our hearts , which makes a memorial a living thing only so long as the dead still live within us .
As an experiment , visit one of the old Civil War or World War I memorials that dot so many towns , undoubtedly yours included .
You might ( or might not ) admire the fountain , or the elaborate statue of soldiers , or of a general , or of any other set of icons chosen to stand in for the hallowed dead and their sacrifices .
I happen to like the Grand Army Plaza , designed by Augustus Saint - Gaudens and dedicated to the Union Army , that fronts on Central Park in New York City , my home town ; but it is , in a sense , no longer a memorial .
Decades ago , it turned back into a somewhat gaudy , golden decoration , a statue -- as all memorials , in the end , must .
The odds are that few today visit it to remember what some specific individual did or how he died .
To the extent that we remember , we remember first individually in our hearts in our own lifetimes -- and later , collectively , in our history books .
And , of course , for most human beings in most places , especially those who are not the victors in wars , or simply not the victors on this planet , no matter how unfairly or horrifically or bravely or fruitlessly their loved ones might be taken from them , there is only the heart .
For those dying in Kabul or Baghdad , Chechnya , Darfur , the Congo , or Uzbekistan today , the emotions released may be no less strong , but in all likelihood there will be no statues , no reflecting pools , no sunken terraces , no walls with carefully etched names .
There has , in American journalism , been an unspoken calculus of the value of a life and a death on this planet in terms of newsworthiness ( which is often , of course , a kind of memorializing , a kind of remembering ) .
Crudely put , it would go something like :
One kidnapped and murdered blond , white child in California equals 300 Egyptians drowning in a ferry accident , 3,000 Bangladeshis swept away in a monsoon flood , 300,000 Congolese killed in a bloodletting civil war .
Call that news reality in this country .
It 's also true , as the recent World War II memorial on the Washington Mall indicates , that Americans have gained something of a taste for Roman imperial - style memorialization ( though , to my mind , that huge construction catches little of the modesty and stoicism of the WWII vets like my father who did not come home trumpeting what they had done ) .
Reflecting Absence and the Freedom Tower , however , go well beyond that .
Their particular form of excess , of the gargantuan , in which money , elaborateness , and size stand in for memory is intimately connected not so much with September 11 , 2001 as with the days , weeks , even year after that shock .
To grasp this , it 's necessary to return to the now almost forgotten moments after 9/11 , after the President had frozen in that elementary school classroom in Florida while reading The Pet Goat ; after a panicky crew of his people had headed Air Force One in the wrong direction , away from Washington ; after Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush ( according to former counterterrorism tsar Richard Clarke ) started rounding up the usual suspects -- i.e. Saddam Hussein -- on September 11th and 12th ; after the President insisted , " I do n't care what the international lawyers say , we are going to kick some ass " ; after he took that bullhorn at Ground Zero on September 14th and -- to chants of " USA ! USA ! USA ! " -- promised the American public that " the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon " ; after his associates promptly began to formulate the plans , the " intelligence , " the lies and tall tales that would take us into Iraq .
It was in that unformed , but quickly forming , moment that , under the shock not just of the murder of almost 3,000 people , but of the apocalyptic images of those two towers crumbling in a near - mushroom cloud of white dust , that an American imperial culture of revenge and domination was briefly brought to full flower .
It was a moment that reached its zenith when the President strutted across the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1 , 2003 and , with that Mission Accomplished banner over his shoulder , declared " major combat operations " ended in Iraq .
The gargantuan Freedom Tower and the gargantuan sunken memorial to the dead of 9/11 are really monuments to that brief year and a half , each project now hardly less embattled in controversy , cost - overruns , and ineptitude than the war in Iraq or the post - Katrina rescue - and - reconstruction mission .
Each project -- as yet unbuilt -- is already an increasingly controversial leftover from that extended moment when so many pundits pictured us proudly as a wounded Imperial Rome or the inheritor of the glories of the British Empire ; while the administration , with its attendant neocon cheering squad in tow , all of them dazzled by our " hyperpower " ( as other Americans were horrified by the hyperpower of al - Qaeda 's imagery of destruction ) , gained confidence that this was their moment ; the one that would take them over the top ; the one that would make the United States a Republican - Party possession for years , if not generations , the Middle East an American gas station , the world an American military preserve , and a " unitary " commander - in - chief presidency the recipient of the kinds of untrammeled powers previously reserved for kings and emperors .
These were , of course , dreams of gargantuan proportions , fantasies of power and planetary rule worthy of a tower at least 1,776 feet high , that would obliterate the memory of all other buildings anywhere , and of the largest , most expensive gravestone on Earth , one that would quite literally put the sufferings of all other victims in the shade .
As those two enormous reflecting pools were meant to mirror the soaring " beacon " of the Freedom Tower , so the American people , under the shock of loss , experiencing a sense of violation that can only come to the victors in this world , mirrored the administration 's attitude .
In a country where New York City had always been Sodom to Los Angeles ' Gomorrah , everyone suddenly donned " I [ Heart ] New York " hats or t- shirts and became involved in a series of repetitive rites of mourning that in arenas nationwide , on every television screen , went on not for days or weeks but months on end .
From these ceremonies , a clear and simple message emerged .
The United States was , in its suffering , the greatest victim , the greatest survivor , and the greatest dominator the globe had ever seen .
Implicitly , the rest of the world 's dead were , in the Pentagon 's classic phrase , " collateral damage . "
In those months , in our EveryAmerican version of the global drama , we swept up and repossessed all the emotional roles available -- with the sole exception of Greatest Evil One .
That , then , was the phantasmagoric path to invasion , war , and disaster upon which the Bush administration , with a mighty helping hand from al - Qaeda , pulled back the curtain ; that is the drama still being played out today at Ground Zero in New York City .
But those 2,752 dead can no longer stand in -- not even in the American mind -- for all the dead everywhere , not even for the American dead in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Perhaps it 's time not just to cut back radically on that billion - dollar cost , but to do what we should have done -- and , if we had had another kind of leadership , might have done -- starting on September 12 , 2001 .
Taken a breath and actually thought about ourselves and the world ; taken another breath and actually approached the untimely dead -- our own as well as those of others around the world -- with some genuine humility .
I know that somehow this memorial will be built ; that , for some , it will touch the heart .
But I also know that someday , maybe even yesterday in a country that now wants to forget much of what occurred as it was railroaded into a never - ending war , whatever is built at Ground Zero will mainly memorialize a specific America that emerged from the rubble of 9/11 .
That was the America that had stopped being a nation and had become a " homeland , " a country that should not have been using the numbers 1776 in any way .
Facing a building so tall , who has any need to approach a declaration of only 1,322 words , so tiny as to be able to fit on a single page , so iconic that just about no one bothers to pay attention to it any more .
But perhaps , with that monumental invocation of its " spirit " in mind , it 's worth quoting a few of the words those men wrote back in the year 1776 and remembering what the American dead of that time actually stood for .
Here , then , from a great anti-imperial document , are some passages about another George 's imperial hubris that you are less likely to remember than its classic beginning :
" The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States He has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance .
He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation For depriving us in many cases , of the benefit of Trial by Jury : For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences ...
For suspending our own Legislatures , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever . "
Someday , those reflecting pools and that tower will mirror so much of the rise as well as the fall of the Bush administration -- not least of all its heck - of - a - job - Brownie incompetence and its inability to fulfill civil promises of any sort .
After all , almost five years past the catastrophe of 9/11 , after all the grandiose promises and the soaring costs , after all that " enormity , " there is nothing 1,776 feet in the air , nor , as yet , any hint of a gravestone over the dead of the tragedy of that day .

It was watching sea creatures choke on plastic bags in the Pacific Ocean that finally persuaded Rebecca Hosking that enough was enough .
The British filmmaker had already recoiled in disgust at deserted Hawaiian beaches piled up with four feet of rubbish , the jetsam of Western consumerism washed up by an ocean teeming with plastic .
Now , filming off the coast , she looked on aghast as sea turtles eagerly mistook bobbing translucent shapes in the water for jellyfish .
" Sea turtles can't read Wal - mart or Tesco signs on plastic bags , " fumes Ms. Hosking , who returned to Britain in March .
" They will home in on it and feed on it .
Dolphins mistake them for seaweed and quite often they 'll eat them and it causes huge damage . "
Within a few weeks of coming back , Hosking persuaded her hometown to ban plastic bags outright and found herself in the vanguard of a sudden British revulsion for that most disposable convenience of the throwaway society .
Stores , grass - roots groups , and citizens are joining forces to reduce national consumption of plastic bags , and Hosking is fielding hundreds of requests a day for guidance .
Wave of plastic - bag activism
Dumbstruck by what she 'd seen off the Hawaiian coast during her year - long filmmaking trip , Hosking set up a local screening of her film and invited the town 's 43 shopkeepers to come see where plastic bags end up .
All but seven of them showed up .
At the end of the viewing , held in a local hall , Hosking called for a show of hands in support of a voluntary ban on plastic bags .
Every single hand went up .
The rest of the town 's shopkeepers quickly followed suit .
On May 1 , Modbury won bragging rights as the first plastic - bag - free town in Europe .
Now , larger towns and even cities are calling up Hosking to ask how she did it .
Supermarkets and other retailers are experimenting with plastic - bag - free days , reusable totes , or even buy - your - own bags to discourage usage .
Retailer Sainsbury introduced a limited - edition reusable cotton bag with the logo " I am not a plastic bag , " emblazoned on it .
Priced at $ 10 , within an hour 20,000 of them sold out .
Others stores are trying out paper bags and " green " checkout lines for environmentally friendly customers who bring their own bags .
Grass - roots campaign
Another grass - roots action group , We Are What We Do , was surprised by the strength of feeling on the issue .
For a book entitled " Change the world for a fiver " ( five British pounds ) , its activists asked 1 million people what their top suggestions were to make the world a better place .
Eschewing plastic bags was one of the most frequent responses , and is now one of its top campaigns .
" It 's one of the worst indicators of indulgence and excess , " says Eugenie Harvey , cofounder of the group , which seeks to inspire people to change the world through everyday actions .
" In this country , we [ each ] use nearly 200 bags a year on average .
They can take up to 500 years in landfill to break down .
It 's needless waste . "
Hosking adds , " They are the epitome of throw - away living .
It 's amazing how many people want to [ stop using them ] , how many towns are keen to get rid of them .
We have had 800 e-mails a day . "
Modbury is even organizing for plastic bags to be recycled into furniture to remove at least some from circulation .
Yet an awful lot remain .
Estimates vary wildly when it comes to mankind 's propensity for the ultimate in convenience shopping .
Environmental groups guesstimate that up to 1 trillion plastic bags are used worldwide each year .
In Britain the figure is 8 billion – 134 per person .
Some will be reused or employed as wastebasket liners .
But billions end up back in the environment , fluttering from trees and hedges in China , disrupting the digestion of Indian cows , scudding along the ocean floor , and suffocating an estimated 100,000 birds , whales , seals , and turtles each year .
Reduced CO2 emissions
And there is a climate - change dimension as well : Plastic bags are manufactured using oil .
Cutting usage in Britain by a quarter would reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 63 tons a year – equivalent to taking 18,000 cars off the road , the government says .
Some countries have taken decisive action against the plastic bag .
Bangladesh and Taiwan have banned them .
Ireland took a much - lauded step of imposing a tax ( €0.15 per bag ) in 2002 , leading to usage reduction of up to 95 percent .
Next month , California will become the first US state to force supermarkets to provide recycling bins .
But so far , despite the growing public clamor in Britain , the government is showing no signs of introducing a ban or a tax .
It prefers encouraging retailers to sign up to waste recycling commitments .
The latest arrangement , agreed in February , commits big stores to reducing the environmental impact of their shopping bags by 25 percent by the end of next year .
Government minister Ben Bradshaw called it an " ambitious " agreement and noted that consumers had become " increasingly aware that they can make positive choices to help the environment in the way they shop . "
But Hannah Chance , spokeswoman for Sainsbury , a big supermarket chain , says a total ban is unlikely at the moment .
Sainsbury has tried bag - free days and promoting its reusable " bag for life . "
But Ms. Chance says " it would be too radical to completely remove them .
The plastic bag does have a functional purpose in life .
In cities a lot of people do n't have a car .
Lots of people use it as a [ trash ] bag at the end of the day .
It 's giving customers things that are practical . "
She said they did try out biodegradable bags , but they were n't strong enough .
Harvey says that Gordon Brown , poised to take over as prime minister next week , once declared that governments " respond to the climate that people create . "
In other words , as one wag once put it , in order to lead people in Britain , first find out where they 're going and then walk in front of them .
But it remains to be seen if enough people will move in this direction .
Anecdotal evidence would appear to show that those who bring their own bags to supermarkets with them are still in a minority .
Campaigners say they hope that by Christmas it will be " as fashionable to carry plastic as it is to wear fur , " but privately admit that they may have a much longer wait .
Mr Johnston said his time in captivity was the worst of his life
Johnston reaction
Mr Johnston , 45 , was handed over to armed men in Gaza City .
He said his ordeal was like " being buried alive " but it was " fantastic " to be free .
Speaking live from Jerusalem later , he thanked those who had supported him , and vowed to return to " obscurity " .
Rallies worldwide had called for Mr Johnston 's release .
An online petition was signed by some 200,000 people .
Mr Johnston 's father Graham said he and his wife were " overjoyed " at their son 's release .
" It 's been 114 days of a living nightmare , " he said .
Gordon Brown , in his first prime minister 's questions session in the UK parliament , said : " The whole country will welcome the news that Alan Johnston , a fearless journalist whose voice was silenced for too long , is now free . "
Mr Brown acknowledged the " crucial " role played by Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in securing Mr Johnston 's release .
I literally dreamt many times of being free and always woke up back in that room
Alan Johnston
Hamas role in release Johnston describes ordeal
But a spokesman for Mr Brown said Britain 's policy towards Hamas had not changed , and the movement was still expected to recognise Israel and show a commitment to non-violence .
The BBC reporter was handed over to officials of Hamas , which controls Gaza , in the early hours of Wednesday morning .
He later appeared beside Ismail Haniya , the Hamas leader in Gaza , and thanked everyone who had worked for his release .
Mr Johnston is now at the British Consulate in Jerusalem but is not expected to fly home on Wednesday .
Hamas gunmen overran Gaza last month , expelling their rivals from the Fatah faction and prompting its leader , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , to sack Mr Haniya as prime minister .
Mr Haniya said the result " confirms [ Hamas ] is serious in imposing security and stability and maintaining law and order in this very dear part of our homeland " .
He also said he hoped a deal could now be reached for the release of the Israeli corporal , Gilad Shalit , who has been held in Gaza since being seized in a border raid by three militant groups a year ago .
' Dreamt of freedom '
At the news conference , Mr Johnston thanked everyone who had worked towards his release .
He described his experience of captivity as " appalling " and " occasionally quite terrifying " .
" It became quite hard to imagine normal life again , " he said .
" The last 16 weeks have been the very worst of my life , " he added .
" I was in the hands of people who were dangerous and unpredictable .
" I literally dreamt many times of being free and always woke up back in that room . "
Mr Johnston said he was not tortured during captivity but he did fall ill from the food he was served .
He added that he had been kept in four different locations , two of them only briefly .
He was able to see the sun in the first month but was then kept in a shuttered room until a week before his release , he said .
Mr Johnston was kept in chains for 24 hours but was not harmed physically until the last half hour of his captivity , when his captors hit him " a bit " .

Jon 's comments in full
He said Hamas 's seizure of power in Gaza and its subsequent pledge to improve security in the territory had facilitated his release .
" The kidnappers seemed very comfortable and very secure in their operation until ... a few weeks ago , when Hamas took charge of the security operation here , " Mr Johnston said .
He said that he was told he was going home on Tuesday night .
" I thought at first ' They are moving me again ' , and I thought maybe they 're handing me on to new kidnappers but then as we got deeper and deeper into Gaza City , I really began at last to believe that maybe we were finishing it , " he said .
Radio contact
Mr Johnston was abducted on 12 March by the Army of Islam , a shadowy militant group dominated by Gaza 's powerful Dugmush clan .

Just over a month after his capture , it was announced that he had been killed to send a " message " to the Palestinian authorities .
The group released three videos , two of which featured footage of the kidnapped correspondent .
It said it would kill its captive if its demands for the release of Muslim prisoners in British custody were not met .
But Mr Johnston said his abductors had also offered him freedom in exchange for making one of the videos .
Having worked in Gaza for the past three years , Mr Johnston said he was well aware of Palestinian traditions of hospitality and regarded his abductors as an " aberration " .
He said he was looking forward to being re-united with his family , expressing sorrow that his " actions " had brought turmoil to their lives .
BBC colleagues have been celebrating the release
Mr Johnston said he stayed aware of efforts to free him by listening to the BBC World Service on the radio .
News of global demonstrations in his support was a source of comfort to him , he said .
" There were demonstrations from Beijing to Buenos Aires , Beirut to London to Washington and you know I could feel how much the Palestinian people were feeling that this was n't right and how much support there was for an end to my captivity , " he said .
The BBC has issued a statement expressing relief and delight at its employee 's release .
This past Friday , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) announced details of its upcoming Registered Traveler program .
In a nutshell , the RT program allows frequent flyers to submit to a background check and fingerprinting in exchange for a special smartcard pass that can be used at airport security checkpoints to " accelerate the screening process at participating airports for passengers who voluntarily choose to enroll in the program . "
What exactly is meant by " accelerate the screening process " ?
The answer is unclear for two reasons : 1 ) the program is n't fully implemented yet , and 2 ) even when it goes live , " acceleration " will mean different things to different users at different checkpoints at different airports at different times of the day .
The Registered Traveler programs will be market - driven and offered by the private sector .
Individual participation in a Registered Traveler program will be entirely voluntary , with prices established by private sector providers .
TSA will mandate a core RT security assessment for each applicant to a Registered Traveler program .
If RT providers undertake more in - depth security background checks ( e.g. , by using commercial data specifically authorized by customers , or by other voluntary means ) , TSA will offer a variety of enhanced or time - saving participant benefits at passenger screening checkpoints .
Participants may receive significant efficiency benefits over what exists today , if additional security is added by a more thorough background check ...
If the RT businesses wish to make investments in approved screening equipment , fund additional screeners , and / or obtain space for separate RT screening , then TSA is prepared to authorize the use of dedicated screening lanes or alternative screening locations for RT participants .
Welcome to the brave new world of " market - driven " airport security , where different private security firms run and operate different lanes at different checkpoints , offering varied levels of accelerated screening depending on how much a user paid and how deep of a background check he or she submitted to .
Thus the speed at which you move through a checkpoint will theoretically depend on a multiplicity of factors , only two of which are under your control ( the depth of your background check and the firm (s ) with which you 've contracted ) .
Other factors affecting your screening time , like which private security firm is manning a checkpoint and what resources that particular firm has invested in a particular checkpoint ( e.g. extra personnel , more screening equipment , and so on ) at a particular time of day , are entirely out of your control .
Constant change , creative destruction , risk , unpredictability , inequality , profit maximizing behaviors , incentives ( both aligned and misaligned ) , choice ( for travelers and for terrorists ) and all of those other things that we 've all come to love about free markets will now be part of our airport screening experience .
Frequent flyers , rejoice !
But that 's not all !
The RT program not only has the free - market attributes I 've just described , but the TSA will intervene at random times to ensure that this little ( faux ) market system does n't naturally self - organize into something rational , stable , and predictable .
The TSA has assured us that they will randomly juggle about the benefits of the program to keep the terrorists off - balance .
I 'm not kidding .
They actually said this :
We know that terrorists may seek to exploit the Registered Traveler program , and the program must be designed to thwart those efforts .
Therefore , program benefits will change from time to time in order to make it more difficult for terrorists to anticipate our security activities .
Further , TSA will not exempt Registered Traveler participants from random additional screening .
So you 'll never be sure what , if anything , your participation in the program is going to do for your screening time , because even if you contract with one company and always fly out of the same terminal at the same time of the day through the same checkpoint , the TSA may decide to mix it up on you just for giggles and tack another ten minutes onto your screening time .
What 's worse than the government having your sensitive data in one centralized location ?
Multiple private firms having multiple copies .
In addition to knowing that she has a wide variety of average airport screening times to keep track of as she moves about the country from airport to airport and from terminal to terminal , the RT - registered frequent flyer traveller will also have the security of knowing that her most intimate personal data — finances and fingerprints and family connections and all that stuff that goes into a thorough background check — is safely in the hands of the same private sector that brought us Choicepoint and related fiascos .
But hey , that 's the magic of the market as applied to travel authentication : multiple private firms with multiple databases among them , and personal data just multiplying and flowing everywhere between these firms and the feds .
It 's an identity thief 's paradise .
This inevitable multiplication of pools of individuals ' personal data is also part of the magic of the market .
Any time there 's a market for something — widgets , music , ideas , biometric identifiers , background information — then there will be more of that thing in more places and in the hands of more agents .
So by creating a market for detailed information about your identity , the government will ensure that such information multiplies and moves about like dandelion seeds in springtime , or like credit histories , or like cell phone calling records .
What 's worse than having identity thieves impersonate you to Chase Bank ?
Having terrorists impersonate you to the TSA .
We can only hope , will all of that privately managed personal data spread out all over the world and flying to and fro from database to database , that the perpetrators of identity theft are strictly confined to the criminal classes .
If terrorists were to get their hands that on cornucopia of data , then they'd be much more empowered to impersonate you or I for the incredibly attentive and highly trained forgery detection experts that the contractors will no doubt hire at great expense to man these checkpoints .
Speaking of the quality of the security at individual screening checkpoints , this is another place where the market will ( not ) work wonders for our security .
Consumers will want the fastest possible screening for the lowest price .
This will give private screeners massive incentives to hire low wage , unskilled employees to man the checkpoints , and to give them the worst benefits possible .
( Of course , such incentives are already in place to a large degree under the current TSA regime , but the proposed RT plan will increase them . )
The new plan also will explicitly encourage companies to find ways to move travelers through checkpoints as rapidly as possible .
Do unskilled , minimum - wage airport screeners who 're under pressure from management to move customers through checkpoints as rapidly as possible sound to you like a recipe for thorough and secure airport screening ?
I did n't think so .
You'd think that at at least two of the problems I 've pointed out above — the potential increase in terrorist access to larger and more ubiquitous caches of sensitive personal data ; and the misaligned market incentives that encourage corner cutting at security checkpoints — would combine to defeat the whole purpose of the new program .
You'd be wrong , though , because you'd be assuming that the purpose of the program is the keep us safe from terrorists .
Given that a truly market - driven airport screening program would encourage shoddy screening and give terrorists just as many options for gaming the system as it would give travelers options for participating in it , it 's hard to believe that the program was actually designed with keeping the skies safe as its primary goal .
Rather , the program seems tailor - made for handing out lucrative TSA contracts to well - connected private sector companies .
Hey , it 's your tax dollars at work .

The headline reads “ US rejects Iran captives exchange . ”
My initial response was “ Why is the US doing rejecting a captive exchange ” ?
My second thought was , “ not those hostages ” .
Yes , Iran has asked for the five Iranian Consulate staff seized by the from Irbil , Kirkuk in January , 2007 .
You may recall that Bush had approved an attack on the Iranian Consulate in Kirkuk .
Why did it take from March 23rd to March 31st for the issue at play in the holding of 15 UK sailors to be brought to light ?
Iran ’s arrest of 15 UK sailors has largely been painted as a “ provocative ” move by Iran .
Presented as another “ crazy ” move by Ahmadinejad .
However , now a totally different issue arises .
In January , more than two months ago , the US raids a recognized Iranian Consulate in Kirkuk , Iraq .
Along with taking computers and files , the US military also takes into custody , five staff people from the Consulate .
Kirkuk and Iran issue a protest and a demand for the release of the captive consulate staff .
The US claims they are part of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard al - Qods force , and refuse to release them .
We can imagine what has happened in the ensuing time .
Through back channels and intermediaries , Iran has continued to demand the release of their five consulate staff .
The US has denied or ignored the requests – through back channels and intermediaries as the US wo n’t talk to Iran .
Instead , the US decided to launch massive “ war games off the coast of Iran . ”
However , they were not seen as games by Iran .
Iran ups the ante by taking their own hostages as a negotiating chip for their consulate staff .
It even makes sense that they would arrest UK personnel rather than US military – who are surely in and near Iran .
The US would take the capture of US personnel as a directly hostile move and a legitimation of retaliatory strikes .
Bush seems to just be waiting for the opportunity to legitimate his “ tactical ” nuclear war against Iran .
Instead , they arrest UK personnel , where any action to be taken is by the UK .
In fact , if the US utilizes this as the opportunity to attack , it will make the UK look very bad indeed .
One might even say it would preempt the UK ’s sovereignty and be “ emasculating ” of their national honor and rights .
Suddenly , this very public action by Iran takes on a very canny sense .
They are also making clear to the world that the UK sailors are being well cared for .
For all that their statements may be coerced , the videos show them to be intact and in good shape .
I am relatively sure that Iran has no such assurance about their five captive consulate staff .
Regardless , the presentation of the UK sailors ( while protested by the UK ) is a very public statement that undermines a military response to the situation .
What has happened ( or is happening ) to the five consulate staff who were captured by the US ?
Why is n’t the corporate press or our Congress asking the Bush administration to report on the status of these high visibility captives ?
Will they ask now that Iran ’s hostage negotiations have become public – at least public in the UK ?
CHICAGO ( the USA ) – this video shocks the world : Jessica is only seven years old and brings already 222 Kilos on the balance .
With this record weight it is the thickest child of the world .
As the newspaper Bild reports , Jessica eats per day 15 plugs (!)
Happy Meals , 5 litres of Cola and over 10.000 calories in itself purely .
To the comparison : A child of their age would have to actually take only 1800 calories to itself .
Her mother says : ” Perhaps it would not harm Jessica anything to decrease a few Pounds .
But my small one eats now times gladly , that is nevertheless nothing bad , or ? ”
Jessica corroded in the meantime much bacon in such a manner that she cannot go times to more like a normal child .
Often it must crawl on the belly by the dwelling or slip with its
Po-cheeks from a side to the other one .
“ Right now there is still a vacuum among conservative Republicans , ” said Gary Bauer , a Christian conservative who was a Republican primary candidate in 2000 .
Conservatives , he said , “ want a more provable conservative who also is demonstrating that they can put together the resources necessary to prevail . ”
He declined to comment on the Amelia Island meeting .
A spokesman for Mr. Brownback said he would not comment on the senator ’s presentation to the council , citing its rules about strict confidentiality .
Several others who attended his speech said he received heavy applause for his emphasis on restricting abortion and amending the Constitution to ban same - sex marriage .
But foes of illegal immigration objected to his support for a temporary guest worker program , and some faulted him for touching only briefly on the threat of Islamic terrorists , an increasingly central focus of the council and many social conservative groups since the Sept. 11 attacks .
( People who attended the Amelia Island event said Rick Santorum , the former senator from Pennsylvania , delivered a well - received address to the council about what he called the gathering threat of radical Islam . )
In an interview , Mr. Hunter , the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee and a supporter of Mr. Bush ’s plan to send more troops to Iraq , said the need for a strong national defense was the centerpiece of his speech .
That defense , he argued , should include cracking down on illegal immigration , building a wall along the Mexican border and renegotiating foreign trade deals to protect American manufacturing .
“ We are losing the arsenal of the democracy , ” he said .
But several people at the council meeting said his stance on trade alienated the business wing of the Republican Party , compounding his substantial fund - raising challenges .
Mr. Huckabee , a Southern Baptist minister who was the head of the Arkansas Baptist convention before becoming governor , has the advantage of strong personal ties to many council members .
Many prominent evangelical Christians consider him a friend , and he has appeared several times as a guest on Dr. Dobson ’s popular Christian radio program .
In an interview , Mr. Huckabee said he believed his roots in the evangelical world helped set him apart from his rivals .
“ I am not going to them , ” he said .
“ I am coming from them . ”
He said he did not remember speaking about his opposition to abortion or same - sex marriage , “ although I am sure that I must have . ”
He said he emphasized education , among other issues , and talked about a continuing war “ with a radical form of Islamic fascism , ” which he called “ a bastardization of religion . ”

A vast second army , one of contractors — up to 126,000 Americans , Iraqis and other foreigners — is working for the United States government in Iraq .
Many work side - by - side with soldiers and are exposed to the same dangers , but they mostly must fend for themselves in navigating the civilian health care system when they come back to the United States .
...
" I think the numbers are in the thousands , maybe tens of thousands , " said Paul Brand , a psychologist and chief executive of Mission Critical Psychological Services , a Chicago firm hired by Dyncorp International , a major contractor in Iraq , to assess and treat its workers .
" Many are going undiagnosed .
These guys are fighting demons , and they do n’t know how to cope . "
Jana Crowder , who runs a Web site for contractors seeking help , says she gets new evidence of that every day in phone calls from desperate workers .
As the nation ages , an estimated 44 million Americans , including at least half of those ages 50 and older , are at risk for osteoporosis , making their bones fragile and vulnerable to serious fractures .
Now , a Florida State University engineering professor is looking to develop new technologies that could replace bone mass lost to the disease , as well as treat traumatic bone injuries such as those suffered in automobile accidents or combat .
Teng Ma , an associate professor of chemical and biomedical engineering at the Florida A&M University - FSU College of Engineering , and two colleagues have received an $ 824,000 , four - year grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to research ways of generating bone cells in a laboratory that then could be transplanted into human patients .
" The Department of Defense 's main interest in this research is its potential for developing new treatments and therapies for military personnel who have suffered bone loss due to diseases or traumatic injuries , " Ma said .
" However , many other types of patients who suffer from bone diseases could benefit from this research as well . "
Ma pointed to recent students showing that tissue - engineered bone grafts are effective for correcting bone defects resulting from osteoporosis and other bone - related diseases .
One out of every two women and one in four men over the age of 50 eventually will suffer an osteoporosis - related fracture , and many more are at risk .
Such fractures typically occur in the hip , spine and wrist .
" Currently , there are two sources of bone that can be used for performing corrective grafts - the patient 's own body and human cadavers , " Ma said .
" Both of these have severe limitations .
There is a limited supply , obviously , of bone tissue that can be taken from one part of the patient 's body to be grafted onto another .
And with cadaveric bone " - bone taken from human cadavers - " immune response and the possibility of viral infection remain a concern . "
Ma 's research involves growing human mesenchymal , or adult , stem cells in a laboratory using a device he has patented known as a perfusion bioreactor .
Each stem cell has the ability to divide so as to produce a perfect copy of itself ; the copy then can become a " workhorse " cell , such as a bone or nerve cell .
By subjecting the stem cells to very specific conditions that mimic those they would encounter in the human body , he seeks to determine what type of cell they turn into - in this case , bone .
The bone cells then would be combined with a biomaterial to create tissue similar in structure and density to that of actual bone .
" Artificial bone grafts generated by combining a patient 's own stem cells with biomaterials represent a novel approach that overcomes the donor limitation , reduces immune response , and increases the rate of effectiveness for defect repair and healing , " Ma said .
He cautioned , though , that stem - cell research is a long - term proposition .
" We 're not going to see artificially created bone tissue being transplanted into human patients by this time next year , " he said .
" Stem - cell research still is in its very early stages , and we have a great deal more research to do - and regulatory hurdles to overcome - before this is ready for medical use . "
Collaborating with Ma on the Department of Defense research are Bruce Bunnell , an associate professor of pharmacology at Tulane University ; and Feng Zhao , a postdoctoral researcher at the FAMU - FSU College of Engineering .

" Apparently , you have to jump through more hoops than a trained seal , " write Bankston .
" Perhaps they 'd also like my mother 's maiden name ?
Birth certificate ?
Urine sample ? "
He continues :
Of course , if the choice is giving Google a copy of my driver 's license or leaving the picture up , I 'll take the latter , regardless of how unflattering it may be .
It 's worth noting that there 's no apparent policy limiting Google 's use of the information I 'm being asked to provide to them .
Update :
Bankston writes , " Google has blinked , backing down from its demand for my driver 's license and a sworn statement and agreeing not to use the information I submit for any purpose other than processing my request . "
Google product counsel Daphne Keller personally phoned Bankston to tell him about the change in policy , and then Google 's help desk sent him the new requirements :
To ensure the best possible user experience it is important that only inappropriate images are removed from Street View .
Therefore , we ask for verification that the person depicted ( or a parent or guardian of that person ) is really the source of the image removal request .

Bankston replied ( " I am the dark - haired Caucasian fellow in the striped button - down shirt … " ) and Google took down his image just a couple minutes ago .
It 's worth noting Bankston 's picture was n't X - rated , or any more intrusive than all the other candid shots in Street View .
That means Google has no content - based standard for a take - down , and no verification that the requester is the person pictured .
Anyone willing to lie in an e-mail should be able to remove any picture with a human in it .
I doubt this will stand .
Google wo n't go back its unseemly Kafkaesque process , but I predict when the attention dies down Google will begin requiring a complaint be accompanied by a photo of the person making it , perhaps holding a sign reading " Take Me Off Street View , " in the style of MySpace 's " salute " procedure for getting an imposter 's profile deleted .
Researchers have uncovered a large area of low but increasing gravity over North America – the lingering effect of the last ice age when sheets of ice sometimes three kilometres thick covered nearly all of Canada and the northeastern U.S .
The study , published in the May 11 issue of Science , is the first to show a map of ongoing changes in the gravity field over North America due to the ice age .
It provides an unprecedented image of the geometry of the long - vanished Laurentide ice sheet : a massive ice complex that had two major domes , one east and the other west of the Hudson Bay area , and raised global sea - level about 60 metres when it disappeared .
" There are many uncertainties about the last ice age and its impact on the Earth , " says U of T Professor of Physics Jerry Mitrovica , Director of the Earth System Evolution Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and one of the study ’s authors .
" We are able to show that the ghost of the ice age still hangs over North America . "
The study , performed in collaboration with Drs. Mark Tamisiea and James Davis of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , analyzed four years of data collected from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) satellite mission – a pair of satellites that are measuring the Earth ’s gravitational field to determine how mass is being redistributed on the planet .
The researchers uncovered tiny changes in the gravity over Canada , reflecting the recovery of the Earth ’s crust that was pushed down by the weight of the thick ice sheet .
" These are parts of the crust that have n’t completely rebounded from the giant depression caused by the ice , " explains Dr. Tamisiea .
" The ongoing uplift of the land continues to have an effect on gravity .
Constraining the geometry of the ice is important to understanding ice age climate , and it is also important for making accurate corrections before we interpret modern climate records . "
The ice age is n’t the only thing responsible for the continental scale depression .
According to Mitrovica , movement of material in the Earth 's interior associated with plate tectonics is also pushing the area down .
" When we think of plate tectonics we think of the plates moving horizontally , but mantle flow also shifts plates vertically , " he says .
" This movement is endemic in continents , like rafts being pushed downward by descending currents of water , and our study has also helped us to uncover this remarkable aspect of plate tectonics . "

In the science fiction movie Gattaca , the hero , Vincent , is an “ In - Valid ” – someone whose only crime is to be conceived in a moment of passion rather than in a Petri dish .
His brother , by contrast , is a Valid , created by a process designed to ensure the optimum recombination of his parents ’ genes .
In - Valids are condemned to a life of menial jobs and discrimination .
To realise his dream of becoming an astronaut , Vincent has to buy a Valid ’s identity .
It ’s a scenario that is difficult to imagine from today ’s viewpoint .
Yet could we be moving towards an age in which entering nature ’s genetic lottery is no longer seen as a desirable way to bring a child into the world ?
Might natural conception even come to be thought of as irresponsible , as bad as smoking while pregnant ?
Reproducing the traditional way is undoubtedly flawed .
Worldwide around 1 child in 16 is born with a mental or physical disability due to a genetic defect , and most of us probably carry gene variants that predispose us to serious illnesses later in life .
How much safer it would be to go along to the fertility clinic , have some embryos created and pick the one or two that will produce the healthiest baby .
IVF has become commonplace , and top clinics boast pregnancy rates of more than 30 per cent for each cycle – better than the 1 in 4 chance of conceiving the natural way and likely to improve further .
Until recently , though , IVF was only for those with fertility problems .
The rapid development of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is starting to change this .

WASHINGTON , March 24 — A sharp debate within the Bush administration over the future of the Central Intelligence Agency ’s detention and interrogation program has left the agency without the authority to use harsh interrogation techniques that the White House said last fall were necessary in questioning terrorism suspects , according to administration and Congressional officials .
The agency for months has been awaiting approval for rules that would give intelligence operatives greater latitude than military interrogators in questioning terrorism suspects but would not include some of the most controversial interrogation procedures the spy agency has used in the past .
But the internal debate has left the C.I.A. program in limbo as top officials struggle over where to set boundaries in the treatment of people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities .
Until the debate is resolved , C.I.A. interrogators are authorized to use only interrogation procedures approved by the Pentagon .
The C.I.A. ’s proposed interrogation rules are part of the first major overhaul of the agency ’s detention and interrogation program since the agency began jailing terrorism suspects in 2002 .
The agency has already decided to abandon some past interrogation techniques — among them “ waterboarding , ” which induces a feeling of drowning — that human rights groups and some lawmakers have argued are torture .
Some proponents of human missions to Mars say we have the technology today to send people to the Red Planet .
But do we ?
Rob Manning of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory discusses the intricacies of entry , descent and landing and what needs to be done to make humans on Mars a reality .
There ’s no comfort in the statistics for missions to Mars .
To date over 60 % of the missions have failed .
The scientists and engineers of these undertakings use phrases like “ Six Minutes of Terror , ” and “ The Great Galactic Ghoul ” to illustrate their experiences , evidence of the anxiety that ’s evoked by sending a robotic spacecraft to Mars — even among those who have devoted their careers to the task .
But mention sending a human mission to land on the Red Planet , with payloads several factors larger than an unmanned spacecraft and the trepidation among that same group grows even larger .
Why ?
Nobody knows how to do it .
Surprised ?
Most people are , says Rob Manning the Chief Engineer for the Mars Exploration Directorate and presently the only person who has led teams to land three robotic spacecraft successfully on the surface of Mars .
“ It turns out that most people are n’t aware of this problem and very few have worried about the details of how you get something very heavy safely to the surface of Mars , ” said Manning .
He believes many people immediately come to the conclusion that landing humans on Mars should be easy .
After all , humans have landed successfully on the Moon and we can land our human - carrying vehicles from space to Earth .
And since Mars falls between the Earth and the Moon in size , and also in the amount of atmosphere it has then the middle ground of Mars should be easy .
“ There ’s the mindset that we should just be able to connect the dots in between , ” said Manning .
But as of now , the dots will need to connect across a large abyss .
“ We know what the problems are .
I like to blame the god of war , ” quipped Manning .
“ This planet is not friendly or conducive for landing . ”
The real problem is the combination of Mars ’ atmosphere and the size of spacecraft needed for human missions .
So far , our robotic spacecraft have been small enough to enable at least some success in reaching the surface safely .
But while the Apollo lunar lander weighed approximately 10 metric tons , a human mission to Mars will require three to six times that mass , given the restraints of staying on the planet for a year .
Landing a payload that heavy on Mars is currently impossible , using our existing capabilities .
“ There ’s too much atmosphere on Mars to land heavy vehicles like we do on the moon , using propulsive technology completely , ” said Manning , “ and there ’s too little atmosphere to land like we do on Earth .
So , it ’s in this ugly , grey zone . ”
But what about airbags , parachutes , or thrusters that have been used on the previous successful robotic Mars missions , or a lifting body vehicle similar to the space shuttle ?
None of those will work , either on their own or in combination , to land payloads of one metric ton and beyond on Mars .
This problem affects not only human missions to the Red Planet , but also larger robotic missions such as a sample return .
“ Unfortunately , that ’s where we are , ” said Manning .
“ Until we come up with a whole new trick , a whole new system , landing humans on Mars will be an ugly and scary proposition . ”
Road Mapping
In 2004 NASA organized a Road Mapping session to discuss the current capabilities and future problems of landing humans on Mars .
Manning co-chaired this event along with Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt and Claude Graves , who has since passed away , from the Johnson Space Center .
Approximately 50 other people from across NASA , academia and industry attended the session .
“ At that time the ability to explain these problems in a coherent way was not as good , ” said Manning .
“ The entry , descent and landing process is actually made up of people from many different disciplines .
Very few people really understood , especially for large scale systems , what all of the issues were .
At the Road Mapping session we were able to put them all down and talk about them . ”
The major conclusion that came from the session was that no one has yet figured out how to safely get large masses from speeds of entry and orbit down to the surface of Mars .
“ We call it the Supersonic Transition Problem , ” said Manning .
“ Unique to Mars , there is a velocity - altitude gap below Mach 5 .
The gap is between the delivery capability of large entry systems at Mars and the capability of super - and sub-sonic decelerator technologies to get below the speed of sound . ”
Plainly put , with our current capabilities , a large , heavy vehicle , streaking through Mars ’ thin , volatile atmosphere only has about ninety seconds to slow from Mach 5 to under Mach 1 , change and re-orient itself from a being a spacecraft to a lander , deploy parachutes to slow down further , then use thrusters to translate to the landing site and finally , gently touch down .
No Airbags
When this problem is first presented to people , the most offered solution , Manning says , is to use airbags , since they have been so successful for the missions that he has been involved with ; the Pathfinder rover , Sojourner and the two Mars Exploration Rovers ( MER ) , Spirit and Opportunity .
But engineers feel they have reached the capacity of airbags with MER .
“ It ’s not just the mass or the volume of the airbags , or the size of the airbags themselves , but it ’s the mass of the beast inside the airbags , ” Manning said .
“ This is about as big as we can take that particular design . ”
In addition , an airbag landing subjects the payload to forces between 10 - 20 G’s .
While robots can withstand such force , humans can’t .
This does n’t mean airbags will never be used again , only that airbag landings ca n’t be used for something human or heavy .
Even the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) rover , weighing 775 kilograms ( versus MER at 175.4 kilograms each ) requires an entirely new landing architecture .
Too massive for airbags , the small - car sized rover will use a landing system dubbed the Sky Crane .
“ Even though some people laugh when they first see it , my personal view is that the Sky Crane is actually the most elegant system we ’ve come up with yet , and the simplest , ” said Manning .
MSL will use a combination of a rocket - guided entry with a heat shield , a parachute , then thrusters to slow the vehicle even more , followed by a crane - like system that lowers the rover on a cable for a soft landing directly on its wheels .
Depending on the success of the Sky Crane with MSL , it ’s likely that this system can be scaled for larger payloads , but probably not the size needed to land humans on Mars .
Atmospheric Anxiety and Parachute Problems
“ The great thing about Earth , ” said Manning “ is the atmosphere . ”
Returning to Earth and entering the atmosphere at speeds between 7 - 10 kilometers per second , the space shuttle , Apollo and Soyuz capsules and the proposed Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) will all decelerate to less than Mach 1 at about twenty kilometers above the ground just by skimming through Earth ’s luxuriously thick atmosphere and using a heat shield .
To reach slower speeds needed for landing , either a parachute is deployed , or in the case of the space shuttle , drag and lift allow the remainder of the speed to bleed away .
But Mars ’ atmosphere is only one per cent as dense as Earth’s .
For comparison , Mars atmosphere at its thickest is equivalent to Earth ’s atmosphere at about 35 kilometers above the surface
The air is so thin that a heavy vehicle like a CEV will basically plummet to the surface ; there ’s not enough air resistance to slow it down sufficiently .
Parachutes can only be opened at speeds less than Mach 2 , and a heavy spacecraft on Mars would never go that slow by using just a heat shield .
“ And there are no parachutes that you could use to slow this vehicle down , ” said Manning .
“ That ’s it .
You ca n’t land a CEV on Mars unless you do n’t mind it being a crater on the surface . ”
That ’s not good news for the Vision for Space Exploration .
Would a higher lift vehicle like the space shuttle save the day ?
“ Well , on Mars , when you use a very high lift to weight to drag ratio like the shuttle , ” said Manning , “ in order to get good deceleration and use the lift properly , you ’d need to cut low into the atmosphere .
You ’d still be going at Mach 2 or 3 fairly close to the ground .
If you had a good control system you could spread out your deceleration to lengthen the time you are in the air .
You ’d eventually slow down to under Mach 2 to open a parachute , but you ’d be too close to the ground and even an ultra large supersonic parachute would not save you . ”
Supersonic parachute experts have concluded that to sufficiently slow a large shuttle - type vehicle on Mars and reach the ground at reasonable speeds would require a parachute one hundred meters in diameter .
“ That ’s a good fraction of the Rose Bowl .
That ’s huge , ” said Manning .
“ We believe there ’s no way to make a 100 - meter parachute that can be opened safely supersonically , not to mention the time it takes to inflate something that large .
You ’d be on the ground before it was fully inflated .
It would not be a good outcome . ”
Heat Shields and Thrusters
It ’s not that Mars ’ atmosphere is useless .
Manning explained that with robotic spacecraft , 99 % of the kinetic energy of an incoming vehicle is taken away using a heat shield in the atmosphere .
“ It ’s not inconceivable that we can design larger , lighter heat shields , ” he said , “ but the problem is that right now the heat shield diameter for a human - capable spacecraft overwhelms any possibility of launching that vehicle from Earth . ”
Manning added that it would almost be better if Mars were like the moon , with no atmosphere at all .
If that were the case , an Apollo - type lunar lander with thrusters could be used .
“ But that would cause another problem , ” said Manning , “ in that for every kilogram of stuff in orbit , it takes twice as much fuel to get to the surface of Mars as the moon .
Everything is twice as bad since Mars is about twice as big as the moon . ”
That would entail a large amount of fuel , perhaps over 6 times the payload mass in fuel , to get human - sized payloads to the surface , all of which would have to be brought along from Earth .
Even on a fictitious air - less Mars that is not an option .
But using current thruster technology in Mars ’ real , existing atmosphere poses aerodynamic problems .
“ Rocket plumes are notoriously unstable , dynamic , chaotic systems , ” said Manning .
“ Basically flying into the plume at supersonics speeds , the rocket plume is acting like a nose cone ; a nose cone that ’s moving around in front of you against very high dynamic pressure .
Even though the atmospheric density is very low , because the velocity is so high , the forces are really huge . ”
Manning likened theses forces to a Category Five hurricane .
This would cause extreme stress , with shaking and twisting that would likely destroy the vehicle .
Therefore using propulsive technology alone is not an option .
Using thrusters in combination with a heat shield and parachute also poses challenges .
Assuming the vehicle has used some technique to slow to under Mach 1 , using propulsion just in last stages of descent to gradually adjust the lander ’s trajectory would enable the vehicle to arrive very precisely at the desired landing site .
“ We ’re looking at firing thrusters less than 1 kilometer above the ground .
Your parachute has been discarded , and you see that you are perhaps 5 kilometers south of where you want to land , ” said Manning .
“ So now you need the ability to turn the vehicle over sideways to try to get to your landing spot .
But this may be an expensive option , adding a large tax in fuel to get to the desired landing rendezvous point . ”
Additionally , on the moon , with no atmosphere or weather , there is nothing pushing against the vehicle , taking it off target , and a la Neil Armstrong on Apollo 11 , the pilot can “ fly out the uncertainties ” as Manning called it , to reach a suitable or desired landing site .
On Mars , however , the large variations in the density of the atmosphere coupled with high and unpredictable winds conspire to push vehicles off course .
“ We need to have ways to fight those forces or ways to make up for any mis-targeting using the propulsion system , ” said Manning .
“ Right now , we do n’t have that ability and we ’re a long way from making it happen . ”
Supersonic Decelerators
The best hope on the horizon for making the human enterprise on Mars possible is a new type of supersonic decelerator that ’s only on the drawing board .
A few companies are developing a new inflatable supersonic decelerator called a Hypercone .
Imagine a huge donut with a skin across its surface that girdles the vehicle and inflates very quickly with gas rockets ( like air bags ) to create a conical shape .
This would inflate about 10 kilometers above the ground while the vehicle is traveling at Mach 4 or 5 , after peak heating .
The Hypercone would act as an aerodynamic anchor to slow the vehicle to Mach 1 .
Glen Brown , Chief Engineer at Vertigo , Inc. in Lake Elsinore , California was also a participant in the Mars Road Mapping session .
Brown says Vertigo has been doing extensive analysis of the Hypercone , including sizing and mass estimates for landers from four to sixty metric tons .
“ A high pressure inflatable structure in the form a of a torus is a logical way to support a membrane in a conical shape , which is stable and has high drag at high Mach numbers , ” Brown said , adding that the structure would likely be made of a coated fabric such as silicon - Vectran matrix materials .
Vertigo is currently competing for funding from NASA for further research , as the next step , deployment in a supersonic wind tunnel , is quite expensive .
The structure would need to be about thirty to forty meters in diameter .
The problem here is that large , flexible structures are notoriously difficult to control .
At this point in time there are also several other unknowns of developing and using a Hypercone .
One train of thought is that if the Hypercone can get the vehicle under Mach 1 , then subsonic parachutes could be used , much like the ones employed by Apollo , or that the CEV is projected to use to land on Earth .
However , it takes time for the parachutes to inflate , and subsequently there would only be a matter of seconds of use , allowing time to shed the parachutes before converting to a propulsive system .
“ You ’d also need to use thrusters , ” said Manning .
“ You ’re falling 10 times faster because the density of Mars ’ atmosphere is 100 times less than Earth’s .
That means that you ca n’t just land with parachutes and touch the ground .
You ’d break people ’s bones , if not the hardware .
So you need to transition from a parachute system to an Apollo - like lunar legged lander sometime before you get to the ground . ”
Manning believes that those who are immersed in these matters , like himself , see the various problems fighting each other .
“ It ’s hard to get your brain around all these problems because all the pieces connect in complex ways , ” he said .
“ It ’s very hard to see the right answer in your mind ’s eye . ”
The additional issues of creating new lightweight but strong shapes and structures , with the ability to come apart and transform from one stage to another at just the right time means developing a rapid - fire Rube Goldberg - like contraption .
“ The honest truth of the matter , ” said Manning , “ is that we do n’t have a standard canonical form , a standard configuration of systems that allows us to get to the ground , with the right size that balances the forces , the loads , the people , and allows us to do all the transformation that needs to be done in the very small amount of time that we have to land . ”
Other Options and Issues
Another alternative discussed at the 2004 Mars Road Mapping session was the space elevator .
“ Mars is really begging for a space elevator , ” said Manning .
“ I think it has great potential .
That would solve a lot of problems , and Mars would be an excellent platform to try it . ”
But Manning admitted that the technology needed to suspend a space elevator has not yet been invented .
The issues with space elevator technology may be vast , even compared with the challenges of landing .
Despite these known obstacles , there are few at NASA currently spending any quality time working on any of the issues of landing humans on Mars .
Manning explained , “ NASA does not yet have the resources to solve this problem and also develop the CEV , complete the International Space Station and do the lunar landing systems development at the same time .
But NASA knows that this is on its plate of things to do in the future and is just beginning to get a handle on the needed technology developments .
I try to go out of my way to tell this story because I ’m encouraging young aeronautical engineering students , particularly graduate students , to start working on this problem on their own .
There is no doubt in my mind that with their help , we can figure out how to make reliable human - scale landing systems work on Mars . ”
While there is much interest throughout NASA and the space sector to try to tackle these issues in the ensuing years , technology also needs a few more years to catch up to our dreams of landing humans on Mars .
And this story , like all good engineering stories , will inevitably read like a good detective novel with technical twist and turns , scientific intrigue , and high adventure on another world .

The ' contestants ' were all in genuine need of a kidney
The " donor " in the show was in fact an actress - though the three people vying for an organ were real patients in need of a kidney transplant .
The three knew that The Big Donor Show , which aired on Friday , was not real .
The producers say it was made to highlight the shortage of Dutch donors .
Before the hoax was revealed , the show had attracted widespread criticism .
" We are not giving away a kidney here , that is going too far even for us , " presenter Patrick Lodiers said at the moment when the fake donor was apparently about to reveal her choice of patient .
The 37 - year - old " donor " , identified only as Lisa , was to make her choice based on the contestants ' history and profile , and conversation with their family and friends .

Bad taste or not , the programme has achieved its goal of raising awareness of the issue

Earlier , Lisa had said that it felt like playing God .
" Think of it as playing Santa Claus , " replied the presenter .
' No losers '
Viewers were invited to send in their opinions and votes by text message during the 80 - minute show .
" We have only done this cry for help because we want to solve a problem that should n't be a problem , " a producer told a news conference after the show .
Dutch Culture Minister Ronald Plasterk hailed the show as a " fantastic stunt " .
Caroline Klingers , a kidney patient who was watching the programme at a treatment centre in the town of Bussum , also praised it .
" It 's good for the publicity and there are no losers , " she said .
Helen Illes , a British woman who had a kidney transplant four years ago , said she was repulsed by the show at first but hoped the publicity would help highlight the need for more donors .
" Although my initial thinking was that this was disgraceful , I thought if this is being done with actors , then I understand it , " she said .
" But what kind of society do we live in where there has to be this kind of show to make people sit up and take notice about it ? " she added .
BBC News website readers had mixed views .
Richard Taylor said it was an " excellent way to highlight the shortage of organs and the desperate plight of those who require them " .
But Doug Nanaimo wrote : " That anyone believed that this was real shows how horrible , tasteless and puerile most television programming has become . "
Earlier in the week Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende had criticised the programme , saying it could damage the reputation of the Netherlands .
There were calls from lawmakers to ban the show and Dutch embassies received complaints about it .
But Mr Lodiers said it was " reality that was shocking " because about 200 people die each year while waiting for a kidney in the Netherlands , and the average waiting time is more than four years .
A small fire broke out today at a partly constructed nuclear power station in northern Japan , the third blaze at the plant this month .
It comes a week after an earthquake caused a radioactive spillage at another atomic plant .
The operator , Hokkaido Electric Power ( Hepco ) , said there was no danger of a radiation leak and there were no injuries during the incident at the Tomari plant .
Two other reactors at Tomari were operating normally , it said .
The Kyodo news agency said investigators found damage to electrical wiring and suspected foul play , but the operator was unavailable to comment .
The fire came eight days after an earthquake caused radiation leaks at the Kashiwazaki - Kariwa plant - which generates the most electricity of nuclear power stations worldwide .
International inspectors were due to visit the Kashiwazaki plant in the aftermath of the quake , in which 400 drums of low - level radioactive waste fell over , with about 40 losing their lids and spilling their contents .
The spillage was one of more than 50 malfunctions at the plant in the immediate aftermath of the quake .
The operator , Tokyo Electric Power ( Tepco ) , was criticised for failing to deal with the blaze and for initially under - reporting the scale of the radioactive leaks .
The Kashiwazaki plant has been closed indefinitely and Japan 's 54 other nuclear power stations have been ordered to carry out emergency safety checks .
The Tomari plant has had problems before .
In 2003 , Hepco temporarily shut a reactor there after a leak in a coolant tank .
And in 1995 , four workers were badly burned when a radioactive waste tank caught fire .
Hepco said no radiation had leaked outside the compound in any of the cases .
Smoking is the stupidest thing you can do to your own body , short of hurling it off a ferry .
It turns your fingers yellow , your teeth brown , and your lungs black .
Lungs .
Lungs .
While I was smoking I often pictured my lungs , just to torture myself ; in my mind 's eye , years of steady puffing had transformed them from cheery pink wet breathing baubles into a brittle pair of crackling , desiccated paper bags , dangling side by side like twin toasted wholemeal pitta breads filled with tar and tumours .
Little wonder I wanted to quit .
But I could n't .
For years , cigarettes and I were trapped in an abusive relationship .
They beat me up , internally speaking , yet I could n't live without them .
To say I smoked like a chimney would be misleading .
A chimney emits smoke serenely , with little apparent effort .
I screwed my face up like a constipated pug , dragging on one deathstick after another like it was my second career .
I even smoked in the shower .
Honestly .
It 's easier than you think .
Every so often , I 'd come to my senses and kick the fags out , promising myself it really was over for good this time .
And then , months down the line , I 'd forget about the bad times , forgive all the damage .
Truth was , I still fancied them .
And in a weak moment , after a few drinks , there I was , back in their arms .
If they had arms , which they do n't .
Still I wanted out .
I tried cold turkey .
Lasted 12 hours and wound up walking to an all - night garage in tears .
Next came the patches .
You have incredible dreams on patches ; vivid 3D Imax productions like you would n't believe .
One night I spent hours floating in space wielding a gigantic cannon , firing planets into suns and watching them explode .
Stick that up your Spiderman 3 .
Thanks to the patches , I quit for five years .
Then I had a harrowing break - up and decided it would be a wheeze to amplify my misery by taking up smoking again .
This time , the habit stuck fast .
I tried the patches again , but my heart was n't in it .
I ended up using them as a " pause button " for the habit proper : I 'd slap a patch on in the morning , pretend not to smoke all day , then peel it off at night and puff my way through a 10 - pack .
Some time later I started going out with someone who thought I had quit .
When she stayed at mine , I 'd smoke in secret ; pop out " to buy a paper " and light up round the corner .
With judicious use of breath mints , you can get away with that for a surprisingly long time .
And it 's genuinely exciting , like an illicit affair .
Naturally , I got caught out one night .
A lighter flew out of my pocket while I was getting undressed .
For several minutes I stood there in my pants , indignantly bellowing that it must have fallen through the ceiling , from the flat upstairs .
I do n't lie well under pressure .
This madness could n't continue , so I resolved to quit once and for all .
Hypnotism proved effective , by which I mean painless .
I did it several times .
Contrary to expectation , the hypnotist did n't programme me to assassinate Tony Blair , just stop lighting up : 72 hours with a bad mood and a head cold and the nicotine had gone .
The problem was that three - month mark : three months into my new life , I 'd visit a pub and somehow come out smoking .
And after my last lapse , I was too ashamed to return to the hypnotist .
Instead , I tried a miracle pill I 'd heard about .
Zyban , the prescription wonder .
You take one a day for six days , then increase the dose .
After 11 days , you stop smoking .
Stay on the pills for seven weeks , and you 're done .
It worked .
Eleven days in I did n't want to smoke , as though the nicotine - craving bit of my brain had been deleted .
A pharmaceutical magic trick .
But .
There was a " but " .
A week after my " quit date " , I was at home , watching a film with a friend .
As the credits rolled , a frantic , nameless dread washed over me .
Within minutes , I was a quivering wreck .
My mind was drifting away from reality , tethered only by a narrow thread that might snap at any moment .
Heart pounding , palms sweating .
I clutched my head , blinking , hyperventilating , nerves jangling at 9,000 rpm .
It was a major panic attack , which eventually lasted over four hours , deep into the night .
I 've never known such terror .
I became obsessed with the notion that I might snap at any moment ; attack my friend , leap from a window , gouge my own eyes out with my thumbs , screaming , shrieking ; a banshee .
I 've had better evenings in .
The next day I decided I 'd had enough of that for one lifetime .
I threw the pills away .
Thing is , it takes days to clear your system .
For a week , I walked around like a de-tuned radio , continually anxious , fighting insane paranoid notions ; a horrified alien visitor on a tour of my own life .
I was terrified it was permanent ; slowly , normality returned .
Weeks later , I still can't believe I was legally prescribed something that could bend my brain over its knee with such demented zeal - although it 's worth pointing out I have no evidence that what happened to me had anything to do with Zyban .
All I know is it happened while I was taking the drug , and stopped several days after I binned the pills .
Maybe it was a coincidence .
Maybe I 'm just crazy .
I do n't know .
I do know , however , that pharmaceutical companies have ominous legal departments orbiting the planet in almighty Death Stars , and that a lawyer twice as powerful as God is doubtless reading this right now .
Anyway .
Smoking kills , and I 'm glad I 've stopped .
Quitting 's worth it .
Just do n't choose a cure worse than death .

Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
“ I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical . ”
So said Jefferson .
It would appear to be time again for a little rebellion in the Grand Old Party â€ “ this time against George II .
For President Bush has attacked his own loyalists for a lack of patriotism .
“ If you do n’t want to do what ’s right for America , ” he said of opponents of the Bush - Kennedy immigration bill , “ if you want to scare the American people , what you say is the bill ’s an amnesty bill .
That ’s empty political rhetoric , trying to frighten our citizens . ”
But if the 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens are instantly legalized , what other term is there to describe that than amnesty ?
Not only are opponents not doing “ what ’s right for America , ” their courage is in question : “ People in Congress need the courage to go back to their districts and explain exactly what this bill is all about .
The fundamental question is , will elected officials have the courage necessary to put a comprehensive immigration plan in place ? ”
Where , one wonders , was “ Bush ’s Brain , ” Karl Rove ?
For , worse than a crime , this attack on his base was a blunder .
The people Bush is savaging â€ “ columnists , commentators , talk - show hosts , congressmen fighting his bill â€ “ have been the frontline troops in his fight to sustain funding for the war .
And if there were any doubt whom Bush had in mind , his surrogate , Linda Chavez , cleared it up :
“ Some people just do n’t like Mexicans â€ “ or anyone else from south of the border .
They think Latinos are freeloaders and welfare cheats who are too lazy to learn English .
They think Latinos have too many babies and that Latino kids will dumb down our schools .
They think Latinos are dirty , diseased , indolent and more prone to criminal behavior .
They think Latinos are just too different from us ever to become real Americans . …
“ Unfortunately , among this group is a fair number of Republican members of Congress , almost all influential conservative talk radio hosts , some cable news anchors â€ “ most prominently , Lou Dobbs â€ “ and a handful of public policy ‘ experts ’ at organizations such as the Center for Immigration Studies , the Federation for American Immigration Reform , NumbersUSA , in addition to fringe groups like the Minuteman Project . ”
Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan cites other attacks by Bush surrogates on the conservative base : “ Sen. Lindsey Graham has said , ‘ We ’re gonna tell the bigots to shut up . ’ … Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff suggested opponents would prefer illegal immigrants be killed ; Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said those who oppose the bill want ‘ mass deportation . ’
Former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson said those who oppose the bill are ‘ anti- immigrant ’ and suggested they suffer from ‘ rage ’ and ‘ national chauvinism . ’
“ Why would they speak so insultingly , with such hostility , of opponents who are concerned citizens ?
And often , though not exclusively , concerned conservatives ? ” asks Noonan .
Because ,
Peggy , down deep where they live , they do n’t like the right , never did and have always sought to be seen by the Big Media as the progressive children of a dysfunctional and retarded family .
Bush ’s attack on the motives and character of conservatives tell us it is Goldwater - Rockefeller time again â€ “ time to split the blanket .
Conservatives need to declare their independence of Bush and to repudiate Bushism as the philosophy of their movement and party .
While Bush ’s court appointments , setting aside the Harriet Miers mess , have been superb , while his tax cuts have been Reaganite , while his stand on traditional values is courageous , beyond is a vast wasteland as far as the eye can see .
His free - trade zealotry has led to five straight record trade deficits .
While America ’s economy is now growing at under 1 percent , China ’s is booming at 10 percent .
His refusal to defend and secure the borders is well - nigh impeachable .
His compromises with Teddy Kennedy on No Child Left Behind have doubled the size of the Department of Education without any appreciable gain in test scores .
His “ Big Government Conservatism ” marks him as his father ’s son , not Reagan ’s heir .
In Ward Connerly ’s courageous battle against reverse discrimination , the Bushes have all been on the other side .
His bungled war of choice on Iraq has left us with 3,400 dead , 25,000 wounded , hundreds of billions deeper in debt and an Army on the point of breaking .
Relations with Europe , Russia , and the Arab and Muslim world are worse than they were when he took office .
His clandestine drive to merge Mexico , America and Canada in a “ Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ” â€ “ a North American Union modeled on the European Union â€ “ entails the loss of sovereignty and end of the republic as we know it .
The damage Bush has done to his party is beginning to rival that of Herbert Hoover .
If the Clintons were doing this , would conservatives be mute ?
Time to lock and load .

In Peru
Oscar - winning Al Gore chose to call his film about global warming An Inconvenient Truth .
But for Peru it is more like an alarming reality .
Government officials , water experts and environmentalists agree the rapid melting of the spectacular Andean glaciers featured in the film is threatening the long - term economic and human development of what is South America 's most " water - stressed " country .
The Cordillera Blanca provides drinking water and electricity
Enlarge Image
" Global warming for us is not just about the environment , " warns Julio Garcia of Peru's National Council on the Environment , Conam .
" It 's more about how on earth we can develop Peru in a sustainable way over the coming years . "
Peru 's water problem lies in part in the peculiar geography of the country .
Most of the Pacific coast would be desert if it were not for the water flowing down from the Andes .
Seventy per cent of the population live along the coast , where less than 2 % of the country 's water resources are found .
In contrast , the Atlantic side of the Andes has 98 % of the water and about a quarter of the population .
Click here for a map of Peru
" Much of our water supply is on the wrong side of the wall , " says Mr Garcia .
Glacial melt
Peru has the largest number of tropical glaciers in the world .
These water towers are crucial for slowly releasing water , particularly in the dry season .
And Peru desperately needs the water all year round .
Apart from the need for drinking water , 80 % of the country 's power has traditionally come from hydro- electricity .
And , the current boom sectors of the economy - agro-exports and mining - also absorb huge volumes of water .
Lima already has a large deficit between supply and demand and official projections say it 's going to get a lot larger in the future
Juan Carlos Barandiaran
Estimates by a team of Peruvian and international scientists say that Peru and Bolivia , which together account for more than 90 % of the world 's tropical glaciers , have lost about a third of the surface area of their glaciers between the 1970s and 2006 .
A lot of attention has been paid to the range known as Cordillera Blanca , home to Peru 's largest mountain , Huascaran , at 6,768 metres ( 22,200ft ) .
Water coming down from the range feeds an array of economic activities in the Rio Santa valley below it .
This includes a hydro-electric plant providing 5 % of Peru 's electricity , drinking water for two cities , and commercial and small - scale agriculture .
" Water from glaciers is absolutely critical for the valley in the six or seven months of the dry season , " says Gabriela Rosas , a researcher at the national weather institute , Senamhi .
Glacial melt is calculated to provide 10 to 20 % of the total annual water run-off in the valley , but it can reach 40 % in the dry season .
Ms Rosas is part of a team modelling future water availability in Peru .
The models , based on moderate rises in temperature , predict annual water availability will increase slightly as more of the glaciers melt , but that there will be a dramatic decline after 2050 and possibly as early as 2030 .
Seasonal variations will become more intense , with less water available in the dry season .
Low reserves
Lima , Peru 's capital , is a particular worry .
The government wants more people to have water connections ( Photo : Peru Support Group )
The city gets most of its water from the Rio Rimac and two other rivers with sources high up in the Andes .
The rivers are partly fed by glacial melt , although less than the Rio Santa valley .
" Lima already has a large deficit between supply and demand and official projections say it 's going to get a lot larger in the future , " says Juan Carlos Barandiaran , former head of projects for the municipal water company , Sedapal .
Demand is set to increase as the city absorbs thousands of new arrivals every year .
" We must have more reserves , " says Mr Barandiaran .
The last major drought in 2004 pushed the city 's water supplies to the limit .
" If we had droughts two years running our current reserves would not support it , " he says .
President Alan Garcia 's government wants to give water connections to nearly a million more people in Lima , but experts say this will increase demand even more .
The project is known as " Agua para todos " or " Water for all " .
But , says Sedapal 's former president , Carlos Silvestri : " It will be very little water for all . "
' Vulnerable '
For several years , Mr Silvestri and other experts have been urging successive governments to build a range of multi-million - dollar infrastructure works , including a second tunnel through the Andes , in order to build up their reserves .
We really are on the edge of an abyss
Carlos Silvestri
" We are only city in South America with so few reserves - less than a year 's supply .
We are very vulnerable , " says Mr Silvestri .
He also worries about the increased frequency and intensity of droughts due to El Nino , and Lima 's current reliance on just one 60 - km ( 37 - mile ) tunnel fetching water from the other side of the Andes .
And now there 's glacial melt .
" We really are on the edge of an abyss , " he warns .
Scientists say it is hard to predict in how many years the effect of glacial melt will really bite .
But it is remarkable how many experts in Peru take seriously the prediction that the time will come this century when a barrel of water will cost more than a barrel of oil .
Hardball : David Shuster smacks down Scooter Libby defender David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Saturday July 7 , 2007 Print This Email This On MSNBC 's Hardball on Friday , guest host David Shuster reported on a fresh controversy surrounding the Scooter Libby pardon .
In a Wall Street Journal column on June 8 , conservative Fouad Ajami wrote " Scooter Libby was a soldier in your -- our -- war in Iraq .
He can't be left behind as a casualty of a war our country had once proudly claimed as its own . "
That remark has sparked widespread outrage .
Ajami appeared with Shuster to defend himself , saying testily , " I do n't really need to be lectured on the soldiers killed in Iraq .
... I have a nephew serving with the US military as a lieutenant in Iraq .
...
You have to be able to handle a metaphor . "
Ajami then began laying out a set of standard talking - points , begining with the familiar argument that Libby was not really the person who leaked Valerie Plame 's identity .
" I know where you 're going with this , " interrupted Shuster .
" You said , ' Oh , we know that Richard Armitage was n't the leaker , ' as if there was just one leaker .
... Richard Armitage would have only had this information about Valerie Wilson only because Scooter Libby asked the State Department for the information .
...
Seven different people talked with Scooter Libby about Valerie Wilson .
... Vice President Cheney told Scooter Libby about Valerie Wilson . "
When Ajami attempted to continue with the assertion that " there had been no underlying crime , " Shuster broke in again , pointing out that " the whole issue was that because Scooter Libby lied and obstructed the investigation , Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was not able to make a call . "
" This should never have been criminalized to begin with , " insisted Ajami .
" This was part of the debate on the Iraq War . "
" Why do you believe that Scooter Libby lied to the FBI , lied to the grand jury if this was simply a matter of politics ? "
Shuster replied .
Shuster then invited Iraq veteran Paul Rieckhoff , founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , to respond to Ajami 's comments .
Rieckhoff said , " I think it 's absurd David .
I think it 's a new low and an act of desperation here to defend a man , comparing him to fallen soldiers .
...
Part of the soldier 's creed is to say that you will uphold the Army values and live the Army values .
Those values include honor , integrity , personal courage .
They do n't include lying and breaking the law . "
Rieckhoff continued , " If you are going to use us as props for a political argument to defend Scooter Libby , you have to understand that we 're going to push back .
Scooter Libby does not embody the Army values .
He is not an honorable soldier by breaking the law and lying . "
At the end of the segment , Fouad Ajami returned with an attempt to connect the 9/11 attacks to the war in Iraq .
Shuster quickly cut him off , saying , " Mr. Ajami , I 'm not going to let you end this with the idea that Iraq was part of 9/11 , when everybody knows that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 . "

The Natural Productivity Cycle
In your personal life , when attending to business or working on side projects , how often do you spend 8 consecutive hours in front of a computer ?
It does n’t make sense because we lose the ability to concentrate effectively within a few hours .
Everyone goes through alternating periods of high and low mental acuity .
There are days when I work on personal projects for well over 8 hours , but the time is always divided into multiple sessions .
I might spend a few hours coding a design , a few hours writing , and a few hours reading feeds , moderating comments , and responding to email .
I work this way because it aligns with my mental energy cycle .
Any more than 3 hours in front of a computer and my eyes start hurting and I become restless .
I lose the ability to do my best work .
Instead of forcing myself to continue , I switch to an activity that allows my mind to recharge .
These breaks maximize productivity by eliminating down periods .
It ’s counter productive to force work when the mental energy is n’t there .
The Problem with an 8 Hour Work Day
A continuous 8 hour work day is a relic of the past .
It makes sense for physical labor and manufacturing work , but with information workers it does n’t account for the mental energy cycle .
The ability of a factory worker to think analytically is irrelevant , he ’s either cranking widgets or he is n’t .
In the case of the modern information worker , nearly all tasks involve creative or strategic thinking .
The way someone answers an email or interprets a piece of information can differ drastically depending on his or her energy level .
Nobody does their best work 5:30 in the afternoon after they ’ve been sucking down coffee all day to stay awake .
I ca n’t speak for all workers , but I ’ve observed that productivity levels generally peak twice a day — first thing in the morning and shortly after lunch .
The most productive period is the beginning of the day .
People are capable of creative tasks like writing and solving complex technical problems .
After a couple hours of intense work , energy levels drop and workers downgrade to less demanding tasks like responding to email and tinkering with existing creations .
Towards the end of the cycle , the mind is so cluttered and drained that workers resort to “ work related activities ” that appear productive but do n’t contribute to the bottom line .
The afternoon cycle is similar but the productivity peak is n’t as high .
For different people the peaks and valleys will vary , but overall I ’d estimate only 3 - 4 hours a day could be classified as highly productive .
This number is n’t caused by slacking .
You ca n’t force an information worker to be highly productive when the energy is n’t there .
Workers can try their hardest , but the work just wo n’t have that creative edge .
The low ratio of highly productive hours to total hours worked is the result of the continuous 8 hour work day .
When workers reach the low energy part of the cycle , they ca n’t recharge with a non -work activity .
The only option is office purgatory .
You ca n’t be highly productive because you ’re mentally fatigued , but you ca n’t recharge because the 8 hour work day requires the appearance of constant productivity .
The result is millions of unproductive workers trapped at their desks when they ’d rather be doing something else .
Alternative Work Arrangements
The obvious solution to this problem is planning around the mental energy cycle by breaking the work day into multiple segments .
The traditional office setting does n’t accommodate this because there are few available recharge activities .
People ca n’t do household chores , run errands , or engage in recreational activities without leaving the workplace .
Some companies have tried to make the work environment more accommodating by offering meals , fitness centers , and special areas for relaxation .
Although these amenities are certainly an improvement , they ’re expensive for employers and only partially satisfy employees .
The solution that makes the most sense is a remote work arrangement because it reduces employer costs and allows employees to adjust their work schedule to their mental energy cycle .
When a worker becomes mentally fatigued , they can go off the clock and engage in recharge activities that are personally productive like exercise or relaxation .
When energy returns , the worker can start working again at a high level , effectively cutting out the low productivity period of the cycle .
Employers do n’t pay for unproductive time and employees get to work in a more natural pattern that adjusts to their personal lives .
Why is n’t everyone doing this already ?
Many workers already are , and as commutes get worse and communications improve , the number will continue to increase .
Of course there will always be a need for office workers in businesses ( like doctor ’s offices and law firms ) that require daily customer interaction , but for most companies it really is n’t necessary .
There is also the argument that people need to collaborate in person .
This is steadily becoming less essential .
Most office communications are already done through email or instant messenger .
Face to face meetings are certainly necessary , but for the vast majority of lower and mid level employees meetings are the exception and could be conducted via phone / video conference or condensed into one or two days a week .
Another common objection is that employees will abuse remote work arrangements by slacking off .
I ’m inclined to believe that most adults value their employment enough that this is n’t a problem .
In cases where supervision is required , web cams and other technology can used to monitor a worker .
I suspect the real reason remote work arrangements are still the exception is inertia .
Companies are used to doing business in the office and are reluctant to change .
There is also the presence of office politics .
If one person is given a remote arrangement , jealous employees will complain .
Does n’t it make sense to give everyone what they want and save a boat load of cash on office space ?
I may only be a kid in his 20’s , but I can tell when something just makes sense .
I perceive an increasing number of people are noticing the same phenomena .
Forty years from now we ’ll be telling our grandchildren about the olden days when everyone ’s mommy and daddy went to work in an office .
The Real Story of JPG Magazine
If there ’s one thing I ’ve learned about community - building , it ’s this : Do Not Lie .
People are too smart and well - connected to believe a lie anymore .
So , with that in mind , the story I ’m about to tell is absolutely true as I experienced it .
How JPG Began
In September , 2004 , Heather and I went for a walk in Buena Vista Park and started dreaming up a community project .
The idea was to create a printed venue for all the awesome photographers we saw online .
That afternoon I checked : jpgmag.com was available .
A couple months later , we launched the site .
We used every available free web tool we could find : Flickr for community discussions , Gmail for submissions , Notifylist for the mailing list , and ultimately Lulu for printing the magazine .
We maxed out a Gmail account collecting submissions for issue 1 .
After it was published , my friend Paul offered to whip up a backend in PHP that allowed people to submit online .
By issue 2 , we were using the system he developed .
We created six issues over two years this way , each with a public call for submissions on a theme , and edited by Heather and I .
Each one was a labor of love , not just for us , but for the thousands of amazing photographers who submitted their work out of a altruistic desire to participate .
Inspired by the amazing growth of the magazine , in 2006 , Heather , Paul , and I began discussing what we were then calling “ JPG 2.0 . ”
We wanted to open up the publishing process to the community to let everyone help make the magazine .
I came up with a spec for how it would work .
Paul and I had been doing freelance design and consulting work for a while , and had been talking about starting a design firm .
We envisioned devoting four days of the week to clients , and using the fifth for our own projects .
JPG was at the top of the list .
But once we looked at the spec for JPG 2.0 , we realized that , if we built that tool , we could make a magazine on any topic .
The opportunity we had before us was really “ Magazine Publishing 2.0 . ”
I remember sitting in Heather ’s and my apartment , on our big , blue couch , asking Paul , “ If you had the choice , would you rather start a design firm or a publishing company ? ”
For me , the answer was easy .
I ’d been working in and around magazines and newspapers since high school .
I wanted to start a publishing company .
Paul was n’t sure .
But all that changed when he met Halsey Minor .
Birth of 8020
Halsey was the founder of CNET .
Paul met him through the editor of Surface Magazine , where Paul was a long - time web contractor .
Halsey also had been thinking about a participation - driven magazine company .
Our ideas seemed to overlap nicely .
The three of us , plus Halsey ’s business partner Ron , got together for a steak dinner ( I had the fish ) .
I brought a few copies of JPG .
We talked about what we ’d learned doing it , and how we thought we could expand the idea to multiple magazines .
Conversations continued .
A few weeks later Paul and I were in a meeting with Ron , who asked , “ Which one of you would be CEO ? ”
The obvious answer , as I saw it , was : “ We have n’t discussed that yet . ”
“ Me , ” Paul said .
Discussing it later , Paul assured me .
“ It ’s no big deal , it just means I ’ll have some extra stuff to do , but otherwise we ’ll be equal partners . ” I believed him .
We called the company 8020 Publishing .
I suggested the name based on my experience with virtual communities , after the 80/20 ratio of lurkers to posters .
Halsey invested in exchange for a percentage in the company .
After 11 years of working at other people ’s startups , I was finally the cofounder of my own .
It was a dream come true .
Paul and I talked about all the different magazines we ’d start , but ultimately decided to begin with JPG .
The brand had two years of momentum behind it and a strong community .
8020 bought JPG from Heather and I for a modest sum .
I did n’t think about it too much at the time , because I was still the editor , Heather would still participate as much as she could , and I still owned it because I owned a portion of 8020 .
We hired an amazing team and , over the course of the next year , we built the JPG 2.0 system of my dreams .
We began selling subscriptions and advertisements , and distributing to bookstores .
The community grew by leaps and bounds .
We published four more issues in the new system ( the fourth , issue 10 , should come out soon ) .
We also participated in two different gallery shows .
Getting unknown photographers onto the walls of art galleries is still one of the things I ’m proudest of .
Fight or Flight
Unfortunately , issue 10 will be the last one that Heather and I will have a hand in .
We are no longer working for JPG Magazine or 8020 Publishing .
Why ?
The reasons are complicated , and the purpose of this post is not to air dirty laundry – it ’s just to let the community know why the founders of JPG are no longer there .
We owe you that much .
In one evening , Paul removed issues 1 - 6 from the JPG website , removed Heather from the About page , and deleted the “ Letter from the Editors ” that had lived on the site since day one .
Paul informed me that we were inventing a new story about how JPG came to be that was all about 8020 .
He told me not to speak of that walk in Buena Vista , my wife , or anything that came before 8020 .
Here ’s where the whole “ not lying ” thing comes in .
I just could not agree to this new story .
It did n’t , and still does n’t , make any business sense to me .
Good publishing companies embrace their founding editors and community , not erase them .
Besides , we ’d published six issues with participation from thousands of people .
There ’s no good reason to be anything but proud of that .
We had a long meeting with Ron. I tried to compromise .
I suggested we add text to the website , explaining the difference between issues 1 - 6 and the new issues .
I wanted to embrace the truth :
Tell people how we started , how we grew , and what we were now .
It ’s the story of how a successful , organic community begins .
It ’s the story of how authentic media gets made .
And it has the added benefit of being true .
Compromse could not be reached .
It became clear that we could not continue to work together with this fundamental disagreement .
And because he was the CEO , I was the one who would have to leave .
I still own a percentage of the company , so I hope to see JPG continue to grow and prosper .
Unfotunately , it will be without its founding editors .
I ’m indescribably sad this happened .
I invested every bit of my personal and professional capital in this .
I spent three years of my life working on JPG .
I traveled the world to promote JPG and 8020 .
I hired my friends and designed the system .
I managed the community and we built 10 amazing issues together .
I ’m very proud of what we made .
What I Learned
If it ’s any help to other entrepreneurs , here ’s what I ’ve learned .
Make no assumptions when it comes to roles and responsibilities .
Like my dad says : “ Someone ’s gotta call quittin ’ time . ”
Communication between partners is mandatory .
And you cannot communicate with someone who is not communicating with you .
Decisions are n’t decisions if you have to keep making them .
Set on the course and stick to it .
If you keep talking about things that have already been decided , nothing will ever get done .
When someone says one thing , but acts in a contradictory way , you have a choice between believing their words or believing their deeds .
Believe their deeds .
Never let anyone tell you what you want .
When someone says , “ You do n’t want that , ” what they really mean is , “ I do n’t want you to have that . ”
Do n’t stay where you ’re not wanted , respected , or happy .
Even if it ’s your company .
Ever Forward
I chose to tell this story because I wanted the community I spent three years growing to know that I did n’t leave on a whim .
As sad and embarrasing as it is to tell , I put the truth out there because my personal and professional credibility is on the line .
To my friends and colleagues who supported JPG over the years , thank you .
You made JPG a wonderful magazine and community .
And to the people I hired at 8020 , I miss you terribly .
This was not your fault .
And to the members of JPG community , thank you for all of your amazing work .
I want you to know that I tried to work through a tough situation with honesty and integrity .
And , in the end , I left because I could no longer create the kind of authentic media we set out to make together .
I hope that the next venture I start is lucky enough to have participation from people with the same enthusiasm , talent , and genuine awesomeness .
Until then ,
— Derek

Why did I write this ?
Here ’s why .

The female orgasm is more of a mystery than the
Bermuda Triangle .
One of the greatest differences between the sexes is that
men always seem to be in the mood .
For women , however , arousal and satisfaction are much
more complicated issues .
Research reveals that as many as 40 per
cent of women in the UK have a libido which
is limbo low , causing all kinds of resentments within a relationship .
Husbands seem bemused about female sexual dysfunction .
How can a woman lose her orgasm ?
What is it ?
A sock ?
Is it in some sexual laundry basket waiting to be paired so it can become a multiple orgasm ?
People often lose things .
Their tempers .
Their sense of humour .
Their figures .
( Do the words " control top panty hose " mean anything to you ? )
Their minds .
But not their orgasm .
But for nearly half the female population ,
the orgasm has become more elusive than
the Yeti .
Couples are out there now ,
searching with as much vigour and dedication as
we once looked for the Loch Ness Monster
or Amelia Earhart .
With impotence drugs such as Viagra worth more than £ 1.3 billion , drug companies are now keen to make profit out of female sexual dissatisfaction .
But the author Marrena Lindberg claims a more natural solution .
She has written The Orgasmic Diet , a book which promises to give " all women the ability to have orgasms within two weeks , even if they have never had one before " .
Even if you are lucky enough to reach orgasm regularly , the book promises to make the experiences even bigger and better .
Always greedy for more of anything , I agreed to stick to the diet for three weeks .
( Hey , any diet which counsels you to devour a couple of
squares of dark chocolate every day is okay by me . )
The fish oil supplements , however , proved harder to swallow .
Literally .
The dose the
book recommends , 2.5 of EPA and 2g of DHA , actually means eight biggish tablets a day .
I ’ve ingested so much fish oil I ’m swimming upstream in the bath .
The fish oil is supposed to release dopamine , the feelgood chemical associated with the emotions of anticipation and desire .
But by
week two , the only thing I was anticipating with desire was giving up taking so many damn
tablets .
The third element of the diet is to cut down on carbohydrates .
Apparently , too much starch
stimulates serotonin .
This is also a feel - good brain chemical , but an excess makes you too hyper to surrender to a
sexy mood because you ’re too busy thinking about all the things you have to do .
Men , take note .
Serotonin or no serotonin , women
think of a great many things while making love .
Topics include : " I wonder if my boobs would look
bigger if I lay on my side ?
" I have n’t told him how much I spent on those sandals .
Will he understand that it ’s genetically impossible for a woman to walk
past a shoe sale and not buy something irrational and strappy ?
" I glimpsed Angelina Jolie on television this morning and she looked a little plump . "
Meanwhile , the only thing going through the average man ’s mind while making love is " Phwoarrrrrr " .
I digress .
The next step is to increase your testosterone .
What this means is replacing those
carbohydrates with lots of nonstarchy fruit and vegetables , plus protein at every meal .
I was also told to give up coffee .
Giving up carbs was okay , but coffee ?
I ’m a working
mother .
Still , keen to discover the New and Improved
Libidinous
Me , I stuck to the rest of the diet as best I could for three weeks .
With growing
excitement I waited for the wake - up call to my senses , the hormonal reveille .
Any minute now the air would crackle with sexual heat , like a fuse burning towards a bomb .
I
was going to discover in myself a passion so fiery that not even that daredevil oil well capper , Red Adair , could quench it .
When that Big O came , I felt sure I ’d cry out with such intense ecstasy that my neighbours
would be confused whether it was an orgasm or demonic possession .
My partner would n’t
know whether to offer a postcoital cigarette or an exorcist .
So , what happened ?
Did I net the Loch Ness Monster ?
Did the Yeti come in from the cold ?
Did I discover the postcode of the Bermuda Triangle ?
Yes !
Yes !
Yessss !!!
But was it do with the diet ?
Or the fact that eating less puddings and sugar means losing weight , and if you feel better about your
body , you ’re more inclined to want to show it off naked and be more confident when doing so .
The more confident you are , the more relaxed you are ... and , hormonal Houston , we have lift off .
Yes , fish oils increase blood flow , crucial for sexual pleasure , but as the book also recommends
taking up exercise , it might be the daily jog which had my heart , not to mention other parts of my anatomy , pumping so furiously .
We know that men will have sex with anything .
The female orgasm , however , is profoundly
dependent on the psychological and emotional landscape .
Too many men expect their wives to come home from work , make dinner , do the ironing ,
finish the kids ’ homework , defrost the chops for tomorrow , put the washing on , pack the dishwasher — then jump into bed purring
like a sex kitten .
But let me tell you , when a mother flops , exhausted , between the sheets , the one thing
she ’s fantasising about is sleep .
He ’s in the mood for love .
You ’re in the mood for running him through with a bread knife .
Especially if he has n’t helped you all evening .
But I ’m convinced that if a husband would do the odd Sensitive Thing with mange tout in the
kitchen , his wife might be inclined to do something sensitive to him , in a horizontal capacity .
Although , talking to my women friends , one of their main complaints is that too many
husbands only hug their wives when they ’re horizontal .
It seems to me that the trouble with married sex is not women faking orgasms , but
men faking foreplay .
And as wordplay is foreplay for women , talking and hugging out of bed are vital .
All women dream of being taken — preferably by a
muscular Adonis .
But most wives are being taken only for granted .
So I would say forget the orgasm diet .
Just help with the housework , boys , and your wife will soon be eager to show
you her appreciation .

Dear Cingular ,
I hope business is well .
I have been a happy customer for over a year now .
Last year , you enticed me with a lovely smartphone , in addition to an unlimited data plan .
Being able to send / receive e-mail at anytime is priceless .
And , at $ 69.97 / month , it 's expensive , but certainly worth it .
Now , I 'm no business man , but this is completely stupid :
That 's right , you 're paying $ 5.15 , every month , to send me my bill : a 231 page manifesto of stupidity .
That 's over 7 % of what
I
pay
you
, and you 're giving it away to the post office so they can clog my postbox with even more useless shit .
Did I make a bajillion phone calls last month ?
No , of course not .
But
every time
my phone went and checked for e-mail , you diligently recorded every transaction and mailed me a hardcopy so that I could use it in case I ran out of toilet paper .
Cingular , please - a little common sense would be useful here .
Those with unlimited data plans do n't really need to know each and every time they made a data transfer , because they do n't care .
Does my ISP save and send me a record every time I visit a web site ?
Of course not .
This is really stupid ,
and
you 're losing several million dollars in postage every month
and
you do n't even know it .
Just fix it , ok ?
Thanks .
ps -
Yes , you can disable paper bills , but you should n't have to
pps -
Yes , your lawyers probably gave you some reasons why you need to send out full histories of every data transfer , but they 're clearly stupid .
The answer is no ; for more information , see the section describing the reasons for this .
In other words , does there exist any number system which , as well as including the familiar numbers we are used to , also includes an " infinity " concept ?
Now the question is , does infinity exist in the same way that these concepts ( negative numbers , fractions , etc. ) do ?
Number systems come in many sizes .
There is the " natural number system " , which is just the set of numbers used in counting : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and so on .
Or , one can expand this number system to include additional concepts , such as negative numbers , fractions , even the so - called " imaginary " numbers ( which are not really imaginary at all ) .
Each of these concepts exists provided we look for it in the context of a large enough number system .
A number system is any collection of objects that has the basic properties ( like addition , multiplication , and so on ) we normally associate with numbers .
More information is available on this .
You 've probably never heard the term " topological space " before ; it occurs in an advanced branch of mathematics .
Do n't worry ; we do n't need to get into that advanced area .
All we need is the following rough idea :
Roughly speaking , a topological space is any collection of objects for which there is a definition of which sequences of objects converge to other objects , and which sequences do n't .
The real number system is a topological space : there 's a definition of what it means for a sequence of numbers to converge .
For instance , the sequence 1.1 , 1.01 , 1.001 , 1.0001 , etc. converges to the number 1 , while the sequence 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , etc. does not converge to anything .
In areas such as calculus , one often speaks of a sequence like 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , . . . as " converging to infinity " .
Is this just a convenient phrase , or can there actually exist an object " infinity " that this sequence is converging to ?
In other words , the question is : does there exist some topological space ( that is , a set of objects plus a definition of what convergence means ) which , as well as including the familiar real numbers we are used to , also includes an " infinity " concept to which some sequences of real numbers converge ?
The answer is yes ; for more information , see the section describing the reasons for this .
It is important to realize , though , that this topological space is not a number system .
Although it includes an additional object called " infinity " as well as the familiar real numbers , you cannot add , subtract , multiply , or divide this additional object the way you can numbers .
Sometimes you will see a statement like " " .
This does not really mean what it seems to say .
You are not really dividing 1 by infinity .
Instead , it is a statement about sequences .
What it means is that if a sequence , , , . . . converges to infinity , then the sequence of reciprocals , , , . . . converges to zero .
( Similar looking expressions like " " do n't make any sense , for just because two sequences , , , . . . and , , , . . . each converge to infinity tells you nothing about what the sequence , , , . . . does . )
Students will learn about video game technology
The one - year postgraduate course in interactive entertainment technology is starting at Trinity College in October .
It has been designed in collaboration with some of the world 's top gaming companies .
Module subjects include graphics , artificial intelligence and real - time animation .
Students will get to operate technology used by professional game development companies .
Course director Dr Steven Collins said it was a fantastic opportunity .
" Interactive entertainment is one of the fastest growing and most exciting areas of global industry right now , " he said .
" If we can continue to grow the skills and knowledge available in Ireland in key areas , building on our research strengths , we have the ability to make Ireland a specialised hub for this business . "
The growth of online technology means that the skills students will learn on the course will be relevant and in demand
Orla Sheridan , Microsoft
The closing date for applications is 31 July and Dr Collins said it was proving very popular .
" We 're attracting local and international students and , with only a month left before applications close , time is running out , " he said .
The course is open to 25 students , each of whom must have at least a 2:1 undergraduate degree in computer sciences or a related subject .
During the second half of the year students put theory into practice , including a group project which could involve developing a game .
The course is supported by Microsoft and the company 's Orla Sheridan said : " There is a huge demand for skills in this technology , both from established global players and also from smaller companies based here and abroad .
" The growth of online technology means that the skills students will learn on the course will be relevant and in demand . "

The sci - fi dork future has long promised a world of computer interaction and automation in which , the moment you walk into your office , your computer says , " Good morning , " shakes your hand , and offers you a cup of coffee .
While we have n't yet reached this glorious morning , there 's actually a surprising amount of software available — especially for Macs — that offers an impressive range of task automation .
Advertisement
Using network and Bluetooth detection software , you can do things like mount networked drives , set default printers , enable / disable your screensaver , and launch applications based on what networks are available , what network you 're connected to , and what Bluetooth devices are in range .
Today I 'll show you how .
Advertisement
Despite the proliferation of applications out there for Macs that tackle these ideas in one way or another , I 'm only going to focus on two : Home Zone ( the best I 've seen ) and previously mentioned Home and Away .
( Others include MarcoPolo and Proximity . )
Using these two handy little apps , we can set our computer to do all kinds of really cool things that make our computing lives more secure , simpler , and more fun .
There are a lot of different ways that you might be able to set up your computer to do your bidding with Home Zone ( and to a lesser extent , Home and Away ) , so I 'm just going to show you a couple of my favorite ways to use them :
For proximity - based actions and location - based actions .
Advertisement
Proximity - based actions with Home Zone
What you 'll need : First , be sure you 've grabbed a copy of Home Zone .
Second , you 'll need a Bluetooth device that you carry with you — which will most likely be your mobile phone .
Advertisement
Open up Home Zone , which will add a new entry to your menu bar .
Using your Bluetooth device , we 're going to configure a set of actions that you want to occur every time you walk away from your computer and another set for every time you return to your computer .
First , you need to create a new zone ( which you do by clicking on the plus sign (+ ) next to Zones .
Then name your zone ( I 've called mine Proximity actions ) .
Advertisement
Next head over to the Triggers section and set up a new Bluetooth trigger .
Again , hit the plus sign (+ ) to add a new trigger , then select " Bluetooth device " from the drop - down and click the Select Bluetooth device box to select the Bluetooth device you want to use as your proximity trigger .
( If you have n't already set up your Bluetooth device with your computer , you may need to do so before you can find it in the menu . )
Advertisement
Now it 's time to have some fun .
In the Actions section , you can define a set of actions you want to be performed when your Bluetooth device enters range along with another set of actions to be performed when your device leaves your computer 's range .
What you set up here is completely up to you , but to give you an idea of how you might be able to use it , here 's how I 've got it set up .
When I leave my computer , Home Zone :
Enables my screen saver password for an added layer of security
Starts my screen saver
Increases my system volume ( This way I can still hear my music when I walk into another room , and if I have any alerts set up , I can hear those , too .
However , if you work in a more public setting , you might want to do just the opposite — turn down or even mute your volume when you leave so your computer wo n't disturb others while you 're gone . )
Advertisement
When I return to my computer , Home Zone :
Advertisement
Disables my screen saver password
Stops my screen saver
Decreases my system volume ( Again , you might flip this depending on your work setting . )
Advertisement
Handy , huh ?
Other cool proximity actions you might want to consider include the ability to pause iTunes , lock your Keychain , open files , or synchronize data with iSync .
Location - based actions with Home Zone and Home and Away
In much the same way that you can set up your Bluetooth device to execute proximity - based actions that tether you to your computer , you can set up location - based actions that tether your computer to different networks .
Setting up these actions works the same way as they work above with your Bluetooth device ( except you 'll want to choose a network rather than a Bluetooth device as your trigger .
However , the range of actions you might want to use when you connect to a new network opens up new doors .
For example , when I leave my home network , I 've set Home Zone to :
Advertisement
Set my default printer to my PDF virtual printer ( which is normally how I print away from home . )
Mute my system volume ( Generally when I travel with my laptop , I prefer it 's muted until I tell it otherwise . )
Advertisement
When I return to my home network , Home zone :
Sets my default printer to my networked printer
Unmutes my computer
Other handy actions you might want to execute include launching a file or application or even changing networks ( okay , I 'm not sure exactly when " change networks " might be a viable option , but there 's bound to be a time ) .
Advertisement
As you can see , there 's a lot of potential for how you might use these actions , and there 's a lot of room for growth in terms of actions that could be useful in future releases of Home Zone ( after all , it 's still a beta app ) .
The one killer feature that 's still missing from Home Zone , IMHO , is the ability to mount and unmount network volumes .
That 's why I 've also suggested previously mentioned Home and Away , which fills this gap for now by letting you automatically mount network volumes when you connect to specific networks .
Fingers crossed that in the future Home Zone will incorporate this feature .
Extending your options
In my examples , I kept things very simple .
However , since Home Zone allows you to combine triggers in a variety of ways , you might also consider setting up combinations of proximity - and location - based actions .
For example , you may want your proximity actions to behave differently when you 're in your home office versus your local coffee shop .
Just create a new zone and start combining triggers and get specific .

Your computer may not hand you a cup of coffee when you walk in the door ( yet ) , but it 's better than nothing .
Windows users , I 'm sorry to say that your free options covering the same sort of territory are sorely limited ( if available at all — the best I could find was the $ 30 Net Profile Switch ) .
If you 've got any other cool ideas for how you might take advantage of any of these great applications ( especially Home Zone ) , let 's hear them in the comments .

( A hacker friend of mine recently heard a talk by an executive at a giant corporation , and his reaction was so funny that I had to preserve it .
The company 's name has of course been changed . )
Hey Paul ,
I just heard a presentation by a woman who is the " Chief Engineer " at Megacorp about how Megacorp does business , and I could n't believe it !
You often write about practices inside big corporations , but this is my first even indirect experience with that .
Here are some of the quotations or near - quotations I wrote down :
" value levers "
" structured phase gate approach "
" Lean Six Sigma "
" mistake - proofing "
" it 's a stage - gate execution process with a focus on the value chain "
" medium impact to in - process and results metrics and Business Case .
Decision Team discretion for phase exit "
" TTM , LSS and DfLSS work together . . . "
" All problems are business problems - engineers need to think like business people . "
The best part , though , was the summary at the end , when she claimed that all of the appalling processes she had talked about for an hour and a half ( using 52 PowerPoint slides ) showed " respect for the intelligence of the individual . "
Is this for real ?
How could anyone possibly endure this at Megacorp ?
Mr Litvinenko died in a London hospital in November last year
The Russian Prosecutor General 's Office said the constitution did not allow for the extradition of its citizens .
However , it said it would consider the possibility that Mr Lugovoi could be put on trial in Russia .
UK - Russian relations have been strained since Mr Litvinenko died of exposure to the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 .
UK officials have said they expect full co-operation from the Russian authorities in bringing the perpetrators to justice in Britain .
Inquiry ' possible '
It has taken Russia five weeks to give an official response , although Prosecutor General Yuri Chayka has repeatedly said that no Russian national would stand trial in Britain .
However , a statement from his office said Mr Lugovoi could be investigated " if the British side makes the corresponding inquiry and offers the necessary material for a criminal case " .
Mr Lugovoi , himself a former Russian agent , denies the charges against him , and last month accused British secret services of being involved in the murder .
He says that either MI6 , fugitive Kremlin opponent Boris Berezovsky or the Russian mafia were behind the killing .
The Russian Federal Security Service said last month that a criminal case had been opened based on remarks and information provided by Mr Lugovoi .
Mahmod Mahmod , 52 , and his brother Ari Mahmod , 51 , planned the killing during a family meeting , prosecutors told the court .
Two others have pleaded guilty in the case .
Two more have fled the country .
Sentencing is expected this month .
The men accused the young woman of shaming her family by ending an abusive arranged marriage , becoming too westernised and falling in love with a man who did not come from their Iraqi village .
The Kurdish family came to Britain in 1998 when Banaz Mahmod was just 11 .
" She was my present , my future , my hope , " said Rahmat Suleimani , 29 , Banaz Mahmod 's boyfriend .
More than 25 women in Britain have been killed by their Muslim relatives in the past decade for offences they believe have brought shame on their family .
More than 100 other homicides are under investigation for potential honour killings .
Some Muslim communities in Britain practice Sharia law , or strict Islamic law .
" We 're seeing an increase around the world , due in part to the rise in Islamic fundamentalism , " said Diana Nammi with the London - based Iranian and Kurdish Women 's Rights Organisation .
During the three - month trial over Banaz Mahmod 's murder , prosecutors said the girl 's father began beating her at an early age for using hairspray and becoming too westernised .
Her uncle once told her that she would already have been " turned to ashes " if she were his daughter and had shamed the family by becoming involved with the Iranian Kurd , her sister 22 - year - old Bekhal Mahmod testified .
Banaz Mahmod ran away from home when she was a teenager , but was later sent an audio tape in which her father warned he would kill her sisters , her mother and himself if she did not come home , her sister said .
She returned home and was later hospitalised after her brother attacked her , her sister testified .
The brother said he had been paid by their father to finish her off , but in the end was unable to do it , the sister said , testifying in a full black burqa .
She said she still feared for her life .
The years of Banaz Mahmod 's abuse were compounded by officers who repeatedly dismissed her cries for help .
She first went to police in December 2005 when she suspected her uncle was trying to kill her and her boyfriend .
She sent the police a letter naming the men who she thought would later kill her .
On New Year 's Eve , she was lured by her father to her grandmother 's home and believed she would be attacked after he forced her to gulp down brandy and approached her while wearing gloves .
She escaped by breaking a window , and was treated at a hospital .
Police dismissed her claims .
One officer , who is under investigation , considered charging her with damages for breaking her grandmother 's window .
Laying in her hospital bed after the escape , Banaz Mahmod recorded a dramatic video message saying she was " really scared " .
The videotape , taken by her boyfriend at the hospital , was shown to the jury during the trial .
The boyfriend feared it could be the only chance she would have to detail her fears .
After she was released from the hospital , she returned home and tried to convince her family she stopped seeing her boyfriend , according to court documents .
But friends told the family they spotted the couple together on January 22 , 2006 .
Soon after , a group of men allegedly approached her boyfriend and tried to lure him into a car but he refused .
It was that event that prompted Banaz Mahmod to go to police again .
This time officers tried to persuade her to stay in a safe house .
She refused , believing her mother would protect her , according to court documents .
But her mother and father left her alone in the house the next day .
Her boyfriend - who noted the absence of text messages - quickly alerted police .
Her body was not discovered until three months later , after police tracked phone records .
One of the men who fled the country is allegedly the man who arranged for her burial in the northern city of Birmingham .

“ This page best viewed in … ”
If that phrase does n’t provoke a shudder of horror and loathing , it should .
It ’s the battle cry of the Browser Wars , those terrible and ultimately futile years at the end of the last milennium .
It ’s the rallying cry of those who would take the open ubiquity of the web and fragment it into a collection of gated communities , where entrance to each is predicated on running a specific browser .
“ Your browser is not compatible and must be upgraded … ”
All too often , because developers are too fearful or prideful or just plain lazy , they put up unnecessary barriers to entrance .
They prevent people from using their sites based on choice of browser .
Of course there are situations where the experience will be different — nobody expects Netscape 4 users to be able to see all 2007 ’s pretty CSS effects , just like table - based sites look beyond bizarre in Mosaic .
That ’s no excuse for sites that intentionally lock users out just because their choice of browser does n’t line up with the developer ’s expectations .
It ’s regressive , short - sighted , and just plain unprofessional .
“ This site is for iPhone users only . ”
STOP IT .
Stop it right now .
The fact that optimizing pages for an iPhone makes the development of such specialized pages attractive in no way excuses lockout of other users .
I might be willing to entertain the argument if the iPhone ’s browser were some specialized non-web contraption .
It ’s not .
It ’s a full - fledged XHTML +CSS+DOM browser that happens to lag a bit in some implementation areas and wo n’t run some plugins .
Besides , if you ’ve developed a version of your site ( or application or whatever ) that works well on the iPhone , then why in the name of Tim Berners - Lee would you deny other people that optimized experience ?
You might find that they prefer to interact with the site that way no matter what platform they ’re using .
You might find that you do n’t need a separate iPhone version after all .
The iPhoned version might be the only version you need .
Designers will argue that pages optimized for the iPhone screen will look bad on a desktop browser .
Maybe , and maybe not , but stop preventing your users from making that decision for themselves .
Nobody says you have to convert your whole site to be iPhoney .
But your lockout of non-iPhone users is worse than rude .
It ’s stupid .
We finally learned , after much sweat and a fair number of tears , that “ best viewed in ” is a fool ’s errand .
Are we so eager to rush back into that morass and fight the war all over again ?
Please .
Just stop .
Having a moral obligation to the Iraqi people does not mean keeping our troops stuck indefinitely in the middle of a religious civil war .
But it does mean taking responsibility to alleviate as much of the suffering as possible .
This is something that many of those advocating a responsible end to the war often overlook ( Not because they are against helping the Iraqi people , but because they are more focused on ending the war )
So here is a question for candidates who support ending the war .
Given that American military action can do little to put Iraq back together .
Given that maintaining a large troop presence harms U.S. security interests .
Given that we did create this mess in the first place and that a lot of people are suffering as a result .
What is America ’s moral obligation to the Iraqi people and what steps would you take to minimize the humanitarian crisis ?
Here are some ideas that I would like to see in these plans :
1. Completely rework our disgraceful refugee policy .
More than two million Iraqis have fled the country .
Two million more are internally displaced and the numbers continue to rise .
Yet through June of this year the U.S. has taken in just 133 people .
That is just embarrassing and sad .
2. Implement some kind of plan to help Syria and Jordan absorb the roughly 1.5 - 2 million refugees that those two countries are dealing with .
( Jordan ’s population is only 6 million .
This is seriously destabilizing for them ) .
3. Commit more funding to the UN High Commissioner for refugees to continue and significantly expand its work in the Middle East .
They know these issues much better than the U.S .
4. Massive ramp up in humanitarian funding .
Incredibly humanitarian funding in Iraq fell from $ 453 million in 2005 to $ 95 million in 2006 ( Three days worth of U.S. military spending in Iraq ) .
According to Oxfam one third of Iraqis need emergency medical attention and much of Baghdad is without water or electricity .
We might not be able to salvage the situation in Iraq but we should do everything we can to help the Iraqi people cope with the miserable conditions they are facing .
MONTREAL – A woman who was turned away from a gay bar has filed a human rights complaint .
Audrey Vachon was recently refused service at Le Stud in Montreal 's gay village after sitting down with her father for a quiet afternoon pint .
A waiter came over and told her father , Gilles , that the bar does n't serve women .
Vachon , 20 , says the waiter avoided looking at her during the conversation .
" On the spot I did n't believe it , I thought it was a bad joke , " Vachon said today in an interview .
" I did n't say a word until I 'd left .
I was too shocked .
I was embarrassed , I was humiliated , I felt guilty that I 'd even gone there , like I 'd done something wrong . "
Vachon said she would be the first to complain if homosexuals were refused service at a business .
Bar owner Michel Gadoury says Le Stud has banned women most nights since it was established 11 years ago .
He says he does n't understand the fuss .
" We 're not discriminating , women have the right to come on certain days , " Gadoury told Radio - Canada .
" It 's a choice , it 's a choice that my clients make , that they ask me to make , and we 're respecting them . "
The bar , an understated spot in a flamboyant part of the city , has the trappings of a local pub with pool tables and video poker terminals .
On many nights it shows gay pornography on TV screens instead of the usual hockey game fare .
" Le Stud is the best place in town for a truly manly meat market , " said a review on one travel website .

If you live to 100 , as roughly one in every 10,000 people do , you will likely want both your mind and body intact .
Researchers have now discovered a gene that accomplishes just that , apparently protecting the brain as well as prolonging life .
The Longevity Genes Project , initiated by Nir Barzilai , director of the Institute for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine , investigates people who live exceptionally long lives .
" There 's a strong family history of longevity in these people , " says Barzilai .
" Research has shown the odds of having exceptional longevity are about 10 to 18 times more if you have a centenarian in your family .
And these usually are n't vegetarians or professional athletes .
Some have smoked for 90 years . "
Barzilai and his colleagues examined 158 people of Ashkenazi , or Eastern European Jewish , descent who were 95 years of age or older .
They chose Ashkenazi Jews since current generations stem from a relatively limited number of ancestors .
This means they have a comparatively uniform genetic makeup , making it easier to identify important genetic differences .
The scientists gave these volunteers a common test of mental function , consisting of 30 questions .
Correctly answering 25 of the questions meant a subject passed the test .
Those centenarians who passed were two to three times more likely to have a common variant of a particular gene , called the CETP gene , than those who did not .
When the researchers studied another 124 Ashkenazi Jews between 75 and 85 years of age , those subjects who passed the test of mental function were five times more likely to have this gene variant than their counterparts .
The CETP gene variant makes cholesterol particles in the blood larger than normal .
The researchers suggest smaller particles can more readily lodge in the lining of blood vessels , leading to fatty buildups , which are a risk factor for heart attacks and strokes .
Whether or not this gene variant protects the brain by preventing this buildup , or through some other mechanism , remains uncertain , says Barzilai .
Future research should also investigate whether this gene has an effect on dementia associated with Alzheimer 's disease , says pathologist and human geneticist George Martin at the University of Washington .
Pharmaceutical companies are currently developing drugs that mimic the effect of this gene variant , says Barzilai .
Unfortunately , one known as torcetrapib , manufactured by Pfizer , was pulled in December due to increased death and heart problems among study subjects , " but others in development are n't seeing that , so it might just have been a problem with that drug , " says Barzilai .
" If not , it 's a question people might face -- whether or not people want to prevent Alzheimer 's even if there 's a small risk of getting a heart attack . "
Barzilai and his colleagues reported their findings in the December 26 Neurology .
The net has flattened out the taking part in discipline among large companies and tiny firms .
On the web , your organization does not need to have a fancy creating or hundreds of personnel to become successful .
The secret is being aware of how to market your company on the internet like the massive , effective businesses .
Right here is some advice on how to make your organization productive on the web premium domain names
There are a good deal of totally free e-books and video clips accessible on the internet to discover about a wonderful domain identify .
Get your time and understand about these strategies .
If you have the sources , contemplate hiring a person to do an a excellent domain title campaign for you .
You can investigation the credibility of the man or woman you want to retain the services of by asking them to give you with a portfolio of previous Aftermarket for Domains a great domain name encounter .
For much better outcomes , promote products that are unique .
If you are promoting the exact same factor as a thousand other web sites , you ’ll find less results coming from these objects .
Your client could be interested in your item , but they ’ve probably currently gone to it from a distinct website .
Locate items that are special and less heavily promoted by other web sites Register a domain Set oneself apart and see bigger results .
Be standard and distinct .
Keep in mind your visitor base includes a wide array of folks , with diverse quantities of knowledge of your products .
Use laymen ’s terms to describe factors , but also contain the personal specs for individuals more superior .
Catering to all of your readers will very likely enhance income from all sides of the spectrum .
If you are trying to develop your business ’s web presence by making use of a weblog , hold your updates brief and effective .
Your regular updates must be about three hundred to 5 hundred words in length ; if you have a specific characteristic you can extend this out to a thousand phrases .
Any longer and you ’ll likely lose the reader ’s curiosity before the end .
Keeping track of the competition is intelligent business in any field .
When it comes to a fantastic domain name , keeping tabs on competitors means examining sites that use the same keywords and phrases one particular ’s personal site does to draw in possible site visitors .

You do not want a huge personnel of personnel .
You just need to have to know how to perform like the large gamers .
Hold learning , do not be afraid to try new ideas , and ahead of long , your world wide web enterprise will flourish .
This is a weekly update on new Java 7 information .
All current and previous information is maintained on my Java 7 page .
In general Java 7 news , Frederic Simon recently gave an overview of Java 7 at Java Tech Day in Israel .
Modularity
Java 7 modularity , specifically JSR 277/294 vs JSR 291 OSGi , seems to be a hot topic these days .
There is probably no better place to look than Glyn Normington ’s summary of where we are and where things are going .
Glyn has a foot in both camps and is an excellent writer – I am glad he ’s involved and helping to translate for the rest of us .
The Java Posse Episode # 133 also has some discussion of JSR 277/294 and OSGi .
InfoQ interviewed Eric Newcomer about the future of OSGi and the discussion turned to JSR 277 near the end .
These days I ’m not sure what to think about it all .
I used to be pretty excited about JSR 277/294 because I thought having it built into the JVM would make using it in some scenarios easier to approach than OSGi .
But I ’ve come to really appreciate the depth of the OSGi approach and the undeniable fact that it works now and people are adopting it at a good pace .
As I read the various mailing lists , it ’s starting to sink in that there is even more complexity than I originally thought involved in putting 277/294 support into Java .
The impacts on classloaders , packaging , etc are going to be a big change .
I ’m not sure at this point how it ’s going to fall out .
I ’m still hopeful that at the end of the day we will have a usable modularity system built into Java that complements OSGi .

This week on Tuesday , June 26th , the mystery of the dragonfly - shaped aerial “ drones ” took another turn with the release of an alleged secret report containing photographs of alleged extraterrestrial technologies , entitled “ Commercial Applications Research for Extraterrestrial Technology ( CARET ) , the Q4 - 86 Research Report , ” dated December 1986 , Palo Alto , California , by the Palo Alto CARET Laboratory , also known as PACL ( pronounced “ packel ” ) .
The CARET Laboratory ’s research goal is stated as , “ achieving a greater understanding of extraterrestrial technology within the context of commercial applications and civilian use . "

To understand the motives and goals of Islamic jihad terrorists , one good place to start might be to explore what they themselves say about why they ’re doing what they ’re doing , and what they want .
That in turn will lead you to the Qur’an ( or Koran ) , the Islamic holy book .
The jihadists quote it frequently and portray themselves as those who are following “ pure Islam , ” the genuine article as it is taught in the Qur’an and Islamic tradition .
So in the course of my work explaining the jihadists ’ objectives , I ’ve quoted the Qur ’an a great deal – and hardly a day goes by without my being accused of “ cherry - picking ” violent passages , and quoting them “ out of context . ”
Meanwhile , the Council on American Islamic Relations and other Muslim groups say that in order to understand the true , peaceful Islam , we should read the Qur’an .
So over the course of the next few months , I ’m going to read it , and discuss it in a series of columns .
All of it .
Not “ cherry - picked ” or “ out of context . ”
The whole thing , beginning to end .
Some of you may be familiar with David Plotz ’s series on Slate , “ Blogging the Bible . ”
This series will be similar to that one , but rather than just write about what I think or feel about a certain passage , I will , unlike Plotz , refer to commentaries – all Muslim ones – on the Qur’an .
I ’ll try to explain how mainstream Muslims who study the Qur’an will understand any given passage , and what its import might be for non-Muslims .
You ’ll need a Qur’an .
Here is a good Arabic / English text .
In traditional Islamic theology , the Qur’an is essentially and inherently an “ Arabic Qur’an ” ( as the Qur’an describes itself repeatedly : see 12:2 ; 20:113 ; 39:28 ; 41:3 ; 41:44 ; 42:7 ; and 43:3 ) .
Its meaning can be rendered in other languages , but those translations are not the Qur’an , which when no longer in Arabic is no longer itself .
Some Muslim scholars even claim that the Qur’an cannot be fully understood except in Arabic , but the blizzard of translations made by Muslims for Muslims who do n’t speak Arabic ( who are the great majority around the world today ) as well as to proselytize among non-Muslims belies that claim .
Here are two popular Muslim translations , those of Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall , along with a third by M. H. Shakir .
Here is another popular translation , that of Muhammad Asad .
And here is an omnibus of ten Qur’an translations .
The Qur’an is , according to classic Islamic thought , a perfect copy of a book that has existed eternally with Allah , the one true God , in Heaven : “ it is a transcript of the eternal book [ in Arabic , “ mother of the book ” ] in Our keeping , sublime , and full of wisdom ” ( 43:4 ) .
The angel Gabriel revealed it in sections to Muhammad ( 570-632 ) , an Arabian merchant .
Like Jesus , Muhammad left the written recording of his messages to others .
Unlike Jesus , Muhammad did not originate his message , but only served as its conduit .
The Qur’an is for Muslims the pure Word of Allah .
They point to its poetic character as proof that it did not originate with Muhammad , whom they say was illiterate , but with the Almighty , who dictated every word .
The average Muslim believes that everything in the book is absolutely true and that its message is applicable in all times and places .
This is a stronger claim than Christians make for the Bible .
When Christians of whatever tradition say that the Bible is God ’s Word , they do n’t mean that God spoke it word - for - word and that it ’s free of all human agency — instead , there is the idea of “ inspiration , ” that God breathed through human authors , working through their human knowledge to communicate what he wished to .
But for Muslims , the Qur’an is more than inspired .
There is not and could not be a passage in the Qur’an like I Corinthians 1:14 - 17 in the New Testament , where Paul says : “ I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius ; lest any one should say that you were baptized in my name .
( I did baptize also the household of Stephanas .
Beyond that , I do not know whether I baptized any one else . ) ”
Paul ’s faulty memory demonstrates the human element of the New Testament , which for Christians does not negate , but exists alongside the texts ’ inspired character .
But in the Qur’an , Allah is the only speaker throughout ( with a few notable exceptions ) .
There is no human element .
The book is the pure and unadulterated divine word .
Allah himself tells him this , in the Qur’an itself : “ This is a mighty scripture .
Falsehood cannot reach it from before or from behind ” ( 41:41 - 2 ) .
It is “ free from any flaw ” ( 39:28 ) .
In short , “ it is the indubitable truth ” ( 69:51 ) .
Allah , speaking in a royal plural that does not , according to Muslim theologians , compromise his absolute unity , proclaims that “ it was We that revealed the Koran , and shall Ourself preserve it ” ( 15:9 ) .
But reading the Qur’an is not always easy .
Since so much of it consists of Allah speaking with Muhammad , it is often rather like listening in on a conversation between two people you do n’t know , talking about events with which you were uninvolved .
Even though a surprisingly large amount of what the Qur’an says is said more than once , still often the reader can’t figure out what ’s being said , or why , without reference to Muslim tradition .
Also , it has no overarching narrative unity , although there are smaller narrative units within many chapters .
With the exception of the brief first chapter ( sura ) , its 114 chapters are arranged from the longest to the shortest .
In the longer chapters , stories are told , laws are given , and warnings to unbelievers are issued , but in them and throughout the book , there is no chronological or narrative continuity .
The shorter suras , meanwhile , particularly those near the end of the book that run only a few lines , are poetic and arresting warnings of the impending divine judgment .
When I first read the Qur’an and began studying Islam in late 1980 and early 1981 , those poetic suras captured my imagination to the extent that I continued reading deeply into other Islamic texts .
I ’ll refer to Islamic traditions when necessary , as well as to traditional commentaries , to shed light on various passages .
And by the end of this journey , I believe we will see more clearly what makes the jihadists tick – and also perhaps understand what we can and must do to resist them .
This will be a weekly feature — to be posted every Sunday at Hot Air — with within - post updates as warranted .
I intend this to be a participatory exploration of the Qur’an — a two - way conversation .
Thus I welcome feedback and criticism in the comments section , in e-mail correspondence , and on other blogs , and will answer questions and respond to the most thoughtful comments , criticism , and challenges .
Next week : chapter one , the Fatiha , the most important prayer in Islam .

Facebook Science retracted a paper Friday that included doctored photos from a former university researcher .
COLUMBIA , Missouri ( AP ) 
The prestigious journalretracted a paper Friday that included doctored photos from a former university researcher .
The journal retracted the paper a day after the University of Missouri - Columbia announced it had completed an investigation that determined postdoctoral researcher Kaushik Deb had altered pictures of mouse embryos .
' SCIENCE ' ARTICLE : Cdx2 Gene Expression and Trophectoderm Lineage Specification in Mouse Embryos Questions arose after the photos appeared in a February 2006 issue of the journal .
Complaints to both Science and the university had prompted the magazine to issue an " editorial expression of concern " in October warning readers that the results of the earlier study might not be reliable .
The research indicated that cell division of a mouse embryo differentiated sooner than previously shown , with one cell eventually forming a placenta while the other formed a fetus .
It had major implications in determining which early stage cells could be used to create embryonic stem cell lines , said R. Michael Roberts , who led the research group .
" Retraction is a relief in a way , " Roberts said .
" I 've wanted to retract for over a year . "
The investigation cleared Roberts and two other researchers , Mayandi Sivaguru and H.Y.
Yong , of any wrongdoing in the case .
The three researchers signed the retraction , noting their paper was " founded at least in part on falsified or fabricated images . "
The retraction said Deb had resigned from the school shortly after allegations of research misconduct were received and could not be found to sign the retraction .
" We deeply regret any scientific misconceptions that have resulted from the publication of this article , " the retraction read .
Roberts said the retraction does not mean that everything in the paper was wrong .
" But , " he said , " the paper was written on the basis of those images .
Everything has to be repeated . "
In a written statement , the journal said a handful of the 950 papers it publishes each year do lead to some type of clarification or retraction .
" Unfortunately , scientific misconduct does occur , though other retractions are due to honest error , " according to the statement .
Because the research involved grants from the National Institutes of Health , the university 's findings will be shared with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of Research Integrity .
The agency could bar Deb from getting federal research money for several years , Hall said .
" I would say that all things being equal , Dr. Deb has forfeited his career in science , " Hall said .

Abstract
Context
Peer review should evaluate the merit and quality of abstracts but may be biased by geographic location or institutional prestige .
The effectiveness of blinded peer review at reducing bias is unknown .
Objective
To evaluate the effect of blinded review on the association between abstract characteristics and likelihood of abstract acceptance at a national research meeting .
Design and Setting All abstracts submitted to the American Heart Association 's annual Scientific Sessions research meeting from 2000 - 2004 .
Abstract review included the author 's name and institution ( open review ) from 2000 - 2001 , and this information was concealed ( blinded review ) from 2002 - 2004 .
Abstracts were categorized by country , primary language , institution prestige , author sex , and government and industry status .
Main Outcome Measure Likelihood of abstract acceptance during open and blinded review , by abstract characteristics .
Results
The mean number of abstracts submitted each year for evaluation was 13 455 and 28.5 % were accepted .
During open review , 40.8 % of US and 22.6 % of non-US abstracts were accepted ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.81 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.75 - 1.88 ) , whereas during blinded review , 33.4 % of US and 23.7 % of non-US abstracts were accepted ( RR , 1.41 ; 95 % CI , 1.37 - 1.45 ; P<.001 for comparison between peer review periods ) .
Among non-US abstracts , during open review , 31.1 % from English - speaking countries and 20.9 % from non −English - speaking countries were accepted ( RR , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.39 - 1.59 ) , whereas during blinded review , 28.8 % and 22.8 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively ( RR , 1.26 ; 95 % CI , 1.19 - 1.34 ; P<.001 ) .
Among abstracts from US academic institutions , during open review , 51.3 % from highly prestigious and 32.6 % from nonprestigious institutions were accepted ( RR , 1.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 - 1.67 ) , whereas during blinded review , 38.8 % and 29.0 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively ( RR , 1.34 ; 95 % CI , 1.26 -1.41 ; P<.001 ) .
Conclusions
This study provides evidence of bias in the open review of abstracts , favoring authors from the United States , English - speaking countries outside the United States , and prestigious academic institutions .
Moreover , blinded review at least partially reduced reviewer bias .
Peer review of research should be based solely on scientific merit and research quality .
Bias occurs if a review is influenced by other criteria , such as geographic location or institutional prestige .
Several studies have examined the likelihood of acceptance of openly reviewed manuscripts or brief reports to journals by various author characteristics .
They found differences in acceptance between authors from prestigious and nonprestigious institutions1 and between those submitted within and from outside the United States , 2 - 4 but no differences were found between male and female authors .
3,5 However , these studies could not distinguish whether differences were because of quality or bias .
Blinded peer review , in which the author 's identity and institutional affiliation are concealed from the reviewer , is commonly used to reduce reviewer bias .
6,7 However , blinded review is variably used by journals and scientific meetings .
8- 10
The reluctance to adopt blinded review may , in part , be because little is known about the effectiveness of blinded review at reducing bias .
Our objective was to evaluate the effect of blinded review on the likelihood of abstract acceptance to the American Heart Association 's Scientific Sessions , an annual meeting attended by more than 30 000 health care professionals that includes the presentation of nearly 4000 research abstracts .
We hypothesized that certain characteristics would be associated with a greater likelihood of abstract acceptance during open review than during blinded review , providing evidence of both reviewer bias during open review and the effectiveness of blinded review at reducing bias .
Methods
Design and Setting
In 2000 and 2001 , abstracts submitted to the American Heart Association 's Scientific Sessions were reviewed openly : the author 's name and institution were included with the abstract for evaluation .
However , in 2002 , after membership stimulated an internal debate about the influence of reviewer bias , the review policy was changed .
From 2002 through 2004 , abstracts were reviewed blindly , concealing the author 's name and institution .
This policy change presented a unique opportunity to study the effect of blinded review .
Using American Heart Association databases created each year to track abstract submissions from 2000 through 2004 , all submitted electronically , we conducted a retrospective analysis of all submitted abstracts using a pre-post design .
Yale University Human Investigation Committee approval was obtained prior to the study .
Review Process
Each abstract submitted to the Scientific Sessions was independently evaluated by 8 to 10 reviewers .
During the study period , reviewers scored abstracts from 1 to 10 ( 1 = poor , 10 = excellent ) .
Reviewers were instructed to evaluate an abstract 's scientific merit and research quality based on the following : organization , practicality , presentation , and technical quality .
Furthermore , the reviewers were guided to score 25 % of abstracts 8 or greater ( “ must / should accept ” ) and another 10 % to 15 % equal to 7 ( “ accept only if space ” ) .
There was no predetermined acceptance rate because it varies slightly from year to year , reflecting convention center size and scheduling logistics .
Each reviewer evaluated 100 or more abstracts within a research category .
The research categories were consistent from year to year , numbering approximately 100 , and were distributed among 21 cardiology subspecialties within the basic , clinical , and population sciences .
Finally , throughout the study period , reviewers were instructed to recuse themselves from evaluating abstracts recognized from their own institution or if there were other conflicts of interest .
Abstract Categorizations
All abstracts were categorized by several characteristics , using the first name and institution of the corresponding author .
Abstracts were categorized by country as being from the United States or elsewhere .
Non-US abstracts were categorized by the country 's official language as English or non-English .11 Countries whose official language is English and from which abstracts were received included the following : Antigua and Barbuda , Australia , Canada , Grenada , India , Ireland , New Zealand , South Africa , Trinidad and Tobago , and the United Kingdom ( England , Scotland , and Wales ) .
All US abstracts from academic institutions were categorized by institution prestige .
For this categorization , we created a composite score based on the mean monetary value of research and training grants and contracts funded by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) for fiscal years 2000 through 200412 and the mean “ heart and heart surgery ” hospital rankings by US News & World Report from 2000 through 2004.13
These scores reflect investigative success and clinical reputation .
An institution was given 2 points for receiving mean NIH awards exceeding $ 300 million or 1 point for exceeding $ 100 million .
An institution was given 2 points for having an affiliated hospital with a mean ranking by US News & World Report in the top 10 for heart and heart surgery facilities or 1 point for being in the top 30 .
Each institution received a total score from 0 to 4 .
Based on the abstract acceptance distribution during open peer review , institutions were subsequently categorized as highly prestigious for scoring 3 or 4 points ( n = 12 ) or moderately prestigious for scoring 1 or 2 points ( n = 41 ) , and the remainder were categorized as nonprestigious .
All US abstracts were categorized by author sex as male , female , or uncertain .
These categorizations were used to attempt to capture clear assignations by sex by the predominance of reviewers .
For example , the sex of “ David ” and “ Susan ” were thought to be easily assigned as male and female , respectively .
In contrast , the sex of “ Sydney , ” “ Biykem , ” and “ Tomoyuki ” were thought not to be easily assigned and were categorized as uncertain .
An assessment of the 200 most frequent author first names categorized independently by 2 investigators were found to be 95.5 % in agreement ; disagreements were resolved by consensus .
Non-US abstracts were not categorized by sex because of the high proportion of uncertain categorizations .
The institution type for all US abstracts was categorized as academic , government agency , or industry .
Abstracts were received from several US government agencies , but they were primarily from the NIH or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Abstracts were received from a wide array of private corporations , predominantly from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries .
We were unable to perform an analysis of study sponsorship because the submission process did not require information detailing receipt of public or private funding .
Statistical Analysis
The main outcome measure was abstract acceptance for presentation .
We categorized the peer review period as open ( 2000 - 2001 ) or blinded ( 2002 - 2004 ) .
We used descriptive statistics to summarize the total number of abstracts submitted and overall proportion accepted , as well as the distribution by abstract characteristics .
We then assessed the relative risk ( RR ) of acceptance within categories ( ie , US vs non -US abstracts ) during open and blinded review .
Finally , we used the Breslow - Day test for homogeneity to examine if the RR of acceptance was different between open and blinded review .
We performed exploratory subgroup analyses by submission category ( basic , clinical , or population sciences ) for all abstract characteristics except government or industry status because of small sample sizes .
Data analysis was performed using SAS version 9.1 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) .
All statistical tests were 2 - tailed .
The a priori level of significance was set at P <.05 .
Results
The mean number of abstracts submitted each year for evaluation was 13 455 ( range , 13 023-13 878 ) , totaling 67 275 .
The total number and proportion of submitted abstracts categorized by abstract characteristics were consistent over the study period ( Table 1 ) .
There were 19 198 total abstracts accepted for presentation ( mean , 28.5 % ; range , 26.7 % - 30.3 % ) , although the proportion declined slightly from 29.7 % during open review to 27.8 % during blinded review .
The mean proportion of reviewers from the United States was 85.0 % ( range , 84.4 % - 85.7 % ) ; from English - speaking countries outside the United States it was 38.9 % ( range , 37.8 %- 40.9 % ; Table 2 ) .
Effect by Country
During open review , 40.8 % of US and 22.6 % of non-US abstracts were accepted .
After implementation of blinded review , 33.4 % and 23.7 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively .
Blinding significantly attenuated the association between country and likelihood of abstract acceptance , as the RR of acceptance for US compared with non-US abstracts decreased significantly from open to blinded review ( RR , 1.81 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.75 -1.88 vs RR , 1.41 ; 95 % CI , 1.37 - 1.45 ; P< .001 ; Table 3 ) .
In subgroup analyses by submission category , blinding significantly attenuated the association between country and likelihood of acceptance for basic science ( RR , 1.83 [ 95 % CI , 1.73 -1.94 ] vs RR , 1.38 [ 95 % CI , 1.31 - 1.45 ] ; P < .001 ) and clinical science ( RR , 1.80 [ 95 % CI , 1.71 - 1.89 ] vs RR , 1.41 [ 95 % CI , 1.35 - 1.47 ] ; P < .001 ) abstracts , and it tended toward significant attenuation for population science abstracts ( RR , 1.86 [ 95 % CI , 1.59 - 2.17 ] vs RR , 1.54 [ 95 % CI , 1.37 - 1.73 ] ; P = .05 ) .
Effect by Language
Among non-US abstracts , during open review , 31.1 % from English - speaking countries and 20.9 % from non −English - speaking countries were accepted .
After implementation of blinded review , 28.8 % and 22.8 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively .
Blinding significantly attenuated the association between language and likelihood of abstract acceptance , as the RR of acceptance decreased significantly from open to blinded review ( Table 3 ) .
In subgroup analyses by submission category , blinding significantly attenuated the association between language and likelihood of acceptance for basic science ( RR , 1.42 [ 95 % CI , 1.28 - 1.57 ] vs RR , 1.19 [ 95 % CI , 1.09 - 1.30 ] ; P = .02 ) and clinical science ( RR , 1.58 [ 95 % CI , 1.45 - 1.73 ] vs RR , 1.30 [ 95 % CI , 1.20 - 1.41 ] ; P = .001 ) abstracts , but not for population science ( RR , 1.39 [ 95 % CI , 1.07 - 1.80 ] vs RR , 1.41 [ 95 % CI , 1.15 - 1.73 ] ; P = .86 ) abstracts .
Effect by Institutional Prestige
Among abstracts from US academic institutions , during open review , 51.3 % from highly prestigious , 42.7 % from moderately prestigious , and 32.6 % from nonprestigious institutions were accepted .
After implementation of blinded review , 38.8 % , 34.3 % , and 29.0 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively .
Blinding significantly attenuated the association between institution prestige and likelihood of abstract acceptance , as the RR of acceptance decreased significantly from open to blinded review when comparing highly with nonprestigious institutions ( P<.001 ) , moderately with nonprestigious institutions ( P = .002 ) , and highly with moderately prestigious institutions ( P = .02 ; Table 3 ) .
In subgroup analyses by submission category , for the comparison of highly with nonprestigious institutions , blinding significantly attenuated the association between prestige and likelihood of acceptance for basic science ( RR , 1.58 [ 95 % CI , 1.45 - 1.73 ] vs RR , 1.30 [ 95 % CI , 1.19 - 1.41 ] ; P < .001 ) and clinical science ( RR , 1.58 [ 95 % CI , 1.45 - 1.72 ] vs RR , 1.34 [ 95 % CI , 1.23 -1.45 ] ; P < .001 ) abstracts , but not for population science ( RR , 1.44 [ 95 % CI , 1.11 - 1.86 ] vs RR , 1.52 [ 95 % CI , 1.28 - 1.81 ] ; P = .76 ) abstracts .
Whereas for the comparison of moderately with nonprestigious institutions , the association was significantly attenuated by blinding only for clinical science abstracts ( RR , 1.35 [ 95 % CI , 1.24 - 1.47 ] vs RR , 1.18 [ 95 % CI , 1.09 - 1.28 ] ; P = .008 ) , and not for basic ( RR , 1.25 [ 95 % CI , 1.14 - 1.37 ] vs RR , 1.16 [ 95 % CI , 1.07 - 1.26 ] ; P = .15 ) or population science ( RR , 1.47 [ 95 % CI , 1.20 - 1.81 ] vs RR , 1.30 [ 95 % CI , 1.10 - 1.54 ] ; P = .29 ) abstracts .
Effect by Author Sex
Among US abstracts , during open review , 41.7 % from male authors and 41.6 % from female authors were accepted .
After implementation of blinded review , 33.1 % and 33.4 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively .
No association was determined between sex and likelihood of abstract acceptance during either open or blinded review ( Table 3 ) .
Effect by Institution Type
Among US abstracts , during open review , 65.2 % from government agencies and 41.0 % not from government agencies were accepted .
After implementation of blinded review , 45.5 % and 33.5 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively .
Blinding significantly attenuated the association between government status and likelihood of abstract acceptance , as the RR of acceptance decreased significantly from open to blinded review ( RR , 1.59 ; 95 % CI , 1.42-1.79 vs RR , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 1.18 - 1.57 ; P = .02 ; Table 3 ) .
Among US abstracts , during open review , 41.0 % not from private industry and 29.3 % from industry were accepted .
After implementation of blinded review , 33.5 % and 29.1 % of abstracts were accepted , respectively .
Blinding significantly attenuated the association between industry status and likelihood of abstract acceptance , as the RR of acceptance decreased significantly from open to blinded review ( RR , 1.40 [ 95 % CI , 1.22 -1.61 ] vs RR , 1.15 [ 95 % CI , 1.02 - 1.29 ] ; P = .02 ; Table 3 ) .
Comment
Among abstracts submitted to the American Heart Association 's Scientific Sessions , blinded peer review significantly attenuated associations between abstract acceptance and nearly all abstract characteristics .
Although we were unable to assess abstract quality , variations in quality over time are unlikely to account for our results because we determined that the proportion of abstracts accepted and the proportions of abstracts submitted by country , language , institutional prestige , author sex , and government and industry status were all consistent over our short study period .
In addition , the American Heart Association 's policy of reviewer recruitment was not formally altered from 2000 - 2004 , and the proportions of reviewers by country and language were consistent over this period .
Hence , it is unlikely that our findings were the result of a change among reviewers .
Therefore , these results provide evidence of reviewer bias in the open review of abstracts , favoring authors from the United States , English - speaking countries outside the United States , and prestigious academic institutions , and likely favoring authors from US government agencies and authors not from private industry .
We found no evidence of bias of sex among US authors .
In addition , we found that blinded review at least partially reduced reviewer bias .
Blinded review attenuated but did not eliminate differences in the likelihood of abstract acceptance .
The associations found during blinded review may reflect true differences in the quality of research .
Research quality may vary by authors at prestigious vs nonprestigious institutions or US vs non-US institutions .
Quality may be associated with institutional funding for facilities and staff , better educated or trained faculty and staff , better or more widely available mentoring , an institution culture prioritizing research , or many other reasons .
Thus , there may be genuine quality differences in abstract submissions , and these differences may account for the persistent differences by author characteristics .
Nevertheless , we cannot exclude the possibility of residual reviewer bias .
Successful blinding may require more than removing the author 's name and institution .
Reviewers may have identified an author 's identity or location based on the abstract 's content .
However , blinding abstracts is far more straightforward than blinding manuscripts , which can involve the line - by - line removal of study setting references , sample descriptors , data source , and citations .
In fact , blinded reviewers of manuscripts have been found to correctly identify between 20 % and 60 % of authors , varying widely by journal .
14,15 Moreover , abstract blinding success may be easier to achieve for larger than for smaller scientific meetings , just as it may be easier to achieve for basic or clinical science than for population science submissions .
The strategy used by the American Heart Association , concealing an abstract author 's name and institution from the reviewer , is remarkably simple , practical , and electronically straightforward for blinding abstract review at minimal complication and cost .
Our study focused on abstract review , which may be more susceptible to bias than manuscript review .
First , abstract review relies on brief summaries of scientific work , likely making assessments more variable .
Second , abstract review requires reviewers to evaluate many submissions , possibly leading to time constraints that make a reviewer more likely to use criteria other than scientific merit and research quality in an evaluation .
Finally , abstract reviewers are responsible for a broad category of submissions , rather than a specific submission topic , so reviewers may have less expertise in the subject .
It is unclear if our results can be generalized to manuscript review .
However , even if manuscript review is not as susceptible to reviewer bias and is more difficult to blind effectively , future research should evaluate the effect of blinded peer review on manuscript reviewer bias .
Other limitations need to be considered .
Our study evaluated one scientific meeting .
However , our findings are unlikely to be exceptional , and the scientific community should address potential bias at research meetings .
In addition , we used a nonvalidated measure to assess institution prestige .
Our purpose was to create a simple assessment with face validity .
Our categorization approach suggests appropriateness , as we found increasing abstract acceptance for each successive level of prestige , regardless of whether it was categorized by 5 levels or 3 levels ( as presented ) , during both open and blinded review .
Conclusions
Our study provides evidence of reviewer bias in the open review of abstracts , favoring authors from the United States , from English - speaking countries outside the United States , and from prestigious academic institutions and likely favoring authors from US government agencies and not from private industry .
Also , blinded review at least partially reduces bias .
Our results suggest that adoption of blinded peer review by scientific research meetings is a reasonable , low - cost intervention with substantial benefit .

No bosses in sight at plants taken over by ex-employees in new workers ' revolution
If Willy Wonka and Karl Marx went into business together the result might resemble Ghelco .
From the outside it is a nondescript industrial site in a drab suburb of Buenos Aires , the firm 's logo barely visible .
Inside , the first thing you notice is the smell of chocolate , honey , caramel , ice cream , cakes and jam .
Machines hum while cheerful men in green overalls pack crates of confectionary .
The second thing you notice is the absence of bosses .
There are no people in suits giving orders .
They do not exist .
Nor is there an official owner .
Ghelco is run as a cooperative along democratic lines , with an equal say and equal pay .
" In the beginning no one thought we could do it , they thought we were brutes , ignorant .
But we 're still here , stronger than ever , " said Daniel López , 37 , who operates machinery and is a member of the sales team .
Welcome to the workers ' revolution , Argentina - style .
Ghelco is part of a movement where employees " recuperate " firms that have gone bust .
Marx urged workers to break their metaphorical chains but here they do it literally , breaking the chains and locks of their former workplaces , turning on the lights and restarting machines .
Some 200 enterprises , from hotels to car parts factories , have started in this way , and now employ more than 15,000 people .
For some , the movement is proof of a viable alternative to neo-liberal capitalism .
For critics it is an attempt to rewrite economic principles .
For the workers it is a way to put food on the table .
" This is not about ideology .
It is about what works , " said Luis Caro , a leader of the National Movement for Recovered Factories , an umbrella group representing 10,000 people at 80 factories .
The movement grew out of the economic crisis five years ago when Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt , triggering capital flight and the collapse of many businesses .
Unemployment rose above 20 % and nearly six in 10 sank below the poverty line .
Ghelco 's story is typical .
The company laid off all 91 staff , leaving many owed months of back pay .
" We were abandoned , we had nothing , " said Juan Mellian .
" So we took it back . "
In early 2002 workers broke into the boarded - up premises .
By begging in the street , then selling cardboard , they raised cash to fix machinery and buy cacao , sugar and other supplies .
Water and electricity were reconnected after staff demonstrated outside utility firms with drums and firecrackers .
Many white - collar staff did not return , thinking the effort doomed , so the machine operators were forced to manage the sales , marketing and accounting sides .
Five years later the factory is thriving .
Each person in the 43 - strong workforce earns £ 405 a month , more than double the previous salary , and the staff jointly make decisions at weekly assemblies .
Mr López , the machine operator , has bought his house , sends his stepdaughter to a private school , and his wife no longer needs to work outside the home .
The factory has earned the trust of suppliers and clients by paying its bills and improving quality control , he said .
He attributed the higher salaries to the lack of " fat cat " executives .
In the past three years Argentina 's economy has bounced back , easing unemployment and poverty .
When a company goes bust there are alternative jobs available but workers often choose the potentially riskier route of taking over their old place of work .
According to Mr Caro the Recovered Factories movement has almost doubled its membership in the past two years .
It is a radical , if pragmatic , cog in global capitalism , he said .
Most cooperatives face a grinding battle for economic survival .
Lack of investment capital and little sales or administrative experience are often crippling ; many are in competitive industries , such as textiles .
Legal uncertainty also dogs the movement .
While the government has approved a 20 - year expropriation bill that frees factories from bankruptcy proceedings , no such exemption has so far been issued .
The longest exemption given so far is for two years .
" A lot of factories are still hanging in legal limbo , " said Brendan Martin , director of Working World , a non-profit finance agency that lends to recovered factories .
The movement has been hampered by internal divisions , with some leaders finding politically radical allies such as militant trade unions .
Others , such as Ghelco , have a lower political profile .
Neither the radicals nor moderates hold the political clout they did after the economic crisis .
Arguably , the political dilution signals a step towards greater institutional and economic maturity .
" Over the last few years we have really seen the movement shift from a political focus to a practical , production focus , " said Mr Martin .
Those worker - led factories that are doing well tend to be in niche markets and have low infrastructure costs .
The 44 workers at Cortidoros Unidos Limitada , a wool and leather processing plant outside Buenos Aires , occupied their factory in March , three months after it shut , and are back to 10 % capacity .
A court has given them a year 's grace to prove the cooperative viable .
With the help of other cooperatives they are buying materials and paying their bills .
" I could probably have found a job at another company but I like this concept , " said Salvador Fernández , 45 .
" To be your own boss .
That 's nice . "
As always , I enjoy reading what someone thinks of Smalltalk after a proper demonstration .
I find Edwards thoughts on Smalltalk typical of that aha you get when you really see what Smalltalk 'ers can do .
Edward was lucky , he had a Smalltalker handy to show him the ropes , few have that opportunity .
I 'm still amazed by how many people think they can grok Smalltalk by seeing syntax examples .
Smalltalk is n't its syntax , it 's its environment .
Smalltalk is a living world of running objects , there are no files , no applications , just what 's running .
To understand Smalltalk , you have to either actually use it for a while , or have a seasoned Smalltalker demonstrate it to you .
Reading sample code just wo n't cut it .
For better or for worse , Smalltalk is a world unto itself .
It 's much more an operating system than a programming language .
When Steve Jobs stole the idea for a windowing system and mouse from Xerox ( not that they invented it ) , it was Smalltalk he was seeing .
Even he readily admits he was so dazzled by the GUI he did n't even notice Smalltalk , or the fact it was all networked with email , things we take for granted now but did n't exist widely back then .
Sure , we package code and use source control , but our methods are n't file based .
Our source control systems are language aware , they can diff and merge code at the method level , auto merge and allow you to select , method by method , which version you want to keep .
Smalltalk is different , top to bottom , it 's just different .
Everything is live , code changes are live , applications do n't start , they 're simply always running .
Object oriented programming means something entirely different to a Smalltalker than to someone doing OO in another language .
Ruby comes very close to Smalltalk .
It 's a nice introduction to many if not most of Smalltalk 's ideas .
It 's very pragmatic , fits in with the world around it , it 's based on files , works with your favorite text editor , etc. etc .
But Ruby still is n't Smalltalk .
I use Ruby , I like Ruby , but Smalltalk is more productive when I 'm working in unknown territory .
Smalltalk is better for prototyping ideas quickly .
A read eval print loop and hyper - linked documentation just does n't compare to a real Smalltalk workspace and a real Smalltalk browser where the code itself is hyper - linked and navigable and objects are things you can actually pick up and shake .
Smalltalk does n't have to be pragmatic , because it 's better than its imitators and the things that make it different are also the things that give it an advantage .
Its syntax is n't weird , C's is .
Weird is n't even the right word , because what 's weird is totally relative and very dependent on your background experience .
Smalltalk 's syntax is simply better .
Window window = new Window ( 0 , 0 , 800 , 600 ) ;
Simply is n't as expressive as ...
window := Window top : 0 left : 0 width : 800 height : 600 .
And this is a trivial example , the more complicated the code gets , the more of an advantage Smalltalk has .
Ruby chose to go with a C'ish syntax , but by convention , mostly tries to fake the Smalltalk style anyway because it 's simply better .
window = Window.new :top => 0 , : left => 0 , : width => 800 , : height => 600
So , if you still have n't tried Smalltalk , and I mean really tried it , by writing an application in it , give it a go .
You 'll never regret it , because everything you learn , and you 'll learn a lot , you 'll be able to bring back with you to whatever language you call home .
Smalltalk will change the way you think , no matter what language you 're coming from .
Whether it changes it for better or for worse is of course entirely up to you .
If you 're afraid to try Smalltalk , then at least try Smalltalk Lite ... uh , I mean , Ruby , you 'll enjoy it and still be able to use your existing tools .
You can work your way up to the real thing .
PS : Lisp and Haskell are two other equally mind bending languages that I think everyone should learn , however , neither of them can touch Smalltalk 's development environment .
That being said , learn them anyway .
But their new attitude ensures , right now , that the crisis WILL spread .
Let me tell you why .
The very people that , in many instances , denied that there was any kind of bubble , or that house prices were a problem in any way , and denied that market valuations of certain assets were completely unreasonable , are now saying , in hindsight , that it was indeed a bubble and , while they are still saying that nothing much will really happen fro mthe end of the bubble ( other than silly people getting punished ) , they are already hard at work trying to pin the blame elsewhere .
As the markets keep on going through turbulence , and many conflicting opinions are heard as to whether this is just a harbinger of things to come ( my position ) or just a " welcome correction " ( still that of most " serious " pundits and the conventional wisdom ) , what 's most striking to me - and very revealing on its own - is how suddenly everybody is talking about the real estate bubble as it if were the most obvious thing .
Fear makes a welcome return ( FT , 15 August )
The world has witnessed four great bubbles over the past two decades - in Japanese stocks in the late 1980s , in east Asia 's stocks and property in the mid-1990s , in the US ( and European ) stock markets in the late 1990s and , finally , in the housing markets of much of the advanced world in the 2000s .
There has been too much imprudent finance worldwide , with central bankers and ministries of finance providing rescue at virtually every stage .
Thus , Martin Wolf , the senior economics correspondent of the Financial Times , the European business version of a Broder in Washington :
This is a polite version of my " Bubbles " Greenspan moniker : cheap money , especially in times of turmoil , has cause runaway asset price inflation .
But as wages were under control thanks to the Chinese , there was nothing to worry about .
But now , this is deemed " imprudent " .
And a classic mania :
The process starts with " displacement " , some event that changes people 's perceptions of the future .
Then come rising prices in the affected sector .
The third stage is easy credit and its handmaiden , financial innovation .
The fourth stage is over - trading , when markets depend on a fresh supply of " greater fools " .
The fifth stage is euphoria , when the ignorant hope to enjoy the wealth gained by those who came before them .
The warnings of those who cry " bubble " are ridiculed , because these Cassandras have been wrong for so long .
In the sixth stage comes insider profit - taking .
Finally , comes revulsion .
Ridiculed we were indeed .
But whether this takes the form of Jim Cramer begging the Fed to bail out feckless financiers , or Wolf 's more prudent assertion that the " central bank must save not specific institutions , but the market itself , " two thing are certain , and undoubtedly acknowledged by all : that there was a bubble , and that it has come to and end .
That people say that this is just the beginning , or that it is a healthy correction to still high levels is mostly irrelevant , because what matters is that the notion of the end of the bubble is now widely public , because this is the single most important driver of things .
To make it simple : market psychology has flipped - from " prices will continue to go up " to " prices will no longer go up " - and thus the herd will stop buying .
It does n't really matter if it starts selling , or if it holds tight - buyers have become scarce ( both because they suddenly do n't think it 's a good thing to buy , and because banks have stopped lending them money to do so - that 's the credit crunch bit of the current crisis ) , and people do n't expect prices to go up anymore .
That , in itself , in enough to cool the markets .
No expectations of quick gains and fewer buyers means , at the very best , stagnant markets .
But too many things in recent years have been predicated on ever increasing prices .
Ninja mortgage loans ( no income , no job , no assets ) can only be repaid by flipping houses .
Too many private equity buy outs of corporations made sense only in the expectation of a quick resale within 2 - 5 years at a premium .
Now these homeowners and the companies have to live with crippling debt burdens - and many will collapse under that weight .
That means , down the road , houses dumped on the market , and companies going bust , with the attendant layoffs , loss of pension and loss of healthcare .
To be honest , the scale and the timing of these phenomenons is still very hard to pin down , which explains why prognoses go from ' speed bump ' to ' major economic depression . '
But again , the end of the great bull market is , in itself , enough to seriously cripple what has been the main engine of growth in recent years : construction , financial engineering and increasing debt .
Wages , which remained stagnant in supposedly booming economies , are not going to go up now , and the lower ability of households and corporations to borrow yet more money will necessarily cause ther spending to shrink .
Again , I have not yet talked in any way about the cost of the financial bubble itself - only about the expected changes in economic behavior due to new conditions .
The financial meltdown , if there is one ( as I personally think there will be ) will only add to that and make thing worse by weakening banks , causing asset dumps and bringing down all sorts of asset classes down , and all the business they underpinned .
For samples of what might happen , read this Hedge Fund Sell Outs Threaten Markets or this excellent summary by stoneleigh earlier here at the Oil Drum : The Resurgence of Risk - A Primer on the Developing Credit Crunch .
Without going into these scenarios , what strikes me , again , is how quickly the pundits have flip - flopped to the new common wisdom of the bubble and are out looking for scapegoats .
Here 's Martin Wolf , again :
Financial markets , and particularly the big players within them , need fear .
Without it , they go crazy .
Moreover , it is impossible for outsiders to regulate a global financial system riddled with conflicts of interest and dominated by huge derivatives markets , massive trading by highly leveraged hedge funds and reliance on abstruse mathematics and questionable statistical models .
These markets must regulate themselves .
The only thing likely to persuade them to do so is the certainty that the players will be allowed to go bust .
" they go crazy " ( i.e. they overpay for assets ) " conflicts of interest " ( i.e. cheerleaders profit from higher prices ) " highly leveraged " ( i.e. too much easy debt ) " questionable statistical models " ( i.e. models work only so long as there are no crises ) .
And the culprits are indeed now all over the media :
Rating agencies hit by subprime probe
The European Commission is to investigate credit ratings agencies amid growing dismay over their slow response to the subprime mortgage crisis .
Officials in Brussels , and many other critics , believe the ratings agencies failed to act quickly enough to warn investors about the risks of investing in securities backed by US subprime mortgages - the sector whose troubles triggered the recent global market volatility .
In the US , Barney Frank , Democrat chairman of the House financial services committee , said he planned to hold hearings on the agencies ' performance next month .
He said the agencies had " not done a good job " in the current crisis .
Rating agencies got paid by banks to provide ratings .
Good ratings meant more sales by the banks .
Of course there was pressure for rating agencies to be optimistic .
Thier only restraint was their reputation , and we saw how effective that was for Arthur Andersen .
Plus , the more they rated junk bonds favorably , the easier it was to refinance dodgy companies , and the fewer defaults there were , thus providing more fuel for that cycle .
This has been said for months by the Cassandras but , as usual , investigations get started when it 's too late .
Hopefully , this will at least lead to a fundamental rethink of the role of the rating agencies in the lending markets .
Giving such a fundamental gatekeeper role to private entities essentially paid for by sale - side bankers is not a good way to avoid bubbles .
Limitations of computer models " Models ( ours including ) are behaving in the opposite way we would predict and have seen and tested for over very long time periods , " said Lehman Brothers last week .
A glance at recent financial history shows that this type of " rare " event is not so unusual at all . (...)
" People say these are one - in - a - 100,000 - years events but they seem to happen every year , " says Satyajit Das , a consultant to hedge funds and investment banks .
" This episode should make people ask questions about models - I think it could lead to a real reassessment . "
Any such reassessment could have far - reaching consequences .
The spread of financial models is at the heart of the growth of modern banking .
Indeed , were it not for modern computing power , this decade 's remarkable explosion in finance would not have occurred at all . (...)
But while computers are often able to operate better than humans in " normal " markets , this month 's events demonstrate that during times of stress they have some crucial flaws .
One problem is that models typically predict the future on the basis of past data .
This can lead to distortions , given the speed at which the financial industry is currently evolving .
Indeed , many of the instruments at the heart of the current credit storm barely existed before this decade - which means that computers can only model these markets based on the benign conditions of the past few years .
Another big problem is that computer models do not always take account of the way that their own behaviour is affecting markets .
The dirty secret of bankers is that they are bad at science and maths , and do not understand that a model , however sophisticated , cannot provide output of a qaulity better than the input .
Lots of data does not mean better data ; what makes data " good " is qualitative analysis , i.e. risk assessment by bankers doing their job instead of relying on fancy models .
They do use extremely smart mathematicians to play around with data , but these guys ' jobs are not that of bankers .
I mean , " models typically predict the future on the basis of past data " - anybody that has ever bought any financial instrument gets told ( or sees written in small print ) right from the start that the past is no indicator of the future ...
Thus , models work until they do n't .
LTCM 's lesson has visibly not been learnt .
But blaming rating agencies and computer models , of course , is a way to avoid the real debates , the ideological ones - that over the supposed superiority of the " efficient markets " to drive economic behavior , that over the insistence that things be valued in dollars ( discounted cash flow ) or be worthless , and that over the idea that greed is good and leads to socially acceptable outcomes .
The core of the Reagan - Thatcher revolution is that greed ( especailly that of financiers capturing future cash flows of the real world for their personal , immediate profit ) spontaneously improves the common good , and that all regulations and taxes that limit it should be dismantled .
Well , we 're about to see the price of that grand collective delusion .
But we , especially those of us that call ourselves progressives , should not mistake our target .
Bankers and financiers should be made to pay for their follies but that is only a small part of it .
The big thing is to blame it on the failed , and utterly dangerous , ideology of the efficient markets / society does n't exist / government is the problem crowd .
otherwise it will start again - and not only that , but their proposed remedy WILL be lower wages , fewer worker rights , lower taxes and the other usual " reforms . "
Again , the fact that a bubble is now publicly acknowledged ensures that there will be a major economic correction , irrespective of whether there is a full financial meltdown or not .
There will be pain .
There will be calls for bailouts .
There will be further pressure on the lower and middle classes to bear the brunt of the price .
Unless we have a coherent alternative economic discourse on the crisis - that of strict regulation of the financial world ( real regulation , not the busybody but pretend kind like we have right now ) , bankers will continue to capture wealth , even as the pie shrinks .
Zimbabwe Businesses Reeling From Price - Slashing Order
By Nonthando Bhebhe
HARARE , Zimbabwe , July 18 , 2007 ( ENS ) -
" It was an act of madness , " said a manager at a Spar store in the low - income Harare suburb of Seke .
" Ripple effects will be felt for a long time in Zimbabwean business .
Job losses will be immediate . "
Businesses in Zimbabwe are still reeling from President Robert Mugabe 's June 26 decision to slash the prices of all commodities by 50 percent , in a bid to tackle skyrocketing inflation , which he claimed is being fueled by the private sector to bring down his government .
The move sparked a stampede of shoppers , leaving companies with empty shelves .
Many say they may now be forced to close .
" This act is the latest in a long chain of irrational political decisions Mugabe has taken in the past few years to keep himself in power , " continued the Spar manager .
" The next will most probably be the seizure of mines and foreign - owned businesses which he is legitimizing through the Economic Empowerment and Indigenisation Bill currently before parliament . "

" Operation Murambatsvina destroyed the informal sector , and now this is destroying the formal sector .
So where do we go from here ? " said Chari .
Like Operation Murambatsvina , the current operation , according to Mugabe , is to stop the formal sector from working with western powers wishing to effect " regime change " in Zimbabwe .
Several senior company executives , many from companies headquartered outside Zimbabwe , have been arrested and have spent nights in filthy police cells for failing to comply with the government directive to reduce their prices .
Long fuel queues are also back at the few service stations that have received cheap fuel from the state - owned National Oil Company of Zimbabwe , NocZim , which they are selling at 60,000 Zimbabwe dollars , ZWD , a liter , ( just under 50 US cents at black market prices ) down from nearly 200,000 ZWD two weeks ago .
The fuel situation had stabilized after government allowed private companies to import and sell fuel at rates determined by the black market from which dealers obtained the foreign exchange to import .

The public transport sector is almost grinding to a halt after government ordered them to reduce their fares or face a cancellation of their operating licences .
Government told public transport operatives at a meeting last week that if one of their vehicles was caught over - pricing , officials would cancel the licences of not just that one vehicle but of the whole fleet .
One city commuter bus operator said , " Really I can not be working for the government .
It makes no sense to continue when I will be making such a huge loss . "
Motorists have also been affected as they cannot get fuel and are being forced to either source from the black market or leave their cars parked .
Traffic on Harare 's roads has been significantly been reduced over the last week or so .
Zimbabweans initial excitement about the order to slash prices of basic commodities by half has now been replaced by panic and desperation as most retail outlets have begun to run out of goods .
The first casualties of the price slash were the butchers , which ran out of the beef and pork within a few days of the directive .
Most meat outlets in Harare suburbs have either closed or are about to .
Highfield butcher Petros Mawoneke was on the verge of tears when asked what effect the price reduction had had on him and his family .
" I just do n't know for how long I will be coming to work if the situation continues like this .
I am afraid that one day , we will be told not to report for work anymore because we are not selling anything at the moment .
Our suppliers are no longer supplying us , " he said .

In response to the beef shortages , the government last week revoked the licences of all private abattoirs for refusing to continue supplying meat and meat products .
They had stopped slaughtering livestock in protest against the slashing of prices which they say would bankrupt them .
Trade Minister Obert Mpofu said the Cold Storage Company , CSC , part owned by the government , would now have the sole responsibility of slaughtering livestock .
The CSC , however , was already facing serious financial problems and had been operating well below its capacity .
One of the largest outlets of pork products , Colcom Foods , has already run out of everything except bacon , a few boxes of pork sausages , polony and smoked ham , all of which are foods for the rich .
An employee at Colcom Foods said that the company did not know when the next supplies were going to be delivered .
Its general manager in Harare 's Workington industrial area was recently arrested together with 33 top executives of other companies for allegedly ignoring the government directive to reduce prices .
Long queues could be observed at TM Supermarket in Arcadia suburb , where the prices of basic commodities like washing soap , washing powder , Vaseline petroleum jelly and margarine were reduced by more than 100 percent .
Reports say the situation is the same countrywide .
Thomas Madziva , who was queuing to buy slices of polony , also known as bologna , and bread rolls for his breakfast , was irate .
" Why should I queue when all I want is polony ?
This is getting really frustrating now .
First it was the bread queues , now it 's for everything - this is absolute madness .
Our relief was temporary - we should have known this is where Mugabe 's generosity would land us . "

We are about to start the cycle again .
By most accounts , President Bush plans to highlight health care in his forthcoming State of the Union address .
His proposals may or may not have merit , but they surely wo n't fix the health system in any fundamental way .
The reason is that most Americans do n't want to fix the system in that sense .
Most are satisfied with their care .
Most do n't see ( or pay directly ) most of their costs .
Because politicians -- of both parties -- reflect public opinion , they wo n't do more than tinker .
Unfortunately , tinkering is n't enough .
As everyone knows , health spending has risen steadily .
In 2004 , it totaled 16 percent of national income , up from 7.2 percent in 1970 .
As health insurance becomes more costly , the number of uninsured , now about 46 million , may grow .
Worse , health costs may depress wage gains , raise taxes and squeeze other government programs .
Here 's the paradox : A health - care system that satisfies most of us as individuals may hurt us as a society .
Let me offer myself as an example .
All my doctors are in small practices .
I like it that way .
It seems to make for closer personal connections .
But I 'm always stunned by how many people they employ for non-medical chores -- appointments , record - keeping , insurance collections .
A bigger practice , though more impersonal , might be more efficient .
Because insurance covers most of my medical bills , I do n't have any stake in switching .
On a grander scale , that 's our predicament .
Americans generally want their health - care system to do three things : ( 1 ) provide needed care to all people , regardless of income ; ( 2 ) maintain our freedom to pick doctors and their freedom to recommend the best care for us ; and ( 3 ) control costs .
The trouble is that these laudable goals are n't compatible .
We can have any two of them , but not all three .
Everyone can get care with complete choice -- but costs will explode , because patients and doctors have no reason to control them .
We can control costs but only by denying care or limiting choices .
Disliking the inconsistencies , we hide them -- to individuals .
We subsidize employer - paid health insurance by excluding it from income taxes ( the 2006 cost to government : an estimated $ 126 billion ) .
Most workers do n't see the full costs of their health care .
Nor do Medicare recipients , whose costs are paid mainly by other people 's payroll taxes .
We 're living in a fantasy world .
Given our inconsistent expectations , no health - care system -- not one completely run by government or one following ``market '' principles -- can satisfy public opinion .
Politicians and pundits can score cheap points by emphasizing one goal or another ( insure the uninsured , cover drugs for Medicare recipients , expand ``choice ' ' ) without facing the harder job : finding a better balance among competing goals .
Every attempt to do so has failed .
Consider the ``managed care '' experiment of the 1990s .
The idea was simple : herd patients into health maintenance organizations or large physician networks ; impose ``best practices '' on doctors and patients as a way to encourage preventive medicine and eliminate wasteful spending ; and cut costs through administrative economies .
But managed care upset doctors and patients .
After a backlash , managed care relaxed cost controls .
The near - collapse of the secondary and sub - prime mortgage markets claimed it ’s first victim yesterday :
TUCSON , Ariz . — First Magnus Financial Corp. , a national mortgage lender that is suspending operations , says it has laid off 99 percent of its nearly 6,000 employees nationwide and closed all of its more than 300 offices .
According to a notice filed with the state Friday , the Tucson - based company that originated home loans and then sold bundled loans into the secondary loan market expects to retain only about 60 of its employees .
First Magnus officials said a bankruptcy filing was possible .
On Thursday , First Magnus announced that it had stopped originating new loans and was suspending operations .
Company officials said the lender was caught in the credit liquidity crunch now causing a meltdown in the mortgage industry , even though First Mangus was not engaged in selling “ sub - prime ” mortgages that sparked the crisis in recent months .
This follows Thursday ’s announcement by Countrywide Financial that it had tapped into a $ 11.5 billion line of credit to deal with liquidity problems brought on by the problems in the mortgage industry , and is clearly one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve Board decided yesterday to lower the discount rate by .5 % .
Yesterday ’s action by the Fed did turn the stock markets around , and it ’s likely to help most of the mainstream banking industry deal with the short - term liquidity crisis that ’s developed in the past several weeks , but the collapse of First Magnus and Countrywide ’s liquidity problems should be a signal that we are far from the end of this particular story .
But here ’s the thing to remember .
What we ’re seeing is not a “ market failure ” and it ’s not a sign of some inherent defect in the banking system , it ’s the “ effect ” part of a cause - and - effect scenario that started with the downturn in the housing market .
For years , mortgage lenders were foolishly giving money to people who , foolishly , thought that interest rates we had n’t seen since the 1960 ’s would be here forever and that they could afford to buy really expensive houses .
When that proved not to be the case , people started defaulting on their mortgages and the lenders who gave them money started experiencing liquidity problems .
If anything else , this entire episode should remind everyone that the free market does n’t prevent people from making foolish decisions , it just ensures that , in the end , there will be consequences paid .
In other words , There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch .
So , some scientists called into question the religion of Global Warming , suggesting that those who were putting forward the narrative were “ stifling ” debate .
In a show of tolerance by those in the “ movement ” , those scientists have started receiving death threats :
Scientists who questioned mankind ’s impact on climate change have received death threats and claim to have been shunned by the scientific community .
They say the debate on global warming has been “ hijacked ” by a powerful alliance of politicians , scientists and environmentalists who have stifled all questioning about the true environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions .
Timothy Ball , a former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg in Canada , has received five deaths threats by email since raising concerns about the degree to which man was affecting climate change .
One of the emails warned that , if he continued to speak out , he would not live to see further global warming .

Penang 's wildlife have been known to make temples their homes
Buddhism forbids devotees from harming any living creature .
So the monks are looking for a creative and non-violent solution to deal with the insects , which are biting worshippers .
The monks at the Ang Hock Si Temple , also known as the Hong Hock See temple , in Georgetown on Penang Island have had to learn to live with nature .
Some years ago they shared their temple compound with a cobra .
The chief monk , the Venerable Boon Keng , told the BBC that they had become used to meditating alongside the snake but eventually decided to catch it and take it away to a nearby forest .
Now he says the cobra 's place has been taken by a colony of fire ants .
Vacuum cleaner
But the ants are dropping from the temple 's sacred bodhi tree onto people meditating below - and when they bite it causes painful swelling .
The Venerable Boon Keng practises what he calls " letting go " meditation - so he " lets go " of the pain .
But out of consideration for worshippers less far along the path to enlightenment the monks are looking for ways to persuade the ants to go .
An attempt to remove them using a vacuum cleaner failed , so the Buddhist community is appealing for help .
They cannot encourage anyone to harm the ants , but the chief monk says that if someone turns up unbidden and deals with them without the monks ' involvement then that is the will of the universe .

Energy companies have
made up to £ 2 billion profit
at the expense of
customers under the EU’s
controversial carbon trading
scheme , the Government has
conceded .
The scheme – introduced
two and a half years ago – was
supposed to encourage dirty
power stations to switch to
cleaner , low carbon , energy .
But , in practice , the first phase
of the scheme has allowed some
of the dirtiest polluters to
generate huge profits by ramping up
customer bills , without lowering
greenhouse gas emissions .
Some industry experts believe
the carbon trading ‘ windfall ’ will
soar to around £ 1.5 billion a year
when the second phase begins
next year .
Consumer and environmental
groups yesterday said the
scheme had lined the pockets of
electricity generators such as
PowerGen and Scottish Power
without reducing emissions .
European carbon trading is a
key part of the Government’s
drive to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions .
Under the scheme ,
major manufacturers and electricity producers are handed
permits that allow them to
produce a fixed amount of carbon
dioxide each year .
Companies that reduce their
pollution ration can sell unused
permits on the open market ,
while companies that exceed
their carbon target must buy
additional permits .
It was assumed that
companies would be forced to buy the
permits , giving them a real
financial incentive to reduce
pollution .
But , after lobbying from
industry , the EU handed out the
permits for free .
Because power firms were now
keen to reduce pollution by
cutting their total electricity
output , the knock - on effect was to
increase the price of electricity ,
generating massive windfall
profits .
In addition , they were able to
sell any unused permits for a
profit on the open market .
Peter Ainsworth , the Tory
shadow Environment Secretary ,
said the principle of carbon
trading was sound .
‘ But the carbon trading
scheme is designed to bring
down carbon emissions , not
create windfall profits for the power
companies , ’ he said .
‘ Some of the worst polluters
have been given free permits to
produce carbon , and have then
passed on the cost of these
allowances to customers as if
they had paid for them .
It ’s a
design fault in the scheme which
needs to be rectified . ’
The wildlife charity WWF said
it also backs the principle of carphasebon trading , but described the
free allocation of carbon permits
as ‘ a mistake ’ .
Yesterday , the Department of
Trade and Industry ’s Malcolm
Wicks said energy suppliers were
making around £ 800 million a
year profit from carbon trading
‘ based on the assumption that
electricity generators pass on
the full cost of carbon
allowances through to higher
electricity prices ’.
The industry believes that
figure will rise when the second
of carbon trading starts
next year .
‘ Between 2008 and
2012 , we expect the windfall to
be at least £ 1.5 billion a year , ’ said
an industry insider .
The windfall came during a
period when wholesale gas
prices , and the gas and
electricity prices paid in the home , were
at a record high .
Although prices have fallen
over the last few months , energy
companies have been accused of
taking too long to cut prices .
The Government concedes
that the windfall profits for
energy companies have been a
problem .
However the Department for
the Environment , Food and
Rural Affairs said the estimate of
£ 800 million was the ‘ potential ’
windfall , but in reality was
probably lower .
A spokesman for the
Association of Electricity Producers said
power companies are investing
heavily in new power stations
and reducing carbon emissions
and the scheme acted partly as a
form of compensation .
‘ It was a political decision to
give the allocations to power
companies for free , ’ she added .
PATNA , India ( Reuters ) - Hundreds of people are flocking to a remote village in eastern India to catch a glimpse of an old man who has spent six years lying inside his own grave waiting to die as he mourns for his wife , officials said .
Basanta
Roy claims he is 103 and spends his day clearing weeds from the grave and lying in it .
Belonging to a Hindu caste who bury their dead , Roy dug his grave close to his wife ’s after she died in the late 1990s .
“ He cleans his grave every day and waits for his death , which seems to be eluding him , ” said Shyam Narayan Ram , a senior government official from Jharkhand state .
PEJ Talk Show Index June 24 - 29 , 2007
It was Lou Dobbs ’s victory lap .
On June 29 , a day after the Senate applied what appeared to be the coup de grace to the immigration bill , its most vocal media opponent read some congratulatory emails on his CNN show .
“ Thanks Lou , for presenting the views of legal American citizens , ” wrote “ Joan from Virginia . ”
“ We love you Lou .
Your hard work paid off .
Thank you .
Thank you , ” enthused “ Fred from Florida . ”
“ Thank you Lou Dobbs for leading the charge against this immigration bill , ” added “ E. from Washington . ”
In the weeks between the May 17 introduction of the Senate immigration legislation and its June 28 demise , many hosts — including conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh , Michael Savage , and Sean Hannity — mounted an aggressive campaign against the bill .
But over the long haul , no one devoted more energy to derailing what he called the “ amnesty ” measure than Dobbs , the veteran CNN personality who has transformed himself from a pinstriped chronicler of the corporate boardroom to a full - blown populist , though he still has the suits .
( Critics might use other words to describe him . )
In the last three months , from April 1 - June 29 , Dobbs devoted more than a quarter ( 26 % ) of the airtime on his nightly show to immigration .
( That ’s almost twice as much attention as he gave to the next leading subject , the Iraq war policy debate . )
Last week , the immigration debate was the most popular cable and radio talk topic , filling 24 % of the airtime , according to PEJ ’s Talk Show Index from June 24 - 29 .
And nearly half the week ’s talk stories on immigration originated from Dobbs ’s program , including the segment in which he basked in the citizen kudos .
While immigration dominated the talk menu , the failed London car bomb plot — which occurred on the last day of the week examined in this Index — was the second - biggest topic ( 12 % ) .
It was a much bigger subject on cable than radio .
The controversy over Vice President Dick Cheney ’s secretive and unprecedented influence over policy in the White House , explored in a Washington Post series , was next at 9 % .
For liberal critics of the Vice President such as radio ’s Randi Rhodes and MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann , the Post ’s articles were irresistible ammunition .
With last week largely devoid of major campaign news , the 2008 White House race was the sixth - biggest talk subject ( filling 6 % of the time , plummeting from 25 % the previous week ) .
You have to go back to April 15 - 20 , when the horrific Virginia Tech shooting spree consumed 63 % of the talk newshole , to find a week when the campaign got less attention on the talk shows .
The talk universe topic list continues to be somewhat different than the agenda seen in PEJ ’s more general News Coverage Index each week .
Four subjects that made talk ’s top - 10 story list failed to register that high in the general news Index .
The grisly family murder / suicide apparently perpetrated by professional wrestler Chris Benoit was the fourth - biggest topic at 7 % in talk .
Socialite Paris Hilton ’s release from jail was the tenth - biggest subject at 3 % .
The other two subjects that generated more talk attention than general coverage involved the media directly .
One was the exchange of words between Elizabeth Edwards , wife of Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards , and conservative commentator Ann Coulter over civility in politics ( seventh at 6 % ) .
The other was an argument over ideology on the talk airwaves ( eighth at 4 % ) .
The Talk Show Index , released each week , is designed to provide news consumers , journalists and researchers with hard data about what stories and topics are most frequently dissected and discussed in the media universe of talk and opinion — a segment of the media that spans across both prime time cable and radio .
( See About the Talk Show Index . ) PEJ ’s Talk Show Index includes seven prime time cable shows and five radio talk hosts and is a subset of our News Coverage Index .
Paris Hilton ’s return from incarceration and the Benoit tragedy were two very different crime stories that intrigued some talk hosts last week .
The Benoit case — in which police say he killed his wife and seven - year - old son before hanging himself — may end up opening a window on the issue of steroids in the physically demanding world of pro wrestling .
On the June 28 edition of MSNBC ’s “ Scarborough Country , ” — the program that devoted by far the most attention to the issue — guest host Dan Abrams discussed the subject with pro grapplers “ Johnny B. Badd ” and “ the Lethal Weapon . ”
As the screen displayed the statistic that pro wrestlers have death rates seven times higher than the general population , Abrams said “ we ’ve had former wrestlers on this program …and every one of them talks about funerals and the fact that a disproportionate number of wrestlers have died .
There ’s got to be some explanation for why so many wrestlers are having so many problems . ”
Most of the talk of Hilton ’s June 26 release from jail — following her assertion that she found God and is a changed person — came on the Fox News Channel ’s “ O’ Reilly Factor ” and “ Hannity & Colmes . ”
( The “ celebutante ’s ” June 27 interview with CNN ’s Larry King also tripled King ’s normal audience . )
The Elizabeth Edwards / Ann Coulter face - off was a media - generated flare - up that started when Edwards called into the June 26 edition of MSNBC ’s “ Hardball ” to confront Coulter and ask her “ to stop the personal attacks ” on her husband , John Edwards , and others .
Coulter responded with : “ OK , great the wife of a presidential candidate is calling in asking me to stop speaking . ”
The next night , the battle continued when John Edwards appeared on “ Hardball ” to declare that “ when people like Ann Coulter …engage in this kind of hate mongering , you have to stand up to them . ”
Coulter got a hearing on the June 28 “ O’ Reilly Factor ” where she said she was undaunted by the Elizabeth Edwards call .
“ I ’m more of a man than any liberal is , ” she declared , “ so … I do n’t care . ”
( For those of you with a more skeptical bent , it was pointed out on both “ Hardball ” and “ The O’Reilly Factor ” that Coulter has used the confrontation to sell more of her books and John Edwards has turned the dustup into a fundraising tool . )
Another media - related issue that is generating momentum on talk radio centers around political balance on the airwaves .
And it was ignited , in part , by a recent report concluding that conservative hosts overwhelmingly dominate the radio microphones .
That has quickly developed into its own ideological argument with some conservatives warning of a return to the Fairness Doctrine , a regulation repealed 20 years ago that required broadcasters to air balancing points of view on controversial public policy issues .
On his June 27 show , Limbaugh referred to his program as one “ that frightens and scares the American left to the point that they want to deny this program Constitutional access to the First Amendment . ”
A day later , Ed Schultz , one of a much smaller group of successful liberal hosts , said “ I can guarantee you folks that no one is out there saying ‘ let ’s have the Fairness Doctrine . ’ ”
And he blamed conservatives for trying to silence liberal voices .
“ How come I ’m still on the air ? ” Schultz added .
“ They do n’t want us here . ”

Seagate 160 GB Momentus 7200.2 Notebook Hard Drive
It 's high time for Seagate to refresh the Momentus 7200 line using their Perpendicular Recording technology , which have been in use since it debuted in their Momentus 5400.3 hard drive .
Thanks to the use of perpendicular recording , the new Momentus 7200.2 family boasts a maximum capacity of 160 GB - 60 % more than its predecessor .
Not only does this new recording method allow for much higher capacities , it also increases the platter - to - buffer throughput merely due to the increased areal density .
While the Momentus 7200.1 had a maximum internal transfer rate of 45.8 MB/s , the Momentus 7200.2 boasts a much higher internal transfer rate of 59 MB / s .
That 's about 28.8 % faster than the already impressively - fast Momentus 7200.1 .
This was confirmed in the platter transfer rate graph which showed that the Momentus 7200.2 had a maximum transfer rate of 59.1 MB/s and a minimum transfer rate of 33MB / s .
In fact , that was very close to the transfer rate profile of the Seagate Barracuda 7200.9 desktop hard drive - a very impressive achievement .
However , because of its smaller 8 MB buffer , it ended up about 14 - 16 % slower in reads and 8.6 % slower in writes than the Barracuda 7200.9 .
Still , that is a very impressive performance for a 2.5 " notebook hard drive .
It was certainly much faster than the Fujitsu 4200 RPM hard drive we tested - about 21 - 27 % in reads and 43.8 % in writes .
Perpendicular recording aside , this is the first Seagate hard drive to feature an ( optional ) integrated G - Force Protection sensor package .
This sensor package greatly increases the drive 's robustness and the survivability of your recorded data by automatically parking the read / write heads in the event of an accidental fall .
This feature will be of great interest to those who put great value in their data but are currently using notebooks that do not support such sensors .
Tack on the magnificent 5 - year limited warranty , and you will have a very attractive notebook hard drive upgrade for those who are not only interested in performance but also robustness .
While the long warranty does not guarantee that this hard drive wo n't quit on you in the next five years , it does show the amount of confidence Seagate has in the reliability of this model .
If you are looking for a high - performance notebook hard drive , the Seagate Momentus 7200.2 hard drive is certainly a hard drive you have to consider .
It offers performance that 's close to that of desktop hard drives with a large storage capacity of 160GB .
It also offers a G - Force Protection option for those who are looking for the extra protection against data loss when the notebook is accidentally dropped .
All in a small 2.5 " package .
Hard to beat that !

In a meeting Thursday , July 26th , 2007 , members of ImpeachForPeace.org and After Downing Street met with Congressman Dennis Kucinich in his Washington DC office to present the Congressman with thousands of “ Do It Yourself Impeachments ” collected over the past few months .
DIY Impeachment Memorials are actually a little known and rarely used part of the Rules of the House of Representatives ( “ Jefferson ’s Manual ” ) , which empowers individual citizens to initiate the impeachment against any federal official themselves .
These Memorials support the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Â
During our meeting , Congressman Kucinich agreed to place all signers of the DIY Impeachment Memorials specifically referencing Cheney into the Congressional record .
Rep. Kucinich also agreed to enter into the record the names of signers of regular petitions to impeach Cheney .
Because there is a limit to the number of pages that a representative can submit to the Congressional Record each day , Rep .
Kucinich stated he will continue to submit petitions every day until all the names are submitted .
The most powerful statement for impeachment is the submission of a Memorial , however , so if you have not yet sent a Memorial for the impeachment of Vice President Cheney to ImpeachForPeace.org , please do so !
Go to http://impeachforpeace.org/ImpeachNow.html and download the Memorial .
Then send it to the address listed on the cover letter .
“ Jefferson ’s Manual ” is an interpretive guide to parliamentary procedure , and is included ( along with the Constitution ) in the bound volumes of the Rules of the House of Representatives .
It is ratified by each congress ( including the current one ) , and has been updated continuously through the history of our democracy .
The section covering impeachment lists the acceptable vehicles for bringing impeachment motions to the floor of the House .
Â
Before the House Judiciary Committee can put together the Articles of Impeachment , someone must initiate the impeachment procedure .
Most often , this occurs when members of the House pass a resolution .
Another method outlined in the manual , however , is for individual citizens to submit a memorial for impeachment .
Since then , Kucinich held a press conference informing the public of this .
Enter your name into the Congressional Record

More than 300 psychiatry beds have been lost in New Orleans because of closed hospitals or departments .
Included in the losses : Charity Hospital ( closed ) • 92 general psychiatry beds • 10 alcohol - substance abuse detoxification beds • 40 crisis - intervention beds ( for emergency and short - term mental health admissions ) Touro Infirmary ( partially reopened ) • 50 general and geriatric psychiatry beds DePaul Hospital ( closed ) • 125 psychiatry beds Methodist Hospital ( closed ) • 16 psychiatry beds Source : New Orleans Health Department Enlarge By H.

When Desiree Johnson realized she could n't cope with the stress of rebuilding her life after Hurricane Katrina , she looked for help , but there were no doctors left in her neighborhood .
New Orleans feels pain of mental health crisis NEW ORLEANS  Sixteen months after Hurricane Katrina tore this city apart , a hidden sort of damage is emerging .
Local officials see it in reports of suicides , strokes and stress - related deaths .
They see it in the police calls for fights and domestic violence .
They see it in the long waiting lists for psychiatric care that they have no way to provide .
These days , life in the Big Easy is n't easy at all .
Everyone from the mayor to the people staffing the public health clinics sees it : New Orleans is facing an unprecedented mental health crisis — and the city has no way to deal with it .
The obvious problems only fuel the more subtle ones .
About half of the city 's 450,000 pre-Katrina residents have yet to return , according to the mayor 's office , and entire neighborhoods remain filled with boarded - up homes and businesses .
For those who have come back , everything is hard , and the challenges seem endless : lining up contractors , getting basic services restored , even finding neighborhood places to buy groceries , clothes and gasoline .
Now , many fear the situation could worsen .
" This couple of months is our most critical time period .
… New Year 's , Mardi Gras , Easter , and if people need ( mental health ) services right now , there really is almost no place to go , " says Kevin Stephens , director of the city Health Department .
" We 've got families that have been split up for months , families that lost their homes , crammed in small trailers .
…
People have lost their jobs , their support system , " he adds .
" There 's a heaviness .
And we 're seeing a much , much higher incidence of mental illness . "
How bad is the situation ?
The suicide rate in the first four months after Katrina rose almost 300 % over pre-storm levels , according to coroner 's office statistics .
In a survey after the hurricane by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 26 % of respondents said at least one person in their family needed mental health counseling — but less than 2 % were getting any .
Even now , police data show that emergency calls involving people who need psychiatric treatment continue to come in at a rate about 15 % higher than before Katrina .
Stephens and other top officials in the city 's ravaged mental health system say their anecdotal experience suggests those numbers reveal only a fraction of the problem .
Depression , post - traumatic stress disorder and anxiety are rampant , they say .
People with schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and other chronic mental illnesses are unraveling because they can't get the treatment they need .
The city has virtually no capability to respond .
In all of New Orleans , only a few dozen hospital beds remain available for inpatient psychiatric services , down from more than 300 before Katrina .
A survey last spring , cited in the Journal of the American Medical Association , found only 22 of 196 practicing psychiatrists had returned to the city since the storm .
Stephens ' health department has n't been immune .
Staffing has dropped from 300 to about 60 , he says .
One of his nurses who tended evacuees in the Superdome during the storm is among the suicides .
" It 's not the Katrina event that is really hurting us ; it 's the recovery , the aftermath , " Mayor Ray Nagin said in an interview last month with USA TODAY .
" Our citizens are under tremendous stress .
The pain of what 's going on in our community , particularly with our seniors , is unbearable almost . "
' Everything is so hard '
Before Katrina , Desiree Johnson had a decent job in the billing department of a local insurance company office .
She had a good place to live , plenty of friends and extended family nearby .
" I was just living a normal life , " she says .
When Katrina crashed ashore Aug. 29 , 2005 , almost 10 feet of water filled Johnson 's house .
She and her family fled , some to Houston , some to Indiana , some to places unknown .
They just got on any buses that would take them out of New Orleans .
Now , Johnson , 41 , is living with her grown daughter and infant grandson in a trailer provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
It sits in front of her flood - ravaged home on a block of mostly empty buildings .
She has no job .
Money is tight .
She does n't have a local grocery store anymore .
" There 's so much stress , " she says .
" We still have family members scattered all over .
My son's in Texas , my mother 's in Indiana , my grandmother 's in Mississippi .
Every year , we all get together for the holidays , for Thanksgiving , Christmas . "
This year , for the first time , she says , the family did n't do that .
Even if the family could overcome the costs and logistical hurdles of bringing everyone back , she says , " we do n't even have a place to get together .
You can't find contractors to fix your house , and the ones you do find , it 's hard to make sure they do n't rip you off .
We do n't even have a phone in the trailer . "
Around Thanksgiving , Johnson realized she could n't cope .
She looked for help , but there were no doctors left in her neighborhood .
Finally , she found her way 7 miles across town to the Chartres - Pontchartrain Behavioral Health Clinic , one of the public mental health clinics that has reopened since the storm .
She was diagnosed with depression and put on medication .
She has been coming in regularly since and seeing a counselor .
" I never had depression before ; I did n't really know what to expect , " she says .
" I feel a little better . "
But " better " is a relative term in Johnson 's upside - down world .
" It 's still hard , everything is so hard , " she says .
" In my area , there 's basically nobody back .
It 's just us , maybe one person in this house or that house .
…
Sometimes I still just do n't know how we 're going to make it .
On TV , it looks like our city is OK , but it 's not like that . "
Facilities stretched thin Chartres - Pontchartrain is one of only two public health clinics in New Orleans that were n't destroyed by Katrina .
Six others have reopened ( the last two just came back this month ) .
Four of those are in temporary trailers , and none is fully staffed .
Still , because many of the city 's privately practicing psychiatrists and psychologists have n't returned — and hospital services for the mentally ill are all but shut down — the clinics are the only option for thousands in the city .
" We 're stretched very thin , " says Jerome Gibbs , executive director of the Metropolitan Human Services District , the state - funded agency that runs the public mental health system in greater New Orleans .
At the reopened clinics , " we 're having trouble with staffing , ( and ) we have tremendous resource needs .
And we 're finding that there are large numbers of people who need services that are n't even making it in . "
The same pattern is emerging at the few non-governmental clinics that are trying to share the load .
At the Behavioral Sciences Center , an outpatient facility run by the psychiatry department at the Louisiana State University medical school , caseloads are running about double what they were last year , according to Howard Osofsky , chairman of the LSU department of psychiatry .
More than 100 people are on waiting lists for treatment .
At least those people have some hope :
For the sickest of patients — those needing hospitalization — the problems are worse .
Until August , not a single public inpatient psychiatric bed could be found in New Orleans .
Since then , the New Orleans Adolescent Hospital ( NOAH ) , an LSU - run psychiatric hospital that usually provides youth services , has converted 20 of its 35 beds to treat adults .
Those beds and about 20 others at private facilities are the only ones in the city .
" The lack of beds is a monumental problem — when you have people in crisis and no way to care for them , it strains all of the system , " Gibbs says .
Many people who need acute care for mental health problems are sent out of town for hospitalization , sometimes at facilities 100 miles away .
That often means more problems later .
" If you have to send someone out of the community for treatment , where you do n't have family involved , and you do n't have the ability to do follow - up treatment when they get back , you end up with … a lot more follow - up problems , " Osofsky says .
Sitting in a wheelchair in her small room at NOAH , Eileen Dorn has trouble seeing herself as lucky .
But at least she has a bed , a place to stay , at a time when she knows she can't make it alone .
Dorn , 45 , has a long history of severe depression and other mental health problems .
Before the storm , she lived with her mother .
She survived on Social Security disability payments and spent her days listening to her favorite talk shows on the radio , writing fan mail to the hosts and watching television .
Dorn stayed in the city during Katrina , but she and her mother were evacuated in its wake .
Dorn ended up at a Houston nursing home ; her mother went to a nursing home elsewhere in Texas , where she remains .
" I was so lonely .
I thought that if I came back to a hotel someone would be here to help me figure out how to get a place , " she says .
" When I came back , I needed a support system , counselors .
But I could n't find anything .
It was desperation , frustration .
It was terrible panic and fear . "
Dorn ended up on the street .
Eventually , she was picked up and given one of the 20 inpatient beds that had opened at NOAH .
Today , she probably would be sent somewhere outside the city .
Dorn 's ward is far from homey .
The walls are bare , paint peeling in places .
Her room has a desk and a small single bed .
The TV is in the common room .
But it 's clean , and the staff is dedicated and friendly , Dorn says .
She has spinal problems , which make moving difficult , yet she says she is getting medication , regular counseling and , most important , a sense that she 's not alone .
" It 's been better here , " she says .
" I still do n't know where I 'll go after this ; I try not to think about it .
But I feel safe here .
And that 's better . "
Measuring the demand for mental health services in New Orleans today is difficult .
Few records are kept .
With only 20 % of the city health department 's staff having returned since the storm , those who remain are focused on restoring day - to - day services .
Stephens had a staffer review death notices published in the local paper since Katrina .
Before the storm , there were fewer than 900 death notices a month , the review found .
Now , it 's about 1,300 a month , he says .
The next step , still unfinished , is figuring out how many of the deaths are stress - related — suicides , strokes , heart attacks .
Stephens says those figures will give him leverage to seek state and federal help .
" We know the numbers are up ; we think they 're way up , " he says .
" But we do n't have good data . "
Even without numbers , mental health workers say they know there 's a crisis .
" We hear anecdotal accounts of hospitals turning away people who come in seeking mental health services because they 're not able to treat them , " says Mark Townsend , an LSU psychiatry professor who sees patients at NOAH .
Townsend says many people with chronic mental health conditions are coming into hospitals , trying in vain to get medication because their regular psychiatrists have not returned .
He 's also heard of families bringing loved ones to hospitals for commitment , only to turn away after learning that their relative would be sent out of town .
" It 's really hard to capture in words how dire the situation is , " Townsend says .
" We need help . "
