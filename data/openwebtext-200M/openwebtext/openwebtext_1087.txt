Bloggers in Saudi Arabia Cautious About Expressing their Opinion
Added by Sanket on Jul 16 , 2009 | Visited by 4974 | Voted by 77 persons
In Saudi Arabia young people that have an Internet connection attempt to promote the idea of change within the conservative Gulf Arab monarchy .
The country does not have an elected parliament and clerics are the ones to have a powerful influence on the opinion of the society .
In addition , in Saudi Arabia most newspapers express the opinion of officials and people are prohibited from organizing and participating in demonstrations .
This is why blogging represents the only tool that can make people heard .
Although the officials in Saudi Arabia made it possible for some foreign media to report about the events in the country and the information minister holds a page on Facebook , analysts and diplomats believe that conservatives are still cautious about changes .
According to researchers in Saudi Arabia , at the moment there are about 10,000 blogs in the country .
However , a lot of them are inactive or simply refrain from expressing opinions about the issues in the kingdom .
Most of them focus mainly on daily life and try not to talk a lot about Islam , which is considered to be a rather sensitive topic .
Abdulrahman al - Hazza , spokesman for the information ministry , mentioned that most blogs in Saudi Arabia were not monitored .
At the same time , bloggers still remain cautious , especially when earlier a law was enacted saying that anyone who " touches upon the general order , religious values , or general conduct " can be put on trial , said the information ministry .
Bloggers worry that the government would use the law to take serious actions against those who express freely their opinion over the Internet .
It is worth mentioning that in April the Committee to Protect Journalists described Saudi Arabia as one of the worst nations for bloggers , saying that the government in the kingdom monitors the blogs and had already blocked about 400,000 websites .
Still some journalists in Saudi Arabia believe that the situation will improve over time .
It is yet a mystery whether the government of Saudi Arabia really controls the online resources in the kingdom .
Bloggers will still remain cautious , expressing fear that they may be caught when expressing their ideas .
The freedom of speech is definitely a serious issue in the country and something needs to be done .
It would be a great step towards democracy if the young generation will be able to freely express their opinions , especially over the Internet , currently the most powerful international information source .
Will things change in Saudi Arabia or will the government still actively monitor the activities of its citizens ?
This is the question that remains open , at least until bloggers are finally free to say whatever they believe is needed to be said , without any fear .

Positive Psychology is a recently developed branch of psychology that , unlike other branches , turns away from the focus on treating those deemed “ mentally ill , ” and instead shifts its attention on what makes individuals , and communities , thrive and live happily .
It first began through the theories and practices of humanistic psychologists such as Abraham Maslow , who is famous for his theory on the hierarchy of needs ( 1943 ) , Carl Rogers , and Erich Fromm .
However , Positive Psychology really first got started in 1998 when Martin Seligman chose it as the theme of his presidential term at the American Psychological Association .
Seligman has been previously known for his work on the theory of “ learned helplessness ” , and is now the current director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania ( which offers a compact one - year Masters in Applied Positive Psychology for professionals in the domain of psychology , education , business , health , life - coaching , and research ) .
What positive psychology researches
Positive psychologists research interests include :
1. Research into the Pleasant Life , or the “ life of enjoyment ” , examines how people optimally experience , forecast , and savor the positive feelings and emotions that are part of normal and healthy living ( e.g. relationships , hobbies , interests , entertainment , etc. ) .
2 . The study of the Good Life , or the “ life of engagement ” , investigates the beneficial affects of immersion , absorption , and flow that individuals feel when optimally engaged with their primary activities .
These states are experienced when there is a positive match between a person ’s strength and the task they are doing , i.e. when they feel confident that they can accomplish the tasks they face .
3 . Inquiry into the Meaningful Life , or “ life of affiliation ” , questions how individuals derive a positive sense of well - being , belonging , meaning , and purpose from being part of and contributing back to something larger and more permanent than themselves ( e.g. nature , social groups , organizations , movements , traditions , belief systems ) .
Theories of positive psychology
Positive psychologists have theorized three main components to building positive experiences : mindfulness , flow , and spirituality .
Positive psychologists characterize mindfulness using terms such as non-judging , non-striving , accepting , patient , trusting , open , letting go , gentle , generous , empathetic , grateful , and kind .
Researchers believe mindfulness can lead to physical and mental health benefits including reduction of stress , anxiety , depression , and chronic pain .
It is a skill that can be developed to some degree in all individuals .
Flow is referred to as state of absorption , and can be characterized as intense focus , concentration , and being in the moment .
Flow is considered a rewarding experience to have and has also been shown to optimize skillful performance in achieving one ’s goals .
The concept of “ flow ” was first formulated by Hungarian psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi ( who now teaches at Claremonte University in California , which also offers graduate degrees in applied Positive Psychology ) .
Colloquial terms for flow include : “ in the zone , ” “ on the ball , ” and “ in the groove . ”
The concept is comparable to the Buddhist notion of jhāna meaning “ states of absorption ” , or samadhi , a technical term for a high level of concentration where the subject “ becomes one ” with the object of attention ( leading to the loss of self - awareness ) .
Csíkszentmihályi identifies the following nine factors as accompanying an experience of flow :
1. Clear goals ( expectations and rules are discernible and goals are attainable and align appropriately with one ’s skill set and abilities ) .
Moreover , the challenge level and skill level should both be high .
2. Concentrating and focusing , a high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention ( a person engaged in the activity will have the opportunity to focus and to delve deeply into it ) .
3 . A loss of the feeling of self - consciousness , the merging of action and awareness .
4. Distorted sense of time , one ’s subjective experience of time is altered .
5. Direct and immediate feedback ( successes and failures in the course of the activity are apparent , so that behavior can be adjusted as needed ) .
6 . Balance between ability level and challenge ( the activity is neither too easy nor too difficult ) .
7 . A sense of personal control over the situation or activity .
8 . The activity is intrinsically rewarding , so there is an effortlessness of action .
9 . People become absorbed in their activity , and focus of awareness is narrowed down to the activity itself , action awareness merging .
Lastly , the research into the benefits of spirituality in positive psychology has shown that more spiritually adept individuals are more likely to find purpose and meaning in their life .
Positive psychologists use the concepts of spirituality to evoke ecological well - being , to get individuals to consider there important relationship with the world and universe as a whole .
Positive psychologists have also suggested integrating theories of self - efficacy , learned optimism , and hope .
Applications of positive psychology
Despite the growing amount of empirical research done in the name of positive psychology , the field is largely an applied science , especially in forms of education , counseling , business , and health .
Much like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) in clinical psychology , positive psychologist developed something known as the Character Strength and Virtues ( CSM ) manual .
Positive psychologists challenge moral relativism , and instead promote the idea that man has an intrinsic and biological disposition toward certain moral virtues .
Positive psychologist have identified six main virtues in the cultivation of happiness :
1. Wisdom and Knowledge : curiosity , open - mindedness , love of learning , perspective , creativity
2. Courage : bravery , persistence , integrity , vitality
3. Humanity : love , kindness , social intelligence
4. Justice : citizenship , fairness , leadership
5 . Temperance : forgiveness and mercy , humility , prudence , self control
6. Transcendence : appreciation of beauty and excellence , gratitude , hope , humor , spirituality
These principles of positive psychology have been applied to numerous settings : mental health , efficiency in the workplace , personal development , education and learning , skill - building , achieving goals , and finding meaning and purpose in one ’s life .
The future of positive psychology
Positive psychology at first focused on achieving excellence and happiness in the individual .
It is still very much about the individual , but it is also now slowly taking an ecological approach .
Positive psychologists are now asking questions on how this research can affect economic and governmental policy .
Ed Deiner at Claremont University says instead of just using GDP to measure economic growth , why do n’t we measure the actual happiness and well - being of individuals ?
All this emphasis on material economic growth seems to have clouded the picture on how we should use our knowledge to benefit the psychological well - being of humanity .
Deiner gives one example of how recent research has showed that increasing “ green space ” in a town ( public space dedicated to flowers , plants and nature ) has shown to increase the level of happiness in a community .
What other implications does this research have on improving society as a whole ?
Perhaps the lessons of positive psychology could raise the awareness of individuals to take better care of the environment and each other .
Positive psychology , in a way , is slowly becoming an interdisciplinary science between psychology , morality , economics and spirituality .

This is the third in a series of blog posts I ’m doing on the upcoming VS 2010 and .NET 4 release .
Today ’s post discusses VS 2010 ’s enhanced multi-targeting support – which allows you to use and target multiple versions of .
NET .
We did significant architectural work in the VS 2010 release to enable a number of new multi-targeting features , and provide a much better experience .
Understanding Side - by - Side
VS 2010 can be installed “ side by side ” with previous versions of Visual Studio .
What this means is that you can install it on the same machine as VS 2008 / VS 2005 / VS 2003 – and use all of the versions at the same time if you ’d like .
. NET 4.0 can also be installed “ side by side ” with previous versions of .NET on the same machine .
. NET 4.0 has a new version number for both the framework libraries and CLR engine – which means it runs completely independently from .
NET 2.0 , 3.0 and 3.5 .
What this means is that you can install .
NET 4.0 on a machine that has .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5 installed , and configure some applications to run using .
NET 4.0 and others to run using the older .
NET versions ( the IIS admin tool allows you to configure this for ASP.
NET applications ) .
This allows you to use .
NET 4.0 for new applications - without having to necessarily test and upgrade all your existing ones .
VS 2008 ’s Multi-Targeting Support
VS 2008 was the first release of Visual Studio that included multi-targeting support for .
NET .
What this meant was that you could use VS 2008 to create and edit not only .
NET 3.5 projects , but also .NET 3.0 and .NET 2.0 projects as well .
This allowed developers to more quickly upgrade and take advantage of new Visual Studio tooling features – without having to necessarily require the newer version of .NET to be installed on the clients and production servers running their applications .
VS 2008 ’s multi-targeting support was able to take advantage of the fact that .NET 2.0 , .NET 3.0 , and .NET 3.5 all ran on top of the same version of the CLR – and that the primary difference between the .NET versions was in their framework libraries .
As a result , Visual Studio ’s compilers were able to generate the same IL output , the debugger was able to debug against the same CLR engine , and the IDE support for multi-targeting was primary focused on filtering out new assemblies and project templates from showing up when they were n’t supported with a given .NET version .
This multi-targeting experience worked – although it was n’t perfect .
Intellisense within VS 2008 always shows the types and members for the .NET 3.5 version of a framework library ( even if you are targeting . NET 2.0 ) .
This means that you can sometimes inadvertently end up using a method that is only in ASP .
NET 3.5 even when you are working on a ASP .
NET 2.0 project .
VS 2010 ’s Multi-Targeting Support
We made some pretty major architectural changes with VS 2010 to enable much better and more accurate multi-targeting support .
VS 2010 now ships what we call “ reference assemblies ” for each version of .
NET .
A “ reference assembly ” contains only the metadata of a particular framework assembly – and not its actual implementation ( making it much smaller in size on disk ) .
This metadata is enough , though , to ensure that VS 2010 can always provide 100 % accurate intellisense when targeting a particular version of the .NET framework .
It also means that properties exposed through the property grid within designers , API listings within the Object Browser , and all the other various places within the IDE accurately reflect the exact API version signature .
We also updated the VS 2010 debugger , profiler and compilers to be able to target multiple versions of the CLR .
Using VS 2010 ’s Multi-Targeting Support
To get a better understanding of how these new multi-targeting features work , let ’s create a new ASP .
NET Web Application using VS 2010 .
To - do this we can use the “ File - > New Project ” menu command to bring up the “ New Project ” dialog .
We ’ll use the version drop - down at the top of the dialog to filter the project templates to only show those supported with .
NET 2.0 .
We ’ll then create a new ASP .
NET 2.0 web application project :
Because we are targeting .
NET 2.0 with this project , VS 2010 will automatically filter the toolbox and markup intellisense to only allow us to use those controls that shipped in ASP .
NET 2.0 .
Unlike VS 2008 , the VS 2010 property grid now automatically filters to only show those properties that were supported on the ASP .
NET 2.0 button control :
When writing code , VS 2010 will also now only show code intellisense for those types and methods / properties / events supported with .
NET 2.0 .
Below you can see intellisense for the ASP .
NET 2.0 “ Response ” object when we type “ Response. Re ” :
When we run the application using the built - in VS web - server , it will run using the ASP .
NET 2.0 version ( and the VS 2010 debugger will debug the CLR 2.0 process ) :
Moving a Project from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.0
We can optionally retarget our project to work with a later version of .NET by right - clicking on the project within the solution explorer and by bringing up its properties dialog .
We can select the “ target framework ” dropdown within it and select the version of the .NET Framework we want to target :
We can choose from a variety of different .NET versions above .
Included in the list is the " Server Core ” profile that supports the GUI - less version of Windows Server 2008 R2 – and which does not support certain APIs .
Because the reference assemblies we use for metadata and intellisense can support any version or release , we ’ll even be able to distribute versions of them with future service packs if they introduce any new APIs ( enabling 100 % accuracy ) .
For this walkthrough , we ’ll choose to move the project to use .
NET 4.0 .
When we do this , VS 2010 will automatically update the project reference assemblies and the web.config file of our project to properly reflect the new version .
Once we do this , VS 2010 will filter the toolbox and markup intellisense to show us all of the new controls and properties available in the ASP .
NET 4.0 version .
For example , the property grid below now displays the new “ ClientIDMode ” property available on all controls in ASP .
NET 4.0 - which gives you the ability to control how client id ’s are output and avoid ugly client ids ( a new ASP .
NET 4.0 feature I ’ll cover in a later blog post ) :
Now that we ’ve upgraded the project to use .
NET 4.0 , VS 2010 will also now show us code intellisense for the new types and methods / properties / events on types in .NET 4.0 .
For example , below you can see some of the new redirect methods available on the ASP .
NET 4.0 “ Response ” object ( which previously did not show up when the project was targeting . NET 2.0 ) :
The new Response. RedirectPermanent ( ) method above makes it easy to issue “ HTTP 301 Moved ” responses – which can avoid your site accumulating stale links in search engines .
The URL Routing engine is now supported by both ASP .
NET Web Forms and ASP.
NET MVC based applications , and the new Response .
RedirectToRoute ( ) method allows you to easily redirect to a route declared with it .
And lastly when we run the application using the built - in VS web - server , VS 2010 will now run it using the ASP .
NET 4.0 version :
Summary
VS 2010 ’s multi-targeting support enables you to work on projects that target .NET 4.0 , .NET 3.5 , .NET 3.0 and .NET 2.0 .
It will allow you to start taking advantage of the new tooling features , without having to immediately upgrade the clients and servers running your application ’s to .NET 4.0 .
The improved multi-targeting support will ensure that this experience is even better and more accurate than before .
Hope this helps ,

Ever taken your car or motorcycle for a spin and pretended that you ’re Batman , racing through the dark streets of Gotham to release your anger by beating petty criminals to pulp ?
Then we may be able to interest you in the Dark Knight Leather Motorcycle Suit , an officially licensed replica of Batman ’s S&M getup from the last two movies .
This suit is tailor - made for our own Brian X. Chen , who splits his days equally between personality - building activities : Kittens ( shows sensitive side ) , work ( what better place to practise your Twittering skills ? ) and searching the internet for leather biker boots ( [ redacted ] ) .
Chen would appreciate the cordura and spandex base , the removable body - armor and the molded leather and Kevlar sections .
And it is n’t just the kinky boots he so craves : the suit is made up of jacket , pants , boots and gloves .
The suit is n’t on sale yet , but you can be it will be rather costly .
Hopefully Brian will have some cash left over for a pointy - eared helmet and a nerdy utility belt .

Imagine a time when the entire universe froze .
According to a new model for dark energy , that is essentially what happened about 11.5 billion years ago , when the universe was a quarter of the size it is today .
The model , published online May 6 in the journal Physical Review D , was developed by Research Associate Sourish Dutta and Professor of Physics Robert Scherrer at Vanderbilt University , working with Professor of Physics Stephen Hsu and graduate student David Reeb at the University of Oregon .
A cosmological phase transition — similar to freezing — is one of the distinctive aspects of this latest effort to account for dark energy — the mysterious negative force that cosmologists now think makes up more than 70 percent of all the energy and matter in the universe and is pushing the universe apart at an ever - faster rate .
Another feature that distinguishes the new formulation is that it makes a testable prediction regarding the expansion rate of the universe .
In addition , the micro-explosions created by the largest particle colliders should excite the dark energy field and these excitations could appear as exotic , never - seen - before sub-atomic particles .
" One of the things that is very unsatisfying about many of the existing explanations for dark energy is that they are difficult to test , ” says Scherrer , " We designed a model that can interact with normal matter and so has observable consequences . ”
The model associates dark energy with something called vacuum energy .
Like a number of existing theories , it proposes that space itself is the source of the repulsive energy that is pushing the universe apart .
For many years , scientists thought that the energy of empty space averaged zero .
But the discovery of quantum mechanics changed this view .
According to quantum theory , empty space is filled with pairs of " virtual ” particles that spontaneously pop into and out of existence too quickly to be detected .

This sub-atomic activity is a logical source for dark energy because both are spread uniformly throughout space .
This distribution is consistent with evidence that the average density of dark energy has remained constant as the universe has expanded .
This characteristic is in direct contrast to ordinary matter and energy , which become increasingly dilute as the universe inflates .
The theory is one of those that attribute dark energy to an entirely new field dubbed quintessence .
Quintessence is comparable to other basic fields like gravity and electromagnetism , but has some unique properties .
For one thing , it is the same strength throughout the universe .
Another important feature is that it acts like an antigravity agent , causing objects to move away from each other instead of pulling them together like gravity .
In its simplest form , the strength of the quintessence field remains constant through time .
In this case it plays the role of the cosmological constant , a term that Albert Einstein added to the theory of general relativity to keep the universe from contracting under the force of gravity .
When evidence that the universe is expanding came in , Einstein dropped the term since an expanding universe is a solution to the equations of general relativity .
Then , in the late 90's , studies of supernovae ( spectacular stellar explosions so powerful that they can briefly outshine entire galaxies consisting of millions of stars ) indicated that the universe is not just expanding but also that the rate of expansion is speeding up instead of slowing down as scientists had expected .
That threw cosmologists for a loop since they thought gravity was the only long - range force acting between astronomical objects .
So they had no idea what could possibly be pushing everything apart .
The simplest way to account for this bizarre phenomenon was to bring back Einstein 's cosmological constant with its antigravity properties .
Unfortunately , this explanation suffers from some severe drawbacks so physicists have been actively searching for other antigravity agents .
These antigravity agents ( dubbed " dark energy models ” in the technical literature ) usually invoke quintessence or even more exotic fields .
Because none of these fields have been detected in nature ; however , their proponents generally assume that they do not interact significantly with ordinary matter and radiation .
One of the consequences of allowing quintessence to interact with ordinary matter is the likelihood that the field went through a phase transition — froze out — when the universe cooled down to a temperature that it reached 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang .
As a result , the energy density of the quintessence field would have remained at a relatively high level until the phase transition when it abruptly dropped to a significantly lower level where it has remained ever since .
This transition would have released a fraction of the dark energy held in the field in the form of dark radiation .
According to the model , this dark radiation is much different than light , radio waves , microwaves and other types of ordinary radiation :
It is completely undetectable by any instrument known to man .
However , nature provides a detection method .
According to Einstein 's theory of general relativity , gravity is produced by the distribution of energy and momentum .
So the changes in net energy and momentum caused by the sudden introduction of dark radiation should have affected the gravitational field of the universe in a way that has slowed its expansion in a characteristic fashion .
In the next 10 years or so , the large astronomical surveys that are just starting up to plot the expansion of the universe by measuring the brightness of the most distant supernovas should be able to detect the slowdown in the expansion rate that the model predicts .
At the same time , new particle accelerators , like the Large Hadron Collider nearing operation in Switzerland , can produce energies theoretically large enough to excite the quintessence field and these excitations could appear as new exotic particles , the researchers say .
The research was funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy .
* China lets state firms default on derivative contracts - report
* US soy , gold and cotton pressured by report
* Lawyers doubt legal standing of the move
* Market suspects more potential losses prompt the move
* Foreign banks dismayed ( Updates with US gold , soy and cotton markets weighed down by reported move ; adds analyst quotes , adds CHICAGO to dateline )
By Eadie Chen and Chen Aizhu
BEIJING / CHICAGO , Aug 31 ( Reuters ) - U.S. gold and soybean markets fell on Monday following a weekend report that China ’s state companies may default on commodity derivative contracts with banks providing over - the - counter hedging services .
Traders in other commodities markets in the United States were cautious , underscoring China ’s predominance as a buyer in global markets from metals to grain to oil after it played a key role in rallying prices to record highs last year .
In a measure of the country 's influence over the global economy , U.S. stocks fell after the Shanghai Composite index .
SSEC fell nearly 7 percent to a three - month low on fears Beijing is trying to moderate growth and choke off speculation in its stock market by tightening bank lending .
Commodities markets were chilled by a report in Caijing magazine quoting an unnamed industry source as saying Chinese state - owned companies will be allowed to default on commodity derivative contracts .
The report provoked anger and dismay among investment banks that feared a damaging precedent .
China ’s regulator of state owned enterprises , the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission ( SASAC ) , has told six foreign banks that SOEs reserved the right to default on contracts , the magazine said in an article published on Saturday .
A government official said that the Bureau of Financial Supervision and Evaluation under SASAC was handling the issue .
The official declined to be named and did not elaborate .
“ A Chinese agency said they reserve the right to walk away from bad derivatives contracts and that stirred up a lot of worry not only about the stock market but soybeans as well , ” said Paul Haugens , vice president at Newedge USA .
China , the world ’s top importer of soybeans , has been an aggressive buyer of U.S. supplies , helping drive prices higher as stockpiles fell to the lowest level in over three decades .
US SOY , GOLD MARKETS FALL , COTTON RECOVERS
Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures for November delivery SX9 fell 31 - 1/2 cents , or 3 percent , to $ 9.79 - 1/2 .
December gold GCZ9 fell $ 5.30 to $ 953.50 an ounce at the New York Mercantile Exchange 's COMEX division .
U.S. cotton futures fell in early trading due to the news , but closed higher on month - end position squaring .
“ Historically , it is not so unusual for China to either renegotiate or abandon some deals that have been made .
Some traders who have been around for a while are certainly aware of that possibility , ” said Bill O’Neill , managing partner at New Jersey - based LOGIC Advisors .
Spokespersons at Goldman Sachs GS.N , UBS UBSN.VX , JPMorgan JPM.N and Morgan Stanley declined to comment , along with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc .
The reported letter to the six banks follows an order from SASAC in July that required all state companies trading in derivatives to make quarterly reports about their investments , including details of holdings and performance .
“ I wo n’t be surprised if more state firms emerged with big derivatives trading losses .
Or else SASAC wo n’t come out with such a radical move , ” a Hong Kong - based derivatives analyst said .
“ As far as I know , there are another number of state firms bogged down in such losses besides those surfaced ones , ” said the analyst , who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue .
‘ ABNORMAL PRACTICE ’
A SASAC media official said he was waiting for the “ relevant department ’s ” official comment before clarifying the situation with the media .
The report deals another blow to investment banks hoping to sell more derivatives hedges in China , the world ’s fastest - expanding major economy and top commodities consumer .
“ It ’s a handful of companies who are being encouraged by regulators to renegotiate .
It ’s outrageous , but it ’s China so everyone is treading very carefully , ” said a banking source .
Beijing - based derivatives lawyers said the so - called “ legal letter ” has no legal standing -- SASAC as a shareholder of SOEs has no business relationship with international banks .
“ This can also lead to market chaos .
For example , a foreign bank can tell its Chinese clients that it can reserve the right to default on contracts that will bring losses to the bank , ” said a lawyer from the derivatives risks committee of the Beijing Lawyers Association .
No bank names were reported in the Caijing report .
The SASAC media officer also declined to specify any .
Chinese state firms , especially those that have suffered big losses in derivatives trading , have been complaining that their foreign banks sometimes did not disclose full information of potential risks when selling them complicated products .

The boss says , " Our VP of Sales asks that you answer customer questions through the sales reps , not directly . "

The boss says , " Why are you like this ? "
DIlbert says , " Should I tell you or the sales reps ? "
The alarm has been sounded .
Politicians , pharmaceutical executives and media conglomerates would have us believe that a 1918 - style pandemic is a real threat .
The 1918 pandemic , however , evolved out of conditions unique to World War I , for four specific reasons .
Why 2009 Is Not 1918
First , World War I was characterized by millions of troops living in waterlogged trenches along the Western Front .
This war zone became fertile ground for an opportunistic virus , as medical literature reveals :
" … a landscape that was contaminated with respiratory irritants such as chlorine and phosgene , and characterized by stress and overcrowding , the partial starvation in civilians , and the opportunity for rapid u2018 passage ' of influenza in young soldiers would have provided the opportunity for multiple but small mutational charges throughout the viral genome . "
1
Second , the war witnessed the growth of industrial - scale military camps and embarkation ports , such as Etaples in France , enabling the flu virus to enter into another phase of accelerated mutation .
On any given day , Etaples was a makeshift city of 100,000 troops from around the British Empire and its former dominions .
These soldiers concentrated into unsanitary barracks , tents and mess halls .
Today , many cities and nations have dense concentrations of people ; none of these , however , are geographically isolated under the conditions of trench warfare and World War I - style deployments .
Of course , there are smaller , sub-populations of people in prisons ( prone to multi- drug resistant tuberculosis ) , in military barracks ( prone to respiratory pathogens and meningococcal infections ) and on cruise ships ( prone to the Norovirus ) — all proof of the connection between human confinement on the one hand and infectious disease on the other .
Third , after the war , ships such as the USS Alaskan became floating Petri dishes .
Thousands of soldiers were packed like sardines for the long voyage home , allowing the virus to reverberate within hermetically - sealed units .
Fourth , returning troops were stuffed into boxcars for the train trip back to military bases , where they infected new recruits .
Later , it was documented that Army regiments whose barracks allowed only 45 square feet per soldier had a flu incidence up to ten times that of regiments afforded 78 square feet per man .

The 1918 flu virus became pandemic because , during World War I , the normal host - pathogen relationship was abandoned when millions of young men crowded into geographical confinement .
In World War I , a flu virus was presented with a seemingly limitless number of hosts — almost all young , male , and with compromised immune systems .
Unconstrained and unchecked by the usual habits of human behavior , the virus went rogue .
Flu viruses are smart , but they are not suicidal : if the host becomes extinct the virus will become extinct too .
The evolutionary strategy , from the virus 's perspective , is to stay one step ahead of the immune systems of both humans and animals — but not two steps ahead .
The flu virus aims to infect and reproduce without killing a critical mass of the hosts , of the herd , so the virus 's virulence is ameliorated after it becomes fatal for people on the margins of the host population — the weak and the elderly .
World War I disrupted this synchronized , co-evolutionary relationship between flu viruses and human populations .
No flu since 1918 has been strong enough to produce , in millions of people , a " cytokine storm , " which is an immunological over - reaction leading to pulmonary edema ( the lungs filling with fluid )  the curse of those with the strongest immune systems , normally between 20 and 40 years of age .
In normal flu pandemics , even in severe ones , the flu virus kills a portion of the weak and elderly .
This appears to be the case in 1837 for Germany and in 1890 for Russia , though reliable medical evidence is scarce .
It was certainly true for the Asian flu of 1957 and the Hong Kong flu of 1968 , neither of which were significantly fatal for young adults .
The flu 1976 – 1977 has been exposed as a boondoggle , a fraud , with far more people dying of the vaccine than from the flu itself .
Indeed , 1918 was an aberration .
Since then , no flu has scythed away so many people : some 500,000 Americans and anywhere between 25 – 50 million people worldwide in three waves : first in March , then in August ( the deadliest wave ) , and in then again in November of 1918 , lasting into the spring of 1919 .
The origins of the 1918 pandemic can be traced back to the trenches of the Western Front in 1915 , 1916 , and 1917 — to the world 's first large - scale industrial and international war .
There was no other cause :
If WWI had not been fought , it is inconceivable that the 1918 flu pandemic would have been so severe .
Today , in 2009 , absent the conditions of WWI , it is preposterous for political and medical authorities to claim that the swine flu is a menace to society .
The Mysterious Origins of the H1N1 " Swine Flu " Virus
If the current H1N1 swine flu virus does become abnormally lethal , there would be three leading explanations : first , that the virus was accidentally released , or escaped , from a laboratory ; second , that a disgruntled lab employee unleashed the virus ( as happened , according to the official version of events , with the 2001 anthrax attack ) ; or third , that a group , corporation or government agency intentionally released the virus in the interests of profit and power .
Each of the three scenarios represents a plausible explanation should the swine virus become lethal .
After all , the 1918 flu virus was dead and buried — until , that is , scientists unearthed a lead coffin to obtain a biopsy of the corpse it contained .
Later , researchers similarly disturbed an Inuit woman buried under permafrost .
3
The US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , with a scientist from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine , then began to reconstruct the 1918 Spanish flu .
Had Iran or North Korea engaged in Frankenstein experiments ( complete with ransacking graves ) to reverse engineer the 1918 virus the US and the UK would have gone ballistic at the UN Security Council .
Interestingly , numerous doctors and scientists suspect that the swine flu virus was cultured in a laboratory .
A mainstream Australian virologist , Adrian Gibbs  who was one of the first to analyze the genetic properties of the 2009 swine flu — believes that scientists accidentally created the H1N1 virus while producing vaccines .
And Dr. John Carlo , Dallas Co. Medical Director , " This strain of swine influenza that 's been cultured in a laboratory is something that 's not been seen anywhere actually in the United States and the world , so this is actually a new strain of influenza that 's been identified . "
4
Because of this , the 2009 swine flu virus — which has yet to be detected in any animals — has a rather suspicious pedigree .
The Propaganda Campaign
Across the mainstream media , reports announce one swine flu death after another ( even though ordinary flu kills about 35,000 Americans each year ) .
Upon closer scrutiny of what passes for journalism , the victims have " underlying health problems , " or " a common underlying health condition , " or " significant medical conditions . "
One news headline even blared : " Swine flu mother dies after giving birth , leaving her premature baby fighting for life , " and only later , buried deep in the story underneath , did it explain that she had " other medical problems " which included being confined to a wheelchair because of a serious car accident .
Citizens the world over are increasingly skeptical of hyped headlines followed by smaller - print caveats .
They are uneasy with the effort to create " doublethink " — a term coined by George Orwell in 1984 and a reference to holding two contradictory ideas in one 's mind simultaneously , paralyzing critical thought .
The media has never been in the habit of reporting the cases of people who , for no known reason , die of the flu .
Out of the 35,000 Americans who die each year from flu - related illnesses , some are bound to be relatively young and healthy .
It happens .
This year , however , their stories are front - page news .
More recently , news reports now claim that the H1N1 swine flu can affect people in the lungs and lead to pneumonia .
This , however , is what separates the flu from the common cold in the first place ; and this is why tens of thousands of elderly people die of flu - related symptoms each year .
Fox
News even claimed that " this one morphs and mutates and comes back in different ways … , " ( like all flu viruses ) .
In short , the media now uses the flu's own ordinary symptoms to fuel fear .
Fortunately , a growing wave of online media challenges the propaganda .
Back in 1976 , there were no rival voices , and the Center for Disease Control 's manipulative television commercials dominated the airwaves .
Fortunately , as a testament to official shamelessness , these videos are now archived and searchable on the Internet under the title of " 1976 Swine Flu Propaganda . "
Biotech Empire : The Un ... Bosworth , Dr. Andrew Best Price : $ 5.47 Buy New null ( as of 05:30 EST - Details )
Now , like then , the US government 's pandemic policy alternates between the ridiculous and the repugnant .
The government 's flu website is revealing .
First , the historical section on the 1918 virus is intellectually dishonest , making absolutely no link between the unique conditions of World War I and the flu pandemic ; instead , the site propagates the erroneous notion that this virus came out of the blue .
5
Second , the site announces an absurd American Idol - style video contest : " Create a Video About Preventing or Dealing With the Flu & Be Eligible to Win $ 2500 Cash ! "
( Congress has earmarked 8 billion dollars for swine flu prevention and can only offer $ 2,500 to the proles — or , rather , to the one prole who , rising above mediocrity , best parrots the Party Line . )
And third , the site encourages the use of Twitter to " stay informed … "
There is something mildly disturbing about the US federal government promoting Twitter as a form of resistance to foreign authoritarianism , while , simultaneously , using social networking to further federalize and protect the abuse of power at home .
1976 + 1984 = 2009
In sum , it appears that the 2009 swine flu pandemic will not be 1918 .
It might be a 1976 - style hoax , however , serving profit and power — with a bit of Orwell 's 1984 thrown in for good measure .

UPDATE : Microsoft has tackled the crack and blacklisted the leaked OEM activation product key .
In less than a week since Windows 7 was released to manufacturing , the first crack for the Ultimate edition of the latest iteration of the Windows client is already available in the wild .
The Windows 7 Build 6.1.7600.16385
Ultimate crack is capable of activating the high - end SKU of the operating system indefinitely .
The product key comes from the only source possible , an OEM , as original equipment manufacturers are the first and for the time being the last group to receive the gold bits of the operating system from Microsoft .
Together with the RTM development milestone of Windows 7 , the Redmond company has also supplied OEM partners with activation product keys , one of which was extracted from a leaked OEM image of the platform .
Reports from various forums and websites ( which I will not link to because they offer the proof - of - concept of the Windows 7 RTM Ultimate crack , along with the activation product key , which is illegal ) indicate that the cracked client can bypass Windows genuine Advantage validation with no problems whatsoever .
A Windows 7 Ultimate OEM DVD ISO from Lenovo has reportedly made the hack possible .
Leaked on a Chinese forum , complete with the download links , the ISO allowed for hackers to grab the OEM - SLP ( System - Locked Preinstallation ) product key as well as the OEM certificate for Windows 7 RTM Ultimate via boot .
wim .
The bypass designed for Windows 7 RTM involves abusing OEM activation 2.1 , and in this regard the circumventing process is nothing more than an OEM hack .
Via OEM activation 2.1 , namely SLP 2.1 , Microsoft allows OEMs to pre-activate Windows 7 for distribution preinstalled on new computers .
In this context , the activation bypass process leading to the hacked Windows 7 RTM needs to be based on a BIOS ( SLIC ) hack first of all .
The procedure is by no means new .
Hackers have managed to crack Windows Vista much in the same manner .
In fact , the Windows 7 RTM Ultimate activation crack also relies on an OEM certificate from Windows Vista in order to function .
At the time of this article hackers have made available in the wild SLIC 2.1 BIN harvested from computers on the market , as well as the genuine OEM certificate digitally signed by Microsoft , which automatically brings to the table the Private Key and the OEM Public Key as well as the OEMID ( from SLIC in BIOS ) .
Together with the leaked OEM SLP master product key Windows 7 can be hacked and the activation process bypassed .
The result is a cracked copy of Windows 7 RTM Ultimate permanently activated .
It also seems that the crack is not limited to Lenovo machines .
The activation process can also be circumvented on HP , Dell , and MSI computers according to reports .
Because of the OEM product key , the crack is limited to the Ultimate edition of Windows 7 ( useless for all other SKUs , Home Basic , Home Premium , Professional ) , but can be used on both 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions of the operating system .
In this generation of gaming consoles , it ’s common for them to be packing some serious technical power under their hood .
Such processing power generates a large amount of heat .
When putting in long hours in a serious gaming session , the risk of overheating is always a primary concern .
Third party accessory manufacturers have tried to come up with cooling solutions , such as Nyko ’s Intercooler which is available for both the PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 .
But the general consensus is that these console attachments can do more harm to your console than good , and they can be quite noisy .
We ’ve found a silent but effective alternative that can help keep your console cool , even in these hot summer months .
Whether your console is couped up in a home entertainment cabinet , or if it ’s out in the open and you just want to be cautious .
Cooler Guys have the perfect solution for next gen consoles .
Their USB powered fan with grill , is whisper quiet and is powered via your console ’s USB port .
So the fan only runs , when your console is running .
The USB cable is 20 inches long , perfect length to position behind your gaming console , or any home theater component for that matter .
Do not point the flow of the air directly at the vents of your console , so you are n’t pushing dust into your precious and expensive console .
Instead use the fan to blow warm air away from you console , not at it .
This will lower the ambient temperature around your console , and reduce the load of your console ’s internal fans , in turn keeping your console cool as can be .
Cooler Guys USB
Fan is priced at under $ 13 and at that price it ’s well worth the peace of mind , and will prevent you from having nightmares ( or realities ) of ‘ Red Rings ’ or ‘ Yellow Lights ’ of ‘ Death ’ .

14 Year Old School Girl Sent as “ Birthday Present ” to be Raped
[ wccdaily ] 14 year old school girl Sisi ’s ( not her real name ) nightmare : she was stopped by two strangers ( girls ) in front of the school and forced to be taken to a guy ’s house .
Sisi never thought the strangers ( girls ) “ gave ” her away as a “ birthday present ” to a man .
Sisi was raped .
When her parents found out about it they reported this crime to the police , finally in July of this year the criminals were brought to the court .
Yesterday , Sisi ’s parents heard the long - awaited verdict , the offenders who hurt their daughter has finally been sentenced .
“ Man was sentenced to 4 years , woman 3 years , it is too light ! ” Sisi ’ family members all feel that criminals should be punished more severely .
After some discussions , they decided to submit a complainant hoping for an appeal .
During the 145 days of waiting for the verdict , every time when Sisi ’s parents think about their daughter ’s experience , they could not help themselves but broke out and cry .
March 10 this year 6 pm in the afternoon , Sisi was going home after school but was stopped by two girls in front of the school .
One girl Xin ( not her real name ) is only 13 years old , the other , Wang is 21 years old .
They told Sisi viciously that they wanted to talk to her and asked her to follow them .
Sisi has never seen these 2 girls before , but she heard about there are people in front of the school stopping students “ asking for money ” .
She did not want trouble so she did not resist and followed them to a residential area .
She did not know and never would have thought what was waiting for her is a nightmare thousands times worse than a robbery .
That day , it is already 10 pm and their daughter still did not come home yet , her parents were worried and went looking for her everywhere ,
They heard someone saw their daughter was taken away by 2 other girls , so they called the police .
Later that night their daughter came home , dazed and expressionless .
After questioning her , parents found out what had happened .
Although Wang and Song were arrested on the next day , the parents never imagined how their daughter was victimize .
She was sent to a man as a “ birthday present ” and letting him to have sex with her .
“ She was still wearing a school uniform . ”
Her mom could not make sense of this , her daughter who just turned 14 years old , did not make trouble with anyone .
Why are these strangers targeting an innocent Jr. High school girl ?
Protecting the privacy of minors , July 21 , Wuhou city court decided on a closed trial .
Defendant Wang admitted that she received Song ’s text message asking her to bring a girl as his “ birthday present ” .
So Wang and Xin went to the front of the Jr. high school forced Sisi to Song ’s place .
Xin took her into the bathroom made her showered then sent her over to Song ’s bedroom .
Afterwards song forced her to have sex with him .
Sisi ’s mother said , they threatened her daughter in many ways , they let her “ choose ” “ have sex with one guy , or get raped by 6 men ” , “ a 14 year old little girl , she was scared to death ” Sisi ’s mom said .
August 3 , Wuhou court reached a verdict , defendant Song and Wang went against Sisi ’s will to have sexual relations with her .
Their actions constituted the crime of rape .
Song and Wang was each sentenced to 4 and 3 years in prison .
And also Xin will be tried separately as a minor .
“ Rape criminals should be sentenced to 3 - 10 years , and the victim is a 14 year old minor , the sentence was too light ! ”
Sisi ’s parents consulted statistics of rape case punishment , think criminals hurt their daughter should be punished more severely .
Sisi ’s mother saw side note on the sentence “ defendant Song ’s mother is willing to pay compensation ” .
She said “ Defendant ’s lawyer first contacted us before , saying defendant ’s family is willing to pay compensation , but not anymore . ”
But Sisi ’s family said compensation is not important , what is important is to “ sentence ( them ) more years in prison ” , because their daughter ’s personality has changed since the incident .
Her mental condition worries the entire family , her future becames something no one wants to think about .
After Sisi went through her experience , once a lively and cheerful girl now rarely speaks , even when she is speaking now her tone became very vicious and hot tempered .
The scariest thing was , Sisi has a pet dog , she loves the dog , but after the incident , when the dog wags its tails in front of her , she even kicked the dog away .
One time she even bit the dog ’s ear .
“ Only see dogs bite human , never human bites dogs ! ”
Because the incident Sisi ’s mother lost weight , her father often drink to forget .
They do not dare to send Sisi to the hospital because every time when it is mentioned , she will “ go crazy ” .
“ In order to do justice to our daughter , we have to appeal ” Sisi ’s parents started to contact a lawyer after the verdict , although they do not know whether the appeals will hold , they are still trying persistently .

BALTIMORE – A white supremacist accused of beating a 76 - year - old black man has a tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his stomach with the words “ He Lives ” beneath it , and uses the Nazi dictator ’s last name as a nickname , according to police and court documents .
Calvin E. Lockner , 28 , was ordered held without bail Wednesday morning .
He ’s been charged with a long list of crimes including attempted murder , carjacking and assault , and prosecutors can seek tougher penalties under Maryland ’s hate crime law .
Lockner told police that the attack early Tuesday on James A. Privott , who had been fishing with his wife in a city park beneath the Francis Scott Key Bridge , “ would n’t have happened if he was a white man , ” court documents show .
Lockner , a convicted sex offender , has other racist tattoos and told police he was a member of two white supremacist groups , including the notorious prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood .
When Lockner was taken into custody , he said , “ I ’m sorry I did it , ” the documents show .
Lockner and two other white men shouted racial slurs as they kicked Privott to the ground , punched him in the face and hit him with a baseball bat , the documents show .
The men stole $ 19 from Privott ’s wallet and drove off in his sport utility vehicle , which was equipped with a theft - monitoring device .
Police tracked down the vehicle , which overturned and crashed after the driver fled .
The men ran off , but officers found Lockner with the help of a witness , police said .
Lockner will be represented by a public defender but has not yet been assigned one , a Maryland Public Defender ’s Office spokeswoman said .
Police had not yet found the two other suspects Wednesday afternoon .
Privott ( pronounced pruh- VAHT ’) , of suburban Windsor Mill , suffered serious head trauma and lost two teeth and may also have broken an eye socket bone .
He was in fair condition Wednesday at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center , a spokeswoman said .
His wife was not injured .
Privott ’s stepdaughter said he was doing OK and that police had asked the family not to speak to reporters during the investigation .
Baltimore is about two - thirds black , and police monitor the city ’s active white supremacists , Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III said .
Many are affiliated with a white prison gang called Dead Man Inc. , although Lockner was not part of that gang , police said .
“ Baltimore ’s a big city , ” Bealefeld said .
“ Just as assuredly as we have Bloods and Crips , we have DMI and we have Aryan Nation and we have outlaw motorcycle gangs and we have MS - 13 . ”
Mayor Sheila Dixon said she met with Privott in the hospital Tuesday , and he told her about good fishing spots around the city and suggested the park he was attacked in may need better lighting and security .
“ People should have the right to go out … fishing , relaxing , in a great park in the city , ” Dixon said .
“ His family is understandably shaken from this and by the violence and what was said to him and what was done to him . ”

Italy is the latest country to accept Guantanamo detainees Italy has agreed to take three detainees from the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , US President Barack Obama has said .
He announced the agreement after talks on Monday with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at the White House .
The US wants other countries to accept Guantanamo detainees so the camp can be closed down , as Mr Obama has pledged .
The European Union earlier endorsed a deal with Washington to transfer some inmates to Europe .
" I ... thanked the prime minister for his support of our policy of closing Guantanamo , " Mr Obama said after meeting Mr Berlusconi .
" This is not just talk .
Italy has agreed to accept three specific detainees . "
The identities of the prisoners have not been disclosed .
Guantanamo
Bay officials have been attempting to fulfil Mr Obama 's order to close the detention facility by early next year .
Last week , the US relocated nine detainees from the camp , transferring three to Saudi Arabia , four to Bermuda , one to Iraq and another to Chad .
Correspondents say officials are having difficulty finding governments willing to accept the remaining detainees , while at home they face stiff resistance to the idea of Guantanamo detainees being transferred to US soil .
Persecution fears
Some 220 detainees are still being held at the US camp in Cuba , many without charge .
About 50 fall into the category of detainees who are cleared for release without trial , but are deemed to be at risk of mistreatment if sent back to their home country .
The joint EU - US declaration on Monday said the decision whether to accept former Guantanamo inmates " remains the exclusive competence of the individual [ EU ] member states " .
" By supporting the US determination to shut down Guantanamo , the EU hopes to contribute to changing US policies and help the United States turn the page , " the Czech presidency of the EU said .
The resettlement of Guantanamo detainees remains controversial because of the EU's Schengen open borders policy , meaning former prisoners would be free to travel inside most of the EU .
Under the agreement , the US " will share with the EU member states the available information relevant to ex-detainees received on the territory of the EU member states and Schengen Area " .
The US also pledged to consider , on a case - by - case basis , contributing to the costs of resettlement .
Besides Italy , several EU member states have voiced willingness to accept ex-Guantanamo detainees , including France , the Irish Republic , Portugal and Spain .
The UK has already taken in 14 former inmates .
Several have also been accepted by Belgium , France , Sweden and Albania , which is not in the EU .
The tiny Pacific nation of Palau has agreed to accept 13 Muslim Uighurs from Guantanamo , who fear persecution if they return to China .

COLLEGE PARK , Md. 
The power drink of the moment costs 20 times as much per ounce as Coca - Cola , comes in a tiny bottle and tastes so bad that most people hold their noses and down it in a single gulp .
Despite all that , sales of “ energy shots ” are soaring in the middle of a recession .
The two - ounce drinks , which give people a concentrated dose of caffeine , B vitamins and amino acids , were all but unheard - of four years ago .
Today they are the hottest drink category in the country , with sales expected to almost double this year from last , to about $ 700 million .
The shots are meant for people who want a jolt of caffeine without having to drink a big cup of coffee or one of the 16 - ounce energy drinks that have become ubiquitous .
They go down fast , more like medicine than a beverage .
That is part of the appeal to their most devoted consumers : students cramming for exams or partying into the night , construction workers looking for a lift and drivers trying to stay awake .
Near the University of Maryland the other day , students thought nothing of paying $ 3 or more for a shot .
That is $ 1.50 an ounce ; at that price , a 20 - ounce bottle of Coca - Cola would sell for $ 30 .
Ani DiFranco‘s Red Letter Year begins with a psychedelic New Year ’s
Eve party and ends with one of the loosest and liveliest New Orleans jam sessions you ’ll ever hear .
In - between , the prolific musician - activist muses on current events , love , insecurity , and her new role as parent amid arguably the most beautiful and sophisticated arrangements of her career .
When we spoke recently , DiFranco was in her New Orleans studio , getting ready to get ready to hit the road again , beginning with a Saturday solo slot at this weekend ’s moe . down festival .
Until then , she ’s busily been working on new albums by self - described “ cosmic tranny ” Animal Prufrock and folksinger Anais Mitchell while juggling the dual responsibilities of work and motherhood , pretty much like every other contemporary parent .
What ’s going on down there ?
I ’ve been buried in these records .
I should be getting ready for my tour .
I ’m coming off of my summer vacation .
We spent a month at my mom ’s place in Quebec , on a lake without electricity or running water .
I find that a month is plenty long enough to forget everything you know .
Who ’s in your band these days ?
Todd Sickafoose , my left - hand man , and Andy Borger , a new drummer I ’ve never met .
Can you believe it ?
It ’s like an arranged marriage .
In a week or so we ’ll rehearse for a couple of days and – bam !
– we ’ll take a mystery journey onstage .
Todd has an FK1 , a little tiny keyboard that makes atmospheric sounds , and we ’ve been traveling with a Wurlitzer , too , so he ’ll jump over to that .
But our relationship with this drummer will be a tabula rasa , so I do n’t know what we ’ll be doing this tour .
We ’ll just be making it up .
Have you played moe. down before ?
Yeah , I played at the very first one ten years ago .
This year I ’m playing solo , by the way .
Do you do anything different at festivals as opposed to audiences of dedicated Ani DiFranco fans ?
Yeah , sure .
When I ’m playing to my own audience , I can assume certain things .
And when I ’m playing to a general audience , I try not to assume anything about who I ’m talking to or what their political sensibility is .
And generally , when you ’re outside in the elements , keeping people rocking is just the best thing to do .
It ’s hard to do anything very subtle outside , with other stages bleeding into yours , and people drinking and getting sunstroke .
It ’s not conducive to the sort of real finite focus you can get in a theater setting , so the setlist adjusts accordingly .
You ’re there for the party .
I definitely do n’t water down my politics , though , because I do n’t believe in that .
Whatever you say with an open heart and inclusive motivation is cool .
And it ’s amazing what people will listen to and take in if you come with the right vibe .
There may be a slight shift in the way I introduce a song or in the flow of a set .
Since you moved to New Orleans , have you become involved in local issues apart from writing songs like “ Red Letter Year ” ?
I ’m a person who ’s really not home enough to build community in any one place .
My community and the people I work with are international .
The work I do is n’t so much based in where I live because I do n’t really live anywhere .
What nonmusical things are you most involved with these days , politically or otherwise ?
“ Politically ? ” I was going to say my two - and - a - half - year - old .
She ’s very expressive .
She does n’t hide her fuck - off feelings and will deliver them to anybody , from her dearest comrades to a stranger on the street .
Lately I ’ve felt like I ’ve been on full - time damage control .
“ She does n’t really mean anything by that screech in your face .
We ’ll just be leaving now . ”
I have a nanny , of course , so I can walk onstage and she does n’t walk into traffic while I ’m there .
As you can imagine , as soon as I get offstage I ’m Mom again .
There ’s very little time in my life for anything extracurricular – even songwriting .
I feel as though I have just enough energy and leeway to play shows ; to stay on the hamster wheel of my work , which is performing and interviewing and these album projects I ’m involved with .
But to write a song ?
That is so far down the list – past laundry and sleep – that I hardly ever get there .
It ’s a little excruciating , but I ’m also very grateful for this journey and mothering job .
It ’s also a ton of fun , and I know I ’ll get back to having more time for my work and other interests soon enough .
How is Barack Obama ’s presidency working for you – or not – so far ?
I lean toward empathy with the man .
I relate to him .
I have immense respect for him .
I relate to him in the sense of where he comes from .
He ’s an activist who ’s so smart that he got elected president .
He ’s smarter than me , which I love in a president .
So I look at him with unending gratitude and respect that he managed to do that .
We have so many opportunities as citizens with him there .
He ’s an enabler .
I like to think of all of the work he will enable us to do .
That being said , of course , he ’s only one man , and I could n’t begin to fathom the oppressive pressures of his position .
I hope the current health - care bill does not pass because it ’s too compromised .
It ’s bullshit at this point .
This public - private combination sounds very threatening to me : one system for the poor , one system for the rich .
This is not the spirit he set out with or the change we need .
I ’m afraid it will be a failure the conservatives and Republicans can use to get elected in the near future .
I wish Obama was sitting more in his own immense power .
He ’s a powerful teacher .
I ache for him to really stand in his own power and say , “ What ’s wrong with socialism ?
Ca n’t we move beyond the Cold War , people ?
Has capitalism served us so much better ?
Ca n’t we look to the examples of socialized medicine in Europe and Canada and recognize that this is not evil we ’re talking about . ”
I ’m saddened by this little spiral we ’ve gotten into .
I want him to get back up on that ever - inspirational horse we know he has out in the barn .
But being a public person myself , I ’ve become aware over the years of how much people look to their heroes to fix everything .
Even just standing onstage and hearing , “ Ani !
Tell them to sit down . ”
It ’s like , “ What ?
You ’re right next to them .
Why me ? ”
All the calls that come in from whatever activist organization : “ Ani , if you could just do a benefit , if you could wave your wand , you could fix this . ”
Well , not really .
So I stop short of feeling disillusioned with him because I really feel we need to look around at all the rest of us .
What are we doing to help this debate stay on track ?
He ’s only one man .

HERE’S an unlikely pairing : Susan Hill and H.P. Lovecraft .
Hill is a successful mystery writer living in England who also owns a small publishing house .
A writer noted for her psychological detective stories -- “ The Risk of Darkness , ” featuring inspector Simon Serrailler , will be published next month -- she seems the model of that writer who has a serene , bookish , rustic life ( she and her Shakespeare scholar husband live in the North Cotswold countryside ) while her prose is full of violent , unsettled passions and disturbing situations .
Lovecraft lived a seemingly quiet life as well , saving his energies for the fledgling weird genre , and died at 46 , in 1937 , after eking out a living as a writer .
He built a reputation on some very long stories , but no novel .
He has inspired others to finish projects of his or else to continue the cosmic vision of his “ Cthulhu ” stories with a franchise that increases today .
And yet , and yet .
Affinities abound between these two very different writers .
In Hill ’s recent “ The Man in the Picture ” ( Overlook Press : 146 pp. , $ 15 ) and a reissue of Lovecraft ’s ( with August Derleth ) “ The Watchers Out of Time ” ( Del Rey : 292 pp. , $ 14 paper ) , one ca n’t help noticing their common interest in paintings and windows as menacing doorways into chilling otherworlds .
Advertisement
Hill ’s novel begins where supernatural stories often start : before a blazing fire .
The aged Theo Parmitter , a university don , tells a story to a young student , Oliver , about how he acquired an enigmatic painting .
The painting , which hangs in the gloom behind them , presents a scene of a Venetian crowd celebrating Carnival .
At first , Oliver believes the painting , like many strange artifacts one might find in a bachelor don’s offices , is just an example of Theo ’s esoteric obsession with priceless things off the beaten path -- “ strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price , ” as Ezra Pound called them .
That is certainly true , but there is something else about the painting -- there ’s a moodiness to the Venetian scene that makes Oliver uneasy .
There is much more to this “ moodiness ” than Oliver , or the reader , realizes .
Much more .
Years before , Theo met the Countess of Hawdon , the original owner , and he tells Oliver how that meeting included this bizarre moment :
“ There was , you remember , one particular scene within the scene .
A young man was being held by the arm and threatened by another person , on the point of stepping into one of the boats , and his head was turned to look into the eyes of whoever was viewing the picture , with an expression of strange , desperate terror and of pleading .
. . .
The face of the young man being persuaded into the boat was the face of the Countess ’s husband .
There was no doubt about it .
The resemblance was absolute .
. . .
Advertisement
“ She was staring at me intently .
“ ‘ My God , ’ I whispered .
But I struggled for words , tried to grab hold of sanity .
There was , of course , a sensible , an ordinary , a rational explanation .
“ ‘ So your husband was a sitter for the artist . ’
As I said it , I knew how ridiculous it was .
“ ‘ The picture was painted in the late eighteenth century . ’
Advertisement
“ ‘ Then -- this is a relative ?
One you perhaps have only just discovered ?
This is an extraordinary family likeness . ’
“ ‘ No .
It is my husband .
It is Lawrence . ’
“ ‘ Then I do not understand . ’ ”
The painting , we learn , is cursed by an Italian woman whom Lawrence spurned -- it is a curse that leads any male involved with the painting to a similarly strange , shadowy fate .
They vanish without a trace -- except , of course , within the painting , which somehow adjusts the scene to include their images .
When the Countess and Lawrence were on honeymoon , she tells Theo , he vanished in that manner .
The Venice police said that he most likely fell into a canal , which is why his body is n’t found at first -- though perhaps , they said , it would wash up eventually .
Advertisement
But , the Countess explains , she knew better than that .
When the Venetian waters failed to produce her husband ’s corpse , she rushed home to their English estate and eventually approached a locked room to which she possessed the only key :
“ I reached the door of the small sitting room and turned the key .
. . . [ W ] hen I found the switch , the two lamps , with their thin light , came on and then I saw the picture again .
And as I saw it , I realized that in the mustiness I could smell something else , a hint of something sharp and very distinctive .
It took me a second or two to work out that it was paint , fresh oil paint .
I looked around everywhere .
Perhaps this room was used after all , perhaps one of the servants had been here to repair or repaint something , though I could see no sign of it .
Nor were there any painting materials or brushes lying about . ”
Then , she makes her terrifying discovery .
Hill ’s story is a clear descendant of Henry James ’ ghost stories and their familiar elements -- the narrator with an odd tale to tell , the English infatuation with Italy , even the hearth fire -- without feeling derivative ; and the use of so many hoary , gothic cliches ( a hidden painting whose image alters under a supernatural hand ) is a cross between “ Dorian Gray ” and “ The Twilight Zone . ”
Advertisement
And yet the terrain feels fresh and all Hill ’s own .
The narrative moves nimbly along , the prose is economical but lush when required -- small details are like buds along an otherwise bare branch of prose :
“ It was a still , clear and bitter night with a frost and a sky thick and brilliant with stars and I went quickly across to my own staircase to fetch my coat .
It was late but I felt like fresh air and a brisk walk .
The court was deserted and there were only one or two lights shining out from sets of rooms here and there .
The night porter was already installed in his lodge with a fire in the grate and a great brown pot of tea .
Advertisement
“ ‘ You mind your step , sir , the pavements have a rime on them even now . ’ ”
The brown pot , the rime of frost -- such lovely touches .
From the onset , Hill ’s word choice conveys that the painting is more than an object of art .
“ Every time I came back into these rooms , it drew me , ” Oliver says early in the story .
“ I spent more time looking at it -- no , into it -- than I did with pictures of far greater beauty and merit . ”
“ Into it ” -- the picture , then , is a portal , an entry point of some kind .
Think of Alice ’s looking - glass , the mirror in which Borges said creatures dwell or , even , that computer screen you are now sitting before .
There is a reality on the other side of what you see that invites participation .
The Internet is built on that concept -- so is the supernatural .

AT HIS DEATH , Lovecraft left behind stories and sketches of potential stories , many of which August Derleth picked up and finished .
In the collection “ The Watchers Out of Time , ” the story “ The Gable Window ” employs a familiar conceit : A stranger stumbles upon the arcane research of someone who either died or mysteriously vanished .
Gradually , the stranger reconstructs that research until it explains , with horrifying clarity , what happened to the other person .
In this story ’s case , the unnamed narrator moves into the New England home of Wilbur , his deceased cousin , a “ student of archeology and anthropology ” who spent years traveling in Mongolia , Tibet , Central America and many other places wild and strange , where civilization held on by its fingertips .
At his death , Wilbur left behind an old house cluttered with journals and arcane books that the narrator sets to organizing .
Despite the strangeness of these tomes -- bearing titles such as “ Cultes des Goules ” and “ Necronomicon ” -- the greater object of mystery here is , not a painting , but a window whose design runs counter to the house ’s architectural style and to the alterations Wilbur made :
" [ T ] here was one change which had baffled me at the time that Wilbur had made it , and for which he never offered any explanation ; this was the installation in the south wall of his gable room of a great round window of a most curious clouded glass , of which he said only that it was a work of great antiquity , which he had discovered and acquired in the course of his travels in Asia . ”
At night , after a day ’s labor of organizing Wilbur ’s work , the narrator hears sounds of animal activity , even though all is quiet outside in the still , cold New England landscape .
He hears “ hoof beats , or the tramping of some gigantic animal , or the twittering of birds . . . or the slithering of some vast body . ”
Search as he might with a flashlight , however , he ca n’t locate their source .
This being Lovecraft ( or Lovecraft - Derleth ) , however , that early tip - off about the strange , cloudy glass window makes it clear where the noises are probably coming from .
Advertisement
Soon , the narrator learns through Wilbur ’s papers that making occult markings on the floor before this window and then uttering bizarre incantations turns it into a doorway onto another world .
When he pronounces a spell that reads like garble -- except for the words “ Cthulhu ” and “ R’lyeh , ” which are familiar to any Lovecraft fan -- the window ’s appearance changes :
“ Instantly a most extraordinary phenomenon took place .
I was seated , facing the round window of clouded glass in the south wall , so that I saw everything that happened .
The cloudiness vanished from the glass , and I found myself , to my astonishment , looking upon a sunbaked landscape .
. . . "
The narrator is fascinated .
He returns to the window several times to “ reopen ” this view , and each time he sees different things -- deserts , caves , outer space and ugly creatures that , he realizes with terror , can also see him .
READING
Hill ’s and Lovecraft ’s stories calls to mind another author , Victor Pelevin , whose “ The Helmet of Horror ” ( Canongate : 288 pp. , $ 13 paper ) retells the Minotaur myth by replacing the Cretan labyrinth with an Internet chat room .
Observers , these books warn us , are never neutral .
To be ignorant of this point puts us all in peril .
The earliest victim of that oversight was Narcissus , and an element of self - infatuation certainly plays a part in all of these ( Oliver thinks he is beyond danger , even after hearing the Countess ’ story ; Lovecraft ’s narrator is too curious to stop ; Pelevin ’s characters are naive in their attitude to the chat room ) .
There is no such thing as a passive witness .
When you surf different websites and think you are leaving as quietly as you entered , you ’re leaving a digital footprint behind that -- some marketer , or worse , may be able to find you later .

Hill ’s story closes on an agitated note .
We ca n’t be sure that the curse of the painting will ever cease .
No one destroys the painting or asks a priest to exorcise it :
The spell it weaves is too strong .
Hill ’s brief novel closes with narration by Oliver ’s wife ( Oliver joins the others in the Venetian scene , though you ’ll have to read the book to learn why ) , who fears the vengeance caused by the painting will one day be unleashed on her unborn child .
Lovecraft ’s conclusion is simpler , more neat and tidy , because the narrator finally shatters the window so that no one will ever use it again .
Even here , however , Lovecraft ends on a splendidly pulpy , melodramatic note .
To suggest how close he came to exposing our world to cosmic disaster , the narrator says :
“ I found near the shattered glass on the floor of the gable room -- the cut tentacle , ten feet in length , which has been caught between dimensions when the door had been shut against that monstrous body to which it belonged , the tentacle no living savant could identify as belonging to any known creature , living or dead , on the face or in the subterranean depths of the earth ! ”

Washington , D.C. , July 1 , 2009 - FBI special agents carried out 20 formal interviews and at least 5 " casual conversations " with former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein after his capture by U.S. troops in December 2003 , according to secret FBI reports released as the result of Freedom of Information Act requests by the National Security Archive and posted today on the Web at www.nsarchive.org.
Saddam denied any connections to the " zealot " Osama bin Laden , cited North Korea as his most likely ally in a crunch , and shared President George W. Bush 's hostility towards the " fanatic " Iranian mullahs , according to the FBI records of conversations from February through June 2004 between Saddam and Arabic - speaking agents in his detention cell at Baghdad International Airport .
The former Iraqi leader , when asked about his accomplishments , listed social progress for the people of Iraq , a temporary truce with the Kurds in the early 1970s , the nationalization of Iraq ’s oil in 1972 , support for the Arab side during the 1973 Middle East war with Israel , and after that , for the remaining 30 years of his rule , simple survival – through a devastating eight year war with Iran that he had launched , and a 12 - year sanctions regime imposed on his people after another war that he began .
During the interviews he repeatedly contests FBI evidence and the neutrality of his interlocutors – which one of them finds ironic , given the record of peremptory Iraqi justice under Saddam ’s governance .
He selectively outlines recent Iraqi history and acknowledges some mistakes , including the destruction without U.N. supervision or verification of some of Iraq ’s WMD arsenal left over from the 1980s .
During the interviews Saddam refutes some examples of what he views as myths , like his purported use of body doubles .
Instead he says that to evade his enemies he never used the telephone and traveled constantly from one dwelling to another ( he describes the farm where he was captured in a “ spider hole ” as the same place where he took refuge after a failed 1959 coup attempt . )
He takes personal responsibility for ordering the launching of SCUD missiles against Israeli targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War , because he blamed Israel and its influence in the U.S. for “ all the problems of the Arabs ” , but denies that his purpose was to draw that country into the conflict and to divide Washington from its Arab allies .
He provides details on the lead - up to the war , reporting that during a January 1991 meeting former Secretary of State James Baker told Saddam ’s foreign minister that if Iraq did not comply with U.S. conditions “ we ’ll take you back to the pre-industrial stage . ”
Saddam ’s historical recollections include his ascendancy within the Ba’athist party in 1968 and 1969 ; his disappointment after the Iran - Iraq war with Arab governments for their lack of gratitude for Iraq ’s “ saving all of the Arab world ” from occupation by Iran ; details about the 1991 Persian Gulf war ; and the post - war Shi ’a uprising in Iraq ’s south , which he characterizes as “ treachery ” instigated by Iran .
Not included in these FBI reports are issues of particular interest to students of Iraq ’s complicated relationship with the U.S. – the reported role of the CIA in facilitating the Ba’ath party ’s rise to power , the uneasy alliance forged between Iraq and the U.S. during the Iran - Iraq war , and the precise nature of U.S. views regarding Iraq ’s chemical weapons policy during that conflict , given its contemporaneous knowledge of their repeated use against Iranians and the Kurds .
This series of interviews also does not address chemical warfare in Kurdish areas of Iraq in 1987 - 1988 , although an FBI progress report says Saddam was questioned on the topic .
One interview , # 20 , is redacted in its entirety on national security grounds , although it is not clear what issues agents could have discussed with Saddam that cannot now be disclosed to the public .
The interviews and conversations were led by George L. Piro , one of an exceedingly small number of FBI agents who spoke Arabic .
The agency expected that Saddam would feel rapport with Piro and develop a sense of dependency .
During the interviews Piro hears Saddam out but is often openly skeptical of the former leader ’s recollections .
The agent does , however , assert with confidence that the U.S. side had information that Iraq was maintaining or developing a WMD capability and cites “ evidence ” of continuing contact between Iran and al - Qaeda , seemingly implying an operational relationship .
Saddam does not provide comfort to his interlocutors on these matters , refuting any notion of collaboration with al - Qaeda , or of a remaining WMD capacity , and in reality the charges , meant to win public support for the invasion of Iraq , were collapsing while the interviews were underway .
Investigators from the CIA , operating freely in occupied Iraq , failed to uncover any credible supporting evidence for the U.S. claims , and ultimately President Bush himself acknowledged that “ most of the intelligence turned out to be wrong . ”
One of the last interviews in the series ends on a valedictory note , after Piro listens to a poem that Saddam had written .
The former president of Iraq is “ done , ” Piro says , “ his life is nearing its end , ” and other detainees are blaming him for all of Iraq ’s many mistakes .
Saddam is fatalistic and acknowledges reality .
His interviews with Piro ended soon thereafter , and on December 30 , 2006 , he was hanged , amid the taunts of the political enemies who carried out his execution .

In a move that has raised eyebrows among established players in the classified real - estate business , Google Australia has unveiled a new tool on its mapping service that will directly link buyers and renters to available property .
The Google Maps feature , which launched today in Australia and New Zealand , will host free listings supplied by real - estate agents and publishers .
An example of a property search in the US version of Google Maps .
Although many existing publishers and real - estate agents offer map - based searching , the maps on Google 's new service will reflect real - time changes in search criteria and location .
The technology behind this enhancement was developed by engineers at Google 's Sydney office and is also being rolled out on the company 's existing property search service in the United States .
Nevada raised its hotel tax rate 3 percentage points , boosting the hotel tax rate in Las Vegas to 12 percent .
In New York City , hotel taxes increased to 14.76 percent , up 0.5 percentage points , and with the city ’s $ 3.50 a night surcharge , the taxes and fees on a $ 200 room amount to more than 16.5 percent .
For example , the hotel tax in Hawaii increased 1 percentage point to 8.25 percent this summer and is scheduled to increase to 9.25 percent next July .
“ Boston is not the only city increasing its taxes and fees , and we ’re not worried that people are going to decide not to come here because of the new taxes , ’’ said Patrick B. Moscaritolo , president of the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau , who blamed the falloff of tourism on the global recession and pointed out that Boston has lower taxes than many other large cities .
“ Most people are more focused on the experience and what the destination offers than taxes , ’’ he said .
The restaurant and hotel taxes are increasing as the number of visitors to Boston fell 6 percent in the first six months of the year , compared with the same period last year , according to the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau .
Over the same period , the city ’s hotel room occupancy rate fell 12 percent , according to Smith Travel Research , a Tennessee - based company that monitors trends in the hotel industry .
Visitors who rent a car at the airport can expect a slew of add - on fees that now amount to one - third of the overall price .
For example , a compact car rented for one day at a base rate of $ 62.69 at Avis would now have a total cost of $ 93.88 , which includes six different fees , from Logan , the state , and the rental company , such as the year - old $ 4 “ customer facility charge ’ ’ designated for a yet - to - be - built rental car facility .
And that is on top of fees and taxes that hit those who arrive at Logan International Airport before they even land , with average domestic ticket prices higher than at most other major airports and a mix of taxes and fees such as a $ 4.50 - per- ticket “ passenger facility charge , ’’ the maximum the federal government allows airports to charge to help subsidize their building projects .
In just about six weeks , the cost of staying in a hotel and dining at a restaurant in Boston will probably climb , and not just because of the sales tax increase that took effect this month .
If endorsed by the City Council , as is expected , the hotel tax will rise to 14.45 percent , up from 12.45 percent , and the meals tax will jump to 7 percent , up from 5 percent last month .
Overall , Boston ranks near the middle of the country ’s top 50 cities in terms of hotel and meal taxes , but Logan has become among the most expensive airports for car rentals , according to a survey by the National Business Travel Association , a Virginia - based group that represents the business travel industry .
In its survey last year , the group reported 18 of 50 cities surveyed had a hotel tax rate higher than 14.45 percent , Boston ’s proposed new rate , with Nashville the highest at 17.18 percent and Las Vegas the lowest at its previous 9 percent rate .
The survey found 33 of the cities had higher meal taxes than Boston ’s planned 7 percent , with Chicago the highest at 10.25 percent - which has already risen this year to 11.5 percent - and Portland , Ore. , the lowest , with no meal tax .
But of the 50 cities , only Chicago added more taxes and fees to the price of a rental car , last year ’s survey found .
Rental car companies now add nearly 23 percent in taxes and fees to the bill of cars picked up in downtown Boston .
“ Even with the higher taxes , Boston remains in the middle of the pack , ’’ said Fay Beauchine , president of National Business Travel Association ’s Foundation , which oversees the survey .
“ The question is whether companies and other visitors will decide it ’s too expensive and choose other cities to hold their conventions in . ’’
Local restaurateurs and hotel operators said they are not concerned .
While many opposed the tax increases , they said they were more concerned about the precedent than the effect of those scheduled to start in the fall .
“ I do n’t see it affecting tourism , ’’ said Paul J. Sacco , president of the Massachusetts Lodging Association , which represents more than 400 hotels and other inns in the state .
“ As a rule , we do n’t support increasing taxes , but I do n’t think a 2 percent increase will have a long - term impact .
I just do n’t want to see them go up further next year .
Then it would start impacting convention business and other segments . ’’
And most tourists taking in the sights in Boston last weekend shrugged off the prospect of raised taxes as generally reasonable or just inevitable .
Ed Johnson , 51 , here on a short trip with his 14 - year - old daughter from Troy , N.Y. , said taxes are part of the recession .
“ It ’s just a sign of the times , ’’ he said at Faneuil Hall .
“ The state ’s trying to get revenue and that ’s how they do it .
If it ’s too high , maybe there ’ll be another Boston Tea Party .
Who knows ? ’’
At Logan Airport , Larry Self , his wife , and their teenage son and daughter were wrapping up a week ’s vacation .
The family had rented a car to tour the Cape and spent some time in Boston before heading home to Wichita , Kan .
Self said his 18 - year - old son is considering moving to the Northeast after college , but Self said he would think twice about returning to Boston if an increase in hotel and meal taxes is approved .
“ When things get so expensive , you ca n’t go as much as you want , ’’ Self said .
But his wife , Sharon , said she knows that visiting New England comes with a higher price tag .
“ There are certainly a lot less expensive places to vacation , but that ’s kind of the whole Northeast in general , ’’ she said .
“ You do have to decide to spend more on vacation . ’’
Peter Christie , president of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association , said the owners of the 5,000 restaurants he represents are more concerned about the effect of the tax increases on local residents than on tourists .
He added that many restaurateurs feel singled out , given that few other taxes target specific businesses .
“ Why should a lunch salad be treated any differently than the sale of a flat panel TV ? ’’ he said .
“ I do n’t think we ’re taxing ourselves out of the market .
I just worry about this being part of a slippery slope . ’’

Here is what Hamm told Congress in his prepared remarks to the Hearing of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on June 16 this year :
Rescission is rare .
It affects less than one - half of one percent of people we cover .
Yet , it is one of many protections supporting the affordability and viability of individual health insurance in the United States under our current system .
Late last week , James Kwak of Baseline Scenario suggested that the numbers put forward by Hamm were misleading because rescissions are targeted only at those who fall ill .
[ NOTE - this corrects my previous , erroneous statement that Kwak had accepted Hamm 's argument ; I apologize for that major error . ]
Taunter , who has a mathematics background , came up with the hard numbers :
To understand why 0.5 % of the people Assurant covers is a lot of people – a jarring , terrifying , probably criminal lot – you need to understand a little bit of math .
You need to understand just enough math to understand what Don and his legal team are not telling you .
You need to understand conditional probability .
And the folks at Assurant are counting on the fact that you do n’t .
. . .
Half of the insured population uses virtually no health care at all .
The 80th percentile uses only $ 3,000 ( 2002 dollars , adjust a bit up for today ) .
You have to hit the 95th percentile to get anywhere interesting , and even there you have only $ 11,487 in costs .
It ’s the 99th percentile , the people with over $ 35,000 of medical costs , who represent fully 22 % of the entire nation ’s medical costs .
These people have chronic , expensive conditions .
They are , to use a technical term , sick .
An individual adult insurance plan is roughly $ 7,000 ( varies dramatically by age and somewhat by sex and location ) .
It should be fairly clear that the people who do not file insurance claims do not face rescission .
The insurance companies will happily deposit their checks .
Indeed , even for someone in the 95th percentile , it does n’t make a lot of sense for the insurance company to take the nuclear option of blowing up the policy .
$ 11,487 in claims is less than two years ’ premium ; less than one if the individual has family coverage in the $ 12,000 price range .
But that top one percent , the folks responsible for more than $ 35,000 of costs – sometimes far , far more – well there , ladies and gentlemen , is where the money comes in .
Once an insurance company knows that Sally has breast cancer , it has already seen the goat ; it knows it wants nothing to do with Sally .
If the top 5 % is the absolute largest population for whom rescission would make sense , the probability of having your policy cancelled given that you have filed a claim is fully 10 % ( 0.5 % rescission / 5.0 % of the population ) .
If you take the LA Times estimate that $ 300 mm was saved by abrogating 20,000 policies in California ( $ 15,000 / policy ) , you are somewhere in the 15 % zone , depending on the convexity of the top section of population .
If , as I suspect , rescission is targeted toward the truly bankrupting cases – the top 1 % , the folks with over $ 35,000 of annual claims who could never be profitable for the carrier – then the probability of having your policy torn up given a massively expensive condition is pushing 50 % .
One in two .
You have three times better odds playing Russian Roulette .
And that 's just the beginning of Taunter 's article .
There are some other great zingers in the rest , such as this :
It is in the health insurer ’s interest to have application fraud , not only because it saves time and expense on the front end , but also because it lets them get out of any policy that is n’t going well for them .
If the health insurer had to verify the information – if , in essence the insurance company had to behave as an accredited investor with adequate expertise to make a decision without reliance – it would n’t have the opportunity to bail out .
It would catch more genuine liars , but many of these liars would have turned out to be healthy , profitable customers , and what the carrier really wants is a population devoid of expensive claims , not devoid of liars .

I ’m going to make a statement here , one that I believe to be true based on a quarter century and more of gaming .
No one wants to play a realistic game .
I ’m going to make another statement now , one that I know to be true based on a quarter century and more of gaming .
People will still complain about a game not being realistic .
Both statements are true .
This can get confusing , but it ’s really all about that word , “ realistic . ”
I have a friend who studied philosophy but gave it up because he felt that all modern philosophy came down to arguing over the meaning of words .
I can see that .
This very important point comes down to the meaning of “ real . ”
For most of us who are n’t billionaire super - spies , gaming is escapism * , something we do to inject some vicarious excitement into our mostly mundane and routine lives .
It ’s power fantasy and storytelling and socializing and getting out of your own head .
That means that we do n’t want to play something that mimics our everyday life ** – we get enough of our everyday lives in everyday life .
That ’s one value of real .
And we do n’t want it .
Even if we ’re playing a simulation of some sort – WWII miniatures , for example – we still do n’t want it to be real .
We do n’t want to spend hours trying to push our tanks forward three inches on the table , or have to roll for logistical and communications foul - ups ***.
We want to deal with the fun parts of the subject , not with the tedious ones .
Let ’s especially look at fantasy and sf games .
Even the hardest of the hard sf games **** interjects a few elements of impossibility : FTL technology , aliens , whatever .
And when you wind up playing , as the title of this post suggests , an elf that uses magic , you pretty much forfeit any right to decry a lack of realism .
I mean , if you swallow the assumption of a near - immortal race changing reality around them with a thought , why would you balk at the idea that the economic scheme for buying , selling , and creating magic items does n’t make any sense *****?
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
“ Does n’t make any sense . ”
That ’s the key .
See , when we talk about whether a game is realistic or not , we ’re not really talking about that .
We ’re talking about whether the game seems realistic or not .
We ’re talking about internal consistency , logical coherence , and believability .
We ’re talking about saying , “ Given the basic assumptions about the world and setting the game presupposes , this makes sense . ”
The word we ’re really talking about is , “ verisimilitude . ”
The quality of something seeming real or true .
This term comes up a lot in drama and fiction .
One of my acting teachers , lo , these many years ago , used to say ( I wrote it down and kept it , because I liked it ) :
If you ever start to feel that you are the person you are portraying on stage , please let me know immediately .
Then have a little lie - down while I call a psychiatrist .
We do n’t become our roles ; we are actors .
We act as if we had become our roles .
If you ca n’t make that distinction , the stage is not the place for you .
When we game , we do n’t want the game world to be like the real world .
We want the game world to behave as if ****** it were a real world .
We want it to follow a coherent , internal structure that meets our ideas of cause and effect , allowing us to understand the relationships within that world .
We want it to make sense .
Which , when you think about it , is pretty weird , because we do n’t necessarily have the same expectations of reality .
Aristotle said :
With respect to the requirements of art , a probable impossibility is to be preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible .
What does that mean ?
Well , the real world is full of strangeness .
Coincidence and synchronicity abound .
Things happen every day that , if we read them in a book , we would point out as being far too coincidental .
And in a game , they become very suspicious .
Here ’s an example :
If I go on vacation to Hawaii and run into my next - door neighbour there , we both say , “ Wow .
That ’s weird . ”
Then we get on with our lives .
If a character in a book goes on vacation to Hawaii and runs into his next - door neighbour , we say , “ Yeah , right .
That ’s completely unbelievable . ”
Despite the fact that such things can , and do , happen in real life .
In a game , if a character goes to a far away land , and runs into his next - door neighbour , the character says , “ I wonder what he ’s up to .
Did he follow me here ?
Is he working for my enemies ? ”
And then he attempts to knock his neighbour out and lock him in a trunk .
My point is that , in a constructed reality like fiction or gaming , we avoid certain aspects of reality , such as coincidence , as violating our sense of the real , despite the fact that such things are very much a part of reality .
Reality , as Stephen King says , is Ralph *******.
Now , how this applies to gaming .
When you build an adventure , you need to keep the What , the How , and the Why in mind .
What .
What happens ?
What is the event , the item , the character , the location ?
What do the characters have to do ?
What are the villains doing ?
This the core of most adventures , and serves as the starting point in development in a lot of cases .
What happens ?
What is the event , the item , the character , the location ?

What are the villains doing ?
This the core of most adventures , and serves as the starting point in development in a lot of cases .
How .
What is the mechanism by which the What happens ?
If the villains are scrying on the characters , what magic are they using ?
If they ’re going to blot out the sun , what device does that , and how does it work ?
If the characters run into their childhood friends , how does it come about ?
This is the first layer of explanation and verisimilitude , providing support and rationale for seeming coincidences .
Players assume that this is here , even if it ’s not , so best to be prepared .
What is the mechanism by which the What happens ?
If the villains are scrying on the characters , what magic are they using ?
If they ’re going to blot out the sun , what device does that , and how does it work ?
If the characters run into their childhood friends , how does it come about ?
This is the first layer of explanation and verisimilitude , providing support and rationale for seeming coincidences .
Players assume that this is here , even if it ’s not , so best to be prepared .
Why .
What ’s the reason for the What ?
Why are the villains trying to blot out the sun ?
Why did the childhood friends come to the far away vacation land ?
This is the second layer of explanation and verismilitude .
Again , players will assume it exists , so it ’s a good idea for it to exist .
In a game , players do n’t believe in coincidence .
Everything is motivated by something , and that something revolves around the characters .
This is a reasonable assumption ; they are the stars of the story , and everything usually does revolve around them .
Put some thought and preparation into it , and it helps the game feel richer and more real .
Now , there ’s another type of realism bugaboo that rears its head from time to time .
This is the real - world expert that tries to apply his real - world knowledge to the game world in order to squeeze some in - game benefit out of what he ’s doing .
This is the guy who argues that the heat of a fireball should cause the air to expand and knock out the walls of the building , or that , because he can fall 416 feet in a round , he should have a fly move of 83 squares .
Or at least 40 , because he ’s gliding laterally .
Or the economist who questions the stability of a kingdom ’s currency because a hard metal standard can’t meet the needs of exchange and credit .
You know what to say to them , right ?
“ You ’re an elf that uses magic .
You do n’t get to talk about realism . ”

*** Now that I ’ve written that statement , I ’m sure there ’s someone out there going , “ But we do !
That ’s what our game is all about ! ”
So , for you folks , I resort to this rebuttal : “ That may be , but you sure do n’t have real people really dying . ”
Those who disagree with this somewhat snarky and hyperbolic argument are free to discuss it with their local constabulary .
**** I ’m thinking probably Traveler 2300 .
At least , of the ones I ’m familiar with .

Electric Roadster costs a cool £ 94 k
Electric cars are a big deal at the moment , and the news yesterday that Tesla officially opened its flagship European showroom in London 's Knightsbridge made national headlines .
Even PH got caught up in the current , as eagle - eyed PHers may have spotted our very own Riggers appearing with a whole ten seconds of comment on the Channel 4 News ...
The store , which will eventually be joined by three other European showrooms in Munich , Monaco and Zurich , is a marker of intent for Tesla 's European ambitions for its battery - powered sports car .
" We expect the London store to dramatically increase our brand identity throughout the continent , " says Tesla CEO Elon Musk , " and with right - hand drive models now due at the beginning of next year , the UK market will provide a solid foundation on which to build this . "
Showroom is just a short hop from Harrods
Tesla is proud of the fact that its new showroom is within walking distance of Harrods - presumably these things are important if you plan to shell out £ 94 k on an electric sports car with the performance and dimensions of a Lotus Elise .
Probably more significant is the Tesla 's exemption from the London congestion charge .
The Tesla Roadster might not be blessed with the noise and excitement of a ' proper engine ' , and it might take several hours to recharge , but Tesla looks as though it is here to stay .
It says it has 1300 orders across Europe for the Roadster , is planning an ' entry - level ' RHD Roadster for early next year and is taking ' reservations ' for the Model S saloon , due for launch towards the end of 2011 .

Caracas -- July 25 , 2009 --
On July 22 , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez again declared his complete support for the proposal by industrial workers for a new model of production based on workers ’ control .
This push from Chavez , part of the socialist revolution , aims at transforming Venezuela ’s basic industry .
However , it faces resistance from within the state bureaucracy and the revolutionary movement .
Presenting his government ’s “ Plan Socialist Guayana 2009 - 2019 ” , Chavez said the state - owned companies in basic industry have to be transformed into “ socialist companies ” .
The plan was the result of several weeks of intense discussion among revolutionary workers from the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana ( CVG ) .
The CVG includes 15 state - owned companies in the industrial Guayana region involved in steel , iron ore , mineral and aluminium production .
The workers ’ roundtables were established after a May 21 workshop , where industrial workers raised radical proposals for the socialist transformation of basic industry .
Chavez addressed the workshop in support of many of the proposals .
Events between the May 21 workshop and Chavez ’s July 22 announcement reveal much of the nature of the class struggle inside revolutionary Venezuela .
Chavez ’s announcement is part of an offensive launched after the revolutionary forces won the February 15 referendum on the back of a big organisational push that involved hundreds of thousands of people in the campaign .
The vote was to amend the constitution to allow elected officials to stand for re-election — allowing Chavez , the undisputed leader of the Venezuelan revolution , to stand for president in 2012 .
With oil revenue dropping due to the global economic crisis , the government is using this new position of strength to tackle corruption and bureaucracy , while increasing state control over strategic economic sectors .
This aims to ensure the poor are not made to pay for the crisis .
Workers ’ control
On May 21 , Chavez publicly threw his lot in with the Guayana workers , announcing his government ’s granting of demands for better conditions in state - owned companies and the nationalisation of a number of private companies whose workers were involved in industrial disputes .
“ When the working class roars , the capitalists tremble ” , Chavez told theworkers .
To chants of “ this is how you govern ! ” , Chavez announced his agreement with a series of measures proposed by workers .
However , like an old train that begins to rattle loudly as it speeds up , more right - wing sectors within the revolutionary movement also began to tremble .
With each new attack against the political and economic power that the capitalist class still holds in Venezuela — and uses to destabilise the country — the revolution is also forced to confront internal enemies .
The radical measures announced at the May 21 workshop were the result of the workers discussion over the previous two days .
Chavez called on workers to wage an all - out struggle against the “ mafias ” rife in the management of state companies .
Chavez then designated planning minister Jorge Giordani and labour minister Maria Cristina Iglesias , who both played a key role in the workshop , to follow up these decisions by establishing a series of workers ’ roundtables in the CVG industries .
The CVG complex is on the verge of collapse in large part due to the privatisation push by pre-Chavez governments in the 1990s .
State companies were run down in preparation to be sold off cheaply .
In the Sidor steel plant , for example , the number of workers dropped from more than 30,000 to less than 15,000 before it was privatised in 1998 .
Chavez ’s 1998 election stopped further privatisation .
But the government has had to confront large - scale corruption within the CVG , continued deterioration of machinery and , more recently , the sharp drop in prices of aluminium and steel .
The plan drafted by workers and given to Chavez on June 9 raised the possibility of “ converting the current structural crisis of capitalism ” into “ an opportunity ” for workers to move forward in “ the construction of socialism , by assuming in a direct manner , control over production of the basic companies in the region ” .
The report set out nine strategic lines — including workers ’ control of production ; improvement of environmental and work conditions ; and public auditing of companies and projects .
Measures proposed include the election of managers and management restructuring ; collective decision - making by workers and local communities ; the creation of workers ’ councils ; and opening companies ’ books .
The measures aim to achieve “ direct control of production without mediations by a bureaucratic structure ” .
The report said such an experience of workers ’ control would undoubtedly act as an example for workers in “ companies in the public sector nationally , such as those linked to hydrocarbons or energy companies ” .
Bureaucracy bites back
Sensing the danger such an example represents to its interests , bureaucratic sections within the revolutionary movement , as well as the US - backed counter - revolutionary opposition , moved quickly to try and stop this process .
A wave of strikes and protests were organised in the aluminium sector during June and July , taking advantage of workers ’ disgruntlement with corrupt managers and payments owed .
The protests were organised by union leaders from both the Socialist Bolivarian Force of Workers ( FSBT ) , a union current within the mass party led by Chavez , the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , and those aligned with opposition parties such as Radical Cause .
Revolutionary workers from Guayana condemned the unholy alliance of bureaucratic union leaders and opposition political forces , which aimed to stifling the process initiated on May 21 .
This alliance was supported by Bolivar provincial governor , retired General Francisco Rangel Gomez , who called on the national government to negotiate directly with local unions .
Opinion pieces began to appear in the local press , calling on the government to once again make Rangel president of the CVG in order to bring “ stability ” .
The alliance between Rangel and union bureaucrats in Guayana is long running .
Officially part of the Chavista camp , Rangel has long been accused of being corrupt and anti-worker .
During his term as CVG president before becoming governor in 2004 , Rangel built up a corrupt clientalist network with local union and business figures .
He stacked CVG management with business partners and friends .
While on the negotiation commission to resolve the 15 - month long dispute at Sidor , Rangel ordered the National Guard to fire on protesting Sidor workers .
Also on the commission was then - labour minister and former FSBT union leader from Guayana , Jose Ramon Rivero , who was similarly accused by Sidor workers of siding with management .
He was also criticised for using his position as labour minister to build the FSBT ’s bureaucratic powerbase by promoting “ parallel unions ” along factional lines and splitting the revolutionary union confederation , National Union of Workers ( UNT ) .
In April last year , Chavez disbanded the Sidor negotiation commission and sent his vice - president , Ramon Carrizales , to resolve the dispute by re-nationalising the steel plant .
Rivero was then sacked .
Today , he works as the general secretary in Rangel ’s governorship .
The forces behind Rivero and Rangel hoped not only to stifle the radical proposals from the May 21 workshop , but also remove basic industry minister Rodolfo Sanz .
Sanz has moved to replace Rangel ’s people with his own in the CVG management .
In the recent dispute , Sanz accused aluminium workers of being responsible for the crisis in that sector .
He worked to undermine the proposals of the roundtable discussions .
After several days of negotiations union leaders — essentially sidelining the workers roundtables —
Sanz agreed on July 20 not only to pay the workers what they were owed , but also to restructure the board of directors in the aluminium sector .
Through this process , the radical proposals for restructuring the CVG appeared to have been push aside — which suited both Sanz and Rangel .
Revolutionary leadership
However , Chavez intervened with his July 22 announcement , which came after a meeting with key ministers and advisors involved in the May 21 socialist transformation workshop .
Chavez said his government was committed to implement the recommendations of the “ Plan Socialist Guayana ” , placing himself clearly on the side of the workers .
He said the workers ’ proposals , embodied in the plan , would “ guide all the new policies and concrete and specific measures that we are beginning to decide in order to consolidate a socialist platform in Guayana ” .
When a journalist directed her first question to Sanz regarding the plan , Chavez stepped in to respond , by - passing Sanz and handing the microphone over to Giordani , who many revolutionary workers identify as strongly committed to the process of socialist transformation .
Rangel , who had been at the May 21 workshop , was not at the July 22 meeting .
Socialism more than state ownership
Chavez also appeared to differentiate himself from other sectors within the revolutionary movement , such as those behind the “ A Grain of Maize ” daily column , whose authors are linked to a political current involving oil minister Rafael Ramirez .
This current has recently been vocal in arguing that socialism simply entails state ownership and central planning from above — with minimum participation from workers .
For Chavez , state - owned companies “ that continue to remain within the framework of state capitalism ” have to be managed by their workers in order to become “ socialist ” .
The Plan Socialist Guayana is Venezuela ’s first example of real “ democratic planning from below ” , Chavez added .
The battle in Guayana is not over .
Workers from the Alcasa aluminium plant told Green Left Weekly that management at aluminium plants met on July 25 to continue the process of restructuring agreed to by Sanz and union leaders — in direct opposition to Chavez ’s statements .
Other fronts of intense class conflict have opened up .
Various struggles have emerged involving different forces and interests in the electricity sector , as well as the still - emerging communes , which unite the grassroots communal councils , to name a few .
A central arena of struggle is the PSUV , which is in a process of restructuring ahead of its second congress in October .
But the battle in Guayana may be one of the most decisive as it involves the largest working - class population .
This is in the context of a revolution whose weakest link has been the lack of a strong , organised revolutionary workers ’ movement .

A 48 - year - old Thai elephant has been fitted with an permanent artificial leg , 10 years after losing a limb from treading on a land mine .
Motola was measured up at an elephant hospital on Saturday before experts made the leg and fitted it on Sunday .
The elephant had been walking with the help of a temporary artificial leg made of canvas , the Associated Press news agency reports .
A much younger elephant at the same hospital already has a false leg .
Motola was injured in 1999 while working at a logging camp along the Thai - Burmese border .
Her front left foot was so badly damaged it had to be amputated .
Her permanent leg was made by the Prostheses Foundation .
Motola and a three - year - old elephant , Mosha , have both been cared for by an elephant hospital run by the Friends of the Asian Elephant ( FAE ) .
Mosha , who is three , lost part of her right front leg as a seven - month - old .
Because Mosha is growing fast , she has already outgrown three of her prosthetic limbs .
Thailand 's borders with Burma and Cambodia are littered with unexploded landmines , the result of decades of conflict .
The FAE says many elephants , often domesticated ones used in the logging trade , are injured by mines every year as they work in remote forests close to the borders .

Sehr geehrte Frau von der Leyen ,
Ihre politischen Ansichten und Vorhaben bezüglich des Internets
machen mir Mut und zeugen von Kompetenz .
Solche widerlichen Bilder
sind pervers und gehören bestraft .
Es darf nicht sein , dass das Netz
ein rechtsfreier Raum bleibt , und es wird Zeit , dass solcher Schund
mit allen Mitteln zensiert wird .
Wie sie Kinderpornografie jetzt
bekämpfen , ist vorbildlich !
Sich hinter der Anonymität im Netz zu
verstecken , hilft niemandem , und es wird Zeit , dass sich das
Gesetz einschägiger Seiten annimmt , bevor sich eine solche URL
herumspricht !
Nicht auszudenken , welcher Schaden entstehen kann ,
wenn unbescholtene Bürger ( oder Kinder ! ) auf soetwas stoßen .
Doch
wenn so engagierte Gesetzteber wie sie , Frau von der Leyen ,
an der Spitze sind , habe ich Hoffnung , dass die Perversen nicht
weiterhin ihren Willen bekommen .
Ich hoffe inständig , dass sie nicht
zu viel Kritik einstecken müssen und drücke die Daumen , dass sie
wiedergewählt werden !
Ich weiß jedenfalls , wo ich mein Kreuz mache .

Chicago - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has asked an Illinois Circuit Court judge to quash subpoenas aimed at outing opponents of a controversial city project .
In December , local residents filed a lawsuit in state court against the city of Chicago and local developers , challenging the legality of a development project in the city 's Uptown neighborhood .
In response , the " Wilson Yard Defendants , " six firms associated with Chicago developer Peter Holsten , issued subpoenas directing Google and a local neighborhood association to unmask anonymous online critics who had discussed either the project or Alderman Helen Shiller , the primary governmental sponsor of the project .
EFF and co-counsel Charles Mudd Jr. obtained a temporary order protecting the anonymous speakers in July , while the defendants asked that the court wait to consider whether to dismiss the subpoenas until after the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint .
With the amended complaint now filed , providing no support for the subpoenas , EFF and Mudd have moved to quash the subpoenas outright .
" The right to speak anonymously is a fundamental element of the First Amendment .
Individuals need to know that they can express their views , and do so without fear of legal reprisal , " said EFF Staff Attorney Matt Zimmerman .
" Efforts to target critics of government - sponsored activity are precisely what the First Amendment is designed to prevent . "
While anonymous online speakers can be unmasked in certain narrow circumstances , none of them apply in this case .
In a motion to quash the subpoenas filed Friday , EFF argues that the identities of the critics have no bearing on issue before the court -- a lawsuit that concerns land - use ordinances .
EFF has repeatedly tried to resolve the matter with the developer 's attorneys but to no avail .
" Enough is enough , " said Zimmerman .
" The defendants are demonstrating a callous disregard for the First Amendment and cannot be allowed to abuse the judicial process any longer . "
The sites targeted by the subpoena to Google were community websites " Uptown Update " ( www.uptownupdate.com) and " What the Helen " ( defunct since 2007 ) .
Also targeted with a separate subpoena was non-profit neighborhood association Buena Park Neighbors ( www.buenaparkneighbors.org).

We live in a digital world that is dominated by all sorts of technology .
From the time you arise to the time you retire to bed , you use various types of devices that are meant to make your life easier but somehow make it more complex too in the process .
Such an irony is more obvious during phenomenon like natural calamities and disasters when the world ’s normal order is broken and people are left to their instincts in order to survive .
Although these events happen rarely , the fact that they do happen should be enough to keep everyone on their toes .
The US just recently experienced a major loss especially if you live in or anywhere near Houston , Texas .
Hurricane Harvey hit it with such a force that left thousands homeless and millions of lives temporarily displaced until the authorities are able to sort things out and help in the rebuilding and rehabilitation of the state .
However , the federal government tries its best to provide for the basic and immediate needs of the people but it ca n’t always offer help on other equally important matters like in recovering the properties destroyed .
Fortunately , help is given to those in need , especially the ones whose homes have been badly hit by the storm and costly gadgets like computers and laptops have been drowned in floodwater much to their owner ’s dismay .
Losing a home and personal property to a flood is obviously traumatic , but some people will tell you that losing precious photos and videos can be even worse .
Thankfully , DriveSavers is stepping up and offering free data recovery services to Hurricane Harvey victims .
The company can recover data from broken phones and computers , even those that have been fully submerged in water .
DriveSavers typically charges hundreds to thousands of dollars per phone or computer , depending on the complexity of the recovery .
In a press release , DriveSavers offered its services to those in Houston , Austin , Corpus Christi and all other areas hit by Hurricane Harvey and its continued rain .
The company is limiting its services to one phone or hard drive per household .

Data recovery is a crucial service in the aftermath of a natural disaster like a hurricane where water is the biggest threat to the integrity of your tech gadgets .
Let ’s not forget how sensitive these gadgets are and you will likely lose all your important files after having them exposed to the harsh elements for days on end .
The biggest hurdle of all is the expense associated with such a costly service like data recovery that is a major burden to people who are trying to rebuild their lives soon after surviving a disaster .

Now that that Barney Frank " trying to have a conversation with you would be like arguing with a dining room table " video has broken 1 million views on YouTube after just four days , time to have a peek YouTube 's new Insight statistics tool .
And here 's an interesting tidbit : the numbers bear out that the clip of the colorful confrontation at a New Hampshire town hall has been rippling out through social media and sharing sites .
Your more " professional " journalistic sites also put up big viewing numbers , for sure .
The Huffington Post , Andrew Sullivan 's blog , and Wonkette combined for about 200,000 referrals .
But views from social media sources built on people - to - people sharing -- primarily Facebook , with 95,000 views , but Digg and Reddit too -- outnumber those from " news " sources in the end .
Social media , according to YouTube , contributed about 229,000 views to the Frank video .
( Without more access to the numbers , of course , it 's tough to know from what type of sources the rest of the views are coming . )
As a point of comparison , take the five - week old video of Representative Mike Castle 's run-in with so - called " birthers " at a Delaware townhall .
The Drudge Report contributed 310,000 of that video's 831,000 views .
Rush Limbaugh , Wonkette , Speigel , Huffington Post , the New York Times , and FoxNation put up another 94,000 , for a total of about 404,000 .
YouTube attributes another 100k to " viral / other " sources .
The numbers suggest that , in the end , we 're seeing the ability of average folks to share a video in a couple clicks compete with the distribution reach of those in the business of news .
You would be hard pressed to find another beverage besides coffee whose health benefits or concerns are more controversial .
It seems with each passing year , coffee is hailed as either medicine or poison , but this year it seems the findings have been positive .
Let ’s take a look at a few recent conclusions .
Coffee May Prevent and Treat Alzheimer’s
In a study on mice , researchers gave them the equivalent of 3 - 5 cups strong coffee and found that after two months the subjects had a greatly improved memory .
It may be because the caffeine reduces inflammation in the brain , which would improve memory , or because they had 50 % less amyloid beta protein in their brains .
Testing the memory of a mouse , what an interesting job .
As for studies on humans , lead researcher on the project , Miia Kivipelto , a professor at the University of Kuopio in Finland and at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , said , “ Middle - aged people who drank between three and five cups of coffee a day lowered their risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer ’s disease by between 60 and 65 percent later in life . ”
She also said it remained unclear exactly how moderate coffee drinking helped delay or avoid the onset of dementia , but pointed out that coffee contains strong antioxidants , which are known to counter Alzheimer’s .
Coffee Cups
Coffee May Help Diabetics
Previous studies have affirmed that a high consumption of coffee may lower the risk for type 2 diabetes , and now another study on 15 overweight men was performed , focusing on two specific compounds found in coffee , chlorogenic acid and trigonelline .
The researchers examined the effects on both glucose and insulin concentrations and found a significant reduction in glucose and insulin 15 minutes after the oral glucose tolerance test , a two - hour procedure commonly used to diagnose diabetes .
They believe that these specific compounds contribute to the overall beneficial effect of coffee on the development of type 2 diabetes .
Caffeine Used to Fight Skin Cancer
Scientists now believe that both drinking caffeine and using sunscreens or after - sun creams containing caffeine may improve sun damaged skin and reduce the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer .
In a 2007 study it was shown that drinking caffeinated coffee caused a reduction in the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer at a rate of 5 % for each cup consumed per day .
Now researchers have shown that caffeine applied topically to the skin effectively protected skin cells after they were exposed to UV radiation .
The reasoning behind it is believed to be that caffeine causes apoptosis , the programmed death of precancerous cells .
In one study , after exposing hairless mice to UV radiation , they found that topical applications of caffeine to the mice decreased the number of nonmalignant skin tumors by 44 % and malignant skin tumors 72 % .
It increased apoptosis of nonmalignant skin tumors by 87 % and squamous cell carcinomas 92 % , and there was no effect on the non -tumor areas of the skin .
This should be good news for those of us living in Arizona !
Coffee Helps Hepatitis C Patients
In an observation study it was found that patients with a hepatitis C virus infection who drank three cups or more of coffee per day appear to be less likely to suffer from progression of liver damage caused by the disease .
In the study , those who drank 3 or more cups of coffee per day had livers that were much healthier than the other participants .
At the 13 - month follow - up , outcome rates continued to decrease more for those who consumed three or more cups per day than those who drank little or no coffee , leading researchers to claim that “ coffee consumption may slow the progression of fibrotic liver disease ” ( the result of the liver forming excessive fibrous connective tissue ) .

Twitter skeptics -- and they remain legion -- will find the idea silly … but it 's not , particularly not in this case .
Of course Best Buy should be seeking Twitter experience in a candidate for a senior manager 's position in " emerging media . "
Who would dream of landing such a job without first - hand knowledge of the most - hyped emerging medium in recent memory ?
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
But that 's not to say the company is going about measuring Twitter savvy in the right manner ; it 's not .
Nor does it answer the more difficult question of who among us needs to be on Twitter for the sake of our employers and our careers .
( It 's a question we 're grappling with right now at Network World . )
From a Computerworld Canada story :
A recent job posting on Best Buy Co Inc. ’s Web site for a Senior Manager – Emerging Media Marketing position based out of the company ’s corporate headquarters in Richfield , Minn . listed two preferred job qualifications : a graduate degree and 250 + followers on Twitter .
Basic qualifications for the position include a Bachelor ’s degree , “ two plus years of mobile or social media marketing experience ” at the director or strategist level , “ four plus years people or resource leadership experience ” and “ one plus years of active blogging experience . "
Again , I 'd want any candidate for such a job to be an active blogger and have a hand in Twitter .
However , an arbitrary number of Twitter followers will not separate the dabblers from the more meaningfully experienced , as was noted by employment experts quoted in the story .
Anyone can accumulate followers on Twitter .
The real questions are whether you 're actively participating and realizing any tangible benefits from that participation .
Although I 'm not interested in working for Best Buy , I do meet the company 's Twitter threshold , having attracted 1,653 followers since taking the plunge eight months ago .
Over that span , I have sent 2,552 Twitter messages -- roughly 10 Tweets a day , seven days a week .
While not by any stretch a Twitter heavyweight , that does put me in the top 1 percent of 2.7 million accounts tracked by TwitterGrader.com .
Yet I remain wholly unconvinced that everyone needs to be on Twitter .
Yes for would - be senior managers of emerging media .
Yes for technology trade - press editors .
No for CEOs .
( A recent survey showed only two Fortune 100 CEOs are on Twitter , and it seems to me they have more to explain than the non-Tweeting 98 . )
Maybe for most everyone else .
As for you , your job and your future aspirations ?
The best way to find out is to give Twitter a shot .
It 's free , it can't hurt , you might find you like it … and you never know when you might need a job at Best Buy .
( Update : Just stumbled across this item noting that Best Buy in general is big on Twitter and that company CEO Brian Dunn has an account , albeit one that just barely would qualify him for employment in his marketing department . )
Quotations
Shoot all the bluejays you want , if you can hit 'em , but remember it 's a sin to kill a mockingbird .
People generally see what they look for , and hear what they listen for .
They 're certainly entitled to think that , and they 're entitled to full respect for their opinions , but before I can live with other folks I 've got to live with myself .
The one thing that does n't abide by majority rule is a person 's conscience .
Not from , but about To Kill a Mockingbird , with apologies :
Monroeville , Alabama
January , 1966
Editor , The News Leader :
Recently I have received echoes down this way of the Hanover County School Board ’s activities , and what I ’ve heard makes me wonder if any of its members can read .
Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that “ To Kill a Mockingbird ” spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct , Christian in its ethic , that is the heritage of all Southerners .
To hear that the novel is “ immoral ” has made me count the years between now and 1984 , for I have yet to come across a better example of doublethink .
I feel , however , that the problem is one of illiteracy , not Marxism .
Therefore I enclose a small contribution to the Beadle Bumble Fund that I hope will be used to enroll the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice .

Throw dung in her face to make her ugly .
She is and she ought to be drowned in baptism ...
She would deserve , the wretch , to be banished to the filthiest place in the house , to the closets . "
— Martin Luther , Erlangen Edition v. 16 , pp. 142-148

Faith must trample underfoot all reason , sense , and understanding , and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and ... know nothing but the word of God . "
— Martin Luther
" We know that reason is the Devil ’s harlot , and can do nothing but slander and harm all that God says and does …
Therefore keep to revelation and do not try to understand . "
— Martin Luther
" What harm would it do , if a man told a good strong lie for the sake of the good and for the Christian church ? [...] a lie out of necessity , a useful lie , a helpful lie , such lies would not be against God , he would accept them . "

Eusebius was a 4th century Bishop of Caesarea and Church Historian , considered " the Father of Ecclesiastical History " " Theology is the most certain of all sciences since its source is divine knowledge ( which cannot be deceived ) and because of the greater worth of its subject matter , the sublimity of which transcends human reason . "
— Thomas Aquinas , Summa Theologiae ( 1265 –1274 )
" Unbelief is the greatest of sins . "

There is no need then to assume that God exists . "
— Thomas Aquinas , ibid. , I , Question 2 , Article 3
" With regard to heretics there are two points to be observed , one on their side , the other on the side of the Church .
As for heretics their sin deserves banishment , not only from the Church by excommunication , but also from this world by death .
To corrupt the faith , whereby the soul lives , is much graver than to counterfeit money , which supports temporal life .
Since forgers and other malefactors are summarily condemned to death by the civil authorities , with much more reason may heretics as soon as they are convicted of heresy be not only excommunicated , but also justly be put to death . "

"
— Council of Toulouse : Canon 14 , 1229 " … the right of holding slaves is clearly established in the Holy Scriptures , both by precept and example …
Had the holding of slaves been a moral evil , it cannot be supposed that the inspired Apostles … would have tolerated it for a moment in the Christian Church .

— Richard Furman , Baptist State Convention , letter to South Carolina Governor , 1822 " God is introduced to give dignity and emphasis ... and then He is banished .
It was this very atheistic Declaration [ of Independence ] which had inspired the ' higher law ' doctrine of the radical antislavery men .

The mission of southerners was therefore clear ; they must defend the word of God against abolitionist infidels . "

That means from a level which is not manifest at a sensory level .

I pledge that I never will tie myself to parties who want to destroy Christianity ..
We want to fill our culture again with the Christian spirit ...
We want to burn out all the recent immoral developments in literature , in the theater , and in the press — in short , we want to burn out the poison of immorality which has entered into our whole life and culture as a result of liberal excess during the past ... ( few ) years . "
— Adolf Hitler , quoted in : The Speeches of Adolf Hitler , 1922 - 1939 , Vol. 1 " We were convinced that the people need and require this faith .

Here 's a list of banned books in Germany , 1932 - 1939 " As for the Jews , I am just carrying on with the same policy which the Catholic Church has adopted for fifteen hundred years , when it has regarded the Jews as dangerous and pushed them into ghettos etc. , because it knew what the Jews were like .

This is why we refer to divine creation as special creation .
We cannot discover by scientific investigations anything about the creative processes used by God . "
— Duane Gish , Evolution , The Fossils Say No! p. 42 " The body of scientific evidence supporting creation science is as strong as that supporting evolution .
In fact , it may be stronger …
The evidence for evolution is far less compelling than we have been led to believe .
Evolution is not a scientific “ fact , ” since it cannot actually be observed in a laboratory .
Rather , evolution is merely a scientific theory or “ guess . ” …
It is a very bad guess at that .
The scientific problems with evolution are so serious that it could accurately be termed a “ myth . ” "

For the religious beliefs of the U.S. Founding Fathers , see The Founding Fathers Were Not Christians by Steven Morris " There is no reason for believing that any sort of gods exist , and quite good reasons for believing that they do not exist and never have .

It would be a joke of cosmic proportions if it were n't so tragic . "
— Richard Dawkins
" Science shares with religion the claim that it answers deep questions about origins , the nature of life , and the cosmos .
But there the resemblance ends .
Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence , and they get results .
Myths and faiths are not and do not . "
— Richard Dawkins , River out of Eden " The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is , at bottom , no design , no purpose , no evil , no good , nothing but pitiless indifference . "
— Richard Dawkins , ibid .
" Since all organisms inherit all their genes from their ancestors , rather than from their ancestors ' unsuccessful contemporaries , all organisms tend to possess successful genes .
They have what it takes to become ancestors — and that means to survive and reproduce .
This is why organisms tend to inherit genes with a propensity to build a well - designed machine — a body that actively works as if it is striving to become an ancestor .
That is why birds are so good at flying , fish so good at swimming , monkeys so good at climbing , viruses so good at spreading .
That is why we love life and love sex and love children .
It is because we all , without a single exception , inherit all of our genes from an unbroken line of successful ancestors .
The world becomes full of organisms that have what it takes to become ancestors .
That , in a sentence , is Darwinism . "
— Richard Dawkins , ibid . p. 2 " I am very hostile to religion because it is enormously dominant , especially in American life .
And I do n't buy the argument that , well , it 's harmless .
I think it is harmful , partly because I care passionately about what 's true . "
— Richard Dawkins
" My last vestige of ' hands off religion ' respect disappeared in the smoke and choking dust of September 11th 2001 , followed by the ' National Day of Prayer , ' when prelates and pastors did their tremulous Martin Luther King impersonations and urged people of mutually incompatible faiths to hold hands , united in homage to the very force that caused the problem in the first place .

" We who are atheists are also a - fairyists , a - teapotists , and a-unicornists , but we do n't have to bother saying so . "
— Richard Dawkins , " Free Inquiry " Summer , 2002 " The alternative which I favor is to renounce all euphemisms and grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself , precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia .
Critical mass may be harder to achieve than with some non-confrontational euphemism , but if we did achieve it with the dread word atheist , the political impact would be all the greater . "

" Although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin , Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist . "

" Natural selection is the blind watchmaker , blind because it does not see ahead , does not plan consequences , has no purpose in view .
Yet the living results of natural selection overwhelmingly impress us with the appearance of design as if by a master watchmaker , impress us with the illusion of design and planning . "
— Richard Dawkins , ibid .
" Another meme of the religious meme complex is called faith .
It means blind trust the absence of evidence , even in the teeth of evidence .
The story of Doubting Thomas is told , not so that we shall admire Thomas , but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison .
Thomas demanded evidence .
Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence .
The other apostles , whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence , are held up to us as worthy of imitation .
The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry . "
— Richard Dawkins , The Selfish Gene " [ It ] is capable of driving people to such dangerous folly that faith seems to me to qualify as a kind of mental illness . "

" You can not be both sane and well educated and disbelieve in evolution .
The evidence is so strong that any sane , educated person has got to believe in evolution . "
— Richard Dawkins , " My Short Interview with Richard Dawkins " by Lanny Swerdlow " Evolution is a fact , as securely established as any in science , and he who denies it betrays woeful ignorance and lack of education , which likely extends to other fields as well .
Evolution is not some recondite backwater of science , ignorance of which would be pardonable .
It is the stunningly simple but elegant explanation of our very existence and the existence of every living creature on the planet . "
— Richard Dawkins
" The distribution of species on islands and continents throughout the world is exactly what you 'd expect if evolution was a fact .
The distribution of fossils in space and in time are exactly what you would expect if evolution were a fact .
There are millions of facts all pointing in the same direction and no facts pointing in the wrong direction . "
— Richard Dawkins , Interview on Salon.com
" In childhood our credulity serves us well .
It helps us to pack , with extraordinary rapidity , our skulls full of the wisdom of our parents and our ancestors .
But if we do n't grow out of it in the fullness of time , our ... nature makes us a sitting target for astrologers , mediums , gurus , evangelists , and quacks .
We need to replace the automatic credulity of childhood with the constructive skepticism of adult science . "

" My respect for the Abrahamic religions went up in the smoke and choking dust of September 11th .
The last vestige of respect for the taboo disappeared as I watched the ' Day of Prayer ' in Washington Cathedral , where people of mutually incompatible faiths united in homage to the very force that caused the problem in the first place : religion .
It is time for people of intellect , as opposed to people of faith , to stand up and say ' Enough ! '
Let our tribute to the dead be a new resolve : to respect people for what they individually think , rather than respect groups for what they were collectively brought up to believe . "

" We are each free to believe what we want , and it ’s my view that the simplest explanation is ; there is no God .
No one created our universe , and no one directs our fate .
This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either .
We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that , I am extremely grateful . "
— Stephen Hawking ; for more of his quotes , see Physics and Cosmology " It is sometimes said that science has nothing to do with morality .

" I 'll tell you what you [ Christians ] did with Atheists for about 1500 years .
You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers , besmirched their reputations , banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind , drove them into exile , humiliated them , seized their properties , arrested them for blasphemy .
You dehumanised them with beatings and exquisite torture , gouged out their eyes , slit their tongues , stretched , crushed , or broke their limbs , tore off their breasts if they were women , crushed their scrotums if they were men , imprisoned them , stabbed them , disembowelled them , hanged them , burnt them alive .
" And you have nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you . "

And yet , this would be no more ridiculous than the world we are living in . "

" The danger of religious faith is that it allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them holy .
Because each new generation of children is taught that religious propositions need not be justified in the way that all others must , civilization is still besieged by the armies of the preposterous .
We are , even now , killing ourselves over ancient literature .

p. 182 " We experience happiness and suffering ourselves ; we encounter others in the world and recognize that they experience happiness and suffering as well ; we soon discover that ' love ' is largely a matter of wishing that others experience happiness rather than suffering ; and most of us come to feel that love is more conducive to happiness , both our own and that of others , than hate .
There is a circle here that links us to one another : we each want to be happy ; the social feeling of love is one of our greatest sources of happiness ; and love entails that we be concerned for the happiness of others .
We discover that we can be selfish together . "

There is in fact , no worldview more reprehensible in its arrogance than that of a religious believer : ' the creator of the universe takes an interest in me , loves me , and will reward me after death ; my current beliefs , drawn from scripture , will remain as the best statement of the truth until the end of the world ; everyone who disagrees with me will spend an eternity in hell ....'
An average Christian in an average church , listening to an average Sunday sermon has achieved a level of arrogance simply unimaginable in scientific discourse — and there have been some extremely arrogant scientists . "
— Sam Harris , Letter to a Christian Nation , pp. 74-75
" While believing strongly , without evidence , is considered a mark of madness or stupidity in any other area of our lives , faith in God still holds immense prestige in our society .
Religion is the one area of our discourse where it is considered noble to pretend to be certain about things no human being could possibly be certain about .
It is telling that this aura of nobility extends only to those faiths that still have many subscribers .
Anyone caught worshipping Poseidon , even at sea , will be thought insane . "
— Sam Harris , ibid .
" It is time that we admitted that faith is nothing more than the license religious people give one another to keep believing when reasons fail . "
— Sam Harris , ibid .
" Morality and values depend on the existence of conscious minds — and specifically on the fact that such minds can experience various forms of well - being and suffering in this universe .
Conscious minds and their states are natural phenomena , of course , fully constrained by the laws of Nature ( whatever these turn out to be in the end ) .
Therefore , there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science .
On this view , some people and cultures will be right ( to a greater or lesser degree ) , and some will be wrong , with respect to what they deem important in life . "
— Sam Harris , synopsis of The Moral Landscape For many more insightful quotes by Sam Harris , see Goodreads .
" Religion is poison because it asks us to give up our most precious faculty , which is that of reason , and to believe things without evidence .
It then asks us to respect this , which it calls faith . "
— Christopher Hitchens , god is not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything " I am absolutely convinced that religion is the main source of hatred in this world . "
— Christopher Hitchens
" The teachings of Christianity — from vicarious redemption to the love of enemies , no thought for the morrow need be taken , that no thrift or care or family or society or solidarity is necessary — these are immoral teachings that have done and continue to inflict untold moral and physical harm on our species .
And until we outgrow this nonsense , we have no chance of emancipating ourselves . "

" We keep being told that religion , whatever its imperfections , at least instills morality .
On every side , there is conclusive evidence that the contrary is the case and that faith causes people to be more mean , more selfish , and perhaps above all , more stupid . "

— Christopher Hitchens " What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence . " ( a.k.a. Hitchens ' razor )
— Christopher Hitchens " [ Religion ] attacks us in our deepest integrity — the core of our self - respect .
Religion says that we would not know right from wrong , we would not know an evil , wicked act from a decent human act without divine permission , without divine authority or without , even worse , either the fear of a divine punishment or the hope of a divine reward .
It strips us of the right to make our own determination , as all humans always have , about what is and what is not a right human action . "
— Christopher Hitchens " Gullibility and credulity are considered undesirable qualities in every department of human life — except religion . "
— Christopher Hitchens
" Why are we praised by godly men for surrendering our ' godly gift ' of reason when we cross their mental thresholds ? "
— Christopher Hitchens " Atheism strikes me as morally superior , as well as intellectually superior , to religion .

" Science is only truly consistent with an atheistic worldview with regards to the claimed miracles of the gods of Judaism , Christianity and Islam .

" At present there is not a single credible established religion in the world . "
— George Bernard Shaw , from " Major Barbara " " Is God willing to prevent evil , but not able ?
Then he is not omnipotent .
Is he able , but not willing ?
Then he is malevolent .
Is he both able and willing ?
Then whence cometh evil ?
Is he neither able nor willing ?
Then why call him God ? "
— Epicurus ( c. 341-270 BCE ) , Greek philosopher " Either God wants to abolish evil , and cannot ; or he can and does not want to .
If he wants to , but cannot , he is impotent .
If he can , but does not want to , he is wicked .
If , as they say , God can abolish evil , and God really wants to do it , why is there evil in the world ? "

If there are gods and they are just , then they will not care how devout you have been , but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by .
If there are gods , but unjust , then you should not want to worship them .
If there are no gods , then you will be gone , but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones . "

" For me , it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion , however satisfying and reassuring . "
— Carl Sagan ( 1934 -1996 )
" The significance of our lives and our fragile planet is then determined only by our own wisdom and courage .
We are the custodians of life 's meaning .
We long for a Parent to care for us , to forgive us our errors , to save us from our childish mistakes .
But knowledge is preferable to ignorance .
Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable .
If we crave some cosmic purpose , then let us find ourselves a worthy goal . "
— Carl Sagan , Pale Blue Dot : A Vision of the Human Future in Space " If some good evidence for life after death were announced , I 'd be eager to examine it ; but it would have to be real scientific data , not mere anecdote .
As with the face on Mars and alien abductions , better the hard truth , I say , than the comforting fantasy .
And in the final tolling it often turns out that the facts are more comforting than the fantasy . "
— Carl Sagan
" Atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist , and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud .
Atheism is an attitude , a frame of mind that looks at the world objectively , fearlessly , always trying to understand all things as a part of nature . "

— Carl Sagan
" I would love to believe that when I die I will live again , that some thinking , feeling , remembering part of me will continue .
But much as I want to believe that , and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife , I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking ... there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there 's little good evidence . "
— Carl Sagan , " Parade Magazine , " March 1996 " Positive claims require positive evidence .
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . "
— Carl Sagan
" If faith is a valid tool of knowledge , then anything can be true ' by faith , ' and therefore nothing is true .
If the only reason you can accept a claim is by faith , then you are admitting that the claim does not stand on its own merits . "
— Dan Barker , of Freedom From Religion Foundation " I have something to say to the religionist who feels atheists never say anything positive :
You are an intelligent human being .
Your life is valuable for its own sake .
You are not second - class in the universe , deriving meaning and purpose from some other mind .
You are not inherently evil — you are inherently human , possessing the positive rational potential to help make this a world of morality , peace and joy .
Trust yourself . "
— Dan Barker , Losing Faith in Faith : From Preacher to Atheist , 1992 " You believe in a book that has talking animals , wizards , witches , demons , sticks turning into snakes , food falling from the sky , people walking on water , and all sorts of magical , absurd and primitive stories , and you say that we are the ones that need help ? "
— Dan Barker , ibid .
" There is not a single contemporary historical mention of Jesus , not by Romans or by Jews , not by believers or by unbelievers , during his entire lifetime .
This does not disprove his existence , but it certainly casts great doubt on the historicity of a man who was supposedly widely known to have made a great impact on the world .
Someone should have noticed . "
— Dan Barker , ibid. p. 360 " There is no evidence for a god , no coherent definition of a god , no good argument for a god , good positive arguments against a god , no agreement among believers about the nature or moral principles of a god , and no need for a god .
We can live happy , moral , productive lives without such belief , and we can do it better . "
— Dan Barker
" It is a fact of history and of current events that human beings exaggerate , misinterpret , or wrongly remember events .
They have also fabricated pious fraud .
Most believers in a religion understand this when examining the claims of other religions . "

— Steve Benson , grandson of Ezra Taft Benson , president of the Mormons ( 1985 - 1994 ) " If , as the true believers claim , the word ' gospel ' means good news , then the good news for me is that there is no gospel , other than what I can define for myself , by observation and conscience .
As a freethinking human being , I have come not to favor or fear religion , but to face and fight it as an impediment to civilized advancement . "

" There is no room in science for the arbitrary meddling of an unknown force or being that intervenes who - knows - when to do who - knows - what for who - knows - why and who - knows - how .
That ’s not science ; that ’s just magic . "
— Austin Cline " I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation , whose purposes are modeled after our own — a God , in short , who is but a reflection of human frailty .
Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body , although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms . "
— Albert Einstein ( 1879 -1955 ) , quoted in The New York Times obituary , 4/19/1955
" It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "
— Albert Einstein , 1954 , Albert Einstein : The Human Side " I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities , for which only He Himself can be held responsible ; in my opinion , only His nonexistence could excuse Him . "

" The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature .

— Albert Einstein , Science and Religion , 1941 " From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am , of course , and have always been an atheist . "
— Albert Einstein , letter to Guy Raner Jr , 1945 " I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one . "
— Albert Einstein , letter to Guy Raner Jr , 1949 " The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the Bible a collection of honorable , but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish . "
— Albert Einstein , letter to Eric Gutkind , 1/3/1954
" For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions . "
— Albert Einstein , ibid .
" It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I can not take seriously .
I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere .
…
Science has been charged with undermining morality , but the charge is unjust .
A man 's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties ; no religious basis is necessary .
Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death . "
— Albert Einstein , " Religion and Science " , 1930 " The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature .
For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events . "
— Albert Einstein , " Science and Religion " , 1941 " If this being is omnipotent , then every occurrence , including every human action , every human thought , and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work ; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being ?
In giving out punishment and rewards
He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself .
How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him ? "
— Albert Einstein , Out Of My Later Years
" If people are good only because they fear punishment , and hope for reward , then we are a sorry lot indeed . "
— Albert Einstein " During the youthful period of mankind 's spiritual evolution , human fantasy created gods in man 's own image who , by the operations of their will were supposed to determine , or at any rate influence , the phenomenal world ...
The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old conception of the gods . "
— Albert Einstein
" The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances , the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life , and the fear of death , and blind faith , but through striving after rational knowledge . "
— Albert Einstein
" The minority , the ruling class at present , has the schools and press , usually the Church as well , under its thumb .
This enables it to organize and sway the emotions of the masses , and make its tool of them . "

" Intellectual honesty is a skill that has to be learned and a virtue that has to be practiced ; it often requires you to accept unpleasant conclusions . "
— John B. Hodges
" If faith is ' believing what you are told ' , religious ethics is ' doing what you are told ' . "
— John B. Hodges " Religion is for people who have never matured in their understanding of ethics .
Religion teaches a child 's view of ethics , that ' being good ' means ' obeying your parent . '
It gives a moral blank check to those bold enough , dishonest enough , to claim to speak for God .
Atheism means looking at ethical questions as an adult among other adults , considering ethics as a means of maintaining peace and cooperation among equals , so that all may pursue happiness within the limits that ethics defines . "
— John B. Hodges " [ Religion is ] nothing more than a type of submission to authority . "
— Paul Broca
" Christianity preaches only servitude and dependence .
Its spirit is so favorable to tyranny that it always profits by such a regime .
True Christians are made to be slaves , and they know it and do not much mind : this short life counts for too little in their eyes . "

— Shaun Mason

— John Stuart Mill , On Liberty , 1859 " On the available evidence we have about how the world works , we have to say that we ’re alone , there is no God . "
— John Searle , interviewed in " Free Inquiry " 1998 " Public prayer is not intended to promote religious values , but to enhance the authority of some churches and some political views over others .
Similarly with the posting of the Ten Commandments .
It is about power , not about religion .
Government by Christian or Islamic or any other faith has rarely been progressive .
And the Constitution clearly intends that there should be freedom from religion . "
— Ellery Schempp
" Most true believers , when faced with evidence that contradicts their beliefs , will hold on to those beliefs even more strongly . "
— Mark Thomas , president and co-founder of Atheists of Silicon Valley " True believers are continually shown by reality that their god does n't exist , but have developed extensive coping mechanisms to deal with this cognitive dissonance . "
— Mark Thomas " Fundamentalists of different religions have more in common with each other than they do with the moderates of their own religions . "

Hindus do n't believe in Yahweh or Allah .
Muslims do n't believe in Brahma or Yahweh .

" The world looks like it was designed .
Of course , the Sun also looks like it goes around the Earth .

— Mark Thomas
" We all behave as though what we think is true , is actually true . "
— Mark Thomas
" Believing is easier than thinking ; that 's why there will always be more believers than thinkers .
However , the results of god - belief are often far more mental trials than those of nonbelief .
It is quite difficult to ascertain the wishes of an invisible being . "
— Mark Thomas " Christians often threaten atheists with eternal torture .
But if we say that they 're delusional , they will tell us that we 're being rude . "
— Mark Thomas
" The essence of Christianity , as I see it , is love .
The essence of Humanism ( and I 'm also a Humanist ) is love .
At that level , we 're not far apart . "
— Mark Thomas
" Atheism is nothing more than a conclusion .
There are plenty of people in this world who are Atheists , but this does n't mean we share values .
Communism is a perfect example .
Communism is for all practical purposes , a political religion :
It is totalitarian , it venerates its sainted founders , it has sacred dogma that cannot be challenged ; it persecutes its heretics , it does not brook disobedience , it feels no compunction against twisting science for its own means .
Even its touted " Atheism " is simply a defensive reaction against its rival religions .
It has nothing in common with the free thought of Paine or Jefferson , or the humanism of Dawkins or Einstein . "
— David Fitzgerald
" I 'm a strong atheist .
I believe that gods are by definition supernatural beings , that the supernatural by definition violates natural law , violating natural law is by definition impossible , and impossible things by definition can't exist . "
— James Huber " Morality is doing what is right no matter what you are told .
Religion is doing what you are told no matter what is right . "

More humble and I believe true to consider him created from animals . "
— Charles Darwin , Notebooks , 1837 " I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true ; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe , and this would include my Father , Brother and almost all my best friends , will be everlastingly punished .
And that is a damnable doctrine . "
— Charles Darwin , Autobiography
" That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes .
Which is more likely , that pain and evil are the result of an all - powerful and good God , or the product of uncaring natural forces ?
The presence of much suffering agrees well with the view that all organic beings have been developed through variation and natural selection . "
— Charles Darwin
" The assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for his existence .
But this is a rash argument , as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits , only a little more powerful than man ; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent deity . "
— Charles Darwin , The Descent of Man , 1871 " There is grandeur in this view of life , with its several powers , having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one ; and that , whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity , from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been , and are being , evolved . "
— Charles Darwin , On the Origin of Species , Chapter 14 " It appears to me ( whether rightly or wrongly ) that direct arguments against Christianity and theism produce hardly any effect on the public ;
It appears to me freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men ’s minds which follow [s ] from the advance of science . "
— Charles Darwin , 1880 " Science is advanced by proposing and testing hypothesis , not by declaring questions unsolvable . "

" It 's always better to tell the truth .
The truth does n't hurt , and saying that , my mother only ever lied to me about one thing .

She thought if I was God-fearing , then I 'd be good . "

" If there is a supreme being , he 's crazy . "
— Marlene Dietrich ( 1901 - 1992 )
" The most serious demand for unquestioned belief is , of course , the atonement .
First the believer is to suspend familiar notions of justice , such as punishment for the guilty as opposed to an innocent party .
You are then expected to accept the necessity of blood sacrifice for sin ; that wrongdoing must be paid for , and not necessarily in proportion to the crime .
A father 's sacrifice of his innocent son is supposed to be not only just but generous and wonderful .
Then the temporary three - day death of this one person is supposed to wipe out all the wrongdoing and ineptitude of a species .
And finally , you should believe that all you need do to erase responsibility for your actions and enter a haven of eternal reward is to believe .
It 's no wonder that once a convert has wrapped his or her mind around this story , anything can be accepted as truth .
The rest of fundamentalist doctrine can be easily swallowed , including Jonah . "

Everyone loves to hate television ads for prescription drugs .
But now , several members of Congress are seeking some restrictions on the commercials .
For example , Representative Henry Waxman , the California Democrat , wants to allow the Food and Drug Administration to bar consumer advertisements for newly approved drugs until they have proved safe in real - world use .
Another Democrat , James P. Moran of Virginia is sponsoring a House bill that would ban ads for prescription sexual aids like Viagra and Levitra from prime - time television , on decency grounds .
Defenders of the direct - to - consumer drug advertising say this is a way to educate consumers and let them know of medical advances .
But some critics say the ads do great harm , and reflect a pharmaceutical industry that has run amok .
How much harm to prescription drug ads do to consumers ?
Are these ads a valuable way to educate people ?
These Ads Are Absurd

She is the author of
“ The Truth About the Drug Companies : How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It . ”
Do we ask the Ford dealer whether his cars are any good ?
Direct - to - consumer prescription drug advertising does exactly what it is intended to do — increase sales for drug companies .
Increasingly , it does that by promoting medical conditions , as well as drugs .
If the industry can convince essentially normal people that minor complaints require long - term drug treatment , its market will grow .
The argument that ads educate consumers is self - evidently absurd .
No one should look to an investor - owned company for objective , unbiased information about products it sells .
Do we ask the Ford dealer whether his cars are any good ?
Back Off Congress
Ronald Bailey , Reason magazine ’s science correspondent , is the author of “ Liberation Biology : The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution . ”
A noisy cadre of medical paternalists evidently believes that consumers will mindlessly gobble down any old pink or blue pill that greedy pharmaceutical companies want to sell them .
Thus opponents of direct - to - consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals — including some members of Congress — want to protect gullible consumers by banning or limiting such ads .
Opponents of direct - to - consumer drug ads chiefly dislike them because they work .
The plain fact is that opponents of these ads chiefly dislike them because they work .
Drug ads clearly do inform and educate patients .
Research shows that direct - to - consumer advertising empowers patients by helping them identify their conditions and enables them to take more responsibility for their health care .
In addition , drug advertising makes some consumers aware of the fact that their ailments may have effective treatments and encourages them to seek them out .

For example , in 2003 , researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital , Harvard University and Harris Interactive reported in the journal Health Affairs the results of a survey of 3,000 adults of the effects of direct - to - consumer drug advertising .
The researchers found that these ads appear “ to affect patients ’ behavior , resulting in more physician visits that detect treatable disease . ”
In fact , the survey established that of the 35 percent of the respondents who discussed these advertisements with their physicians , 25 percent received a new diagnosis .
Nearly half of the new diagnoses involved high priority conditions like arthritis , high cholesterol or diabetes .
In addition , more than half of the respondents reported that their doctors took actions other than prescribing the advertised drug .
“ Despite concerns about DTCA ’s negative consequences , ” conclude the researchers , “ we found no differences in health effects between patients who took advertised drugs and those who took other prescription drugs . ”
Bottom line : back off Congress — drug advertising benefits consumers .
Ban All Pharmaceutical Advertising
James P. Othmer is a former advertising creative director and author of the forthcoming “ Adland : Searching for the Meaning of Life on a Branded Planet . ”
My all - time favorite pharmaceutical ad is for something called R.L.S. ( Restless Leg Syndrome ) a condition whose degree of absurdity is topped only by a drug ’s potential side effects :
“ Tell your doctor if you experience increased gambling , sexual or other urges . ”
Makes one wonder how many evenings that began watching the evening news with a bit of cappuccino - induced leg bouncing — something as innocent as , say , keeping time to the Mirapex jingle — ended in a Vegas hotel room with a bankrupt R.L.S. sufferer snorting coke with a transsexual hooker .
“ Well , I lost every cent of my 401 ( k ) nest egg , and my marriage , and I caught a rare S.T.D .
But at least I no longer have that irritating leg bouncing up and down thingy . ”
Make ads that simply say , if you do n’t feel well , go tell — do n’t ask — your doctor .
If I had a dime for every time I heard the words “ ask your doctor ” or saw a crude clip of phallic imagery during a commercial break from the evening news , or was forced to contemplate a stomach - turning side effect , I ’d be able to afford my own health care .

In fact , relying upon network news pharmaceutical ads as a cultural touchstone , a recent visitor to our planet would think that when we are young our legs can’t stop moving , that we menstruate four times a year , and we are ravaged by S.T.D. ’s ( despite taking great measures not to get pregnant ) , and we are extremely depressed ; when we ’re middle - aged we desperately want to get pregnant but can’t , perhaps because most men can’t achieve an erection ( despite the fact that many others are afflicted with four - hour “ reactions ” ) , and we are also bald , overweight and extremely depressed ; and when we ’re old we are arthritic , forgetful , still depressed , riddled with cancer and either can’t urinate at all or pee so much we have to wear diapers .
The United States and , for some reason , New Zealand , are the only developed countries where direct - to - consumer pharmaceutical advertising is legal .
According to a recent York University report , in 2004 pharmaceutical companies spent twice as much on advertising and promotion ( $ 59.5 billion ) in the U.S. as they did on research and development .
I ’m convinced that if you invented a syndrome — Occasionally Twitchy Toe Syndrome ( O.T.T.S. ) — and put $ 2.5 billion in air time behind it , a market would arise overnight .
So , instead of making ads that play off our fears , anxieties and neuroses , for products that need 30 seconds of legal copy for side effects that include death and blindness , not to mention a questionable F.D.A. situation , for syndromes you ’ve never heard of , but sound kind of , you know , familiar , how about this : make ads that simply say , if you do n’t feel well , go tell — do n’t ask — your doctor .
And while they ’re at it , it would be nice if the same lawmakers who recently proposed scrutinizing big pharmaceutical ads took a similar long hard look at the standards and practices of another dubious marketing genre : the political ad .
Encouraging Better Conversations
Julie M. Donohue is an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh .
It seems absurd to think of those funny drug ads we see on TV with their long list of side effects as educational .
The collective wisdom about commercials in general is that they are intended to boost sales through emotional appeals rather than information provision .
In fact , there is a long - standing and unresolved debate among economists about whether advertising informs consumers or manipulates them .
Studies of drug ads show that they tend to overemphasize the benefits of a drug and downplay the risks suggesting limited educational potential .
For the sake of the patient , it ’s better to regulate drug ads than to eliminate them .
Yet to evaluate the educational value of drug ads we need to consider the information currently available to consumers on prescription drugs .
Research shows that consumers trust doctors above all others to provide information on prescription drugs .
Unfortunately research also tells us that doctors and patients spend very little time discussing the relative benefits and risks of drugs ( drug A vs. drug B ; drug vs. lifestyle changes ) .
Read more …
Studies show that physicians often fail to tell patients about side effects they are likely to experience from a particular drug , perhaps because they worry patients wo n’t take the drug if they do tell them .
And patients seldom tell their doctors when they stop taking medications as prescribed .
Prescription drug ads clearly increase demand for prescription drugs .
They may also increase the quality of discussions between doctors and patients about pharmacologic treatments , but only if they adhere to Food and Drug Administration ’s standards about fair balance between risks and benefits and stick to what clinical trials say about a drug ’s safety and efficacy .
Unfortunately the F.D.A. has not always been effective at policing drug ads because of a lack of resources .
Proper enforcement of the existing rules governing drug ads may do more to create an informed patient population than severely limiting ads .
The Medicalization of America
Jerry Avorn , an internist and professor of medicine at Harvard , is the author of “ Powerful Medicines : The Benefits , Risks and Costs of Prescription Drugs . ”
Congress allocates the Food and Drug Administration about $ 2.4 billion per year to regulate our foods , drugs and cosmetics , a grossly inadequate budget .
Yet twice that amount is spent by the pharmaceutical industry on direct - to - consumer advertising of its wares .
Something is very wrong here .
It would make more sense for a neutral body to offer information about health issues and disease prevention .
Just as every other industrialized nation has figured out how to provide health care to all their citizens and how to get drug makers to negotiate the prices of their products , each of those countries ( with the exception of New Zealand ) also bans direct - to - consumer advertising for prescription drugs .
Such was the case here too , until 1997 , when pharmaceutical companies persuaded the F.D.A. to remove its long - standing prohibition .
All those other countries have it right , and we do n’t .
Doctors spend precious minutes of ever - shorter office visits explaining to patients why their cholesterol drug is every bit as good as the one they saw on television , or why feeling sad at the death of a loved one does n’t require an antidepressant .
Hawking medications to the public encourages rapid adoption of new products that may be no better — or even worse — than older , unadvertised generic drugs .

That happened with Vioxx , whose $ 100 million direct - to - consumer advertising budget drove its use by 20 million Americans before it was found to nearly double the risk of heart attack or stroke .
Since this advertising promotes only the most expensive products , it drives prescription costs up and also encourages the “ medicalization ” of American life — the sense that pills are needed for most everyday problems that people notice , and many that they do n’t .
A few of these ads have some educational value , but it would make more sense for a neutral body to offer this information ( about heart disease prevention or erections ) rather than have messages hawking one particular product .
Who would pay for that ?
The same people who end up footing the bill for direct - to - consumer advertising now : the American public .
Unfortunately , the genie is probably out of the bottle on this .
The industry and its allies in Congress will whine about the First Amendment to defend their right to advertise , and will probably win .
Nor is taxing those ads likely to survive a legal challenge .
Our best hope is for a newly emboldened F.D.A. to require the companies to provide a much fairer depiction of risks and benefits in these ads — something that is clearly within its power .
But as long as the nation spends $ 2 on these drug ads for every $ 1 spent on the agency regulating the industry , this combination of promotional incontinence and federal impotence will continue to generate considerable depression .
Other Ways to Promote a Brand
Robin Raj is the founder and executive creative director of Citizen Group , which focuses on developing pro-social marketing campaigns .
Clients include Amnesty International , Cisco , the Natural Resources Defense Council and Rock The Vote .
Drug advertising functions the way most television advertising does — that is , marketers promote their products largely at a surface level .
And therein lies the reason and moral imperative to do better .
Pharmaceutical manufacturers spend billions to hawk their pills ( $ 4.8 billion last year , according to Nielsen ) to drive brand awareness and memorability restrained only by mandatory Food and Drug Administration disclaimers to avoid liability .
But selling , say , Cialis like soap is n’t necessarily in the public interest .
Current pharmaceutical advertising is nothing more than one - way directed spin .
Can it be harmful ?
Potentially .
Is it good for us ?
Not really .
The drug makers in general rarely make more than shallow attempts at consumer education .
Their efforts are primarily driven by the profit motive , not the health motive .
So why are we paying the bill for their ads while the drug companies receive taxpayer subsidies ?
This fact strikes me as particularly galling and appalling given the immense health care issues this country faces .

I actually believe drug companies could do well by doing good if they took a more active role in promoting health prevention and wellness through nontraditional , more targeted and contextual media .
They could build brand awareness , goodwill and perhaps greater trust if they financed more community - based efforts , online and on the ground , in an open and transparent way .
Current pharmaceutical advertising is nothing more than one - way directed spin .
While it will never substitute for a doctor ’s advice , deeper information — and creating an open channel for conversation and connections about the health topic and the drug itself — could go a long way toward providing transparency and true education , even illumination about one ’s health condition .
This , and requiring a trial period for drugs that are introduced to the market before deploying massive broadcast budgets , would stand in stark contrast to the current practice of merely driving demand for drugs , for conditions we may not have even known we had .
Entertaining but Out of Control
John Mack is the editor and publisher of Pharma Marketing News and Pharma Marketing Blog .
The topic of direct - to - consumer advertising is a never - ending source of fodder for me , as well as other bloggers .
I ’m especially fond of those silly ads that feature dead presidents , beavers and bees .
Very entertaining indeed , but are they educational ?
Not on your life !
The industry pushes the envelope by overstating benefits and playing down the risks .
Supporters of this type of advertising often cite the educational benefit it provides to potential patients .
Indeed , a speaker at a recent industry conference raised the ante on the educational merit of these ads by suggesting that we “ look abroad , ” where there are no such ads , and “ measure the health literacy to see the potential impact . ”
I took the challenge , did some research and found a report that compared health literacy in the U.S. and in Canada .
Canadians scored significantly higher than Americans .
Does this destroy the educational argument in support of direct - to - consumer advertising ?
Not necessarily .
There is a difference between health literacy and being “ educated ” about a drug .

As for doing harm to consumers , I only need to quote the F.D.A. ’s recently released “ Draft Guidance on Presenting Risk Information in Prescription Drug and Medical Device Promotion , ” which states : Consumers have preconceived ideas about the amount of scrutiny these ads undergo .
Many believe F.D.A. exercises tight regulatory control over the content of these ads and to some extent , believe that all ads have been prereviewed prior to airing .
As a result , consumers are likely to expect that the most relevant risks have been included in the ad .
I am not against prescription drug advertising , but it ’s hard to defend it when the industry pushes the envelope by overstating benefits and playing down the risks .
That has got to stop .
The Vioxx Scandal
Greg Critser is the author of “ Fat Land , ” “ Generation Rx ” and the forthcoming “ Eternity Soup . ”
In his lone dissent from the 1976 Supreme Court case that enabled drug companies to advertise , Justice William Rehnquist observed that “ the societal interest against the promotion of drug use for every ill , real and imaginary , seems to me exceptionally strong . ”
It would be hard to find a better example than the case of Vioxx , the Merck pain killer .
The F.D.A. should use its powers to slow down blitz campaigns and attend to the ‘ societal interest . ’
Vioxx , a COX - 2 inhibitor , was originally approved for use by a small but important group of pain sufferers : those who had sensitive stomachs .
Yet Merck ’s multimillion - dollar ad campaign went much further , repeatedly asserting in ads and media coverage that Vioxx was also better at controlling pain than existing ( inexpensive ) anti-inflammatories .
It was n’t .
And so the skating star Dorothy Hamill was drafted for a new campaign promoting Vioxx for osteo - arthritis .
“ This is my favorite time to skate , ” Ms. Hamill declared in one Merck ad , swirling on the ice .
“ But it ’s also the time when the pain and stiffness of osteo - arthritis can be at their worst . ”
The four - day testing period the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) commonly uses to determine safe levels of pesticide exposure for humans and animals could fail to account for the toxins ' long - term effects , University of Pittsburgh researchers report in the September edition of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry .
The team found that the highly toxic pesticide endosulfan — a neurotoxin banned in several nations but still used extensively in U.S. agriculture — can exhibit a " lag effect " with the fallout from exposure not surfacing until after direct contact has ended .
Lead author Devin Jones , a recent Pitt biological sciences graduate , conducted the experiment under Rick Relyea , an associate professor of biological sciences in Pitt 's School of Arts and Sciences , with collaboration from Pitt post - doctoral researcher John Hammond .
The team exposed nine species of frog and toad tadpoles to endosulfan levels " expected and found in nature " for the EPA 's required four - day period , then moved the tadpoles to clean water for an additional four days , Jones reported .
Although endosulfan was ultimately toxic to all species , three species of tadpole showed no significant sensitivity to the chemical until after they were transferred to fresh water .
Within four days of being moved , up to 97 percent of leopard frog tadpoles perished along with up to 50 percent of spring peeper and American toad tadpoles .
Of most concern , explained Relyea , is that tadpoles and other amphibians are famously sensitive to pollutants and considered an environmental indicator species .
The EPA does not require testing on amphibians to determine pesticide safety , but Relyea previously found that endosulfan is 1,000 - times more lethal to amphibians than other pesticides .
Yet , he said , if the powerful insecticide cannot kill one the world 's most susceptible species in four days , then the four - day test period may not adequately gauge the long - term effects on larger , less - sensitive species .
" When a pesticide 's toxic effect takes more than four days to appear , it raises serious concerns about making regulatory decisions based on standard four - day tests for any organism , " Relyea said .
" For most pesticides , we assume that animals will die during the period of exposure , but we do not expect substantial death after the exposure has ended .
Even if EPA regulations required testing on amphibians , our research demonstrates that the standard four - day toxicity test would have dramatically underestimated the lethal impact of endosulfan on even this notably sensitive species . "
Andrew Blaustein , a professor in Oregon State University 's nationally ranked Department of Zoology , who is familiar with the Pitt study , said the results raise concerns about standards for other chemicals and the delayed dangers that might be overlooked .
Some of the frog eggs the Pitt team used had been collected by Blaustein 's students for an earlier unrelated experiment , but he had no direct role in the current research .

" The results are somewhat alarming because standards for assessing the impacts of contaminants are usually based on short - term studies that may be insufficient in revealing the true impact , " Blaustein said .
" The implications of this study go beyond a single pesticide and its effect on amphibians .
Many other animals and humans may indeed be affected similarly . "
Tadpoles in the Pitt project spent four days in 0.5 liters of water containing endosulfan concentrations of 2 , 6 , 7 , 35 , 60 , and 296 parts - per- billion ( ppb ) , levels consistent with those found in nature .
The team cites estimates from Australia — where endosulfan is widely used — that the pesticide can reach 700 ppb when sprayed as close as 10 meters from the ponds amphibians typically call home and 4 ppb when sprayed within 200 meters .
The EPA estimates that surface drinking water can have chronic endosulfan levels of 0.5 to 1.5 ppb and acute concentrations of 4.5 to 23.9 ppb .
Leopard frogs , spring peepers , and American toads fared well during the experiment 's first four days , but once they were in clean water , the death rate spiked for animals previously exposed to 35 and 60 ppb .
Although the other six species did not experience the lag effect , the initial doses of endosulfan were still devastating at very low concentrations .
Grey and Pacific tree frogs , Western toads , and Cascades frogs began dying in large numbers from doses as low as 7 ppb , while the same amount killed all green frog and bullfrog tadpoles .
The endosulfan findings build on a 10 - year effort by Relyea to understand the potential links between the global decline in amphibians , routine pesticide use , and the possible threat to humans in the future .
A second paper by Relyea and Jones also in the current Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry expands on one of Relyea 's most notable investigations , a series of findings published in Ecological Applications in 2005 indicating that the popular weed - killer Roundup® is " extremely lethal " to amphibians in concentrations found in the environment .
The latest work determined the toxicity of Roundup Original Max for a wider group of larval amphibians , including nine frog and toad species and four salamander species .
In November 2008 , Relyea reported in Oecologia that the world 's 10 most popular pesticides — which have been detected in nature — combine to create " cocktails of contaminants " that can destroy amphibian populations , even if the concentration of each individual chemical is within levels considered safe to humans and animals .
The mixture killed 99 percent of leopard frog tadpoles and endosulfan alone killed 84 percent .
A month earlier , Relyea published a paper in Ecological Applications reporting that gradual amounts of malathion — the most popular insecticide in the United States — too small to directly kill developing leopard frog tadpoles instead sparked a biological chain reaction that deprived them of their primary food source .
As a result , nearly half the tadpoles in the experiment did not reach maturity and would have died in nature .
Environmentalists and industry representatives pleaded their case with federal regulators Tuesday over rules that would slash toxic emissions from cement kilns , the top source of mercury emissions in California .
The Environmental Protection Agency issued proposed regulations for Portland cement kilns earlier this year , after more than a decade of pressure from environmental groups .
The rules aim to reduce the industry ’s mercury emissions by 81 % to 93 % annually , as well as cut emissions of hydrocarbons , particulate matter and hydrochloric acid .
The EPA projects that the changes could save billions of dollars and hundreds of lives a year , but cement industry officials say they will drive up the price of cement , and may drive the industry to countries with lower pollution standards .
The rules would “ undermine the stability of the domestic cement industry , endangering thousands of jobs and the supply of a basic construction material for uncertain environmental benefits , ” Andy O’Hare , a spokesman for the Portland Cement Assn. , told EPA officials at the hearing in downtown Los Angeles .

“ This regulation will help all Californians breathe easier , particularly the dozens of California communities neighboring cement kilns , ” Otana Jakpor , a Riverside high school student speaking for the American Lung Assn. , told the EPA panel .
“ It will reduce hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic chemicals that harm young people .
And it will do so with technology that already exists . ”
Portland cement kilns , which produce the key ingredient in concrete , account for 90 % of the state ’s airborne mercury , which can affect the nervous system , cognitive function and kidneys , and can cause respiratory failure and death at high exposures , the EPA says .
Cement kilns emit hazardous chemicals as they burn coal , petroleum coke or industrial waste to heat raw materials including limestone ore , which also can contain mercury and other elements .
The process produces “ clinker , ” which is cooled , ground and mixed with gypsum .
In 2008 , high levels of a toxic carcinogen were traced to piles of clinker outside the TXI Riverside cement plant , which has since shut down .
California is the nation ’s largest producer of cement , and houses 11 of the nation ’s 163 Portland cement plants , including the Lehigh Southwest plant in Tehachapi , which has been one of the industry ’s worst mercury polluters .

It 's Saturday night and Steve Carroll sits behind the counter in his suburban video store watching the door and hoping for customers .
Once , back in the " halcyon days " , as Steve calls them , he needed two staff for the hectic Saturday shift .
Now the action mostly comes from Heath Ledger 's maniacal ranting on a wall - mounted TV playing The Dark Knight .
At 5.45 pm , a man and a woman in their twenties walk in .
The man is carrying a basketball and he bounces it on the faded blue carpet a couple of times .
The couple rents two movies : Turn it Up and Saw V . Steve notes this in his computer .
" I just do n't get why you want to watch people getting chopped up , " he remarks after they leave .
" I mean , if you 've seen it once , why do you need to watch it through to part five ? "
Steve is 60 but could easily pass for a decade younger with his brown hair and smooth , round face .
He has owned Top Video in Sydney 's northern suburbs for 13 years .
Conventional wisdom says that during a recession , a business like Steve 's should boom as people look for cheap alternatives to going out .
But that 's not the case here .
February and March were " simply awful " for Steve , and April only marginally better .
The economic downturn and new technology will probably close his business .
" I do n't see it lasting more than two or three years , " he says .
" At 60 , it 's gonna be pretty difficult .
It 's maybe not the way I would have hoped things would turn out . "
At 5.50 pm , a young woman asks Steve what Burn After Reading is like .
" It 's a good show , " he tells her .
She chews her lip .
" Should I get Burn After Reading or The Dark Knight ? " she asks .
Steve advises the former and she gives him $ 7.50 for the overnight rental .
" My husband 's not going to be happy , he told me to bring home The Dark Knight , " she says as she walks out .
As Steve puts the cover of Burn After Reading back on display , another customer asks for Finding Nemo .
Steve tells her it's out and she leaves without taking anything else .
Steve bought Top Video after a bout of odd jobs , including painting , labouring and shopfitting .
At first , it was a solid business .
" Videos were once a big novelty , " Steve explains .
" We were the only source of entertainment besides movies .
The saying back then was that people would rent commercials from you , the quality of TV was so bad . "
But over time , the industry changed .
The arrival of payTV , high - speed internet and home gaming systems such as PlayStation and Wii all eroded turnover .
Then , when American networks began producing quality TV series such as The West Wing and The Sopranos , people starting buying DVDs instead of renting them .
Steve estimates that for the past decade , his business has shrunk by a tenth each year .
The financial crisis is yet another body blow .
In March , Paul Uniacke , the biggest franchiser of video stores in Australia through Blockbuster and Video Ezy , predicted that about two hundred such businesses would close this year .
Steve is doing his best to avoid becoming one of them .
He just spent $ 1200 on a letterbox drop to 10,000 local homes offering a bargain subscription package .
After failing to elicit a single response , he persuaded his landlord to give him a 50 % rent cut .
Steve thinks the landlord agreed for fear he would n't find another tenant .
The baker around the corner from Top Video has already folded and the shopfront sits empty months later , a dead cockroach visible on the floor through the window .
At 6.05 pm , a man wearing white sneakers and a gold chain around his neck strolls in with his girlfriend and takes all three Godfather films .
He leans on the counter as Steve processes the rentals .
" He 's the greatest film character ever , Corleone , " the customer declares .
" I also heard that Marlon Brando was the greatest actor , " Steve replies .
The customer disagrees and launches into a ten - minute monologue covering Brando , the history of Citizen Kane , the genius of Clerks , the merits of French New Wave cinema and , finally , an endorsement of The Bicycle Thief .
He leaves only when his girlfriend literally drags him out of the store .
" That happens all the time but you have to be convivial , " Steve explains .
" I 'm like a mentor here , a therapist , people come in and tell me their life stories .
This woman came in the other week and she started to cry over a couple of late rentals .
You know it 's not really about that .
Then she goes , ‘ Steve , I just got home and Ray 's completely cleaned me out . ' "
As if to prove Steve 's point , a teenage girl puts an Agatha Christie film on the counter .
" Is that for your mum ? "
Steve asks .
" No , it 's for me , " she says .
" But I 'm so sick of my parents , what a miserable couple of people ! "
She gives Steve a run-down of their faults and then flounces out .
At 6.25 pm , a man rents Australia .
Five minutes later , a couple clearly waging the standard battle of the sexes rents both the action film Superhero Movie and the chick flick Nights in Rodanthe .
At 6.35 pm , an elderly gentleman requests Death on the Nile .
The hour until 7.30 pm is Steve 's busiest period and he lends about 20 movies .
After that , the customers are scarce .
Steve admits he finds the sitting and waiting dreary and the wasted time troubles him .
He does n't even really like watching the movies he lends , with their dreams that always come true and their heroes who always emerge triumphant .
" You pay the rent , you pay the bills , you think you might try something else , but you never do , " Steve says .
" People tell you that you can chase your dreams , that you can do anything , but you can 't . "
Steve left high school after second year so he always felt his options were limited .
He knows what he would be if he had his time over : " A journalist because I 've always had a lot to say .
And I like cooking .
I could have done something with cooking . "
The final rental of the evening comes at 7.55 pm .
A man in his thirties takes In Bruges .
After that , there 's nobody .
Steve puts some returned films back on display and then sits alone at his counter .
He is supposed to close at 8.30 pm , but by 8.20 pm , when he has not seen a customer for half an hour , he decides he may as well go home .
He turns off the lights and closes the door behind him .
He 's made no more than $ 200 .
Not much of a Hollywood ending , but he 's had worse Saturday nights .
By Catherine Burns
Newsbeat reporter in Hailsham , near Eastbourne
Alfie 's story has been front page news in many newspapers Alfie Patten , 13 , has said he 's going to have a DNA test to prove he is a father .
His girlfriend , 15 - year - old Chantelle Steadman , gave birth to a girl last week .
Now it looks like the couple could make big money selling their story .
Alfie Patten 's family have a big house on a quiet leafy street .
You can tell a mile off that children live here .
There are footballs floating in the pond , and piles of dirty trainers and rollerskates outside the front door .
It looks as if someone is inside - you can see the TV flickering in the kitchen .
No -one is answering the door though .
Alfie says he 's convinced that he is baby Maisie 's dad and that he 'll stand by his girlfriend .
But the 13 - year - old is also going to take a DNA test to be 100 % sure .
Gossip Hailsham 's high street is about a mile up the road , and everywhere you go people seem to be talking about this story .
Some locals are sitting in a coffee shop , swapping theories about Alfie and his girlfriend .
And it 's the same on the shopping precinct .
Thirteen - year - old Elijah says he knows Chantelle and feels sorry for her : " They need to live their lives .
They 're not going to live their lives now they 've got a baby . "
His mum Helen agrees : " 13 and 15 - year - olds should n't be doing that sort of thing . "
But Sarah 's out with her daughter and thinks people should n't overreact : " It does n't really worry me to be honest .
They 're together and that 's the main thing .
Maybe they 'll stay together . "
Under age sex Social services deny claims that they have n't done anything to help .
They say they 've been visiting both families to check how they , and baby Maisie , are doing .
Sixteen - year - old Chloe lives nearby and says there 's a lot of underage sex going on in the area .
" It happens , and no - one 's ever going to be able to stop it .
But he 's only 13 , and they 're not going to be able to bring in any money for at least five years , until he 's qualified to do anything . "
TV programmes and newspapers are already lining up to get Alfie 's story .
His family has signed PR guru Max Clifford to help them and some media experts think they could make up to £ 500,000 .
Chloe thinks that 's sending out the wrong message .
" If they do make loads of money out of it , then other people are going to think , ' I 'll have a baby , I 'll go to the press about it , I 'll get lots of money , and that 's how I 'll make my living . ' "

( Nicole ) MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann is going out of his way to refute the rumors of a deal made between FOX and MSNBC by naming Billo the Clown once again as his Worst Person in the World .
His infraction this time ?
The insinuations by Bill - - all completely unresearched and unconfirmed BY BILLO'S OWN ADMISSION -- that MSNBC parent company GE is under suspicion for supplying parts found in roadside bombs , purportedly placed there by Iranian forces .
So he smeared a company which he had previously threatened with public blackmail .
You can talk all you want about feuds and cease - fires and childishness .
But if I or any actual reporter like me had gotten as much wrong in any story as Bill O'Reilly got wrong in this one , I 'd be fired in 15 minutes , as he should be now .
Silly rabbit .
No one actually thinks Billo the Blowhard is a reporter , do they ?
He 's a talking head .
And as we 've seen time after time from Fox News Channel , the heads need only talk , not have a brain , much less report facts .
Facts have a liberal bias , Keith , and that 's something you 'll NEVER find on Fox News .
Transcripts below the fold
That 's next , but first time for COUNTDOWN 's number two story , tonight 's worst persons in the world .
The bronze to Boss Limbaugh , once again interrupting his new compare everybody to Hitler radio show to bleep that everybody else is comparing him to Hitler .
" You people are out calling us Nazis , saying we 're running around with Swastikas .
We get tarred and feathered as Nazis because we do n't just bend over , grab the ankles and let you guys ram whatever down our throats you want . "
I always knew Mr. Limbaugh had problems with reality and logic , but this misunderstanding of anatomy is news .
The runner - up - here we go again - Lou Dobbs and the self - destruction tour .
He said former DNC Chairman Howard Dean was guilty of advancing liberal fascism .
Then Dobbs added , " I thought we had gotten rid of this left wing pest .
He 's a bloodsucking leftist .
I mean , you got to put a stake through his heart to stop this guy . "
He then issued one of those apologies in which he denies the murderous imagery was his responsibility .
" I 'm sorry if a Bram Stoker allusion is too literary for some .
And for those who could not make what was seemingly an obvious connection , my deepest apologies , and I gladly withdraw the latter part of my remark . "
Howard Dean 's brother , Jim , chairman of the Democracy for America activist group has emailed his entire membership .
It , in turn , issued a statement calling on his radio syndicator and CNN to fire Lou Dobbs .
And tonight 's worst , Bill O'Reilly , who stepped in it this time .
After trying to blackmail people for two months with some story about the involvement of the parent company of this network , GE , in roadside bombs , IEDs found in Iraq , Bill - O made one gigantic mistake .
He said last night , " sources tell the Factor there 's a federal investigation under way to find out if any American company has sold components for roadside bombs to nefarious people .
In May 2008 and again in October of ' 08 , coalition forces discovered unexploded roadside bombs in Iraq and handed them over to the FBI bureau in Baghdad .
The FBI then discovered that radio frequency modules inside the bombs were part of a shipment made by a U.S. company to Corezing International , a business in Singapore with direct ties to Iran .
" Now , the FBI will not comment .
The Factor has been told but cannot confirm that the General Electric corporation is under suspicion in the case . "
So you 've got an unconfirmed report of an unconfirmed investigation , and you 've got an unconfirmed report that GE is under suspicion in your unconfirmed report of your unconfirmed investigation .
Do you have any facts at all ?
Well , there is a company called Corezing , and there are parts called radio frequency modules .
However , a GE spokesman told the Associated Press today that it has never done any business with the Corezing company .
And according to the spokesman , GE also does not happen to make the kind of radio frequency modules described by O'Reilly .
So he confirmed no facts about any investigation , no facts about GE being investigated .
He got the elemental details about whether GE ever dealt with Corezing wrong .
And he did n't bother to check whether the components at issue were even made by GE , which they are not .
So he smeared a company which he had previously threatened with public blackmail .
You can talk all you want about feuds and cease - fires and childishness .
But if I or any actual reporter like me had gotten as much wrong in any story as Bill O'Reilly got wrong in this one , I 'd be fired in 15 minutes , as he should be now .

What was your introduction to computers ?
The Wang [ word processing ] system used by my employers .
After that it was a gigantic L - shaped one - and - a - half - desks - size Hewlett - Packard with three eight - inch floppy drives and a weird sliding half - depth monitor with buttons mounted along the screen 's bottom edge .
A friend of mine worked for the City branch of Credit Lyonnais ; they were throwing this out so we salvaged it , he wrote a simple word processing program for it and I used it to write a couple of books until the screen gave out .
Then I bought an Amstrad PCW512 .
Do you use a PC or an Apple Mac ?
Power Mac 4400 /200 at the moment .
Are computers important for your work ? for the world in general ?
Absolutely vital for me : I hated doing second drafts on a typewriter .
Computers and word processor programs made my life a lot easier .
For the world ?
This is a rhetorical question , is n't it ?
What do you use the machine for ?
Writing books and letters .
Plus I have a rather under -used music processing program called MDTU Freestyle , linked up via Midi to a mixer and various sound and FX modules , including my Fender Stratocaster , which I very bravely took an electric drill to in order to fit the Midi pick - up .
Oh , and sometimes I dip into Claris 's drawing facility to design fantasy houses .
Any particular favourite software ?
Civilization 2 ( until I realised I was spending all the time I should have been reading books playing Civ , and threw it in the bin ) ; and Sim City 2000 , until I ditched that too .
Anything you 'd like but can't have yet ?
A combination of the Oxford English Dictionary and Roget 's Thesaurus immediately accessible from Claris .
This may well exist , but I 'm not organised enough to know .
Any favourite websites ?
Having discovered , thanks to Civ 2 , how addicted I can become , I have cunningly stayed off the net .
This is due to change when my parents move in next door ; we 'll keep the net - linked machine over there .
On a desert island , a human or a computer for company ?
As usual , depends on the human .
The computer would have Civ 2 on it , would n't it ?
What do you see in the future for computers ?
Ubiquity .
And consciousness .
Are you worried about the Y2 K bug ?
Us smug Mac owners are n't personally worried - though we are as much at the mercy of infrastructure chaos as anybody else .
So , a little .
Professionally , what 's taking up your time ?
A couple of publicity tours : one for the paperback of Inversions in June , and one in August for the new mainstream novel , The Business .

How people are promoting new sites that are not newsworthy
Hacker News had a news item recently from the maker of the Geek Atlas titled If you build it , they will ignore it .
The post by John Graham was a perfect example of self promotion through selling self promotion tips or a story .
Daniel Markham was one of the first to comment on this post , which you can read here and he brought up something many developers can easily forget after long hours coding .
I ’ve heard ( here ) that the develop - to - promote ratio should be about 1:10 .
In other words , for every hour you spend developing , you should spend about ten promoting .
I believe it .
Part of the big reason I agree 100 % with his comment is that there is no proven path in marketing a new product or idea of any kind and it is even harder to promote a new site that is n’t groundbreaking or controversial .
John Grahams book is actually newsworthy though , a unique idea for a niche market , the easiest material for a reporter or blog author .
His post though is what sites that are not newsworthy can do to gain traffic and attention for their product .
There are thousands of people that are actively trying to market their idea with no budget and no experience and thousands more that have no product yet and all of them enjoy reading positive or insightful posts about promoting products .
Creating a story worth reading can get you a thousand readers in a day and sharp declines in traffic the following days .
It is n’t sustainable by any measure unless your already an excellent writer but those thousands of visits might give you the mention or opening you need to move up on the web .
That ’s what promoting your site is all about is n’t it ?
Moving up to gain visibility from your target audience so you can start getting visitors you did n’t have to take by the hand .
So how am I promoting my free online dating site DiveIntoThePool ?
For starters I ’m paying for my visitors .
Nothing black market mind you but my monthly bill is about the same as a nice car payment , all money is going to pay per click or impression based ads .
The biggest thing this does for a dating site at least is give a nice fresh feeling for all visitors .
Everyday there is someone new so the site is always changing .
I ’m definitely in the red a great deal of money and will be for the foreseeable future but I think it ’s well worth the investment .
Even if I could buy PageRank or SERP for the keywords I want it would n’t be worth it because I hate sites that game the system , they are usually empty of unique content like BigResource ( I wo n’t link to them sorry ) .
Paid ads are n’t for everyone and if the site your starting is n’t newsworthy then you might not have a budget for advertising at all .
After you ’re done submitting to hundreds of directories and link exchanges I ’ve got another suggestion for you .
Become a part of the community where your users live .
For me this means I needed to learn more and more about dating , you do n’t want to go to relevant blogs and then just spam stuff like “ great article , thanks ! ” because that is worthless to both the site your posting to and yourself .
With insightful commentary you will get a better idea about your users and their needs as well as becoming someone recognized around the area by regulars .
I ca n’t say whether or not becoming part of your target community is the silver bullet to promotion on a budget but it feels like the right thing to do so far .
Keep in mind I have n’t received a single new user from any of my blog or forum posts yet and that is n’t the point .
If you have no budget and no prior success the odds are you are n’t known to anyone .
My first press release of sorts was to my friends and collegeus , single people included in there and I did n’t get a single new signup from my own associates !
While the announcement write up was a good experience and it felt good to tell everyone I launched it did n’t provide the site itself and benifit .
I ’ve been researching how to write up a proper press release and Bill Stoller ’s Publicity Insider had a write up on being newsworthy which removed any doubt that publishers have no interest in helping me succeed .
With a new site that is n’t newsworthy I have the competition of thousands of scripts and throw away sites also publishing press releases and I am working on what makes my site unique .
You ca n’t write your first press release in a single sitting and I suggest that you have a few people read over it .
Do n’t have them look for spelling or grammar mistakes just yet because you want to know if they found the press release interesting .
If it is n’t interesting then you need to go back to the drawing board until it is .
The publishers get dozens of press releases a day you must stand out so take your time on this .
There is no single path to marketing a site that did n’t get $ 12 million in venture capital or was n’t paid for with bailout money but hard work and persistence .
Write about your experiences as you have them , become a part of your target community , write insightful commentary and do n’t give up .
I expect this to be a very long trip .
I ’ll be sure to write about it every chance I get and I hope to read about your experiences too .
Got any other ideas to promoting sites that are n’t newsworthy ?
Leave me a comment and let me know !
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China called on the United States to reduce and eventually halt air and sea military surveillance close to its shores after a series of territorial disputes this year .
The request was made during a special session on maritime safety between the two countries ’ militaries on Wednesday and Thursday , Xinhua news agency said on Thursday , citing China ’s Defense Ministry .
Five times this year , Chinese vessels have confronted U.S. surveillance ships in Asian waters , the U.S. Defense Department said in May .
China said the U.S. vessels had intruded its territory .
There has since been a sixth incident .
“ China believes the constant U.S. military air and sea surveillance and survey operations in China ’s exclusive economic zone had led to military confrontations between the two sides , ” the ministry said .
“ The way to resolve China - U.S. maritime incidents is for the U.S. to change its surveillance and survey operations policies against China , decrease and eventually stop such operations . ”
Susan Stevenson , spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing , confirmed the request .
“ Our position has not changed , ” Stevenson said , citing a U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Michele Flournoy statement during a June visit to China that the U.S. “ exercises its freedom of navigation while putting emphasis on taking care to avoid any unwanted incidents . ”
The United States maintains on principle that waters beyond 12 miles offshore are open to all shipping , while China holds that the U.S. should not trespass within its 200 - mile exclusive economic zone .
In March , five Chinese vessels approached the USNS Impeccable in the South China Sea about 75 miles from Hainan Island in March , after hassling that ship , as well as the ocean surveillance ship Victorious in the Yellow Sea , in previous days .
In May , two Chinese fishing vessels confronted the Victorious again .
In June , a Chinese submarine collided with an underground sonar array being towed by the destroyer USS John McCain , near Subic Bay in the Philippines .
The most serious recent confrontation between China and the U.S. was in 2001 , when a U.S. naval surveillance aircraft flying about 70 miles off Hainan collided with a Chinese fighter and was forced to land on Hainan Island .
Pheromones fascinate me , and not only the ones that mediate sexual attraction .
Several months ago I wrote a post about a study that suggests that airborne chemical signals also mediate stress and fear .
Known as alarm pheromones , these chemicals are found in sweat and saliva .
In that experiment , sweat from skydivers ( collected from pads in their armpits ) activated anxiety circuits in the brains of people who sniffed those pads later on .
The fascinating theory : Emotions can be communicated by smell .
It happens unconsciously .
That was just one study , and naysayers are quick to point out that a solitary experiment doth not prove human pheromones are real .
But now there ’s further proof .
Researchers at the Universities of Dusseldorf and Kiel in Germany recently published the results of study based on the sweat smells of 49 stressed - out students after a. ) taking a final oral exam ( stress sweat ) and b. ) exercising ( sport sweat ) .
Sniffing the pads that had been in students ’ armpits , volunteers often could n’t detect an actual odor .
Nor could they tell whether they were smelling stress sweat and sport sweat .
But it turns out that an area of their brains detected the difference .
Only stress sweat — and not sport sweat — triggered brain activity in areas involved in the processing of social emotional stimuli ( fusiform gyrus ) , and empathetic feelings ( insula ) , attention ( thalamus ) .
The implications are fascinating .
Is stress contagious ?
In an emergency situation , it makes sense that we ’re “ wired ” to perceive and respond to the stress of others .
An odor that induces attention and anxiety may help a group to focus together or synchronize a fight - or - flight response .
It ’s particularly interesting that neural circuits associated with empathy — not just attention — were activated .
Are we naturally empathetic creatures ?
Then again , there ’s no proof that the volunteers actually felt more understanding and compassionate when smelling stress sweat even if their brains go through some of the motions .
I suspect empathy is context - dependent .
Further experiments should look into whether volunteers really are more empathetic ( more willing to help a person in distress , for instance ) after smelling stress sweat compared to sport sweat .
If so , this would be further proof that stress sweat is an alarm pheromone , which , by definition , changes the way we behave after we inhale it .
A thought : Could stress sweat induce compassion in autistic people ?
And another thought :
If feelings have smells , is happiness also inhalable , communicable ?
Fellow Patriots ,
Here are some important things to keep in mind when those blood - suckers from the left try to spread their lies about health care !!
Print this out so you can bring it to a town hall .
1. ) If Stephen Hawking lived in England , he ’d be left to die .
Thank God he ’s safe at the University of Cambridge in Massachusetts .
2. ) If the government was capable of ensuring health care for seniors , they would have done it decades ago .
3. ) If we did n’t have a free enterprise health care system in America , then we would not be able to achieve all those advances in medicine funded by the National Institutes of Health .
4. ) When the people of oppressed countries like Canada , Britain , France , Italy , Germany , Sweden , Denmark , Israel , Australia and New Zealand finally get democracy , they can vote out their socialized health care systems .
5. ) England ’s capital is the ultimate proof that national health care kills free enterprise .
That ’s why London has no stock exchange , no banking district , no tabloid newspapers , no big musicals , and no expensive real estate .
6. ) Even the World Health Organization agrees that “ America has the best health care system in the world ” ; the WHO ranks the American health care system at the very top part of its list , right after the first part where 36 other countries rank higher .
7. ) Free enterprise is the greatest system ever invented and government can’t even come close .
What else but private industry could have split the atom , or gotten a man on the moon ?
8. ) If you drove 100 miles on the interstate freeway you still could n’t come up with one good thing that government has done .
9. ) I ’m writing an urgent letter to my Senator about the health - care issue .
I ’m explaining how the government never does anything right .
I ’m sure the Post Office will deliver it in a day or so .
10 . ) The last thing anyone needs is a government official getting involved with health .
I look after my own health .
For example , I always make sure I eat at restaurants rated “ A ” in the window .
11 . ) I really resent the government thinking I need any assistance from them .
I buy my FDA - approved medication on my own .
12 . ) If health care were available to all at government expense , people would over - consume , using it when they do n’t really need it .
As in the common phrase : “ It ’s Saturday night , honey .
Would you rather go to a movie , or shall we have our gallstones removed ? ”
13 . ) For some reason , the lunatic left ca n’t understand that the most important thing in health care is consumer choice .
When you ’re in a car accident and you ’ve lost pints and pints of blood , what you really want to do is to sit down , think over how much you want to spend and where , and comparison - shop .
And if you happen to choose an incompetent surgeon , well , he damn well wo n’t get your business next time , will he ?

A fundraising event to benefit an LGBT community center in Lebanon last week took a surprise turn when stunned audience members were shown graphic photographs of beheaded corpses and images purportedly depicting U.S. soldiers preparing to execute gay Iraqis .
Two gay Iraqi refugees , who declined to use their real names , delivered a presentation at the Human Rights Campaign headquarters July 24 in which they detailed alleged abuses of fellow gay Iraqis while calling on their audience to donate funds to Helem , a Lebanon - based center that works to address the plight of LGBT people in the Middle East .
One of the Iraqis , who goes by the name " Hussam , " showed the audience of about 80 people gruesome images , including shots allegedly of a beheaded man who was gay and another of the victim�s twin brother grieving over the severed head .
While asserting that anti-gay violence in Iraq is often committed by Iraqis , Hussam also said U.S. service members were involved in anti-gay hostility .
For example , he said service members displayed signs in front of their barracks with the words " Fuck Off Fags . "
But the reaction from the audience turned from anger to shock when Hussam said U.S. service members had detained Iraqi civilians perceived to be gay and executed them .
He then showed an image of what appeared to be an American soldier standing in front of a small group of four or five kneeling naked men who were chained together .
Hussam claimed the men were gay Iraqis and that he possessed images of their execution , which he did not show the audience .
Dana Beyer , a transgender activist and Chevy Chase , Md. , resident who attended the event , said she was " appalled " by the images of the atrocities , but especially by the allegation that U.S. service members were murdering gay Iraqis .
" When it comes down to our armed services � who potentially have contributed to atrocities like that , I �m just appalled , " she said .
" And I hope that we will pursue this through the government , through the State Department and through the Department of Defense because this just can�t be left standing . "
Chris Farris , a gay D.C. resident who also attended the event , said he thought the photo was " disturbing and upsetting , " but voiced skepticism about the veracity of Hussam�s claim .
" It �s very difficult for me to believe that my country would allow its military to engage in the conduct that has been apparently documented , " Farris said .
" I would urge the U.S. government to react . "
When confronted by a Blade reporter after the presentation , Hussam said he feared public disclosure of the photos would incite further violence in Iraq and refused to turn over copies of the images .
If U.S. service members executed the Iraqis as alleged , it would constitute a violation of international law under the Geneva Convention or the Uniform Code of Military Justice , depending on the circumstances .
Defense officials couldn�t immediately confirm whether allegations made at the presentation regarding U.S. service members were legitimate .
Air Force Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder , a Pentagon spokesperson , said he isn�t aware of any cases that match the allegations made by Hussam and deferred to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command for further comment .
Army CID spokesperson Jeffrey Castro also said he wasn�t aware of cases of U.S. service members executing Iraqis perceived to be gay , but said he�d investigate the matter .
Christopher Nugent , a D.C. attorney who specializes in U.S. political asylum cases , including cases involving gay Iraqis applying for U.S. asylum , said he , too , was unaware of reports of anti-gay actions by U.S. military forces in Iraq .
Nugent said he is frequently in touch with non-profit organizations and legal groups that provide pro-bono legal services to Iraqi refugees , including gay refugees .
" The anti-gay persecution is greatest among Sunni and Shia militias , " Nugent said , citing reports from non-profit groups operating in Iraq .
No reports have come in indicating U.S. troops are responsible for anti-gay killings , he said .
Numerous sources have reported that Iraqis have allegedly committed human rights abuses against LGBT people in the country .
In April , the New York Times reported that a democratic Iraq coupled with an increase in security allowed an LGBT subculture to emerge , but the response to the new visibility has been " swift and deadly " and multiple victims of violence had been found , mostly men and boys suspected of being gay .
In a congressional fact - finding trip to Iraq at around the same time , gay Rep. Jared Polis ( D - Colo . ) started calling for greater U.S. action in addressing these issues after he learned Iraqi government officials were allegedly involved in human rights abuses against LGBT people .
Sponsors ' shocked � by report
The July 24 event was co-sponsored by HRC , Human Rights Watch , and the National LGBT Bar Association , according to a posting on HRC�s blog .
HRC also listed the International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission as a co-sponsor , but Sarah Tobias , an IGLHRC spokesperson , said her organization wasn�t involved .
Brad Luna , spokesperson for HRC , attended the event and said his organization was " shocked and disturbed " by the report of U.S. military involvement in the persecution of gays in Iraq .
" We 've been working since then to verify and corroborate the claim , but have not thus far been able to do so , " Luna said .
" We take this sort of allegation very seriously and will continue to monitor the situation . "
Scott Long , director of the LGBT Rights Program for Human Rights Watch , an international watchdog group , said he had just returned from a fact - finding trip to the Middle East on behalf of his group�s LGBT rights monitoring efforts .
" I have seen no indication in our research of any involvement of U.S. military personnel in targeted killings of gay Iraqis , " he said .
" I have seen no evidence of these allegations . "
Long said he was in Lebanon two weeks ago and met with gay refugees from Iraq .
" I can certainly vouch for the work that is being done for Iraqi refugees in Lebanon , " he said .
D�Arcy Kemnitz , executive director of the National LGBT Bar Association , attended the event and said she didn�t know about Hussam�s photos before he showed them .
She also said that she didn�t hear Hussam�s allegation that the U.S. military was involved in atrocities and has no copies of the photos he showed .
Still , she vouched for Hussam�s credibility .
" Based upon everything that I know , having worked with him in this kind of volunteer capacity , his credibility is beyond reproach , " she said .
" He�s worked with international human rights groups since the time I�ve known him and before that . "
She said she couldn�t speak to whether the allegations warrant an investigation because , without having heard the remarks herself , she would be basing a decision on " hearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay . "
Kemnitz emphasized that the " whole purpose " of the event last week was to " focus on providing some sort of support for the very few individuals who have been able to get out of Iraq . "
" Individuals getting out of Iraq are incredibly vulnerable and they face extreme hardship as they �re trying to get their refugee [ status ] processed , so that�s why everybody came together in a volunteer capacity to help those guys out , " she said .
She said she�d " just be absolutely heartbroken " if there were any negative consequences for the gay Iraqis seeking asylum .
Eric Wingerter , a public relations consultant working with the National LGBT Bar Association , said he initiated fundraising events in D.C. last weekend on behalf of gay Iraqi refugees .
Wingerter said he learned about the plight of gay Iraqis through the association�s efforts to provide them with free legal assistance .
He said the National LGBT Bar Association is part of a network of legal groups helping gay Iraqis and others through the complex process of applying for U.S. political asylum .
Wingerter said weekend events raised about $ 8,000 , which he would turn over to the Fund For Global Human Rights , a D.C. foundation that has worked in the past with Helem , which is to be the recipient of the funds .
The event at HRC brought in about $ 6,000 , he said , with another $ 1,000 raised at a subsequent event at Nellie�s bar on Sunday .
Wingerter said he expected a further direct contribution from Nellie�s based on bar receipts .
According to Wingerter , Helem is playing a key role in helping LGBT Iraqis resettle in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries after they flee Iraq due to anti-gay persecution .
Wingerter said the Fund For Global Human Rights , which helps non-profit groups providing refugee relief services , has a relationship with Helem and will deliver the funds raised in D.C. directly to Helem�s headquarters in Beirut .
' There is no law and order �
Hussam discussed his personal experiences as a gay man living in Iraq with the Blade before the start of the Nellie�s fundraiser Sunday .
" I was involved with the LGBT community in Iraq before and after the war , " he said , in referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
He said gays were far better off under Saddam�s regime , even though , like all other groups , they had to obey the rules and restrictions of his dictatorial , one - party government .
" We had men�s clubs and men�s parties , which were gay events , " he said .
" The government gave us a blind eye .
They knew we existed . "
As a secular government that repressed Islamic forces opposed to his rule , Saddam cracked down on violence against various groups , including gays , Hussam said .
Saddam left most of the various religious and ethnic factions , including gays , alone in the country " as long as you stayed out of his way politically , " Hussam said .
But after the U.S. invasion ended Saddam�s rule , the U.S. and allied forces failed to establish a workable replacement , leading to a breakdown of the governmental institutions needed to protect the safety of citizens .
He said the power vacuum was quickly filled by warring ethnic and religious factions , many of which began persecuting gays .
" There is no law and order , " he said , even under the current Iraqi government that is quickly taking over full control of the country from the U.S. military .
Asked which groups are most responsible for anti-gay persecution and killings , Hussam said , " You can�t easily point a finger .
We have militias , religious groups , criminal groups , hate groups , " he said .
Members of each of these groups have targeted gay Iraqis , according to Hussam .
" All minorities in Iraq are targeted , " he said .
" But some have stood up and denounced it when the Kurds were killed , when the Christians were killed .
No one stands up for the gays when they are killed . "
" I lost eight of my gay friends " to anti-gay killings , he said .
There are now " hundreds of gays " whose identities are known to anti-gay forces and who are in serious danger , he said .
" Every day that passes , someone is lost . "
He said gays in the U.S. can help by putting pressure on the U.S. government and on the United Nations to , in turn , put pressure on the government of Iraq to put a stop to the violence against gays and other minorities .
The United States needs to borrow nearly $ 10 trillion over the next decade , including about $ 1.6 trillion this year .
Where 's it going to come from ?
This is critical question , because resistance on the part of creditors will drive up interest rates , clobbering the housing market and demolishing the value of whatever cash savings Americans have left .
The other answer -- our government lending the money to itself - - will destroy the value of the dollar , and that would n't help too many people , either ( except debtors -- it would help debtors because they will be able to repay nominal debts with toilet - paper dollars .
For now , the money we 're borrowing is coming from somewhere , thankfully .
But it 's not coming from China , which has funded our spending for most of the past decade .
As you can see in the chart above from the NYT , China 's absolute purchases of Treasury debt continued to rise through last year , but the percentage of our borrowing that China is funding is shrinking fast .
Here 's Floyd Norris in the NYT :
China reduced its holdings of Treasury securities by $ 25 billion in June , the most China had ever sold in a month ...
China and Hong Kong , which is reported separately but is combined under China in the accompanying graphic , together covered more than half of the increase in the amount of Treasuries sold to the public — that is , to buyers other than United States governme nt agencies like the Federal Reserve or Social Security — in 2006 .
That share had fallen to 22 percent last year , when the government increased its public debt by a record $ 1.2 trillion .
In the first half of 2009 , China and Hong Kong acquired only 9 percent of the more than $ 800 billion worth of Treasuries that were sold .

From Jack Katzanek at the Press - Enterprise : Time -- and benefits -- running out for Inland jobless ( ht Rob Dawg )
... According to the state Employment Development Department , the number of Inland residents whose benefits already have been exhausted is negligible .
Only 121 people -- 67 in San Bernardino County and 54 in Riverside County -- were in that situation at the end of July .
But the number of people facing that predicament could grow exponentially in the coming weeks .
In Riverside County , it is estimated that 12,000 people risk losing their benefits before the end of the year , and 10,500 more in San Bernardino County .
...
A bill to extend unemployment benefits for 13 weeks was introduced in Congress July 30 by Rep. Jim McDermott , D - Wash .
It would apply to about 20 states with unemployment rates higher than 9 percent .
...
[ Mike DeCesare , McDermott 's spokesman 's ] research indicates that more than 200,000 people will lose their benefits each month starting in September .
emphasis added
The Inland Empire could go from 121 workers having exhausted their benefits now to over 21,000 by the end of the year .
Ouch .
The National Employment Law Project estimates that half a million workers will have exhausted their extended benefits by the end of September , and a total of 1.5 million by the end of the year .
These numbers are about to increase sharply .

Trouble flared up around the game between Millwall and West Ham Fighting between Millwall and West Ham football fans was planned a fortnight before the match , the BBC understands .
A Millwall fan who said he organised some of the violence said fans phoned rival supporters arranging to meet .
Police say nine people have been charged after " large - scale trouble " at West Ham 's Upton Park on Tuesday night .
One man remains in hospital in a stable condition after having been stabbed in the chest .
Two other men were also taken to hospital with minor injuries .
Fighting broke out before and after the match and there were several violent incidents inside the ground .
CCTV footage of the night is being examined by police to identify people involved .
It is expected to take months to complete .
One man , a member of a Millwall football gang , told the BBC the violence was being organised as soon as the two clubs had been drawn together .
" About a minute after it came out , that was it .
My phone was red hot , my Facebook went into meltdown .
" It was everyone I know texting me , phoning me and I was phoning people .
I went to work the next day without sleeping .
It 's one of those things you dream about .
A night game at Upton Park . "
They 've got each other 's number for one particular purpose .
They have n't got each other 's number to say do you fancy coming out for a beer .
There have them for specific reasons , and that 's that
Millwall fan
The man , in his mid forties , asked for his identity not to be revealed in fear of reprisals from other gang members .
He was also involved in the violence between football fans in the 1980s and says the match between the two sides has a history to it .
" I suppose the violent side to it , there 's been a lot of previous .
" In the 70s the Inter City Firm ( a West Ham hooligan gang ) were very organised and businesslike .
" And when Millwall played West Ham it was like , we can't let them get on over us .
There was bitter rivalry .
Very violent and there 's been a lot of incidents back and forth over the years . "
History of violence
He says he was in contact with fans involved in the violence during the 70s and 80s , who were organising fights to take place with rival football supporters on the day .
" A few members of the firm have a few numbers of the other firm .
It 's the top boys .
" They 've got each other 's number for one particular purpose .
They have n't got each other 's number to say do you fancy coming out for a beer .
They have them for specific reasons , and that 's that . "
The Metropolitan Police says it is aware that some aspects of the trouble were pre-planned .
A source close to West Ham United also told the BBC an investigation is being carried out into claims that hundreds of Millwall fans got into the match without tickets .
Fans invaded the Upton Park pitch during the match According to the Millwall fan involved with fighting on the night , one of the away gates was forced open .
" The main Millwall firm of about 450 got picked up half a mile from the ground and put in a police escort .
" They broke away from the escort .
They were just outside the away end and there was a few more without tickets .
And they just stormed the gate . "
But the Metropolitan Police said it was " not aware of a large number of Milwall fans forcing their way through the gates or turnstiles before , during or after the match " .
Match tension
The fan also denied that his group had any involvement in the stabbing of a 43 - year - old - Millwall fan , who was attending the match with his family .
He claimed that a separate group of fans were influenced by events on the night .
" The pictures in the papers , the fans running onto the pitch , that 's not hooliganism .
" The firm is not interested in family supporters , people wearing scarves or colours .
They 're after like minded people who are there for the same reason . "
When asked if he felt ashamed about putting people 's lives in danger and ruining the sport for football fans , he acknowledged that it was ruining games but says the West Ham and Millwall derby will always bring out a hooligan element .
" Looking at it from an unbiased perspective , it is quite sad people can't go to a specific game for fear of being stabbed .
" If we got West Ham again you 're gonna have the same people going .
People that should n't have gone .
People without tickets .
You 'd have the same day . "
The Metropolitan Police said evidence suggests the Millwall and West Ham violence was an isolated incident and does not signal a return to the hooliganism seen in the 1980s .

LOS ANGELES -- Driven to desperation , a growing number of financially strapped car owners in the United States are torching , sinking or ditching their vehicles and then reporting them stolen to cash in on the insurance .
SUVs have been found ablaze in the Nevada desert , cars have been dumped in a Miami canal and a BMW was discovered buried in a field in Texas .
Some vehicles have been parked in the path of a hurricane .
Known as owner give - ups , the scams have increased even as auto thefts dropped nationally -- a sign that the deepening recession is pushing the trend .
Authorities say most of the false claims are filed by first - time offenders looking for a quick financial fix with little regard for the consequences .
" We see people doing this kind of crime who ordinarily would n't steal candy from a store , " said Tom Reilly , a sheriff 's investigator in Dallas County , Texas .
James Quiggle , a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud , blames the problem on people who think " insurance companies are rich and fat and wo n't miss a few dollars . "
Experts say the billions of dollars in insurance losses are actually recouped from honest consumers as premium increases .
When gas prices shot up to $ 4 a gallon last summer , investigators reported a number of suspicious auto theft claims involving SUVs and other gas guzzlers .
But as gas prices dipped and the economy sputtered , the trend extended to all kinds of models , with losses concentrated in regions hit hard by layoffs , foreclosures and other signs of economic distress .
Two years ago , Las Vegas detectives were looking into two or three cases of suspicious auto theft a week .
But in the past 2 1/ 2 months , they have investigated 83 such cases and made 11 arrests -- more than a three - fold increase , said Lt. Bob Duvall , head of the city 's Metropolitan Police Department 's auto theft unit .
Police helicopters now patrol the desert around Las Vegas in search of smoldering vehicles or others pushed off cliffs .
In one case , investigators came across a man suffering from burns at the home of a woman whose vehicle had been found ablaze .
He was arrested and quickly confessed , Duvall said .
The New York Alliance Against Insurance Fraud says the number of people arrested statewide on suspicion of making false auto theft reports jumped from 96 in 2007 to 130 in 2008 .
In Dallas County , Reilly estimates suspicious auto theft reports have increased 12 percent this year .
Investigators in border states are finding an increasing number of charred cars with American license plates in Mexico .
" It 's one thing to find a stolen car in Mexico , it 's another to find it stolen and burned in Mexico .
It does n't make a lot of sense for a thief to take your car and burn it , " said Tom Downey , an investigator with the National Insurance Crime Bureau based in San Diego .
Such cases can result in felony charges of insurance fraud , making false statements to police and insurance providers , and arson , if the car is burned .
Along with serving prison time , defendants can also be ordered to pay restitution .
Reilly says most of his cases do n't make it to trial because suspects strike plea deals .
Some even agree to discuss their crimes in videotaped interviews that Reilly uses for educational seminars .
" Some said my back was against the wall , or this looked like a good idea at the time , who can I hurt ? "
Reilly said .
Brian Moody , senior editor of the Web site Edmunds.com that offers information to car shoppers , says owners trying to lower their debt can attempt to renegotiate payments , sell their car or trade it in for a less expensive model .
" You 're not going make money that 's for sure , but the big selling point is that it 's legal , " he said .
The Kepler Space Telescope , which launched earlier this year to find Earth - like planets elsewhere in our galaxy , showed it 's open for business with NASA 's announcement that an exoplanet we thought we knew is like nothing we 've seen before .
Peering at a large planet orbiting very close to its star , HAT - P - 7b , the telescope delivered what one scientist called " exquisite " data , proving that it 's ready to start looking for Earth - sized planets in the habitable zones around stars .
Analyzing just 10 days of data , the scientists even turned up a major surprise : HAT - P - 7b is n't like Jupiter at all .
It has a " dark " side and its atmosphere could be made of relatively exotic chemicals like titanium oxide .
" This planet is not like anything in Earth 's solar system , " said Sara Seager , an exoplanetary scientist at MIT .
The hottest spot on Hat - P - 7b could be more than 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the coldest spot .
There is no comparable planet around our star .
Kepler 's first findings , some of which were published in the journal Science , augur a new level of exoplanetary research , Seager said .
" This exquisite data is just the tip of the iceberg , " she said .
" We 're going to see a new world of exoplanet exploration where discoveries will come much more rapidly than they 've come in the last 10 years . "
But while we 'll be learning more about planets in the universe every month , Kepler 's ultimate mission — finding Earth - like planets in the habitable zone — is still going to take years .
The habitable zone is the term astronomers use to denote the distance from a star where orbiting planets would n't get fried or frozen .
In those locations , liquid water could exist — and that 's something that is necessary for life as we know it .
In our solar system , Venus , Earth , and Mars lie within the zone .
The more planets that Kepler finds in its survey of 100,000 stars , the more likely that Earth - like planets exist in large numbers throughout the universe .
And the more Earths out there , the better our chances get of finding life outside our solar system .
The announcement that Kepler is working as designed is great news for the exoplanetary research community , which had been eagerly awaiting the first data from the instrument .
" It appears Kepler is working at its design precision — the noise level of just 40 parts per million per data point is amazing ! "
Matthew Muterspaugh , an exoplanet researcher at Tennessee State University , wrote in an email to Wired.com .
Kepler 's mission is primarily statistical .
It will tell us how many solar systems like ours likely exist in the universe , but the stars in its field of vision are too far away to characterize in much detail .
Kepler will be able to tell us that the planet is in the right place , but not whether it 's suitable for or home to life .
" [ Kepler ] will be able to say it 's a rocky planet like Venus or Earth , but wo n't be able to say whether it 's more like Venus or Earth , " Muterspaugh said .
So , while Kepler will help sort out how likely life is around the universe , it wo n't actually find any definitive signs of it .
The stars that it 's looking at are just too far away .
" The downside to the Kepler technique is that the stars tend to be very far away and faint , " said Muterspaugh .
" This set of stars will not be well optimized for the follow up observations . "
The ultimate quest to find other planets that support life will require a series of other missions and telescopes , which focus on planets much closer to home .
First , we 'll have to find out which local stars have rocky planets .
NASA 's first potential mission with that capability is the SIM Lite Astrometric Observatory .
It will be able to find Earth - sized planets around 60 stars in our neighborhood .
Once these planets are identified by SIM or other missions like Gaia and CoRoT , NASA will be able to peer at them with the powerful James Webb Space Telescope or a dedicated planet - hunting telescope like the agency 's proposed Terrestrial Planet Finder missions .
For planets larger than Earth , the James Webb telescope will be able to characterize them effectively , but for the true Earths , we 'll need the more powerful instrumentation of the TPF .
It will be a long road from finding the first Earth - like planet with Kepler to knowing how habitable any extrasolar planet is , but if all goes well , scientists think we could have answers by 2020 .
" The timeline is set for in 2020 having that image of our brother world out there , " Muterspaugh said .
" I think that this is a fantastic thing for our generation to do , answering a question that 's thousands of years old : are we alone ? "

Simplenote
Back in November , I held up Apple ’s own Notes app as a great example of iPhone software design .
I wrote :
I ’ve looked at several note - editing apps available in the App Store , and most of them seem to have been designed without any recognition of just how clever and well - designed Apple ’s Notes app is .
Notes exposes its core functionality clearly and obviously , launches very quickly , requires very few taps to use , and uses just two simple levels of hierarchy ( the flat list of notes , and the notes themselves ) .
But I noted three significant shortcomings :
Syncing Search Rotation
All three shortcomings were addressed in iPhone OS 3.0 .
In short , the updated version of Notes is emblematic of Apple ’s steady , iterative approach to improving the iPhone — start with the basics , then add the most - requested new features over time .
However , the one area I ’m not satisfied by is syncing .
Notes only sync via iTunes over USB , rather than over - the - air via MobileMe like calendars , contacts , and bookmarks .
On the Mac , they sync to Apple Mail ; on Windows , Outlook ( which is part of Office , and therefore not free — Windows - using iPhone owners who do n’t have Office ca n’t sync notes ) .
For me at least , over - the - air Internet syncing is an order of magnitude more appealing than USB or Bonjour syncing .
For one thing , iPhone - to - iTunes USB syncing can be time consuming , especially when performing a backup .
I often go several days without syncing my iPhone to iTunes .
That means that if I were to use the built - in Notes app , my notes would only be in sync between my Mac and iPhone once or twice per week .
So I do n’t use Notes .
Since November , shortly after posting the aforementioned article , I ’ve been using a splendid iPhone app called Simplenote .
I ’ve tried a slew of iPhone note editing apps , and not only is Simplenote my favorite , it might be my favorite third - party iPhone app , period .
It ’s that good .
First , unlike most of the other iPhone note apps I ’ve tried , Simplenote shows an appreciation for just how good the built - in Notes app is .
Cloud Factory ( Simplenote ’s developers ) clearly studied what is good about Notes and thought about how to make something that is good in the same ways , but improves upon its major shortcomings .
Anyone who ’s used the built - in Notes app will feel right at home in Simplenote .
There are no folders , just a single , simple date - sorted list of notes .
There are no fields associated with a note — just like with Apple ’s , a note ’s “ title ” is simply taken from the first line of the note .
Simplenote launches quickly , offers full - text search , and supports horizontal screen rotation .
The list of all notes :
An individual note :
In short , Simplenote improves upon Notes in two significant ways :
Over - the - air syncing , which , in eight months of my use , works splendidly .
Helvetica.1
What Simplenote syncs to is this simple web app , reminiscent in style and scope to the Mac app Notational Velocity , which I wrote about in a footnote to my “ Untitled Document Syndrome ” piece back in February .
Several of the online - syncable iPhone note apps I ’ve tried and discarded are designed to use existing web apps like Google Documents ; but Google Documents offers all sorts of features and assumptions that do n’t map well to a simple plain - text iPhone notes app .
The Simplenote web and iPhone apps were designed to work with each other .
They are of a piece .
The Simplenote web app is hosted on Google App Engine .
In my eight months of using it , it has always been fast and syncing has been perfectly reliable .
It just works .
Regarding Basic Syncing Strategies
There are two main strategies for an iPhone app to sync data to your Mac or PC .
The first is direct client - to - client sync .
iTunes ’s USB syncing is an example of that .
A third - party example is Things , from Cultured Code , which syncs directly between the iPhone and Mac version of Things over Wi-Fi .
An example of an iPhone notes app that does this is Polar Bear Farm ’s Note Pad , which syncs to a native Mac and Windows desktop app named Sync , which Polar Bear Farm wrote specifically to serve as a syncing client for Note Pad .
The other strategy is to use a server on the Internet as a hub for syncing .
That ’s how MobileMe works , and that ’s how Simplenote works .
There are several advantages to using a central web app / web service for syncing .
One is that you can access your synced data from any computer with a web browser .
Whereas with an app like
Things , you can only access your data from your own Mac — and it must be a Mac , because there is no Windows client .
Another advantage for web - based syncing is that your data is always up to date everywhere , almost instantly .
As with MobileMe , you do n’t need to manually initiate a sync with Simplenote .
When you launch it , Simplenote checks with the server for changes .
When you make changes on the iPhone , they ’re sent back to the server seconds later .
The only way your data can get out of sync is if you make changes on the iPhone while there is no network available ; in that case you simply need to relaunch Simplenote once network access is available .
With client - to - client syncing a la Things , you often need to initiate syncing manually .
A scenario I ’ve run into with Things is that I ’ll jot a few shopping items using the Mac app , then , later on when I ’m actually at the store , take out my iPhone and realize that I had n’t synced .
Every time you make changes , your data is out of sync until the next time you launch the iPhone and Mac clients together on the same Wi -Fi network .
The same goes for iTunes ’s USB - based syncing for calendar events and contacts — if you do n’t remember to manually initiate a sync ( and wait for it to complete ) before leaving the house , the data on your iPhone is out of date .
With Simplenote and MobileMe , so long as you have a network connection , your data is never out of sync .
To be clear , though , there are important trade - offs .
The biggest downside to web - based syncing is the implicit lack of privacy .
Your data resides on a server that someone else controls .
I ’m willing to accept this because the convenience is worth it , and the privacy issues with Simplenote are no different than with any web - based service .
( It ’s also worth pointing out that Simplenote uses HTTPS rather than regular HTTP , so network communication between the iPhone app and web site is encrypted .
I would not use or recommend Simplenote if it did n’t use SSL to encrypt network traffic . )
With something like Things or Note Pad , your data exists only on your own machines .
And with something like OmniFocus , you can sync to your own WebDAV server , if you have one .
It ’s a trade - off between ( a ) convenience and universal access and ( b ) the privacy advantages of your data residing only on your own devices .
( And even so , keeping your data private to your own machines is no panacea .
Computers and phones — especially phones — get lost and stolen . )
The Bottom Line
Amazingly , Simplenote costs just $ 2 — including ongoing access to the web app .
On the one hand , yes , App Store prices tend to be very low , and Simplenote is very much competing against the free built - in Notes app from Apple .
But when I bought Simplenote back in November , it cost $ 3 , and I thought that price was crazy low .
What gives me pause about the low price is that I want Cloud Factory to thrive and for them to be able to maintain the web - based Simplenote component for the foreseeable future .
The flawless syncing is central to Simplenote ’s appeal .
Yes , Google App Engine hosting is relatively inexpensive , and iPhone - sized text notes are by nature relatively tiny in terms of a service whose bandwidth quotas are measured in gigabytes , but Cloud Factory is only charging a one - time fee of $ 2 .
I ’d feel better spending more — my thought back in November was that the low one - time fee was too good to be true .
On the other hand , though , the low price means there ’s no reason not to try it .
It ’s hard for me to imagine how you could get more for $ 2 than you will by buying Simplenote .
Yes , this is not a mistake , this triplex penthouse apartment located in a clock tower near the Brooklyn Bridge and the Port of New York really costs some modest $ 25 million .
As it is a penthouse in a tower clock , each facade has a working clock in a 14 - foot - high round window .
This means you always know what time it is , unless you forget to read the time backwards ...
And as it is a triplex , there are 3 floors and a very large area .
The first floor which is the main floor is 3000 square feet - it is composed of an open living room , a dining room and a kitchen with a 16 - foot ceiling .
At the center of the space , there is a glass - walled elevator surrounded by a staircase that leads to 2 other smaller floors .

What would you say if I told you that you can stop writing data access code in .
Net ?
Are n’t you tired of writing the same thing over and over again , opening connection , querying the database , figuring out what to return , getting back untype data that you need to start putting on the form ?
Do you really see some value in writing yet another UPDATE statement ??
The Active Record framework allows you to fully utilize the power of the database , but without the back breaking work that it used to take .
Active Record uses .
Net objects to relieve you from the repeating task of persistence .
Those objects are schema aware and can persist and load themselves without you needing to write a single line of SQL .
Building business application using Active Record is a pleasure , the database stuff just happens , and you are free to implement the business functionality .

As an intruder rummaged through his living room and his two children slept upstairs , Tim Maynard stood near a doorway , naked and armed with a baseball bat .
The burglar came toward him and Maynard swung , breaking the man 's jaw and sending him stumbling out a sliding door .
" At the beginning I was frightened .
I did n't believe what was happening , " said Maynard , 28 .
" Once I knew what he was doing , I knew I had to do everything to protect my family . "
Police responding to a call placed by Maynard 's wife arrived about 5:45 a.m.
Wednesday to the couple 's home at 233 Griswold St. , and Officer Jeremy Barnett arrested the alleged burglar in a neighbor 's backyard .
The suspect was taken to Allegiance Health for treatment of a broken jaw , Jackson Deputy Chief John Holda said .
Police will seek charges when he is released from the hospital , Holda said .
While Becky and Tim Maynard slept , a man had entered the Maynards ' home through a sliding glass door , Tim Maynard said .
Becky Maynard , 29 , heard noises , felt " frozen with fear " and awoke her husband , she said .
She took a phone off a night stand and went to a bathroom connected to the bedroom to call 911 .
Knowing she was away from the intruder , Tim Maynard , not bothering to get dressed , fetched the bat stored beneath their bed for " just such an occasion " and listened to the noises in the living room .
The man was pulling at cords stemming from the TV and other electronics , pushing around the family 's possessions and making a lot of noise , Tim Maynard said .
Intending to stand guard until the man left the home or went after Maynard or his wife or children , Maynard said he was forced to act when the intruder headed into the bedroom , which opens to the living room .
He hit the man , who fell , and struck him again .
The man then went outside and over the backyard fence , Tim Maynard said .
" I shouted after him , ' Get out of my house .
Leave , ' " Maynard said .
He then checked to make sure his daughter , almost 3 , and his son , 1 , were safe .
The two never woke , he said .
Tim Maynard said the man took off from the house with video and digital cameras , Becky Maynard 's Blackberry and a cold beverage , all of which police recovered .
Some other items were spilled about the living room floor , Tim Maynard said .
Blood and chewing gum were near the back door .
He said he felt fortunate nothing went wrong , that his wife and children were unharmed .
" I was n't like in a rage .
I just wanted him out of my house and away from my family , " he said .
" Life is really fragile .
Our safety is really fragile , and that is a sobering thought . "
He and other defense lawyers said that rather than supporting Al Qaeda , the Saudis were sworn enemies of its leader , Osama bin Laden , who was exiled from Saudi Arabia , his native country , in 1996 .
“ It ’s an absolute tragedy what happened to them , and I understand their anger , ” Mr. Kellogg said of the victims ’ families .
“ They want to find those responsible , but I think they ’ve been disserved by their lawyers by bringing claims without any merit against the wrong people . ”
The Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment .
Two federal judges and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals have already ruled against the 7,630 people represented in the lawsuit , made up of survivors of the attacks and family members of those killed , throwing out the suit on the ground that the families cannot bring legal action in the United States against a sovereign nation and its leaders .
The Supreme Court is expected to decide this week whether to hear an appeal , but the families ’ prospects dimmed last month when the Justice Department sided with the Saudis in their immunity claim and urged the court not to consider the appeal .
The Justice Department said a 1976 law on sovereign immunity protected the Saudis from liability and noted that “ potentially significant foreign relations consequences ” would arise if such suits were allowed to proceed .
“ Cases like this put the U.S. government in an extremely difficult position when it has to make legal arguments , even when they are the better view of the law , that run counter to those of terrorist victims , ” said John Bellinger , a former State Department lawyer who was involved in the Saudi litigation .
Senior Obama administration officials held a private meeting on Monday with 9/11 family members to speak about progress in cracking down on terrorist financing .
Administration officials at the meeting largely sidestepped questions about the lawsuit , according to participants .
But the official who helped lead the meeting , Stuart A. Levey , the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , has been outspoken in his criticism of wealthy Saudis , saying they have helped to finance terrorism .
Image A German intelligence report described bank transfers made in the early 1990s by Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz and other members of the Saudi royal family to a charity that was suspected of financing militants  activities in Pakistan and Bosnia .

Even if the 9/11 families were to get their trial in the lawsuit , they might have difficulty getting some of their new material into evidence .
Some would most likely be challenged on grounds it was irrelevant or uncorroborated hearsay , or that it related to Saudis who were clearly covered by sovereign immunity .

Most developers already struggled with textual data from some third party system and getting garbage special characters and the like because of wrong character encodings .
Some days ago we encountered an obscure problem when it was possible to login into one of our apps from the computer with the password database running but not from other machines using the same db .
After diving into the problem we found out that they SHA - 1 hashes generated from our app were slightly different .
Looking at the code revealed that platform encoding was used and that lead to different results :
The apps were running on Windows XP and Windows 2k3 Server respectively and you would expect that it would not make much of a difference but in fact it did !
Lesson :
Always specify the encoding explicitly , when exchanging character data with any other system .
Here are some examples :
String.getBytes ( “ utf - 8 ” ) , new Printwriter ( file , “ ascii ” ) in Java
HTML - Forms with attribute accept- charset = " ISO - 8859 - 1 "
In XML headers < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " ISO - 8859 -15 " ?>
In your Database and / or JDBC driver
In your file format documentation
In LaTeX documents
everywhere where you can provide that info easily ( e.g. as a comment in a config file )
Problems with character encodings seem to appear every once in a while either as end user , when your umlauts get garbled or as a programmer that has to deal with third party input like web forms or text files .
The text file rant
After stumbling over an encoding problem * again *
I thought a bit about the whole issue and some of my thought manifested in this rant about text files .
I do not want to blame our computer science predecessors for inventing and using restricted charsets like ASCII or iso8859 .
Nobody has forseen the rapid development of computers and their worldwide adoption and use in everyday life and thus need for an extensible charset ( think of the addition of new symbols like the € ) , let aside performance and memory considerations .
The problem I see with text files is that there is no standard way to describe the used encoding .
Most text files just leave it to the user to guess what the encoding might be whereas almost all binary file formats feature some kind of defined header with metadata about the content , e.g. bit depth and compression method in image files .
For text files you usually have to use heuristical tools which work more or less depending on the input .
A standardized header for text files right from the start would have helped to indicate the encoding and possibly language or encoding version information of the text and many problems we have today would not exist .
The encoding attribute in the XML header or the byte order mark in UTF - 8 are workarounds for the fundamental problem of a missing text file header .

Yesterday Russian police arrested a man in connection with the murder of human rights activist Natalya Estemirova .
He was n’t a killer , her killers will not be punished .
The man was arrested for organizing a demonstration in her memory in the center of Moscow .
The action was legal but the police said that “ too many people ” came to mourn Estemirova , grabbed the 70 - years - old organizer by his arms and dragged him to a police van .
Several people who protested or tried to prevent the arrest were beaten by the riot police .
This is how it happened :
The arrested old man is Viktor Sokirko .
He was a political prisoner under Brezhnev .
Now he became a prisoner of Putin ’s regime .
The last time wolverines were known to live in Colorado , Theodore Roosevelt had just died and women had not yet won the right to vote .
But now , 90 years later , researchers using radio tracking devices have followed a wolverine into the state .
The scientists concede that the return of one animal to a species ’ ancient range is hardly cause for jubilation .
“ Somewhat of an anomaly , ” Rick Kahn , an official in the Colorado Division of Wildlife , called it in a statement .
But the researchers hope their efforts to track the young male , designated M56 , will help explain why only an estimated 250 to 500 wolverines remain in the lower 48 states and what their fate might be in the face of development and climate change .
Wolverines live in Alaska and Canada , and “ we know they used to be in Idaho , Montana , Wyoming , Utah , Colorado , California and Washington , ” said Robert M. Inman , who directs the Greater Yellowstone Wolverine Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society , the organization that also runs the Bronx Zoo .
Scientists have developed a method to produce oxygen from moon rock .
Image credit : NASA .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
If humans ever create a lunar base , one of the biggest challenges will be figuring out how to breathe .
Transporting oxygen to the moon is extremely expensive , so for the past several years NASA has been looking into other possibilities .
One idea is extracting oxygen from moon rock .
Recently , Derek Fray , a materials chemist from the University of Cambridge , and his colleagues have built a reactor that uses oxides in Moon rocks as the cathode in an electrochemical process to produce oxygen .
The design is based on a process that the researchers invented in 2000 that produces carbon dioxide .
In this design , the scientists pass a current between the cathode and an anode made of carbon , with both electrodes sitting in an electrolyte solution of molten calcium chloride , a common salt .
The current removes oxygen atoms from the cathode , which are then ionized and dissolve in the molten salt .
The negatively charged oxygen is attracted to the carbon anode , where it erodes the anode and produces carbon dioxide .
To produce oxygen rather than carbon dioxide , the researchers made an unreactive anode using a mixture of calcium titanate and calcium ruthenate instead of the carbon .
Because this anode barely erodes , the reaction between the oxygen ions and anode produces oxygen .
Based on experiments with a simulated lunar rock developed by NASA , the researchers calculate that three one - meter - tall reactors could generate one tonne of oxygen per year on the Moon .
Each tonne of oxygen would require three tonnes of rock to produce .
Fray noted that three reactors would require about 4.5 kilowatts of power , which could be supplied by solar panels or possibly a small nuclear reactor on the Moon .
The researchers are also working with the European Space Agency on developing an even larger reactor that could be operated remotely .
As a recent story in Nature News reports , other researchers are also developing methods for oxygen extraction .
For instance , Donald Sadoway at MIT is working on a high - temperature technique called molten salt electrolysis .
Here , the Moon rock is molten and acts as the electrolyte itself .
Sadoway 's reactor could even be built out of the rubble on the Moon 's surface called regolith .
NASA and the ESA are strongly encouraging this type of research .
In 2008 , NASA boosted its $ 250,000 prize to $ 1 million for the first team to demonstrate a method to extract five kilograms of oxygen in eight hours from simulated Moon rock .
So far , the prize remains unclaimed .

Privacy Salience and Social Networking Sites
Reassuring people about privacy makes them more , not less , concerned .
It ’s called “ privacy salience , ” and Leslie John , Alessandro Acquisti , and George Loewenstein — all at Carnegie Mellon University — demonstrated this in a series of clever experiments .
In one , subjects completed an online survey consisting of a series of questions about their academic behavior — “ Have you ever cheated on an exam ? ” for example .
Half of the subjects were first required to sign a consent warning — designed to make privacy concerns more salient — while the other half did not .
Also , subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a privacy confidentiality assurance , or no such assurance .
When the privacy concern was made salient ( through the consent warning ) , people reacted negatively to the subsequent confidentiality assurance and were less likely to reveal personal information .
In another experiment , subjects completed an online survey where they were asked a series of personal questions , such as “ Have you ever tried cocaine ? ”
Half of the subjects completed a frivolous - looking survey — “ How BAD are U ? ? ” — with a picture of a cute devil .
The other half completed the same survey with the title “ Carnegie Mellon University Survey of Ethical Standards , ” complete with a university seal and official privacy assurances .
The results showed that people who were reminded about privacy were less likely to reveal personal information than those who were not .
Privacy salience does a lot to explain social networking sites and their attitudes towards privacy .
From a business perspective , social networking sites do n’t want their members to exercise their privacy rights very much .
They want members to be comfortable disclosing a lot of data about themselves .
Joseph Bonneau and Soeren Preibusch of Cambridge University have been studying privacy on 45 popular social networking sites around the world .
( You may not have realized that there are 45 popular social networking sites around the world . )
They found that privacy settings were often confusing and hard to access ; Facebook , with its 61 privacy settings , is the worst .
To understand some of the settings , they had to create accounts with different settings so they could compare the results .
Privacy tends to increase with the age and popularity of a site .
General - use sites tend to have more privacy features than niche sites .
But their most interesting finding was that sites consistently hide any mentions of privacy .
Their splash pages talk about connecting with friends , meeting new people , sharing pictures : the benefits of disclosing personal data .
These sites do talk about privacy , but only on hard - to - find privacy policy pages .
There , the sites give strong reassurances about their privacy controls and the safety of data members choose to disclose on the site .
There , the sites display third - party privacy seals and other icons designed to assuage any fears members have .
It ’s the Carnegie Mellon experimental result in the real world .
Users care about privacy , but do n’t really think about it day to day .
The social networking sites do n’t want to remind users about privacy , even if they talk about it positively , because any reminder will result in users remembering their privacy fears and becoming more cautious about sharing personal data .
But the sites also need to reassure those “ privacy fundamentalists ” for whom privacy is always salient , so they have very strong pro-privacy rhetoric for those who take the time to search them out .
The two different marketing messages are for two different audiences .
Social networking sites are improving their privacy controls as a result of public pressure .
At the same time , there is a counterbalancing business pressure to decrease privacy ; watch what ’s going on right now on Facebook , for example .
Naively , we should expect companies to make their privacy policies clear to allow customers to make an informed choice .
But the marketing need to reduce privacy salience will frustrate market solutions to improve privacy ; sites would much rather obfuscate the issue than compete on it as a feature .

The latest Case - Shiller Index data had its first nationwide price bump up in nearly three years .
I am astounded ( but not shocked ) by what this has done to the psychology of many .
The most recent post highlighting the REO shadow inventory and how banks are keeping homes off the public view instead of convincing people that housing has a tumultuous path ahead , the post actually reinforced a group of people that now think the worst is over .
Keep in mind the Case - Shiller data set for the LA / OC region is still declining .
Yet people are extrapolating nationwide data and transferring it over to the dismal state of California .
It may very well be the case that nationwide prices have hit a bottom but not for the mid and upper tier of California homes .
Price corrections are virtually assured with the coming onslaught of Alt - A toxic dubious mortgages coming in full force in 2010 .
The argument keeps shifting so let me be extremely clear .
Some keep thinking that there will be some generalized and clean decline when the Alt - A loans implode .
They keep obsessing over tiny details in the market and say , “ I thought the implosion was going to happen now !
Forget this , I ’m jumping in . ”
Many people are simply impatient and choose to ignore certain facts at their own convenience .
The same kind of reasoning occurred in 2006 .
Even almighty Ben Bernanke shrugged off the housing problems and did n’t see a recession being set off by the housing bubble .
Housing in California will be in trouble for years to come .
The distress market data tells us that .
Yet if you use the median price as your indicator , you will be completely off .
In fact , I would n’t be surprised to see the median price increase as the mid and upper tier markets implode …simultaneously .
How can this be ?
Simply put , for the past year the bulk of the sales have occurred in the lower priced cities .
Of course , the median price is principally concerned with volume and the volume has been with the low hanging fruit .
Many in the mid to upper tier did not sell and still had prices at delusional levels so the volume at the mid to upper tier simply did not make a dent in the overall data .
But now , we are seeing sales in these areas with more modest price cuts .
Ironically , with more volume in these areas and the lower end working through its funk , prices may increase in terms of the median price .
Let me give you a really simple example .
Take a home in Pasadena .
The hypothetical home might have sold for $ 700,000 during the peak but now will fetch $ 500,000 .
The homeowner bought for $ 300,000 so they still stand to profit .
Life occurs ( i.e. , new job , divorce , etc ) and they need to sell .
The home moves for $ 500,000 .
Do this many times over and you can understand why you are seeing the median price in Southern California increase :
I think this is what is catching many people off guard .
The median price for Southern California has been steady since January of 2009 and has increased in the last two months .
You need to understand why this is occurring however .
Given our previous example , you can understand that the home can sell for $ 400,000 or even $ 350,000 and the owner still will profit and the overall median price for the region will have more fuel to go up .
And the Case - Shiller Index would increase in this case as well because it uses repeat home sales over time .
The Alt - A implosion will force the hand of many banks to off load homes in these kinds of scenarios .
So if you are looking at the region median price , we may have already bottomed .
But make sure we are talking about the same kind of dynamics .
But let us look at the nationwide picture first .
It helps to look at the entire U.S. housing market .
Many of you sent the report from Deutsche Bank AG which stated that 48 % of mortgage holders will be underwater by 2011 .
Interesting point since I have been saying for over a year that California will hit a housing bottom in 2011 .
Yet how extreme is this contention ?
The above chart includes data from multiple sources including the Census Bureau , Deutsche Bank , and Moody’s .
It helps to have it all in one spot to analyze .
First , a couple of facts from the chart above .
Some 31 % of homeowners have no mortgage .
Next , as things stand today some 16 million homeowners are underwater meaning they owe more than their home is worth and another 5 million have zero equity or a few percent in equity ( which is irrelevant if you consider selling costs of 5 to 6 percent ) .
The bottom line is some 21 million Americans already have negative equity or will have no equity in the coming months .
What Deutsche Bank is predicting is we will have 25.8 million people with negative equity by 2011 which makes up about half of homeowners with a mortgage .
Some see this as some mega epic doomer call .
I do n’t see it that way .
The argument they present is that more issues will start occurring with prime mortgages ( the data backs this up ) since unemployment will stay elevated for sometime thus pushing up foreclosures .
And right on time Fannie Mae announces another stunning loss this time to the tune of $ 14.8 billion .
Keep in mind that most of the GSE stuff is supposedly prime paper .
We are still running at record high foreclosures rates by the way :
Nothing will push a home price lower than a foreclosure .
And people forget about the impact that foreclosures have in an area .
They force comp values lower so appraisers start valuing homes lower in general .
I know some in the real estate industry hate this since they only think housing values go up but this is the reality .
And with the Alt - A loans largely being based out of California , there is little reason to think that the mid and upper tier markets in the state will stabilize ( the average balance is $ 440,000 ) :
And for what it is worth , Deutsche Bank was early in calling subprime problems so I do give them some credit in their analysis .
But you say California is different right ?
Well let us look into the California housing situation :
Of those homes with a mortgage in the chart above , 33 percent are estimated to be underwater by Moody ’s .
I would estimate a much higher number given the persistent delusion by many in the mid to upper tier areas .
They somehow look at the Alt - A data and think that it will be swept under the rug as if it was a small amount of dirt .
That is not the case .
If you look at the above data , we now have more people underwater than people that have paid off their mortgage in California !
Also , there is nothing wrong with renting in the state given that nearly as many people rent as those with a mortgage .
And by the way , with the absurd loan modifications extending loans out to 40 - years many homeowners that bought at the peak are basically realizing they have it worse than renters .
A renter can pick up and leave .
They cannot .
Unless they strategically default and stop making payments which many are electing to do but will ruin their credit .
The above implications are rather clear to someone that has been following the California housing market for a decade and is also cognizant of its historical trends .
One key factor not being addressed however is housing affordability .
Clearly lower home prices will make prices more affordable – only if the assumption is based on a stable economy .
Yet what use is having more affordable home prices if the economy is firing people left and right ?
And if you have n’t noticed , California ’s economy with an 11.6 percent unemployment rate is still going up .
Some analysts estimate a 13 to 14 percent peak .
That is why when you look at what regions have underwater homeowners , you will also find economically depressed regions included with the bubble maniac states like Nevada and California :
There are two sides to the housing equation .
First is the home price and second involves the local economy .
This is simple to understand .
Michigan has incredibly cheap housing prices .
Heck , I ’ve seen some homes going for $ 1 to $ 100 simply because the local governments want someone paying some property tax and maintenance for the home .
So the price is fine since you ca n’t get cheaper than $ 1 .
Yet the second part of the equation is a disaster .
Employment is in shambles .
What use is it living in a gigantic cheap home if you have no job in the area ?
And we are a social bunch .
You might think it prudent for you to live in your cheap mansion but what of your friends or family ?
You ’ll need something else to do instead of sitting in your big empty home counting your cash while those around you struggle financially .
That is why plans like those for Flint are openly talking about demolishing parts of towns .
Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes except those ashes will be cemented over in a housing graveyard .
California has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
We have the bulk of those toxic Alt - A loans which include the tasty option ARM variety .
For this entire decade , most of the new high paying jobs revolved around the real estate industry in the state .
Short of us having another bubble , that industry is gone forever .
So what is going to replace that function in the equation ?
What is incredible is even after the major price adjustments , housing in California is still unaffordable .
People say , “ look at that $ 100,000 home in the Inland Empire ” while failing to realize the near 20 percent unemployment rate in some cities in that area .
The California is different argument held water when our economy was booming .
That argument holds no water in a state with a $ 26 billion budget deficit and is chopping services left and right .
For many , the American dream of homeownership has become a nightmare .
It really is too bad .
Private property ownership has worked well for our country .
I would argue that it is an important part of the stability of our economy over the last fifty years .
Yet the perverse crony real estate industry tag teamed with Wall Street and decided to transform this once boring industry into a casino on the backs of the American public .
Forget about long - term stability when you can sacrifice it all for short - term gain .
They now openly chide the American public since they did after all sign on the bottom line while at the same time they are taking money from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury .
It is the ultimate hypocrisy .
I believe that those homeowners that overleveraged themselves should lose their homes .
That is why I am adamant against using taxpayer money for loan modifications especially when they are designed more to protect the banks .
I am even more adamant about letting those lenders who participated in this mess to fail .
Too bad during the earlier days of this crisis we did n’t reward prudent lenders with taxpayer money since they were the ones who demonstrated how to actually conduct banking .
Instead , the money flowed to the most culpable in creating this mess .
So do n’t be fooled about this short - term delusion .
Has the freefall stopped ?
Sure .
But that does n’t imply a robust recovery is around the corner ( the stock market rallying 50 percent since the March low believes in the “ V ” shaped recovery ) .
What industry is going to make up for the lost financial and real estate jobs ?
How much home can you afford while working a service job ?
The fact that we have 21 million Americans with negative equity or zero or little equity is simply astounding .

China ’s Dog License Laws Going to the Dogs
Public hearings are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives , but who would have thought that getting a dog would require one ?
Residents from the downtown Luwan District in Shanghai are beginning to understand this concept as a new ordinance will require they attend a “ dog license hearing ” with their neighbors if they wish to keep a dog in their homes .
Launched for the sake of neighborhood amity , the district ’s new pilot program will require any home desiring to own a dog to get a nod of approval from five of that household ’s nearest neighbors .
If anyone dissents , no dog ’s license will be granted and any pets that are unlicensed will be removed from the household , in question .
This “ purge and remove ” policy takes effect as soon as a resident applies for a dog license .
The request is then sent to the neighborhood committee , which then arranges for a hearing between the applicant and their five nearest neighbors who will then vote on the issue after the applicant gives a statement .
The new regulations come in the wake of a recent survey conducted by the Shanghai Statistics Bureau , which claimed that pets urinating and defecating in public were major causes of annoyance for local families .
The way the law now stands , a dog owner can receive a license after gathering five signatures from neighbors .
Now Luwan District is expanding that regulation to include a gathering of neighbors and the opportunity to sit together , discuss and vote to approve or reject a license application .
“ It ’s a good way to reduce future conflicts caused by pet dogs , ” said Chen Mingjun , director of the Luwan District branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau .
Earlier this year , the district released additional rules requiring those who were granted dog licenses to have their pets vaccinated , clean up after them , use a leash , avoid walking them during rush hours and control their barking at night .
All of that appears to be pretty reasonable , but no one really knows how the dogs feel about this ?
What do YOU think ?

New US home starts surge in June
There are signs confidence may be returning to the building sector
The construction of new homes in the US rose 3.6 % between May and June to the highest level in seven months , official figures have shown .
This is the second month in a row that housing starts have risen following a post - war low in April .
Compared with the same month a year ago , however , June starts were down 46 % , the Commerce Department said .
The number of single family homes being built jumped 14.4 % in June , the biggest jump in over four years .
' Genuine surprise '
The number of new homes built totalled 582,000 , many more than analysts had expected .
Figures for May were also revised upwards , from 532,000 to 562,000 .
It is too soon to call a bottom to the housing market in the US
The Centre for Economics and Business Research " These figures look like a genuine upward surprise , and support our view that housing construction activity is bottoming out , " said Dean Maki at Barclays Capital .
For the April to June months , Mr Maki added that single family starts saw the biggest quarterly increase since the early 1990s .
The number of permits to break ground - considered an indicator of confidence in the building sector - climbed to its highest level since December last year .
Completions down
Some analysts , however , urged caution in the wake of the stronger - than - expected data .
" It is too soon to call a bottom to the housing market in the US , " said the Centre for Economics and Business Research .
William O'Donnell , head treasury strategist at RBS Securities , argued that : " This is another piece of data for those seeing the recession ending soon . "
" But housing starts are still within the range of the past six months and the completion rate is still down , " he said .

Jimmy Bogard , wrote an article : “ Getting value out of your unit tests ” , where he gives three rules :
“ Test names should describe the what and the why , from the user ’s perspective ” – the idea is that a developer should be able to read the name and understand what the intended behavior is .
“ Tests are code too , give them some love ” – production code is n't the only place that you should do your refactoring .
Readable tests are easier to maintain and easier for next person to understand .
“ I hate , hate long , complex tests .
If a test has 30 lines of setup , please put that behind a creation method .
A long test just irritates and leaves the developer cross-eyed .
If I do n’t have long methods in production code , why would I allow this in our test code ? ”
“ Do n’t settle on one fixture pattern / organizational style ” – Sometimes the standard pattern of one class , one test fixture does n’t work .
Lior Friedman added : “ Rule # 0 - Test external behavior and not internal structure . ”
Or , test the expectations for a class not its current structure .

Jv added his own rules :
One Assert per test ( where possible ) .
If there are any " if else " inside a test , move the branches to individual test methods .
Methods under test , if they , too , have if else branches , the method should be refactored .
Name of the method should be the kind of test .
For instance , TestMakeReservation is different from TestMakeNoReservation ( ) .
Charlie Poole , author of NUnit , rewords one Assert per to test to one “ Logical Assert ” – saying “ Sometimes , due to a lack of expressiveness in the testing api , you need to write multiple physical asserts to achieve the desired result .
Much of the development in the NUnit framework api has been out of an attempt to get a single assert to do more work . ”
Bryan Cook produces a considerable list of his own :
DO : Name Fixtures consistently DO : Mimic namespaces of Target Code DO : Name Setup / TearDown methods consistently CONSIDER : Separating your Tests from your Production Code DO : Name Tests after Functionality CONSIDER : Use " Cannot " Prefix for Expected Exceptions
Bryan has over a dozen more suggestions .
Finally a couple of people suggested Gerard Meszaros ’s book : “ xUnit Test Patterns : Refactoring Test Code ”

Silver Soaring
I have recommended gold and silver for a few years .
In September / October , 2008 , we went through a difficult period for all when gold managed to hold its own , and stocks crashed up to 60 percent .
Now the stock market is still down , even after a 30 percent rally .
Silver took a beating .
Now silver is nearing a new high .
It went as low as a little over $ 9 , and is now almost $ 16 .
It ’s a long ways from being too late to buy in .
Some of you are asking me about storing metals with the seller or buying ETFs .
No !
No !
No !
That ’s paper metal , and there is no way to ensure they are actually putting aside the metal .
One of my recommended companies , Investment Rarities ( www.investmentrarities.com) works with a bonded storage company that will store 1,000 oz .
bars of the metal for you .
They will give you actual serial numbers on the bars , and you can take possession of it on demand .
But if you have a 1,000 - ounce gold bar , how would you use some of it to buy groceries ?
The best way is gold and silver coins .
Silver coins will be the most useful for the quantities in which most people buy things .
I also prefer silver because it is less likely to be seized by Government .
Government will probably not even want to seize gold as Roosevelt did .
At that time , gold represented government wealth and Roosevelt wanted to repair the government ’s balance sheet .
Right now , the government is treating gold as just another commodity , and they are making gold coins and selling them .
So it is possible , but not likely .
There is very little likelihood that they will ever want your silver because the silver market is so tiny it will not make one bit of difference to them .
So seizure is less likely .
Fake - outs Continued
In the last Ruff Times , I wrote about stock market fake - outs – false rallies that raise false hopes .
Now more financial advisors are telling everyone the market seems to be recovering .
Do n’t believe it !
During the big stock market crash from 1929 through the 30’s , the market had a huge one - day drop in 1929 , then rallied dramatically into 1932 , and then plunged to its eventual low of the Dow .
I believe we will see more fake - outs , and we ’re seeing one right now .
This market rally has no legs .
Short - term speculators will probably make some money if they time it right , but that ’s not my game .
Stay with investments that have the best long - term trend ahead of them .
Someone once asked , “ Howard , you have always said ‘ buy low and sell high . ’
The stock market is low , should n’t I buy now then sell high ? ”
No , the market is not low as measured by its high PE ( Price Earnings ratio ) and its sagging earnings , which will get worse as time goes on .
The market cannot withstand the major inflation we will see towards the end of 2009 .
Do n’t listen if some - one tries to suck you into it .
They will try to get you to play the short - term trader ’s game , and that is a loser ’s game .
Eventually the market will win .
If you are a speculator and can afford to lose the money , then go ahead and lose it or stick with the long - term trends .
My job is to ferret out the trend of the future and that trend is inflation .
Remember Will Rogers said , “ Invest in inflation , it ’s the only thing that ’s going up . ”
The most money to be made by betting on inflation will be doing it while the fundamentals are clearly being laid .
Prices have not yet reflected it , but they will .
When I do speaking engagements , the brokers in the audience wo n’t like what I have to say .
Wall Street has never approved of me , but I am still here , and most of them have left the brokerage business .
I will go out in a blaze of glory and bet my future ( with less of it left ) that I ’m right .
All you need to make money is guts .
Subscriber Question Dear Howard ,
Please make a statement about an exit strategy from gold stocks , if they have a huge increase .
What if a gold stock goes from $ 30 to $ 80 ?
Do I cash out and go to a weaker dollar again within my brokerage account ?
Convert to another currency ?
Thanks , Jason Dear Jason ,
What you suggest is a short - term strategy where you juggle your money to try to take advantage of short - term moves .
If you sell your gold or silver , you will be hit with a 28 percent tax on your gain as a collectible .
We are working with two senators and one congressman to change that tax rule so it could be ordinary capital gains .
But why should you reward the government with any amount of taxes for your perspicacity in buying silver or gold stocks .
Do n’t jump from one train to the other .
You could fall on the tracks , if your timing is n’t perfect .
My recommendations are for the long - term only , and I will not try to out - guess short - term moves , even if we have spectacular moves which tempt you to take profits and find a cheaper place to put your money .
It ’s up to you , but you ’ll have to do it without my help .
Another Query Several subscribers have asked me about investing in the Swiss franc in place of gold .
The Swiss franc is backed by gold .
Back in the ‘ 70s , when I was on Wall Street Week , one guest host chewed me out for not recommending Swiss francs because they had done so well .
My defense was to point out that gold and silver I had recommended were doing even better .
Nevertheless , a lot of people made money in the Swiss franc as it was a very strong currency versus the dollar and served as an adequate inflation hedge .
The franc was not as good , but still pretty good .
Build your portfolio around precious metals bullion and coins , but if you wish to put some of your money into the Swiss franc , that ’s fine .
You can open a Swiss bank account and put the cash into any currency you want , or even put your Swiss bank account into gold or silver .
I will write more about this later , but in the meantime , I do n’t object to buying the Swiss franc , I just do n’t think it is as good a hedge bullion .
The franc is fine as a hedge against the dollar as it weakens against other currencies .

Chinese publishers rush Jackson biography into print
By Chen Jia ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-07-06 07:38
Surviving on a diet of coffee and cigarettes , two Chinese writers have written an " instant book " on Michael Jackson in just 48 hours .
The 130,000 - word book , titled Moonwalk in Paradise -- the Michael Jackson biography , written by Jiang Xiaoyu and Xing Han , and published by Chinese publishing house Xiandai was available for pre-order sales online on Friday and on bookshelves Saturday .
The cover of a biography
The writers , who were contacted within hours of Jackson 's death , said they switched off their mobile phones and did n't sleep for two days while they wrote the book .
A report in China Youth Daily said the writers never met or interviewed Jackson and simply wrote the story from their " accumulated knowledge about the king of pop " .
" Though it is hard to tell how big the market for instant books is in China , I am sure we have done a nice job on quickly responding to market needs , " Zang Yongqing , general editor of Xiandai , told China Daily .
Jiang , who has written blogs and reviews about the pop icon , said he hoped his book would help Chinese fans find a better way to relieve their pain .
" I am not only a music critic but also a fan of the King of Pop , so I understand what fans really need , " he said .
" The ' painkiller ' could be a book I fought the deadline around the clock , as fans cannot wait for months , " he said .
A reader browses a biography of Michael Jackson at the Xinhua Bookstore Sunday in Beijing .
Books about the late star are appearing on bookshelves only a week after his death .
[ China Daily / Wang Jing ]
But Li Kun , a 26 - year - old assistant in a Beijing - based public relations company , told China Daily that she would buy a classic biography , not an instant book .
" It would be a kind of disrespect to my pop idol if I paid for a scrappy book of his legendary life which was finished in two days , " she said .
Zhao Xin , a PhD student of literature at Beijing Normal University , said " authenticity and accuracy " should be the cornerstones of a biography .
" The writers might infringe on copyright if they never had the chance to interact with the subject , " he said .
Jiang Zengpei , a Chinese publisher , said : " I am worried about the publishing industry in China , because many instant books have been fabricated with information from other books or the Internet .
" Publishing , an important part of the culture industry , should be creative work , " the publisher said .
Zang , of Xiandai , said Jackson had a big influence on many Chinese and that people would want to buy the book .
" It is enough to justify an ' instant book ' written in only two days , is n't it ? " he commented .
The owner of a bookshop near a train station in Beijing , who refused to be named , said : " I ordered 50 books , because I thought the best time for sales would be around his funeral .
Jackson 's funeral will be held in Los Angeles Tuesday .
" But I now have second thoughts people might not buy the books without free albums , " he said .
More than 10 Chinese publishing houses are also planning to launch instant books about Jackson .
Do you remember a time when they were n't trying to destroy something on the Discovery Channel ?
These days , that memory is as distant as an exploding hydrogen tank somewhere off the coast of Antarctica .
This time around however , they are looking to destroy things of value , instead of homemade shacks and tin cans .
I have to be honest , the last show I reviewed for Discovery Channel looked a lot more promising than it turned out to be .
The premise was great , things get destroyed .
Sadly , things got destroyed - by fireworks .
That seems to be behind us now , as the Discovery Channel 's little padawan the Science Channel is premiering a new show that is also promising to destroy things .
Wait , is n't that the same idea ?
Not exactly .
While things may be destroyed , constestants will have the chance to save the items from destruction .
Confused ?
From the press release :
During each episode of Catch It Keep
It three contestants test their scientific and engineering mettle against Science Channel ’s “ engineer of destruction , ” Mike Senese , who devises dastardly schemes uniquely designed to obliterate the prize of the week .
The contestants must brainstorm , plan and construct a way to rescue the item within the span of 48 hours – teams can build anything from a blast / fire - proof box to a giant net used for catching objects in mid fall .
Host Zach Selwyn guides viewers through the pressure - packed 48 hours of organized chaos as the team works tirelessly , not only against the clock , but also against passionate differences of opinion and seemingly never - ending obstacles .
The only things mentioned so far that are up for destruction is a Gibson Les Paul guitar surrounded by chemicals and a years supply of beer hooked to explosives .
I think this will be entertaining if for nothing else than to watch engineers argue .
However , without watching the show I 'm not going to make any snap judgements , but I can take a break from video games for a little while to check out the possibility of something getting destroyed .
Hopefully they do n't put any Xbox or Wii systems on the chopping block , or even worse - someone 's comic collection .
That would be scary .
Wired :
Things get blown up - possibly .
Tired :
Things might not get blown up .
Catch It Keep
It premiers Friday July 17th at 10 pm EST .
As these kinda events can break the ice so to speak as it all has been water under the bridge up until now where BC Rail scandal has taken a turn for Watergate .
Only problem who is going to hold the premier responsible for the corruption ?
The BC justice system and Judge Bennett maybe but that remains to be seen as justice truly moves slowly in BC as the corruption all came to life as Campbell 's starts out as premier for BC , three terms ago .
How does the premier get away with it ?
Well that you will have to ask the people who voted the Liberals in , all 22 % of the BC population who felt the Liberals where the end all be all for BC .
Canwest is in the Campbell Camp where Liberals can do no wrong and it looks like they can do no right but no one is telling so far .
I can't wait to see what unfolds as justice is knocking on the premier 's door but no on is answering .
And why would the premier as he promised British Columbians an open accountable governemnt and then puts a muzzle on the works .
How does that work well it dose n't and all thanks to a media 's love affair with the premier and his double dealing it should be interesting what comes out ; or what dose n't come out as more likely the outcome .
Should the premier and his government be held accountable for obstructing justice ?
Without a doubt as Campbell 's Liberals had set out from the start to deceive , deceive , deceive as the justice system fails to make their case .
And what does Campbell promise British Columbians ?
Transparancey and openess and accountability so " Quilty of Corruption " only who is going to make the " Campbell " accountable ?
God , and here I thought Campbell was one as he rules over our justice system like a lord and master as our justice system is no stranger to lies .

In 1845 , the onset of the Great Irish Famine resulted in over a million deaths .
Ottoman Sultan Khaleefah Abdul - Majid
I declared his intention to send 10,000 sterling to Irish farmers but Queen Victoria requested that the Sultan send only 1,000 sterling , because she had sent only 2,000 sterling herself .
The Sultan sent the 1,000 sterling but also secretly sent 3 ships full of food .
The English courts tried to block the ships , but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman Sailors .
Due to this the Irish people , especially those in Drogheda , are friendly to the Turks .
( Note , in 1845 , the 10,000 pounds dedicated to the Irish from the Sultan would be worth approximately 800,000 pounds today , that is $ 1,683,280 US Dollars .
On the other hand , the Queen gave the equivilant of 160,000 pounds today or 336,656 US Dollars )
The Osmanli Traveller blog has copied to text a writeup by a Christian Priest who wrote about the Sultan of the time in his travelogue .
His account mentions this incident briefly .
What is interesting is that without knowing of the secret sending of the ships , the priest was already impressed with the character of the Sultan in his response to the Queen .
On the Character of Sultan Abdul - Majid Khan , by the Rev. Henry Christmas M.A. ( Christian Priest ) written in 1853 : ‘ One or two anecdotes will put his character in its true light .
During the year of famine in Ireland , the Sultan heard of the distress existing in that unhappy country ; he immediately conveyed to the British ambassador his desire to aid in its relief , and tendered for that purpose a large sum of money .
It was intimated to him that it was thought right to limit the sum subscribed by the Queen , and a larger amount could not therefore be received from his highness .
He at once acquiesced in the propriety of his resolution , and with many expressions of benevolent sympathy , sent the greatest admissible subscription .
It is well known that his own personal feeling dictated the noble reply of the divan to the threatening demands of Austria and Russia for the extradition of the Polish and Hungarian refugees .
" I am not ignorant , " was his reply , " of the power of those empires , nor of the ulterior measures to which their intimations point ; but I am compelled by my religion to observe the laws of hospitality ; and I believe that the sense and good feeling of Europe will not allow my government to be drawn into a ruinous war , because I resolve strictly and solemnly to adhere to them . "
This is the true spirit of Christianity , and there is more it in the Mohammedan Sultan of Turkey , than in any or all of the Christian princes of Eastern Europe . '
Reference : " The Sultan of Turkey , Abdul Medjid Khan : A Brief Memoir of His Life and Relign , with Notices of The Country , its Navy , & present Prospects " by the Rev. Henry Christmas , M.A. , 1853
Also note , this generosity and compassion occurred during the time of the supposed ‘ downfall ' of the Ottoman empire according to Western history books , and Sultan Abdul Majid in himself is not counted as one of the greatest of Ottoman Sultans .
A simple examination of the events surrounding this engagement will open anyone 's eyes to the high station of the character of Khaleefah 's combined with their skillful ability to traverse political waters to achieve moral , Islamic ends .
How many more secret missions remain yet to be uncovered ?
I was stunned to read this from Time Magazine :
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in May that births to unmarried women have reached an astonishing 39.7 % .
How much does this matter ?
More than words can say .
There is no other single force causing as much measurable hardship and human misery in this country as the collapse of marriage .
It hurts children , it reduces mothers ’ financial security , and it has landed with particular devastation on those who can bear it least : the nation ’s underclass .
I checked it out at the CDC ; it is n’t a typo :
The trend in unmarried childbearing was fairly stable from the mid-1990s to 2002 , but has shown a steep increase between 2002 and 2007 .
Between 1980 and 2007 , the proportion of births to unmarried women in the United States has more than doubled , from 18 percent to 40 percent .
Iceland ( 66 percent ) , Sweden ( 55 percent ) , Norway ( 54 percent ) , France ( 50 percent ) , Denmark ( 46 percent ) and the United Kingdom ( 44 percent ) all have higher proportions of births to unmarried mothers than the United States .
Ireland ( 33 percent ) , Germany and Canada ( 30 percent ) , Spain ( 28 percent ) , Italy ( 21 percent ) and Japan ( 2 percent ) have lower percentages than the United States .
Another tidbit :
The highest rates of out of wedlock births are in D.C. ( 59 % ) and Mississippi ( 54 % ) and the lowest rate is in Utah ( 20 % ) .
The new equilibrium we are moving toward seems a very different world .
Women free to pick a dad without expecting him to stay as a long term helper probably pick sexier men .
This should create more inequality in male access to women for sex and kids , and give men more free time to compete to be the few super - sexy super - dads .
Women would get to have kids fathered by sexier men , but at the expense of raising those kids with less male help .
More men would be sex - failures with more free time to pursue long - shot plans to reverse their fortunes , and without wives to moderate them .
How many of those plans will be peaceful ?
I guess this helps somewhat to explain the explicitly sex - aggressive men I see more of these days .
When I wrote :
If you do n’t signal your continued love she may well conclude that your love has in fact changed .
“ Master Dogen ” responded :
Hanson … seems to be thoroughly trained in thinking that the best way to long - term health in a relationship with a woman is to signal “ caring more than everyone else ” and “ giving gifts , ” etc .
This , of course , is the constant position of a supplicant . …
I advocate a very different way of dealing with a woman …
So let ’s assume you are an alpha , and you ’ve trained your woman to supplicate you rather than the other way around . …
You must continue signaling your dominance : gently pull her hair when you go in for a kiss , raise you voice sternly when she steps out of line , flirt shamelessly with other women in public .
I might not like it , but I ca n’t argue that the future does n’t hold a lot more of this .

Braess ’s Paradox and “ The Ewing Theory ”
I spend a silly amount of time thinking about basketball .
Usually this works directly to my detriment , since it means that I easily get distracted when I ’m supposed to be working .
And when you ’re trying to make living “ theorizing ” , focus can be at a premium .
But after Tuesday ’s post on the price of anarchy , I ca n’t help thinking about what these ideas could do if they were applied to basketball .
If you have n’t read the “ price of anarchy ” post yet , please do , or the things I say here might not make a lot of sense .
Like the study of traffic patterns , basketball is a network problem .
Each possession can be thought of as a journey from point A to point B , where point A is the beginning of the possession and point B is a shot attempt .
The team can go from A to B by any number of routes .
The “ path ” they take is the sequence of plays and passes leading up to the shot .
As a simple example , here ’s what a pick and roll between the point guard and the power forward might look like :
One possible outcome of the play is that the point guard keeps the ball the whole time and takes a shot : this would be the top routes .
You could also have the point guard pass to the power forward after the screen and have the power forward take the shot : this would be the bottom routes .
Or you could have the point guard pass to the power forward after the screen , who then hits the cutting small forward for the shot .
Each of these plays ( there are six possibilities ) represents a different path , and each path will have a different efficiency .
If you ’re a basketball coach or player , the question you want to know is : which plays should I run , and how often ?
In network language , the question would be : what is the optimal usage rate for each path ?
The question can be an extremely tricky one , as we saw with traffic patterns .
It may be that shutting down a link or a node ( elminating a possible pass or player from the play ) improves the overall efficiency .
In the study of traffic , this was Braess ’s Paradox : closing a road can improve traffic .
In basketball , it gets called “ The Ewing Theory ” , and its implication is this : eliminating a scoring option can improve the efficiency of your offense .
If you ’ve never heard of The Ewing Theory , please check out this article by the always - hilarious Bill Simmons of ESPN.com .
Simmons coined the term to describe the observation that the New York Knicks always seemed to play better when their best player , Patrick Ewing , was out .
( Just to be pedantic , the “ Ewing Theory ” is n’t really a theory ; it ’s an observation .
It should probably be called the “ Ewing Paradox ” ) .
My goal for this post is to give a plausibility argument for the Ewing Theory .
I want to show that it is truly possible for a team to improve when their best player and primary offensive option is removed .
What ’s more , it can happen without any psychological effects ( like the team being extra motivated to play hard without their star player ) .
The answer has everything to do with the price of anarchy , and the fact that making the highest - percentage play every time down the court is not the same as playing your best possible game .
The team with a dominant big man
Basketball may be a network problem , but it is an almost hopelessly complicated one .
There are so many possible variations of so many possible plays , that it would be silly to try and draw them all out in one diagram .
So I ’m going to simplify the network very drastically , and assume there are only two points : the beginning of the possession and the shot attempt .
This is equivalent to assuming that the only thing that matters for efficiency of a play is who takes the shot .
It ’s a big assumption , but it allows us to make definite predictions .
I ’m going to assume that the team has one star player , whom I ’ll call Patrick , and four “ average ” players .
The diagram for their offense will look like this :
Patrick may be far - and - away the best offensive option on this team , but that does n’t mean that he should shoot every time .
That ’s because , as a scorer , he will become less efficient the more he is used .
The more shots Patrick takes , the more the defenses will focus on him and make it hard for him to score .
As a result , Patrick ’s teammates should take some significant fraction of the team ’s shots , even though they are not as good as he is .
We can make a guess as to how Patrick ’s offensive efficiency might decline with the number of shots he takes :
If Patrick is used only very rarely , then the defense will not adjust to him and scoring will come easy .
As a result , he ’ll shoot nearly 80 % from the field .
In contrast , if Patrick takes every shot his shooting percentage will drop to nearly 20 % .
It ’s not terribly easy to find justification for this assumption : a good player never takes only 2 % of his team ’s shots , and no one in their right mind would ever try to take every single shot for his team ( * insert Allen Iverson joke here * ) .
But there is definitely evidence for a negative correlation between a player ’s field goal percentage and the number of shots he takes .
Consider this data for “ dominant big men ” Shaquille O’Neal and Kevin Garnett :
Each data point on this graph represents a different season in their respective careers ( see Data Footnotes at the bottom ) .
The message is fairly clear : when your big man is used as the primary offensive option , his efficiency suffers .
When he is used more rarely , to clean up misses and take advantage of low - post mismatches , he is significantly more effective .
Just to show that this effect is n’t limited to low - post players , here is a similar data set for guards Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant :
Clearly , Ray Allen the occasional sharpshooter is more effective than Ray Allen the go - to offensive creator .
And the story is similar for Kobe Bryant .
How to best use your superstar
Back to our hypothetical Patrick .
Suppose that Patrick ’s “ average ” teammates all shoot 45 % .
( Since none of them will ever be called upon for more than a fifth of the team ’s offense , we do n’t need to worry about how their efficiency declines with usage . )
Patrick is clearly a better shooter than his teammates , so how many of his team ’s shots should he take ?
The answer depends on your level of strategy .
You might think that the best option is to feed the ball to Patrick until his field goal percentage drops to the level of his teammates .
Only then should his teammates shoot the ball .
And indeed , it ’s hard to argue with this logic : if Patrick is shooting 60 % and his teammates are only shooting 45 % , then clearly Patrick should be taking more shots , right ?
In game theory , this strategy is called the “ Nash Equilibrium ” ; it is the result of considering each play individually , and looking for the best possible outcome .
It is also completely equivalent to the “ selfish ” optimum in the traffic problem , where each driver takes the path that is in their own best interest .
As a result of the strategy , Patrick takes about 44 % of the team ’s shots ( more than three times more than any of his teammates ) and the team shoots 45 % from the field .
But something seems wrong , does n’t it ?
You have a superstar player who is capable of shooting as well as 80 % from the field , but still the team is only making 45 % of its attempts ?
There must be a better strategy .
And , of course , there is .
Here is a plot of the team ’s overall shooting percentage as a function of the number of shots that Patrick takes :
As you can see , the team is most efficient when Patrick takes only about 21 % of the team ’s shots , just slightly more than everyone else .
It seems ridiculous at first : in such a game Patrick would be shooting 60 % while his teammates shot only 45 % ; surely he should be getting more shots .
But the added benefit of keeping Patrick more poorly - defended pays off , and his team ’s shooting percentage improves to about 48.5 % .
This is the price of anarchy in basketball .
A team that looks for the best play each time down the floor will shoot only 45 % , whereas a team aware of its “ global optimum ” can do as well as 48.5 % .
They just have to purposefully refrain from going to their superstar , even when he is the best option .
I think about this sometimes when I watch the Magic use Dwight Howard sparingly , or when the Lakers use Pau Gasol only as a third option , even though he ’s clearly their most efficient scorer .
Maybe that ’s not bad teamwork ; maybe it ’s good strategy .
What happens when Patrick goes out ?
So what happens when Patrick injures his Achilles tendon and must be replaced by an “ average ” teammate ?
Certainly , the global optimum decreases .
The team no longer has Patrick ’s 60 % shooting to bolster them , and must rely on a team of five 45 % shooters .
But if the team was going by the “ one play at a time ” strategy ( the Nash Equilibrium ) and not the best possible strategy ( the global optimum ) , then losing Patrick does n’t hurt them at all .
Having five equally “ average ” players forces them to share the ball and prevents the defense from focusing in on any on player .
As a result everyone shoots 45 % .
They shot 45 % when Patrick was on the court anyway , so the team loses nothing by having him sit out .
The arguments of this post have been a little tricky , but the final conclusion is fairly straightforward .
When the team ’s best player is not on the court , the team is forced to make harder , lower - percentage plays and to share the ball .
And when a team shares better , it plays better : the defense is kept off balance and has no room to focus in on any one guy .
These sorts of improvements can make up for the loss of direct offensive production .
The point of this post was not to make a quantitative prediction .
There were a lot of unjustified assumptions here , and you should n’t take any of them too literally .
The point was to show that the “ network ” of an offense can have surprising and unpredictable properties .
For a team to play its best possible game , it might need to intentionally take lower - percentage shots .
When a team loses a high - percentage option , its overall offense might adjust in surprising ways that can make the team better .
Flow becomes re-routed in the offensive network , and the result might be to push the team closer to its true global optimum .
The Ewing Theory , in my mind , is completely plausible .
Data Footnotes
The data above is taken for full seasons from the careers of the respective NBA players .
I omitted the first two seasons of each player ’s career ( while they were still improving significantly ) , and any season where the player missed more than a third of the games due to injury .
Kobe Bryant had two seasons of anomalously low field goal percentage during the rocky seasons of 03 - 04 and 04-05 ( where he missed 33 games because of the Colorado rape trial and a severe ankle sprain ) .
These are shown on the graph but are not included in the fit line .
UPDATE : To those readers who objected to my use of FG % as a measure of “ scoring effectiveness ” rather than something like TS % , maybe this will be slightly more convincing :

The international group of right - wingers who staged the coup d'état against the democratic government of Honduras on 28 June are watching their plot fast unravel .
There is stiffening international opposition to their protégé , Roberto Micheletti , who , in his capacity as President of Congress , ordered President Manuel Zelaya to be expelled from the country by plane in his pyjamas .
Mr Zelaya gave negotiators meeting in Costa Rica until midnight yesterday to restore him to office , threatening to secretly return to Honduras and attempt to retake power on his own if no agreement is reached .
At a news conference at the Honduran embassy in Nicaragua , he said : " I am going back to Honduras , but I am not going to give you the date , hour or place , or say if I 'm going to enter through land , air or sea . "
But indications last night suggested the interim government would call his bluff .

As the Acting President 's support shrinks at home , the plotters are lobbying to have Mr Micheletti shored up from abroad by means of a declaration of legitimacy from the US Congress .
That scheme is not prospering .
Enrique Ortez Colindres , the supremely undiplomatic octogenarian appointed foreign minister by Mr Micheletti , has had to resign , but not before he called Barack Obama " a negrito who knows nothing about anything " , on Honduran television .
For some of the plotters it is their second attempt to overthrow an elected reformist government in Latin America : the group includes prominent figures involved in the 2002 ousting of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela , who was kidnapped for 48 hours and sent to a Caribbean island before being restored to office after widespread popular protest .
The temporary toppling of Mr Chavez was welcomed by the Bush administration , the Blair government and the International Monetary Fund .
This weekend , the US seems destined for a replay of 2002's Operation Chaotic Coup .
Amid a stream of contradictory messages it is clear that last month 's putsch against Mr Zelaya was brewed up in Washington by a group of extreme conservatives from Venezuela , Honduras and the US .
They appear to have hidden their plans from the White House , but hoped eventually to bounce President Obama into backing them and supporting the " interim president " .
They are making much of Mr Zelaya 's alliance with Mr Chavez , whose sense of nationalism challenges US hegemony .
Financial backing for the coup is identified by some as coming from the pharmaceutical industry , which fears Mr Zelaya 's plans to produce generic drugs and distribute them cheaply to the impoverished majority in Honduras , who lack all but the most primitive health facilities .
Others point to big companies in the telecommunications industry opposed to Hondutel , Honduras 's state - owned provider .
Parallels are being made with ITT , the US telecommunications company that offered the Nixon government funds for the successful overthrow of President Salvador Allende of Chile in 1973 .
A key figure is Robert Carmona - Borjas , a Venezuelan active against Mr Chavez in 2002 , who later fled to the US .
He runs the Washington - based Arcadia , which calls itself " an innovative ' next generation ' anti-corruption organisation " .
Its website carries three video clips alleging , without evidence , that Mr Zelaya , his associates and Hondutel are deeply corrupt .
Behind Arcadia are the US - funded National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) and the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , the well - funded overseas arm of the Republican Party .
Currently active among the Uighurs of western China , the NED has this year funnelled $ 1.2 m ( £ 740,000 ) for " political activity " in Honduras .
The focus of attention in the campaign against Mr Zelaya is now on the office of Senator John McCain , the defeated US presidential candidate , who is chairman of the IRI , takes an interest in telecoms affairs in the US Congress and has benefited handsomely from campaign contributions from US telecoms companies – which are said to have funded the abortive 2002 coup against Mr Chavez .
Mr McCain 's former legislative counsel , John Timmons , arranged the visit of Micheletti supporters to Washington on 7 July where they met journalists at the National Press Club " to clarify any misunderstandings about Honduras 's constitutional process and ... the preservation of the country 's democratic institutions " .

Meanwhile , within the US administration , difficulties in co-ordination have emerged between the State Department and the White House , with the Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , issuing a low - key condemnation of the coup which was quickly superseded by stronger words from Mr Obama .
The President called for Mr Zelaya 's reinstatement , which Mrs Clinton had failed to demand .
The conservative - minded Mrs Clinton retains John Negroponte , an ambassador to Honduras under Ronald Reagan , as an adviser .
He also represented George W Bush at the UN and in Baghdad .
Democratic Senator Chris Dodd attacked Mr Negroponte in 2001 for drawing a veil over atrocities committed in Tegucigalpa , the Honduran capital , by military forces trained by the US .
Mr Dodd claimed that the forces had been " linked to death squad activities such as killings , disappearances and other human rights abuses " .
During his time in Tegucigalpa , Mr Negroponte directed funds to the US - supported Contra terrorists seeking to overthrow the government of Nicaragua .
He assured them of arms and supplies from the Palmerola airstrip , the main US base in Central America .
As President Rafael Correa of Ecuador is in the final stages of closing the US base in his country , Mr Negroponte is conscious of what the US could lose if a Zelaya government banned its presence at Palmerola .
For their part , Hondurans have noted that when Mr Zelaya tried to return on 6 July , and his plane was refused permission to land at Tegucigalpa airport , no room was found at Palmerola .
Since last July , the US ambassador in Tegucigalpa has been the Cuban - born Hugo Llorens .
He was the principal National Security adviser to Mr Bush on Venezuela at the time of the failed 2002 coup , when he was working with two other well - known State Department hardliners , Otto Reich and Elliot Abrams .
Mr Reich , a former US ambassador to Venezuela , advised Mr McCain in his presidential bid and previously worked for AT&T , the US telecoms giant .
As he goes into battle against Mr Zelaya , the website of his business consultancy , Otto Reich Associates , quotes Mr Reagan : " You understand the importance of fostering democracy and economic development among our closest neighbours . "
Mr Abrams was also deep in the business of supplying the Contra terrorists .
He tried to sabotage the Central American peace plans proposed by Oscar Arias , then the Costa Rican President , who later received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts .
In 1991 Mr Abrams , a neoconservative passionately supportive of Ehud Olmert and other leading Israeli hawks , was convicted of hiding information from the US Congress investigation of the Iran - Contra affair .
The New York Times reported in 2006 that he had strong ties to then vice - president Dick Cheney .
In a divided Washington , Mrs Clinton seems in recent days to have regained some advantage .
Now Washington 's strategy is to minimise the role of the pan-continent Organisation of American States which , under the leadership of the independent - minded Chilean José Miguel Insulza , took a strong line against the " interim president " .
Washington is now relying on Mr Arias , a firm friend in Central America , to soften the line against Mr Micheletti .
He is trying to " mediate " between Mr Zelaya and the coup 's appointee by putting them on the same footing .
On Friday he called for a " government of national reconciliation " with ministers from both camps , a proposal which it appeared Mr Zelaya would countenance but that the interim government would not .
Yet the outcome of the crisis is not likely to be worked out in huddles of foreign politicians outside Honduras , but on the streets of Tegucigalpa and in the country 's forests – perhaps even this weekend .
Honduran voters have traditionally – and ineffectually – been organised into two parties , the Nationals and the Liberals , whose politics are almost indistinguishable .
But repudiation of Mr Micheletti is widespread .
The principal roads have been blocked by Mr Zelaya 's supporters brandishing banners calling for his return .
Mr Micheletti has been forced to re-establish the curfew he imposed just after the putsch .
He has even offered to resign in order to prevent civil war – provided Mr Zelaya does not return .
Another worrying development for Mr Micheletti came on Friday , when the armed forces delivered a solemn and urgent message that they were totally united in favour of democracy .
In the world of Latin American politics , this is a sign that they are deeply divided .
At the festivities on Friday commemorating the 200th anniversary of Bolivia breaking free from Spanish rule , Mr Chavez joined Bolivia 's President , Evo Morales , President Fernando Lugo of Paraguay and President Correa in a declaration of support for the re-establishment of democracy in Honduras .
All four leaders are strong supporters of demands for better treatment of Latin America 's indigenous peoples .
Perhaps that 's what is really worrying the plotters of Tegucigalpa .
Hugh O'Shaughnessy 's study of President Fernando Lugo , ' The Priest of Paraguay ' , will be published next month by Zed Books
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Norway ’s $ 380 billion oil fund seeks more influence over how thousands of companies in which it holds stock tackle climate change , and mold a blueprint for ‘ green ’ activism by institutional investors .
The fund will publish a report later on Friday about its expectations for company management of environmental issues in the hope of creating a platform for dialogue with corporations and , potentially , for shareholder action .
Norway ’s wealth fund , the biggest owner of European stocks , believes that environmental factors may sooner or later hit earnings and profitability of the companies it owns and sees its green ambitions as part its wider push for long - term profits .
“ Our primary goal will always be to use our active ownership to improve the fund ’s financial performance in the long - term -- and that is well aligned with an environmental focus , ” Anne Kvam , head of corporate governance at the fund , told Reuters .
“ This report makes it easier for companies to understand our concerns ... and it could serve as a reference for other investors who want to address similar issues , ” she said .
Commonly known as the “ oil fund , ” the Government Pension Fund -- Global invests Norway ’s oil and gas wealth in foreign stocks and bonds to save for when the black gold runs out .
It is the world ’s second largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates , and held 1.3 percent of all listed European stocks at the end of 2008 .
BROADER REACH
The document marks an expansion of the fund ’s environmental activism , which Kvam said had been mainly focused on pushing U.S. energy companies toward greener targets -- an area the fund had felt its efforts would have the biggest impact .
The new tack widens its focus to firms producing chemicals , metals , cement , oil and gas , power as well as transport groups .
It also extends the geographical reach to include Asia as the region of “ the sharpest increase in climate influence , ” mainly due to fast growing carbon emissions in China and India .
The fund , which is run by the Norwegian central bank under a strict mandate from the government , will screen the “ high risk sectors ” and issue compliance reports every year .
Individual companies ’ “ green ” grades will not be published but privately shared with the corporations .
Kvam said continued poor performance may catch the eye of the fund ’s ethics council , which has blacklisted firms on environmental grounds .
Another new priority for the fund is dealing with water management , said Kvam , because continued availability of water resources will have a “ huge impact ” on how the Norwegian fund will develop in the decades to come .
Kvam said water was an important input or production factor for about 1,100 companies in the fund ’s current portfolio , whose combined market value is some $ 43 billion .
“ The shortage of water and increased demand is going to create risks for huge amounts of companies going forward and we as investors need to know that the companies are managing these risks , ” she said in an interview .
Kvam said that even though the credit and economic crises have rightly dominated the investment world for the past year , environmental issues were “ still firmly on the agenda ” for both shareholders and corporations .
In fact , she said the Norwegian fund has signed a declaration that will be put forward by a global group of investors calling on policymakers to iron out a climate change deal in Copenhagen later this year .
“ It ’s too early to say how far we can get ( by raising awareness of environmental issues among shareholders ) .
In 3 - 5 years we can check where we are , ” Kvam said .
After over six ( 6 ) years of handling my domain ’s email through self - built and administered Linux boxes , I just migrated all my email functionality over to Google .
This has never been a solid option for me for one primary reason : the mixing of gmail.com with my own domain ( danielmiessler.com ) .
Forwarding and changing “ reply to ” settings has never been that attractive to me .
That problem has been solved .
You can now let Google handle your domain ’s email while keeping your existing addresses .
That means you still get Google ’s webmail interface ( exactly like GMail ) but everything is tied directly to your domain .
It ’s called Google Apps .
Google Apps allows those with their own domain to move their entire mail infrastructure to Google .
That means keeping your email addresses exactly as they are today ( e.g. daniel@danielmiessler.com ) while gaining the benefit of being hosted by Google .
Here are a few advantages to consider :
Google uptime
Google speed
Long - term stability ( they are n’t going anywhere )
You can use the “ GMail ” interface as your domain ’s webmail and / or use IMAP or POP ( way better than most self - install webmail systems )
use IMAP or POP ( way better than most self - install webmail systems )
You can point http://mail.yourdomain.com to your new GMail interface .
to your new GMail interface .
You get to keep all of your addresses and present a clean identity to everyone ( nobody will see gmail.com in from or reply to fields )
Google ’s industry - leading spam protection
Full IMAP support ( with IDLE )
Full SMTP support ( no need for a separate outgoing server )
SSL support on both incoming and outgoing mail
No more worrying about keeping your mail server up
All of Google ’s mail power , but for your domain .
Notice how I ’m signing in below ; I just enter my first name “ daniel ” , as my domain is already filled out for me .
Way slicker than GMail .
And it ’s simple to setup ; I did the domain and two accounts in like 10 minutes ( including DNS changes )
Here are the basic steps :
Create a free account at Google Apps Verify your domain ownership with Google ( I did the file upload )
Change your MX records to point to Google ’s mail servers ( DynDNS makes this easy )
Wait for everything to update ( for me , 10 minutes ) [ optional ]
Pay the upgrade fee and import everything from another online mail account ( GMail , Hotmail , Yahoo ! , etc . )
That ’s pretty much it .
And keep in mind that Google Apps is n’t just for mail ; you can also have Chat , Calendar , Docs , and even your main web page hosted by Google .
And you can set up shortcuts so that you can get to your online Google Mail by going to http://mail.yourdomain.com.
Mine is at http://mail.danielmiessler.com, for example .
And you can do the same for your calendar , docs , etc .
So yeah , if you have n’t looked into Google Apps yet , it might be time to check it out . ::

Researchers say that a chemical profile of decomposition could eventually lead to a portable device for detecting human bodies at crime scenes and disaster areas .
Credit : Adam Dylewski , American Chemical Society
In an advance toward the first portable device for detecting human bodies buried in disasters and at crime scenes , scientists today report early results from a project to establish the chemical fingerprint of death .
Speaking here at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) , they said a profile of the chemicals released from decomposing bodies could also lead to a valuable new addition to the forensic toolkit :
An electronic device that could determine the time elapsed since death quickly , accurately and onsite .
Today , cadaver dogs are the gold standard for detecting and recovering bodies in earthquakes , tornadoes , hurricanes , and other natural disasters .
" These dogs are highly effective , but it takes lots of time , expense and manpower to train them .
If there was a device that was as effective for a fraction of the cost , that would be something worth pursuing , " says Dan Sykes , Ph.D. , collaborating on this research with graduate student Sarah A. Jones .
To develop such a device , scientists must identify what gases are released as bodies decompose under a variety of natural environmental conditions , Jones noted .
In addition , they must detail the time sequence in which those odorant chemicals are released in the hours and days after death .
" What we 're looking for is the profile of what gases are released when we die , as well as how the environment and the manner in which we die affects this profile , " Jones says .
Decomposing bodies release more than 30 compounds .
Some , like the aptly - named " putrescine " and " cadaverine , " develop early in the decomposition process .
Past studies used donated human bodies that were two to three days old .
As a result , these studies were unable to detect putrescine , cadaverine , and other compounds that appear very early in the decomposition process .
Jones and Sykes side - stepped that problem by using pigs euthanized under humane conditions to study decomposition immediately after death .
" Pigs are good models for this research , " Jones says .
" They go through the same phases of decomposition as humans , as well as the same number of stages .
And those stages last about as long in pigs as they do in humans before complete decomposition occurs and only the bones remain . "
Sykes and Jones placed dead pigs in specially designed odor - collecting units under a variety of environmental conditions .
Above each specimen , they affixed special sensors known as solid phase micro extraction ( SPME ) fibers to capture the gases .
These specially - coated fibers are widely used to sample chemical composition of air .
Jones and Sykes collected odor data every six to 12 hours over the course of a week .
Studying the week 's worth of odor data , a clear chemical profile emerged .
" In days one through three , we found precursors to indole , which is a really good sign .
On day three , we found indole and putrescine , the main compounds that we were trying to detect , " Jones says .
They now are capturing gases released in a variety of other scenarios to re-construct the different ways human bodies could decompose , creating a more complete picture of decomposition .

A hero to millions , Neil Armstrong has consistently shunned the limelight .
To mark the 40th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing , author Andrew Smith travelled across America to discover why the man who first set foot upon the Moon remains such an enigma .
His words on being the first person ever to set foot on the Moon have been written into soundbite history - but in the four decades since Neil Armstrong became a household name , he has also increasingly become an enigma .
Unlike many of his contemporaries , Armstrong has refused to cash in on his fame and seemingly done everything in his power to diminish it .
FIND OUT MORE ... Being Neil Armstrong , presented by Andrew Smith ( right ) , is on BBC Four at 0000 BST , Tuesday 7 July
Or watch it here on the BBC iPlayer So what has made Neil Armstrong such a reluctant hero , unsusceptible to the normal trappings of celebrity ?
And why wo n't he speak about his historic journey ?
In his quest to uncover the man behind the spacesuit , Andrew Smith , author of Moondust :
In Search of the Men Who Fell to Earth , decided to travel across America to meet people who have had an impact on Armstrong 's life .
His conclusion is that Armstrong , now 78 , believes simply that he did not deserve the attention .
" There were 400,000 people that worked on that [ Moon landing ] programme in various different ways and he thinks he did n't deserve all the credit just because he did the flying part , " says Smith .
But Armstrong became a celebrity overnight .
The Apollo 11 Moon landing marked a seismic shift in space exploration during a time when the world was captivated by space .
It was watched by the largest television audience of its time , and President Nixon put in a congratulatory phone call just after the US flag was planted .
On the astronauts ' return , Nasa sent them on a world tour .
Although Neil Armstrong initially went along with the celebrations , he always remained aloof ; an elusive presence who preferred to talk about facts rather than feelings .
Neil Armstrong was the commander aboard Apollo 11
He started to decline speeches and interviews , eventually refusing to sign autographs and shying away from being photographed in public .
" To my knowledge he has done two television interviews in the last 40 years - and he says nothing about what he felt about anything .
He will talk about matters of fact and that 's it , " says Smith .
The author has been repeatedly refused an interview with Armstrong despite many requests , although the pair have had e-mail correspondence .
" And he did n't want to profit from it financially - even though a lot of the other Moon walkers have done - and amazingly he 's stood by that .
An auction house told me that if Armstrong spent just one afternoon signing autographs he could make a million dollars , but he 's always refused . "
Face of space
Two years after his historic journey , in August 1971 , Armstrong left Nasa and decided to become a teacher .
" Ostensibly , it was a very strange decision .
He could have done anything , " says Smith .
Neil Armstrong , Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin made up the crew But if Armstrong thought a small aerospace engineering department at the University of Cincinnati would provide a refuge , he was to be disappointed .
" His old boss told me when he first arrived , he spent two hours every single day signing autographs for members of staff and students .
Apparently there was a window right at the top of the wall and people used to go and make human pyramids just to look into his office .
" He dealt with it but he did n't like it , he could n't walk across the campus without being constantly approached .
He ended up going and spending a lot of his time flying , on his own , to get away from it . "
Neil Armstrong 's decision to keep a low profile contrasts with the man he shared the limelight with on that historic lunar landing .
Buzz Aldrin has become the face of space , courting media attention with a series of high - publicity manoeuvres including a Buzz Aldrin 's Race into Space computer game and making a guest appearance in The Simpsons .
There are many more photos of Buzz Aldrin on the moon than Armstrong For the 40th anniversary of the Moon landing , Aldrin has teamed up with hip - hop artist Snoop Dogg and producer Quincy Jones to create a rap single and video , Rocket Experience .
It 's the kind of stunt that might send a shiver down Armstrong 's spine .
But in an age of mass celebrity culture , how has Armstrong managed to remain so enigmatic ?
" Everyone I met described Armstrong as a reserved and quiet man .
I started to wonder whether they were protecting him , or maybe , in some ways at least , he was just a rather ordinary , nice man , " says Smith .
And yet he concedes in many ways Armstrong is far from ordinary .
" He was an extraordinary pilot .
He 's flown the X - 15 , the fastest plane in the world , at 4,000 mph ( 6,440 km / h ) .
He can fly anything ; he is possibly the most distinguished pilot that has ever lived , " says Smith .
" His generation were enchanted by flying , they were aviation pioneers .
The Second World War pilots were their heroes .
Armstrong never wanted to be a celebrity , he wanted to push the boundaries of flight . "
Quiet determination
That an ordinary small town boy from Ohio might struggle with becoming one of the most famous men on the planet is hardly surprising .
But Smith thinks his steely , disciplined determination to shy away from the public eye is another of Armstrong 's strengths .
Neil Armstrong only makes very rare public appearances
He says it helped him cheat death three times before he even got to the Moon .
" He always kept his cool .
At one point on a flight he was just a fingernail away from not making it .
Afterwards , fellow Nasa astronaut Alan Bean told me he saw Armstrong filling out an incident report but recalled him saying he'd just had a ' little difficulty ' .
" He thought Armstrong had stubbed his toe or something , but actually he'd been two - fifths of a second away from death .
He could n't believe he was just calmly filling in forms as if nothing had happened - but that was the kind of man he was . "
And then there is Armstrong 's apparent eccentricity .
" The music he took on the mission to the Moon was deeply eccentric , " says Smith .
" Most astronauts took one classical piece , and one country and western .
" Armstrong took Dvorak 's New World Symphony .
But the other was theremin music - that eerie , wavy sound associated with sci- fi movies that goes ' woo woo ' .
On one hand it was the most perfect thing he could take , on the other it is massively eccentric - and that 's kind of him . "
And what about the poetic prose " That 's one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind " that slips off most people 's tongues almost as easily as Shakespeare 's famous lines " to be or not to be " ?
Whether Armstrong was fed the line by a press officer or it was his own musing is the subject of much speculation , but one of his oldest friends has his own theory about its origin .
" ' Kotcho ' Solacoff says they used to play the game Mother May I ? ( also commonly known as Grandmother 's Footsteps ) - where you take small steps or giant steps - in the playground .
He thinks it came from that .
It struck me as really weird , " says Smith .
Ordinary man or gentlemanly genius , maybe Armstrong 's most celebrated act has been to remain - certainly in many ways - a man of sizeable mystery .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Armstrong is the ultimate professional .
He was hired to do a job and he did it .
Then he went home .
William , Ilkley A man who we all love for what he did .
But a man who did what he did because he wanted to do it , not for the fame .
Fame on that scale is a daunting life for some .
Respect his wishes .
No amount of money would make the fame easy .
A man who is a living hero for doing something that was a thrill and a job for him .
An adventurer who wants to enjoy the rest of his life in piece without constant attention from anyone he meets for him going to the moon was just another day .
Living with fame is another thing all together
David , Wrexham
While I can respect Armstrong 's humbleness , a part of history will be lost if he never talks about his personal experiences .
Joe , Idaho , USA I recall reading at the time that Armstrong was chosen to be first on the moon as unlike all the other Apollo astronauts he was not a serving officer in the U.S. military .
As a test pilot employed by the Locheed Aircraft Corporation he was technically a civilian .
At the time it was important to be able to say the first man on the Moon was civilian and not military .
John Mackie , Glasgow UK .
I would love to meet and talk with Neil Armstrong , however i hope that all will let him be as that is certainly his desire , he has earned it !
Rich Allen , Houston Alaska
He not only redefined the frontiers of space expeditions but buried the crazy culture of celebrity .
He indeed deserves our standing ovations .
Besides he is not a funky footballer who is simply en cashing his few lucky kicks .
He is an astronaut .
Welcome to planet earth .
Mohammad Athar , Dubai , UAE Admirable not to let it go to his head but he could have used his celebrity to start humanitarian organizations .
Fame does n't have to be all bad .
Too bad he did n't have the foresight to use his fame for the good of mankind in a bigger way than the moon landing hero .
Phoenix , Honaunau , HI Reserved or not , Neil Armstrong we are all proud of you .
Ashwin , Bangalore I 've met him .
He knows he 's just a man and that 's what I love about him .
Luigi , tempe , az , USA Neil will always be a hero to many .
But I agree with him the entire team of the Apollo mission achieved something amazing , a true landmark in history .
Like the writing of the bible or Koran it has influenced many .
I believe that as a planet we should reach out and take historical steps , starting with reversing global warning .
Andrew Hattam , Bury St Edmunds England Good for Neil .
He has guarded the legacy of Apollo and the memory of colleagues who died , with integrity and humility .
Why should he be expected to dismantle all of that now ?
Simon Darnell , New York Mr. Armstrong has made a difference to the world and to all of us .
His famous words are being cited regularly in our household too .
But we can only respect and admire him for his choice to remain his own man .
Kari Wijbrans , Rheden , Netherlands Humility as always displayed by Mr Armstrong during his career showed his greatness as a scientist .
He is my man of the century !
Dr Sunny Gbenebitse - Daniel , Lagos Nigeria
It is wonderful to have an unassuming hero .

This interactive graphic gives a general visual idea of the way an infectious disease can spread around the world , reflecting transmission between people locally and extended by extensive international travel .
It can be modified to give an idea of the severity , rapidity and extent of infection .
For example , very provisional data for the current H1N1 swine flu pandemic suggests it could infect up to a third of the population , and cause deaths in up to 0.4 per cent of cases .
WARNING : This is not a predictive tool .
It was created by the FT graphics department and is not based on any epidemiological model of a particular disease .
It can not show the precise pattern of spread or the relative risk of exposure in a particular location , and does not take into account specific factors that may affect disease , such as the effect of other infections in people , nutrition , genetic factors , the mechanisms of transmission , or medical support and quarantining .
It does highlight the speed with which infection can spread globally in the 21st century .
How it works :
The green dots represent a sample of 600 ‘ individuals ’ moving randomly between 50 locations around the world .
About 5 per cent of the people are naturally immune ( blue dots ) .
Click on any of the green dots to start an outbreak .
As the infected dot travels it spreads the pathogen to others .
The infection rate is initially set to 25 per cent , so approximately one in every four dots that come into contact with the disease will be infected .
Increasing the infection rate will increase the speed at which the disease spreads .
Incubation time is the period between infection and the first symptoms .
Those incubating the disease ( yellow dots ) may not know they are infected , so they continue normally until they fall ill ( red dots ) when they tend to stop travelling .
Duration time is how long the disease lasts , before the patient either recovers and becomes immune , or dies from the infection .
Increasing the mortality rate will change the number of fatalities .
Pathogens with a high mortality rate and short duration , such as Ebola , may not spread far , as they kill the host before the disease can be passed on to another host .
For this graphic the incubation time and duration are measured in hours but in reality often take several days .

On Thursday , Engler admitted a sad truth :
As far as I can tell no movie title we ever come up with will ever get as much attention as Mansquito .
People bring it up all the time .

But instead of feeling sad about that , it seems as if the network looks upon it as an opportunity :
The joke title we always talk about wanting to make is Sharktopus ( half shark , half octopus ! ) .
It 's more fun to say outloud than to read .
Or should that be franchise ? :
We 've also joked about the Mansquito sequel , Womansquito .
Quite the laugh riot over here , no ?
I personally want to see Rhinosaur ...

Amazingly , Matthew Ross comes up with an angle that gets our attention :
Womansquito ?
Why not just call it Ms. Quito ?
Perhaps you could work in a feminist twist ...

I can't believe I 'm saying this , but I would totally watch Ms. Quito .

If anyone has the right to be excited about cloud computing , it 's John Chambers .
But on Wednesday , the Cisco Systems Inc. chairman and CEO conceded that the computing industry 's move to sell pay - as - you - go computing cycles available as a service on the Internet was also " a security nightmare . "
Speaking during a keynote address at the annual RSA security conference , Chambers said cloud computing was inevitable , but that it would shake up the way that networks are secured .
" You 'll have no idea what 's in the corporate data center , " he said .
" That is exciting to me as a network player .
Boy , am I going to sell a lot of stuff to tie that together . "
However , he added , " It is a security nightmare and it can't be handled in traditional ways . "
Cloud computing is a hot topic here at the security conference in San Francisco this week .
Big computing companies like Cisco and IBM are eager to talk about it , but security experts see a lot of work ahead .
" I think it 's really going to be a focal point of a lot of our work in the cybersecurity area , " said Ronald Rivest , an MIT computer science professor and noted cryptographer , speaking during a conference panel Tuesday .
" Cloud computing sounds so sweet and wonderful and safe ... we should just be aware of the terminology , if we go around for a week calling it swamp computing I think you might have the right mind - set . "
Rivest added that he was optimistic about cloud computing 's future , but that it was going to take " a lot of hard work " to make it secure .
Show attendees have n't bought into the concept either .
" I 'm not seeing a huge benefit in the cloud for us , " said Bruce Jones , chief information security officer at Kodak , speaking in an interview .
One of the main problems is that Jones does n't want to give up control of sensitive data to a nebulous cloud - based computing architecture .
For long - term computing projects , it 's probably cheaper to simply buy the hardware , he said , although cloud computing could work on a small scale at Kodak .
" It 's a pilot or an R&D project where they want to do something and they need some kind of on - demand scalability ; it 's good for that as long as you do n't care about the confidentiality of the data , " Jones said .
As data moves onto the cloud , Cisco 's security services will become even more important , and the company 's ability to dig in and inspect data moving on and off corporate networks will become even more critical , said Tom Gillis , vice president of marketing with Cisco 's security technology business unit .
" The move to collaboration , whether it be video or the use of Web 2.0 technologies or mobile devices is really dissolving the corporate perimeter , " Gillis said .
" This notion of security as a line that you draw in the sand ... that notion is just gone . "
And it 's not going to come back .
Chambers said that his company 's use of Web 2.0 technologies such as video blogging and conferencing has mushroomed in the past year .
In the first quarter of 2009 , Chambers held 262 meetings , he said .
Two hundred of them were virtual , using Cisco 's Tele Presence system .
" It 's got to be secure as we do this , " he said .
" This is our lives . "

Father Habacuc Hernandez and seminary students Eduardo Oregon Benitez and Silvestre Gonzalez were shot dead by gunmen over the weekend while driving through the town of Arcelia in southwestern Mexico .
According to the Archbishop of Acapulco Felipe Aguirre Franco , the victims were in the area to help organize a spiritual retreat when they were ordered out of their car and killed .
There seems to be no specific motive for the murders other than the fact that the clergy were caught up in the confrontation between rival drug gangs operating in the state of Guerrero .
Tensions between the Church and the drug cartels recently escalated after the Archbishop of Durango claimed everybody knew where Mexico 's most wanted man and alleged cartel leader , Joaquin Guzman , lived but authorities were doing nothing about it .
The Mexican government , however , refuted the archbishop ’s claim and he has remained silent since he made the statement .
No direct connection can be established between both incidents .
Archbishop Aguirre Franco was quoted by Mexican media saying " The law of the jungle , the law of the revolver , of the gun , the settling of accounts , the spilling of blood ” reigns in Mexico now .
The Bishops ’ Conference of Mexico issued a statement condemning “ the violence that has slammed our country ” and demanded that “ officials at all levels of government carry out a prompt investigation and find those responsible for this cowardly crime . ”

August 29 , 2009 00:17 MiniPerl6 1.0 " Perlito " bootstrapped in SBCL Lisp
MiniPerl6 ( mp6 ) is a subset of Perl 6 , which was designed as a light bootstrapping language .
The initial bootstrap used v6.pm and was then self - hosted in Perl 5 .
MiniPerl6 is now self - hosted both in SBCL Lisp and in Perl 5 .
A developer can modify the compiler source code ( written in MiniPerl6 ) and recompile either with the Perl 5 or with the SBCL backend .
The backends can cross -compile to each other .
MiniPerl6 can be downloaded from the Pugs repository : $ svn checkout http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs pugs $ cd pugs/v6/v6-MiniPerl6
You can create an executable binary using these commands : $ sh lisp - util / create - core - image.sh $ sbcl -- load mp6-lisp-create-core-image.lisp $ chmod +x mp6-lisp $ ./mp6-lisp -e ' class Main { say " hello , World ! " } ' ... lisp compiler warnings hello , World !
The bootstrapping procedure for both " perl " and " lisp " backends can be tested with : $ sh perl5 - util / bootstrap - perl5.sh $ diff -r lib5 lib5 - tmp # should show no differences $ sh lisp - util / bootstrap - lisp.sh ... lisp compiler warnings $ diff -r liblisp liblisp - tmp # should show no differences Links : 2006.11.04 MiniPerl6 compiler structure

Use DonorsChoose to Support Your Local Schools
This post is dedicated to my amazing wife .
She ’s a music teacher at two Title I schools .
This post is a bit long , but I hope you read it in its entirety .
In any American city there are different “ sides ” of town that spill across the landscape .
Some are fantastic , expensive places to live while others are well within the poverty zone .
In Birmingham we have Mountain Brook , one of the most affluent areas in the nation .
The median family income in Mountain Brook is over $ 150,000 .
The houses are grand , luxurious , and … expensive .
No one lives below the poverty line in Mountain Brook .
And then we have places like Pinson where the median family income is $ 48,000 and 10 % of the population lives below the poverty line .
Other places like Fairfield are in worse shape — the median family income is $ 38,000 and 22 % of the population lives below the poverty line ( including 28 % of those under age 18 ) .
My wife is an elementary music teacher in a community similar to Pinson .
It is n’t the best area .
Both of her schools ( yes , she has two ) are Title I schools and many students are on free or reduced lunches .
( Being a Title I schools means that at least 40 % of your students are low - income according to the US Census . )
I truly believe she is making a lasting impact in the lives of these students — even if that impact wo n’t be seen until the end of the year … or twenty years from now .
( I may be a bit biased .
We met in high school choir . )
Educators Need Our Support
It is no secret that primary education is suffering in many American communities .
Tax revenues are down across the nation as America plows through our first major recession in my lifetime .
Lower tax revenue means even education funding — already low — is down .
For example the city of Birmingham has closed many schools due to dropping enrollment and pushed these students into other districts and schools .
It ’s a sad situation and no one is quite sure how many more schools will be closed .
No one knows how many more students will need to be bussed to other areas .
The school my wife teaches in is at least fifty years old .
Her classroom is thankfully quite large , but lacks central heating and air .
She has window units to provide minimal cooling during the hot and humid times of the year .
The units are very old and loud — she is forced to decide between having class where the students can hear her , or having a cool , loud classroom .
When she first got the job I helped her clean and set up her new room .
Her new space .
Full of potential .
It was a bit dusty and dirty , but nothing that a little bit of cleaning could n’t take care of .
We discovered two large closets full of a random assortment of instruments .
These instruments ranged in age from a few years old to likely twenty years old .
Some of them were in okay condition while others , even while looking new , had not been cared for and were practically worthless .
The state thankfully provides some money each year to every teacher to outfit their rooms and buy new learning supplies .
This year it is around $ 400 .
That sounds like a ton of money , but you would be really surprised at how quickly it goes in my wife ’s classroom .
One new set of a specific instrument can be $ 200 to $ 1,000 !
When you are trying to rebuild the entire inventory of instruments … well , it will be several years before she has an adequate supply of instruments in good condition .
DonorsChoose.org Let ’s You Support Classrooms in Need
There is an amazing website that connects teachers in needy areas with donations for those classrooms : DonorsChoose.org
How it works , from the DonorsChoose website :
Here ’s how it works : public school teachers from every corner of America post classroom project requests on DonorsChoose.org .
Requests range from pencils for a poetry writing unit , to violins for a school recital , to microscope slides for a biology class .
Then , you can browse project requests and give any amount to the one that makes your eye twinkle .
Once a project reaches its funding goal , we deliver the materials to the school .
You ’ll get photos of your project taking place , a thank - you letter from the teacher , and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent .
If you give over $ 100 , you ’ll also receive hand - written thank - you letters from the students .
I think it is a genius idea .
It reminds me of Kiva , the microfinance website that coordinates the lending of money to potential business owners in third world countries .
Both sites connect a genuine need with donors .
It ’s a non-profit organization and they collect the funds directly , order the materials , and ship them directly to the school to prevent someone from scamming potential donors .
( The school Principal is alerted to expect a package , too , so you ca n’t get something and sell it off for profit . )
Support My Wife ’s Classroom : Help Buy Tubano Drums
Drums are a fascinating instrument to children .
My wife loves to use drum circle activities with her students .
A drum circle activity is often a musical “ conversation ” between a leader ( the teacher ) and a student or group of students .
For example my wife may ask a “ question ” on the the drum and her students will improvise an “ answer ” back to her .
Unfortunately her current drum set is limited to half of a set of small hand drums .
While these drums are certainly usable they have to be shared ( which leaves half of a class of anxious elementary students looking on ) .
Many lessons require a larger drum called the tubano that provides a much richer sound .
That having been said she has put up a request on DonorsChoose for two tubano drums .
The drums will cost $ 377 including shipping .
With a state budget of $ 400 she can’t afford to buy these drums or else she would n’t be able to do anything else the entire year !
These drums would enrich the experience of her students while also allowing more students to be involved in each activity .
I ’m blogging about this today because I love music , I love my wife , and her classroom is in definite need of help .
I ’m asking you to consider donating to a school , any school , on DonorsChoose today .
There are so many teachers doing hard , underpaid work in our country .
My wife is just one of them .
Of course if you supported her classroom we would be extraordinarily grateful .
I ’m also looking for other ideas on how to support our needy classrooms across the country .
Leave a comment and start the discussion !
UPDATE : Generous personal finance blogger Steve Rhode of GetOutofDebt.org just donated the final $ 225 for the project !
We are stunned !
It only took 4 donations to knock out the needed $ 377 .
My wife was n’t expecting to get these drums — if at all — until the spring .
She is so excited !
Thanks everyone — now go find a school local to you and help them out , too !
The NHS surgeons who saved 15 lives in record - breaking transplant op using just TWO donors
Surgeons are celebrating a European first with five lifesaving transplant operations from two donors in 24 hours .
In a stunning display of teamwork , NHS doctors and nurses gave hope to three seriously - ill children , including an eight - month - old baby , and two adults given less than two years to live .
Other organs were sent elsewhere in the UK to assist terminally ill patients .
Altogether 15 people received the gift of life as a result of the marathon effort at two Birmingham hospitals .
From left , surgeon Paolo Muiesan , Sandie Lee Smith , Sean O'Brien , Professor Christophe Chardot , surgeon Darius Mirza , Angelica Marsh with daughter Lubaya , and surgeon Khalid Sharif
The operations included transplants of multiple abdominal organs into two patients - the first time this has happened in a day in Europe .
Doctors also performed a ' domino ' transplant , in which a live patient donates an organ after receiving a donor replacement , which had never before been attempted with the type of liver used .
Details of the transplants - all carried out on NHS patients - emerged as politicians on both sides of the Atlantic were embroiled in a highlevel row over the Health Service .
Tory leader David Cameron was forced to defend his party after an extraordinary attack on the NHS by his own MEP Daniel Hannan , who went on prime - time U.S. television to dismiss it as a ' 60 - year failure ' that he ' would n't wish on anybody ' .
The medical teams in Birmingham were quietly confident that actions speak louder than words as they unveiled their remarkable results .
Transplant surgeon Darius Mirza , who led one of the teams involved both in retrieving organs from the two donors and the transplant surgery , said it was a team effort at Birmingham Children 's Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital , Birmingham , involving up to 55 doctors , nurses and support staff .
Not only did local patients benefit , but at least ten other organs were sent all over the UK to help NHS patients , he said .
' It is an NHS success story and perhaps we do n't give it the recognition it deserves because none of these patients would have survived two years without a transplant . '
Humbled : Mother - of - two Sandie Lee Smith ( left ) gave her diseased liver to terminally ill cancer sufferer Sean O'Brien ( right ) as she was given a new organ from a donor in a domino transplant
The marathon operation two months ago has transformed the lives of the two adults and three children who received organs .
In the stunning sequence of operations , the liver , bowels and pancreas from one donor were transplanted into a teenage boy .
The stomach , bowels and pancreas from a separate donor were given to another young boy .
Half of the liver from this same donor went to a tiny baby girl , while the other half was given to a 30 - year - old woman .
Uniquely , the liver is able to regenerate itself after transplant .
In a unique ' domino ' transplant , this woman 's own liver was then transplanted into the body of an adult man , who was not allowed to a healthy organ .
The youngest recipient was eight - month - old baby Lubaya Turpin , who received half of a liver from one of thev anonymous donors .
She was born with a rare liver condition and underwent an unsuccessful operation at nine weeks .
Her father Dwayne Turpin , 23 , and mother Angelica Marsh , 22 , from Birmingham , are delighted with the transformation .
Mr Turpin said : ' She 's been like a different baby .
We noticed improvements in just a couple of days .
Her eyes used to be yellow and now they have cleared up .
She has a lot more energy .
She 's been a very lucky baby . '
The other half of the liver went to Sandie Lee Smith , 30 , who had endured a miserable six years since being laid low with the rare genetic condition Acute Intermittent Porphyria ( AIP ) , which regularly left her in agony .
Sufferers do not produce enough enzymes to break down dangerous toxins in the body .
This can lead to damage to the liver and regular ' attacks ' involving abdominal pain and nausea .
Mrs Smith , from Cheltenham , Gloucestershire , said : ' The attacks meant I was going to hospital every month and then towards the end I was in hospital every week .
I was in acute pain . '
The treatment she has received for four years was not effective and Mrs Smith , who works for a packaging firm , was put on the transplant list as a ' last resort ' in December .
Six months later she received the other half of the donor liver - it will regenerate to full size over time - and is now looking forward to going on holiday and playing with her children Jamie , 11 , and Tamzin , eight .
Mrs Smith said : ' I 'm feeling loads better and have so much more energy than before .
I can do things with my children , like take them away for a week somewhere , that I could never do before the transplant . '
As a bonus her liver , which she thought would be good enough only for medical research , was given to Sean O'Brien , 43 , whose terminal condition made him ineligible for a completely healthy liver .
' I did n't think it would be possible to donate my liver to someone else , but I 've managed to give Sean a better quality of life which is great , ' she said .
' It was very strange meeting him because he has a part of me inside him . '
The unique feature of the domino operation is that it is the first time in the world that this type of liver - affected by porphyria - has been transplanted in such a way .
Naturally Mr O'Brien , who lives about 60 miles away in Taunton , Somerset , is forever grateful .
Although he spotted her on the hospital ward while they were recovering from surgery , they did not meet until this week .
Describing the emotional moment at Birmingham Children 's Hospital , he said : ' Sometimes words are n't enough .
I hugged her .
I feel incredibly grateful , incredibly happy and incredibly humble .
' Everything is better for me now , my life is as good as I ever remember it being .
Before I had the transplant I struggled to get out of bed or decide if I wanted tea or coffee .
Everything became more and more difficult . '
Mr O'Brien collapsed in the gym four years ago .
Tests identified a cancerous tumour the size of a grapefruit and 60 per cent of his liver was removed .
In November 2007 a regular scan picked up another growth more than 9 cm in diameter .
Surgeons said it was too big to operate and Mr O'Brien was given drug treatment with debilitating side effects to keep the tumour at bay .
He was told the shortage of donor organs meant a transplant was not an option for a patient like him , at high risk of failing to survive , and he was forced to live under a death sentence .
However , Mrs Smith 's damaged liver gave him the chance to benefit from a ' domino ' transplant .
Even though he risked developing AIP , his cancer would be cured .
' There was a high risk of rejection , but I had no alternative , ' he said .
' I would have died . '
He was prepared for surgery in the room next to Mrs Smith and followed her into the operating theatre to receive her liver .
' After the surgery my wife said she 'd never seen such a big smile from someone on a ventilator and I 've been smiling ever since , ' he said .
Because AIP mainly affects pre-menopausal women , doctors did not expect Mr O'Brien to suffer in the same way Mrs Smith did .
However , a few weeks ago he suffered a painful AIP attack .
He returned to hospital and drug treatment has prevented a repeat of the problem .
Mr O'Brien is married to Sam , 43 , and they have a daughter Megan , 11 .
The couple own a spa and healthcare business and he hopes to be able to return to work soon .
The same donor also gave stomach , bowels and pancreas to an 11 - year - old boy , who does not want to be named .
Mr Mirza said the transplants all took place over 24 hours in June , while other organs including four lungs , two hearts and four kidneys were sent to other patients on the waiting list .
He said the UK 's record on donating organs for use after death could be better .
' We need people to be aware of how we can transform the lives of others .
Only one in four of us is signed up to the NHS donor register .
There is a lack of education and the system could work better across the board - there are many factors involved . '
Altogether 327 people have donated organs and 931 patients have received transplants since April , while 8,046 are still waiting .
More than 1,000 people a year die on the waiting list .
At least 150 people are waiting for a new liver at any time but they are all patients for whom time is running out .
The liver performs 100 complex functions , fighting off infection , making essential chemicals and filtering out poisons .
But when it goes into acute failure or is seriously damaged by cirrhosis , viral infection or even a paracetamol overdose there are no ' liver machines ' to keep patients going .
The shortage of donor livers - like all organs - means surgeons have to make the most of what they have .
Uniquely , the liver consists of two lobes and can be split , with each lobe being transplanted into different recipients .
This is possible because the liver is the only organ that regenerates and will grow to almost full size over time , around eight years on average .
It is particularly useful in the case of child recipients , who can have a ' cut- down ' liver which will then grow with the child .
Last year 636 liver transplants were carried out , more than 100 of which were split liver transplants .
How 55 staff worked together as one
IN total around 55 medical staff and support workers were involved in the multiple transplant operation with some surgeons and doctors taking part in up to four operations .
Consultant transplant surgeon Mr Paolo Muiesan led a team of doctors , anaesthetists and nurses during a six - hour operation to secure the organs from the first donor .
These included the stomach , pancreas and intestine and two kidneys .
In addition a separate thoracic surgical team removed two lungs and a heart .
The liver was divided in half in the donor and then , like the other organs , individually packaged for transportation to the Children 's Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital .
Consultant transplant surgeon Mr Darius Mirza led the team performing the transplant for an 11 - year - old boy , using organs from the first donor .
The six - hour operation involved the transfer of a stomach , pancreas and intestine .
Consultant transplant surgeon Mr Khalid Sharif led the transplant team giving a left half of the new liver to eight - month - old Lubaya Turpin .
At the same time , at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital , consultant transplant surgeon Mr Simon Bramhall led the team giving the right half of the new liver to 30 - year - old Sandie Lee Smith .
He then led the team performing the ' domino ' procedure in which Sandie 's liver was transferred to Sean O'Brien at the same hospital .
Simultaneously , Mr Mirza also led the team who retrieved the organs from the second donor , and carried out the transplant operation on 14 - year - old Damien Simpson using those organs , the last of the five transplant operations on the day .
Each surgical team would consist of ten to 12 people .
At least four surgeons were needed for the retrieval operations , plus an anaesthetist , two technicians , two nurses , two coordinators and one theatre assistant .
The transplant teams consisted of at least one or two transplant surgeons , plus two assistant surgeons , an anaesthetist , two technicians , one nurse , one coordinator and one theatre assistant .
State lawmakers approve new spending California spending
California lawmakers on Thursday gave the green light to bills that will add millions in new spending to the state 's budget just weeks after slashing $ 16 billion in services for some of the neediest people in the state .
They also halted dozens of bills that would have added hundreds of million of dollars in state spending .
Among the bills passed by the state Senate and Assembly appropriations committees by Thursday 's deadline were :
-- $ 3 million to continue survivor benefits for California Highway Patrol officers , firefighters , peace officers and school classified employees who do not pay into Social Security and thus their survivors would not receive benefits if they died .
-- $ 300,000 for costs that would result from a bill that mandates spaying and neutering for most pets .
That money would go to animal shelters for an anticipated increase in surrendered pets from people who would rather not pay for the surgery .
-- $ 2.8 million in disaster relief funds to help victims of the 2008 and 2009 Santa Barbara fires .
Alicia Trost , spokeswoman for Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , acknowledged the state is in a tough financial position but said , " We 're not spending on frivolous things .
" Five million dollars is a pittance to spend when you consider that half of it is to pay firefighting costs already incurred by counties that suffered through wildfires , " said Trost , who predicted the other expenditures would save the state money in the long term .
Republicans on the committees did not support general fund spending - which is where the state 's deficit has been - and instead voted in favor of spending that would not be paid from the state 's general fund or contribute to any deficit .
The bills they approved are to be paid for from special funds .
" Here 's the problem as I see it :
We do n't have any money , " said Assemblywoman Connie Conway , R - Tulare , who is vice chair of the appropriations committee .
" I 've heard them say it 's less than some years and we have fewer bills , but we 've never been in a year like this before . "
The committees approved proposals that could come with significant price tags in future years , such as a bill that mandates an underground tunnel for a proposed Los Angeles freeway .
Taking the project underground as opposed to above ground will add hundreds of millions of dollars in costs , according to a legislative analysis , though construction is likely years away .
Assemblyman Kevin de Leon , D - Los Angeles , emphasized that the Assembly committee considering the new spending cut a list of about $ 600 million in proposed spending to $ 4 million .
" I want to highlight , underline , bold and italicize that , " said de Leon , chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee .
Assembly staffers said it was the smallest amount of general fund spending approved in decades and the voting that typically drags on for hours was finished in a mere 25 minutes .
The measures that got the nod Thursday now move to the floors of the Legislature for final consideration before going to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The governor 's office declined to comment on lawmakers ' actions .
Some measures halted by the committees would have saved the state money , such as a proposal by Sen.
Leland Yee , D - San Francisco , to limit the pay of executive officers in the California State University system and request the UC Regents do the same .
Many legislators significantly changed their original proposals to win approval , such as Assemblyman Jim Beall , D - San Jose , who altered a proposed employment program for people with developmental disabilities , wiping out the state 's price tag entirely - estimated to range from $ 12 million to $ 24 million in the next few years to $ 50,000 that would come from the federal government .

Advertisement Russia is to spend almost $ 500 m ( £ 300 m ) next year reinforcing its military bases in Georgia 's breakaway region of Abkhazia , the prime minister says .
Vladimir Putin 's announcement came as he visited the region for talks .
He said Russia was committed to defending and financing the small strip of land in Georgia 's north - west corner .
Georgia reacted angrily to the visit , calling it " yet another provocation " and an attempt to " escalate tensions in the Caucasus region " .
The UK also condemned Mr Putin 's announcement , saying it ran contrary to wider international efforts to support a negotiated solution in the region .
Moscow officially recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia following the war a year ago between Russia and Georgia .
The only other country recognising the regions ' independence is Nicaragua ; both areas are still widely considered to be part of Georgia .
' Military support '
The BBC's Richard Galpin , in the region 's main city , Sukhumi , says Mr Putin arrived to a hero 's welcome from relatives of those killed in the 1992 - 1993 war between Abkhaz separatists and the Georgian government .
ABOUT ABKHAZIA
Declared independence from Georgia in 1999 , but Tbilisi continues to regard it as a breakaway region Only Moscow and Nicaragua recognise Abkhazia 's declared independence from Georgia Population approximately 250,000 in 2003 Major languages : Russian , Georgian , Abkhaz
Q&A : Conflict in Georgia
Some called him a guardian angel and thanked him for last year 's intervention against Georgia , our correspondent reports .
Mr Putin laid a wreath at a memorial to those who died in the first war , then visited a hospital with Abkhazia 's separatist leader , Sergei Bagapsh .
Speaking ahead of the trip , Mr Putin said Russia would expand its bases in Abkhazia and build a " modern border - guard system " to guarantee the security of the two breakaway regions .
All this would cost about 15 - 16bn rubles ( $ 463 m ; £ 280 m ) , he said .
The build - up of Russia 's military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia is regarded by Georgia as a clear violation of its sovereignty .
But , at a joint news conference in Sukhumi with Mr Bagapsh , Mr Putin said Russia 's stance would not change .
" Russia is showing and will show economic , political and , if necessary , military support to Abkhazia , " he said .
Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov , also in Abkhazia , said Russia currently had a total of 3,636 military personnel in the region and " a bit less " in South Ossetia .
Russian troops have been in Georgia 's breakaway regions since the conflict The Abkhaz government wants Moscow to build a big navy base south of Sukhumi , which could ultimately provide an alternative home for the Russian Black Sea fleet currently based in Ukraine , a senior Abkhaz official told the BBC .
Georgia expressed its " strong protest " at Mr Putin 's visit , which it said demonstrated Russia 's defiance of " universally recognised norms and principles of international law " .
Last year 's five - day conflict erupted on 7 August as Georgia tried to retake control of South Ossetia .
Russia quickly repelled the assault and pushed its forces deeper inside Georgia , before pulling back .

Back in March we brought you pictures of the Columbus Zoo 's newborn elephant calf , Beco , as he took his wobbly first steps .
Now a toddler at 690 lbs , the zoo has shared some outstanding footage of Beco romping with his favorite toy , a very big , and very durable , blue rubber ball .
Enjoy the video !
Beco , named after his mother , Phoebe , and his father , Coco ) was born 27 March 2009 .
As of 12 August , he weighed 690 pounds and is averaging a weight gain of about three pounds a day .
At not quite five months old , he is precocious and curious about everything – from drain hole covers to sticks in the yard , he wants to explore everything .
Phoebe is a wonderful mom – she keeps a close eye on him while he explores and humors a lot of his rambunctious play .
Beco was given the Boomer ball about a week or two ago to introduce enrichment play into his routine ( and to give Phoebe a break from his high energy play ! ) .
The Zoo gives most of its animals different enrichment activities to stimulate play , natural behaviors , and break up the animals ’ routines .
Beco recently had his first swimming lesson from the keepers and Phoebe .
While the introduction to the pool went slowly , in the end , he went into the deep end of the pool and swam about using his little trunk as a snorkel , much to the delight of the visitors who got to see his first foray into the pool .
All in all , Beco is growing up fast and well , just as a baby elephant should .
Due to habitat loss / degradation and poaching , Asian elephants are considered Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species .
Not enough Bay Area kids vaccinated , docs say Childhood vaccinations
Two months - old Santana Brown , center , receives his first rotavirus vaccination at the Bayview Child Health Center on Thursday , July 30 , 2009 .
About 77 percent of San Francisco children are up to date on their immunizations , which leaves thousands of kids vulnerable to diseases such as whooping cough and measles that are uncommon in the United States , in many cases due to parents ' reluctance to immunize their children and some just do n't have access to a regular pediatrician who can keep kids up to date .

Too many children are under- vaccinated in the Bay Area , leaving them vulnerable to illnesses that were once thought nearly eradicated and making it easier for some diseases to get a foothold in communities and spread , public health experts say .
Vaccination rates have climbed over the past 10 years , aided by the creation of immunization registries that help doctors track children 's shots and public information campaigns to convince parents that vaccines are safe and necessary .
But vaccines are still a controversial topic for many parents , who fear potential side effects from immunization or do n't like the idea of giving their infants a dozen or more shots .
In some communities , families are widely taking advantage of laws that allow them to exempt their children from mandatory immunizations .
These laws allow parents to shield their children from inoculations for personal reasons .
In 2008 , Marin County had one of the highest exemption rates in the state - 6.3 percent , compared to 2 percent statewide - and at one San Francisco private school , the exemption rate is 54 percent .
" Our rates are definitely too low , " said Dr. Susan Fernyak , director of communicable disease control and prevention at the San Francisco Department of Public Health .
" We do n't have these diseases killing our children that we had a century ago , and people have really lost sight of that . "
Childhood immunizations are important , first , to protect the individual and , second , to develop " herd immunity " - vaccinating a large enough group that an infectious disease is unable to spread and eventually disappears , say public health experts .
Since the first vaccines became available , diseases like polio and smallpox have disappeared in the United States .
Pertussis , or whooping cough , still infects thousands of people every year and measles shows up in small outbreaks from time to time , but rates of both have fallen off dramatically .
Increased risk of disease
That 's in the United States , but many diseases are still active in other parts of the world .
Today 's air travel makes it easier for them to spread globally .
In February , three people in San Francisco came down with the measles - an adult who was infected while in Europe , and two children who had not been vaccinated .
" People do n't realize these diseases are still out there , " said Dr. Nadine Burke , medical director of the Bayview Child Health Center .
" Vaccines are the single most important way to protect children today .
I am not a person who likes to scare people , but you do n't want to see pertussis in a baby . "
Public health experts recommend that children be vaccinated for nine diseases by age 2 , and a 10th vaccine for chicken pox by age 5 .
All but chicken pox require multiple doses and at least one booster .
About 77 percent of the 2 - year - olds in San Francisco are up to date on their vaccines .
Statewide , about 76 percent of children are fully vaccinated by age 2 .
Both of those rates fall far short of federal mandates that the vaccination rate should be 90 percent by 2010 .
The rates improve for kindergarteners , who are required to be vaccinated unless parents ask for an exemption , which can be granted for medical reasons or unspecified personal reasons .
In the Bay Area , six of nine counties have rates above 90 percent .
Many young children are under - vaccinated for logistical or financial reasons - they come from low - income families with no health insurance , for example , or their parents have moved a lot and the children have n't had one doctor to keep track of their immunizations .
Public health experts are attempting to take care of those children through clinics that provide free immunizations .
The state has developed an immunization registry that keeps tabs on children who repeatedly change doctors .
Worried parents
But there 's a third set of children , those with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children .
Much of the reluctance is the result of long - held and widely publicized beliefs about a connection between vaccines and autism - ideas that have been repeatedly disproved by researchers .
Other parents worry that their baby 's immune system is n't strong enough for so many vaccines , or fear that some of the newer vaccines have n't yet been proved safe .
Doctors dispute these concerns , but many say they understand why parents are worried and will work with them to develop individualized vaccine schedules .
Doctors can allow parents to delay vaccines until children are older , for example , or opt out of specific vaccines they 're concerned about .
It 's not an ideal answer , said Dr. Gena Lewis , a pediatrician at Children 's Hospital Oakland .
But if it 's a choice between late vaccination and no vaccination at all , doctors prefer that children get at least some protection .
" We 're willing to work with people , " Lewis said .
" We 'd rather have them get a few at a time than not have any . "
Boy Born With Heart Outside Body Defies Odds Doctors feared Christopher Wall , now 33 , would not live beyond one day .
Aug. 4 , 2009  -- Christopher
Wall came into this world with all the right parts , except that one of them was in the wrong place .
His heart was beating outside his body .
This was more than a medical rarity .
It was a mystery .
In the summer of 1975 , Teresa Wall was enjoying her first and relatively uneventful pregnancy .
She recalled being in perfect health while carrying her baby , not even suffering from morning sickness .
Indeed , when it came time to give birth , Wall was only in labor for two hours .
She said there was an air of relaxation at the hospital .
" Everyone was all joking and laughing , " she said .
And the doctors and nurses teased her , asking , " This is your first baby ? "
But the joking suddenly stopped when doctors delivered Christopher Aug. 10 , 1975 .
" It was like a cloud of doom came over , " she recalled .
" Christopher was born and everything got really quiet , really quiet .
The nurses started hustling around . "
Watch Christopher 's story and more medical mysteries on " 20/20 " Friday at 10 p.m. ET
Doctors feared the newborn would not survive even one day .
Born with an extremely rare heart condition known as Ectopia cordis , Christopher 's heart was exposed outside of his chest .
His doctors said it is a condition so rare that out of every 1 million babies born , only about 5 to 8 of them will have Ectopia cordis .
Many babies with this condition die within their first 16 days , and some do not even survive the birth process .
Doctors are still unable to explain why some babies are afflicted and others are not .
" A number of these conditions are caused from genetic and inherited causes but we do n't know exactly why some children may carry a particular gene and others don't , " said Dr. Victoria Vetter , a pediatric cardiologist at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , who was on staff at the time of Christopher 's birth .
Wall was immediately warned that Christopher was born with a severe case of the condition and he may never survive .
Her newborn son was rushed to the hospital 's neonatal intensive care unit .
Without the enhanced medical procedures used today , Christopher 's condition came as a " complete surprise . "
" Women , unlike today , did not get ultrasounds or sonograms during the pregnancy , and ultrasound was just in the early stages of development , particularly as far as the heart was concerned , " Vetter said .
" So the doctors did not know Christopher had this condition until the moment he was born .
It was a complete surprise . "
Surgeries Attempt to Tilt Heart Into Anatomically Correct Position
A team of doctors immediately stabilized the baby , putting him on a ventilator and checking for other abnormalities .
" The heart was made perfectly normally , other than the wall between the two lower chambers had n't completely formed , " Vetter said .
" It just simply was outside the chest and pointing straight out . "
Since Christopher 's heart developed outside his chest cavity , there was no room inside his body for the tiny organ .
Combined with the strain that surgery would place on the heart 's blood vessels , this made it impossible to reinsert Christopher 's heart into his body .
Nevertheless , the baby surprised his doctors by surviving his first few days and , then , his first few weeks .
During his initial 18 months of life , Christopher endured 15 surgeries , all of which were attempts to place his heart into the anatomically correct position .
But each surgery posed a greater risk to the blood vessels , with the potential to dangerously restrict blood flow and cause the heart to stop beating .
Doctors had no choice but to cover the heart with skin and let the chest cavity grow .
Christopher 's small chest was also weak and unstable .
He breathed with the help of a respirator because his lungs could not successfully function on their own .
He was a medical rarity and , yet , despite all his complications , he was very much the apple of his mother 's eye .
" I thought he was adorable , " Teresa Wall said .
" The tubes were in his nose so his face was all taped up , you really could n't see him too much .
But I only saw him .
I blocked out the tubes and anything else that was going on . "
Christopher quickly became a hospital favorite .
Nurses said they strategically placed Christopher at the front of the beds so he could wave at visitors .
" He was Mr. Personality , " said Janet Boyce , a nurse in charge of his care .
" We always had him in an area , so he was the meeter and the greeter .
He was very social . "
Soaring Past Expectations , Christopher Leaves the Hospital
Throughout his three - year stay at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , his mother remained optimistic , shaking off the dark prognosis from doctors .
Instead ,
Wall held onto an unwavering belief about her son 's chances .
" I was never in doubt , " she said .
" Maybe it was a motherly instinct , but I just always knew Christopher would be OK . "
In 1978 , two days before his third birthday , Christopher was able to leave the hospital and go home for the first time .
" At that time he was still ... like an infant in a lot of ways . " his mother said .
" He was just so gentle , so it was really like bringing my baby home . "
Still , doctors remained uncertain about his survival .
At home , Christopher still required delicate round - the - clock medical care .
His parents learned a host of emergency procedures , including CPR , just in case Christopher 's respirator failed .
They were also instructed to pound on their baby 's back every four hours , 24 hours a day , just to keep his weak lungs clear .
To accommodate his weak lungs and protruding heart , doctors continued to try to build Christopher a breast bone in the next few years , but everything failed .
In total , it took 21 surgeries but doctors successfully created the chest support needed for Christopher to become free from his respirator .
At 6 years old , he underwent an operation that transplanted a portion of his hip bone into his chest to create a proper breast bone .
" It was sort of like finally ... finally , " Wall said .
" He just grew and progressed in leaps and bounds . "
Because Christopher 's delicate heart sat just beneath his skin , doctors fashioned a plastic breast plate out of the same material used for hockey masks , which he could wear under his clothes to protect his heart .
Christopher was able to live life like a normal kid , riding his first bike and playing sports such as karate and basketball .
Teresa
Wall made a point of letting her son take risks .

33 - Year - Old Christopher Refuses to Sit on Sidelines
" I just brought Christopher up saying that there are so many things out there to do , we do n't have time to be sick , we do n't have time to worry , " she said .
" I guess that was my encouragement , that do n't be afraid , there are a lot of fun things out there to do . "
As a result of Christopher 's many surgeries , he suffered from hearing loss , and is learning - disabled .
In 1995 , he graduated from high school .
Because of his hearing impairment , his speech is often slurred , or can be difficult to understand .
" Right now I play sports with my family , I used to take karate when I was younger , " he said .
" I like a good fight . "
On the streets in his hometown of Philadelphia , friends said , he greets everyone like they 're family , for which he 's earned a special nickname : Mayor of South Street .
" He was introduced as the Mayor of South Street because that 's what everyone called him , " friend Ashley Andrien said .
" I thought he , like , owned South Street or something . "
On the basketball court , Christopher , who'll turn 34 Monday , does n't sit on the sidelines , making three - pointers and rising to the challenge of competition .
" He 's gotta be one of the toughest people I know , " friend Jaime Carr said .
" Everything he 's been through and he hangs out with us and plays sports and hang out and party it up like a normal person .
It 's shocking . "
Although Christopher recently lost his job of 12 years at a pipe / tube construction company because of layoffs , he said he wants to give back , volunteering at the same children 's hospital that helped him survive .
" I just wanna be a good person , " he said .
" I just wanna work and help out with my family . "

Milan are keen to take David Beckham back on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy in January , his spokesman said today while the England midfielder was on international duty .
" Milan have publicly expressed an interest in taking David on a loan move similar to this year but there is no further news to add at this stage , " he said .
Beckham won back his England place during a loan stint at the Serie A club in the second half of last season .
The England manager , Fabio Capello , has said he must return to Europe to have any hope of playing at the 2010 World Cup .
Philip Pullman and Quentin Blake abandon school visits over plans for paedophile checks
Leading children 's authors announced a boycott of school visits yesterday in protest at ' sinister '
Government checks to ensure that they are not paedophiles .
Philip Pullman , writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy , and three former Children 's Laureates claim the Vetting and Barring Scheme database will encourage youngsters to view everyone as potential rapists or murderers .
The 11 million adults working with children will be charged £ 64 to sign up to the register starting in October .
Author Philip Pullman , left , and Children 's Laureate Quentin Blake have threatened to stop visiting schools in protest over the vetting scheme
Unions warned the fee could stop some applying for low - paid public service jobs such as teaching assistants , nursery nurses and care workers .
Even MPs will have to submit themselves to the criminal record checks before they can visit schools .
The scheme is administered by the Independent Safeguarding Authority , set up after the murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells by school caretaker Ian Huntley in 2002 .
Mr Pullman told the Radio 4 Today programme : ' Why should I have to pay £ 64 to a government agency to give me a little certificate to say that I am not a paedophile ?
' It 's actually rather dispiriting and sinister .
It 's the assumption that anyone who comes into contact with children for any reason whatsoever is up to no good and likely to be a rapist or a murderer and has to be checked out in advance to show that they 're not .
' It will encourage children to believe that no adult will ever approach them other than to prey on them or do them harm . '
He was supported by former Children 's Laureates Quentin Blake , Michael Morpurgo and Anne Fine .
Anthony Horowitz , author of the Alex Rider spy series , also said the £ 64 registration fee had ' a nasty feeling of stealth tax about it ' .
Pullman 's His Dark Materials and Blake 's illustrations for Roald Dahl 's novels including The BFG have made them household names
Public service union Unison said it agreed with the principle of the database but warned the fee will have a disproportionate impact on low - paid workers .
It pointed out that £ 64 was almost two days ' work for an employer on the minimum wage of £ 5.73 .
Volunteers who work with children will also be required to sign up to the register , although the £ 64 fee will be waived .
Julian Brazier , Tory MP for Canterbury , warned the vetting system had got ' out of control . '
' It is absurd that they are vetting the same people again and again in different roles .
We do need vetting , but it needs to be sensible , ' he said .
Anyone working in a position that involves contact with children will have to be vetted under the scheme .
If passed , their name will remain on a register allowing them to work with juveniles .
Those who fail will go on a separate register .
It extends the current Criminal Records Bureau checks that apply to school staff , but not to visitors who have only a small amount of contact with pupils
Last month Richard Thomas , who is stepping down as Britain 's first Information Commissioner , said he had serious concerns about the system .
He warned that as well as criminal convictions it would contain ' allegations , some rumour , some speculation ' .
Terry Deary , the writer of the popular Horrible Histories children 's books , accused the authors leading the boycott of being ' pompous ' .
' They should stick to the law like everybody else , ' he said .
A Home Office spokesman said : ' The UK already has one of the most advanced systems in the world for carrying out checks on all those who work in positions of trust with children and vulnerable adults .
' From October this year the new Vetting and Barring Scheme will ensure these regulations are even more rigorous . '
Media multitaskers pay mental price , Stanford study shows
Think you can talk on the phone , send an instant message and read your e-mail all at once ?
Stanford researchers say even trying may impair your cognitive control .
Attention , multitaskers ( if you can pay attention , that is ) : Your brain may be in trouble .
People who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information do not pay attention , control their memory or switch from one job to another as well as those who prefer to complete one task at a time , a group of Stanford researchers has found .
High - tech jugglers are everywhere – keeping up several e-mail and instant message conversations at once , text messaging while watching television and jumping from one website to another while plowing through homework assignments .
But after putting about 100 students through a series of three tests , the researchers realized those heavy media multitaskers are paying a big mental price .
" They 're suckers for irrelevancy , " said communication Professor Clifford Nass , one of the researchers whose findings are published in the Aug. 24 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Everything distracts them . "
Social scientists have long assumed that it 's impossible to process more than one string of information at a time .
The brain just can't do it .
But many researchers have guessed that people who appear to multitask must have superb control over what they think about and what they pay attention to .
Is there a gift ?
So Nass and his colleagues , Eyal Ophir and Anthony Wagner , set out to learn what gives multitaskers their edge .
What is their gift ?
" We kept looking for what they 're better at , and we did n't find it , " said Ophir , the study 's lead author and a researcher in Stanford 's Communication Between Humans and Interactive Media Lab .
In each of their tests , the researchers split their subjects into two groups : those who regularly do a lot of media multitasking and those who do n't .
In one experiment , the groups were shown sets of two red rectangles alone or surrounded by two , four or six blue rectangles .
Each configuration was flashed twice , and the participants had to determine whether the two red rectangles in the second frame were in a different position than in the first frame .
They were told to ignore the blue rectangles , and the low multitaskers had no problem doing that .
But the high multitaskers were constantly distracted by the irrelevant blue images .
Their performance was horrible .
Because the high multitaskers showed they could n't ignore things , the researchers figured they were better at storing and organizing information .
Maybe they had better memories .
The second test proved that theory wrong .
After being shown sequences of alphabetical letters , the high multitaskers did a lousy job at remembering when a letter was making a repeat appearance .
" The low multitaskers did great , " Ophir said .
" The high multitaskers were doing worse and worse the further they went along because they kept seeing more letters and had difficulty keeping them sorted in their brains . "
Still puzzled
Puzzled but not yet stumped on why the heavy multitaskers were n't performing well , the researchers conducted a third test .
If the heavy multitaskers could n't filter out irrelevant information or organize their memories , perhaps they excelled at switching from one thing to another faster and better than anyone else .
Wrong again , the study found .
The test subjects were shown images of letters and numbers at the same time and instructed what to focus on .
When they were told to pay attention to numbers , they had to determine if the digits were even or odd .
When told to concentrate on letters , they had to say whether they were vowels or consonants .
Again , the heavy multitaskers underperformed the light multitaskers .
" They could n't help thinking about the task they were n't doing , " Ophir said .
" The high multitaskers are always drawing from all the information in front of them .
They can't keep things separate in their minds . "
The researchers are still studying whether chronic media multitaskers are born with an inability to concentrate or are damaging their cognitive control by willingly taking in so much at once .
But they 're convinced the minds of multitaskers are not working as well as they could .
" When they 're in situations where there are multiple sources of information coming from the external world or emerging out of memory , they 're not able to filter out what 's not relevant to their current goal , " said Wagner , an associate professor of psychology .
" That failure to filter means they 're slowed down by that irrelevant information . "
So maybe it 's time to stop e-mailing if you 're following the game on TV , and rethink singing along with the radio if you 're reading the latest news online .
By doing less , you might accomplish more .

Newport County push Newcastle United all the way and only shootout agony ends their Carabao resistance
WANT a real dog bites man story ?
A 27 - year - old Bronx college graduate is not suing her alma mater because it failed to get her a job .
But for four days , various media outlets and blogs have been peddling the claim that she is .
It 's certainly a juicy - sounding welfare - moms - with - Cadillacs - type anecdote .
A quick internet search seems to show that the first paper to report it ( on August 2nd ) was the New York Post , ever a bastion of dispassionate reporting on urban issues ( see " Wrong - Way Crash Mom Drunk , Stoned " ) , and one with no particular ideological axes to grind ( " Send Doctor Bill To The Rich " ) .
But other outlets , like CNN , spun the story the same way ( " Alumna sues college because she has n't found a job " ) , even though their own reporting showed it was wrong .
Fortunately , CNN did go the extra mile and link to a scan of the court filing .
And that enabled a reader of Andrew Sullivan 's blog to see the distortion .
The graduate is not suing Monroe College for failing to find her a job .
She is suing because she alleges that the school 's Office of Career Advancement did not try to find her a job , and that this abrogates the promises the school made when she paid them $ 70,000 in tuition .
In the filing , she says the school 's job counselors " are not making sure their e-recruiting clients call the graduates that recently finished college for a [ sic ] interview . "
Monroe 's website says every student gets " a Career Advisor , who provides one - on - one assistance with career decision - making , resume and letter writing , and job search strategies . "
Based on what the graduate told CNN , she seems to think that the school promised her its job counselors would do more for her than they did .
That allegation may be without merit .
Or it may not .
Maybe the plaintiff is a confused young woman with an outsized sense of entitlement who blames her problems on others .
Or maybe the college is deceptively advertising to low - income youth with poor secondary educations that it will help them get good jobs , encouraging them to take out tens of thousands of dollars in student loans , when in fact its graduates rarely get good jobs , and its career counselors barely lift a finger to help them .
Who knows ?
Not the New York Post or CNN .
A court will decide whether the case deserves to be heard and , if so , whether in fact the school did promise to do more for its graduates than it did , and whether the graduate is entitled to redress .
Certainly , suing colleges is not a very effective way to address lower - class unemployment .
But there 's a real question as to whether going to college — or going to the kinds of colleges most lower - class people can afford , and plunging into debt to do so — is an effective way to address lower - class unemployment , either .
For decades , America 's working class has been told that the way to cope with the labour market dislocation caused by globalisation — that is , with the fact that Chinese workers have taken all the factory jobs — is to get an education .
For most poor people in New York , that does n't mean Columbia , or for that matter the State University of New York .
It means Monroe College , Apex Technical School , Kaplan University , and the other places one sees advertising on the subway for degrees as a medical secretary , HVAC technician , and so on .
Many of these are good technical schools with high job - placement rates .
But vocational and technical schools in America tend to set students back $ 60,000 or more for a bachelor 's degree , and there are no guarantees .
This is n't the only possible way to do things ; in Germany 's extensive vocational education system , employers are obliged by law to set aside a certain ratio of apprenticeships , so students will have someplace to go after they graduate .
Obviously , the American economy is not set up that way .
We have an entrepreneurial , no - guarantees , take - what - you - can - get economic culture , and it is hardly surprising that people want to get their money 's worth .
Most people do n't go to Monroe College to broaden their liberal - arts perspective .
They go there to get a better - paying job .
Maybe the school is doing all it can to make sure its graduates get those jobs , but if an alumna thinks the school is blowing her off , she is within her rights to take that complaint to court .
The angry reaction to her case seems like an explosion of subconscious anxiety over two decades of working - class wage stagnation followed by a sudden wave of rising unemployment .
For many , the strategy of educating America 's way out of the global labour surplus is n't working .
It sure did n't work for Trina Thompson .
She is deep in debt , living with her mom , and still looking at a job at Burger King .
Much of America 's working class is in exactly the same fix .
A change in strategy may be in order — suggestions welcome .
Britain is to join
France lobbying governments around the world for an international ban on the sale of the bluefin tuna , which is on the brink of extinction after years of over - fishing .
The fisheries minister Huw Irranca - Davies told The Independent the UK would back and seek support in Washington and other international capitals for a proposal to ban the fish at Cites ( the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species ) .
France , which has a bigger bluefin fishing fleet than anyone else , also announced yesterday it would back a Cites ban , bringing a a real prospect that the fish – which will be wiped out in the Mediterranean by 2012 , according to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature ( WWF ) – may be saved .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Speaking of the need to protect global fish stocks , French President Nicolas Sarkozy said : " Ours is the last generation with the ability to take action before it 's too late . "
Wildlife groups were elated at support for the ban , which would bypass management by the fisheries body in charge of the bluefin tuna , Iccat ( International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ) , which has been roundly derided for its failure to protect the fish .
However it is almost certain to put the UK on a collision course with Japan , where bluefin is highly - prized as sushi and sashimi .
A single fish can fetch $ 100,000 [ £ 60,800 ] in Tokyo , making it the most expensive food on earth .
Motivated by the bounty , organised crime in Italy is believed to be involved in the Mediterranean fishery , which is believed to land 60,000 tons of bluefin a year , almost treble the legal catch and four times the amount recommended by scientists .
Concern has grown this summer following the screening of the docu- film The End of the Line , which presented the bluefin as the starkest example of 21st Century over - fishing .
Nobu , the Japanese restaurant chain , attracted criticism for continuing to serve the fish at its eateries in London , despite acknowledging on its menu that it was a " vulnerable " and advising diners to choose an alternative .
Monaco , the tiny Mediterranean principality , has been privately canvassing support for a Cites ban during recent weeks .
Speaking to The Independent , Mr Irranca - Davies said : " We 've been in some discussions with Monaco to see how that proposal is progressing .
Our biodversity unit has been talking with their counterparts in Monaco and other Cites member states – the US and Canada – to see whether there 's any appetite for proposing this action and what form it might take .
" Now we 've had sight of the proposals in the last day or so , I can confirm that the UK will support a Cites listing of bluefin tuna .
We do think this is not a substitute for Iccat and the work it does , but we are pleased to give that proposal for Cites listing our strong support .
We hope that others will come on board as well . "
Providing it attracts sufficient support , Monaco will table its resolution by 17 October for Cites 's meeting in Doha , in Qatar , in March .
A ban – requiring a two - thirds majority – would take effect 90 days later , ending the annual summer bluefin hunt .
Asked whether he was braced for a fight with Japan , Mr Irranca - Davies said : " I do n't think we need to get into a fight over this .
There will be people for whom this bluefin tuna is important either as a consumer nation or as a fishing nation , but what we cannot get away from is the stark evidence that is staring us in the face . "
Willie MacKenzie , Greenpeace oceans campaigner , said : " It 's fantastic the UK is taking such a strong stance on bluefin by backing the listing on Cites , and it's one that an increasingly - aware British public will welcome .
Not only does this show the UK 's understanding of the severity of the problem , but it must compel other countries , notably the US , to follow suit .
Bluefin tuna are the blue whales of our time , and have been relentlessly over - exploited for far too long . "
" This iconic species has long disappeared from UK waters and we need to ensure the same does not happen in the Mediterranean , " said Sally Bailey , marine programme manager at WWF , who praised the UK's " great step forward . "
Charles Clover , author of the book The End of the Line , while also welcoming the action , said there was evidence that bluefin tuna of breeding age had already been fished out .
" France is one of the nations principally responsible for wiping it out , " he said .
" There are no mature spawners on the Japanese market .
A third of the fish that are being sold are under the legal size . "
" What 's coming together now is that everybody knows there 's no fish left in the sea .
They probably caught them all in 2007 , while we were filming it .
This is Europe 's great fisheries disaster . "
The County Court jury had been asked to decide the crucial issue of deliberate penetration against the suggestion of possible " accidental rape " .
During the trial , the jury was directed to approach their task free of sympathy , emotion or bias and to put views of strippers and bucks ' nights " out of your mind " .
Prosecutor Kieran Gilligan had told the jury they had to be satisfied there was penetration , if even slight , that it was deliberate , without consent , and that Ms Naggs knew the man was not consenting .
But Ms Naggs 's barrister , Paul Higham , asked the jury to have " in the back of your mind " issues of male sexuality and pride , fear , ego and peer group pressure .
He said that , if there was penetration , it was accidental and he asked what led the man to " place himself in proximity to the dildo " , which he described as " arguably statuesque " .
Mr Gilligan told the jury that the man had replaced the groom and another volunteer who were reluctant to continue their involvement with Ms Naggs .
He said that , after she did a lap dance , rubbed her breasts in his face and used the dildo on herself , he asked her : " Be gentle .
Do n't do it too hard . "
" No worries , " Mr Gilligan said Ms Naggs replied .
When the man , who was on all fours and naked from the knees up , asked her not to go near his anus , she allegedly said : " Not a problem .
Relax .
It 's only fun .
I wo n't go there . "
But Mr Gilligan said that , soon after Ms Naggs applied cream or lubricant to his buttocks , he felt a sharp pain , a thrust and the dildo " go right into his anal passage " .
He said the man was hurt and shocked and after Ms Naggs allegedly told him not to worry because " only you and I know " , he said : " What the f --- did you do that for , you stupid bitch . "
Mr Gilligan said the man complained to police later that day while a medical examination showed a small abrasion below his anal verge " most likely caused by blunt trauma " .
Mr Higham submitted that , if there was penetration , it was accidental so " this is a case , if you like , of accidental rape " .
The court heard that the man was on all fours , with his pants around his ankles , when Naggs poured cream on his back and on the pink , strap - on dildo and made thrusting motions .
The man , who said he had been an unwilling participant in Ms Naggs 's show , had told the court he scuffled with Ms Naggs and told her to leave after the incident .
" She said it was just a joke , just a joke , " he said .
Witnesses told the court that as Ms Naggs was leaving the house she repeatedly said " sorry " , and one said Ms Naggs claimed " it was an accident " .
They told of seeing the best man looking like he was in pain and " squinting " during the stripper 's act .
The next day , the best man said he " did n't feel very well , I did n't feel right " .
He was " very , very uncomfortable " and told friends about the incident .
The man said he organised the night 's entertainment , hiring two strippers from the Simply Irresistible agency .
Under questioning from Mr Higham , he agreed that the agency representative he spoke to told him that he was booking a show entitled " Anal " .
The man said he was no longer friends with the groom after he made comments about the stripper incident at the wedding .
Outside court , Ms Naggs 's lawyer James Dowsley said his client wished to thank the jury for the attention they gave to the case and their verdict .

It was a poor Test match wicket , but I 'm not blaming it for us losing - both sides had to bat on it .
It 's probably not my favourite ground in the world , but our guys will learn a lot from playing in this series .
I 've enjoyed the whole tour , but it makes me determined to win the Ashes back .
We let it slip at Cardiff , we were n't good enough to get over the line but the series has see - sawed from one side to the other .

Monty MBE anyone ?
Swann tries to tease Hussey into an error , he stands firm but can't work the last ball for a single so last man Hilfenhaus will be exposed again .

Five more wickets are needed - the scheduled close of play is 1800 BST , but can continue until 1830 if the remaining overs ( 32 ) have not been bowled .
And , if either captain ( most likely Andrew Strauss ) believes a result can be achieved tonight ( we reckon this would be if seven or more wickets have fallen ) , they can claim an extra half - hour of play .

From adrian007 on 606 : " This is now really the end of Australia .
In the grander scheme of things , we all still have to feel sad that the great team that Australia once was is about to be only fourth in the world .
And worst of all , Ponting is about to be the first Aussie captain to lead Australia to the lowest world ranking they have ever achieved " From Ross Brawn ( Team Principal , Brawn GP ) , TMS inbox : " Our team just managed " Our team just managed a win at Valencia and I was desperate to see the score after the race .
What a weekend - Rubens ' first race win for five years and now the Ashes .
Go for it boys ! "
Thanks ,
Ross , glad you 're enjoying the cricket .

Draco Malfoy to bowl from the Vauxhall End ... sorry , it 's Stuart Broad again , and Ricky Ponting lifts him over the helmeted Ian Bell at Reasonably Short Extra Cover for four .

The last ball hits a pothole in the pitch and just misses Ponting 's bat ... still a tricky deck to bat on , but the Aussie pair are looking in good nick .

A 1031 tax exchange can be used to defer taxes on your real estate investment property , provided that your properties qualifies for a 1031 exchange .
It 's also important to understand the process in detail , of how a 1031 tax exchange works .
Here is a step by step guide to the process :
Step 1 .
Hire and retain a tax counsel or certified public accountant .
Step 2 .
Sell the real estate property , and execute the Cooperation Clause in the sales agreement : " Buyer is aware that the seller 's intention is to complete a 1031 Exchange through this transaction and hereby agrees to cooperate with seller to accomplish same , at no additional cost or liability to buyer . "
Your escrow officer must contact the Qualified Intermediary at this point to order and secure the exchange documents .
Step 3 .
At his point you enter into the 1031 tax exchange agreement with your Qualified Intermediary .
In this setup , the Qualified Intermediary is named as principal in the sale of your sold property and the subsequent purchase of your replacement ( new ) property .
The 1031 Exchange Agreement must meet with IRS Requirements , especially pertaining to the proceeds .
Along with said agreement , an amendment to escrow is signed which so names the Qualified Intermediary as seller .
Normally the deed is still prepared for recording from the taxpayer to the true buyer .
This is called direct deeding .
It is not necessary to have the replacement property identified at this time .
Step 4 .
After this point , the relinquished escrow closes , and the closing statement reflects that the Qualified Intermediary was the seller , and the proceeds go to your Qualified Intermediary ( QI ) .
The funds now should be secured in a separate market account to ensure safety and that the funds are liquid and available .
It is important to keep these funds separate so they are available .
The closing date of the relinquished property escrow is considered to be Day 0 of the exchange , and that ’s when the exchange clock begins to tick .
Written identification of the address of the replacement property should be sent within forty five days and the identified replacement property must be acquired by the taxpayer within 6 months ( 180 days to be exact ) .
Step 5 . Written identification of the address or legal description of the replacement property at this point should be sent by the taxpayer to the Qualified Intermediary , on or before Day 45 of the exchange .
It should be signed by everyone who signed the exchange agreement , and it may be faxed or hand delivered or even physically mailed either to the Qualified Intermediary , the seller of the replacement property or his agent , or to a totally unrelated attorney .
Send it via certified mail , return receipt requested .
You will then have proof of receipt from a government agency .
Step 6 .
At this point , you enter into an agreement to actually purchase replacement property , which includes the followingCooperation Clause : " Seller is aware that the buyer 's intention is to complete a 1031 Exchange through this transaction and hereby agrees to co-operate with the buyer to accomplish same , at no additional cost or liability to seller . "
An amendment is signed naming the Qualified Intermediary as buyer , but again the deeding is from the true seller to the taxpayer .
Step 7 .
After all of these conditions have been satisfied and the escrow is prepared and ready to close and prior to the 180th day , per the 1031 Exchange Agreement , the Qualified Intermediary then forwards the exchange funds and growth proceeds to escrow , and the closing statement reflects the Qualified Intermediary as the buyer .
A final accounting is sent by the Qualified Intermediary to the taxpayer , showing the funds coming in from one escrow , and going out to the other , all without constructive receipt by the taxpayer .
Step 8 .
After the close , you file form 8824 with the Internal Revenue Service when taxes are filed , and whatever similar document your particular state requires .
That is the complete process in detail from start to finish of a 1031 tax exchange transaction .

Two ex-Blackwater employees ( or individuals claiming to be ) say the company and its enigmatic founder , Erik Prince , murdered — or arranged for the murders — of people cooperating with federal authorities investigating the controversial security firm .
Blackwater , which renamed itself
Xe earlier this year , says it “ questions the judgement of anyone who relies upon ” the anonymous declarations filed Monday in connection with a series of civil suits brought on behalf of Iraqi civilians .
It calls the accusations — which also include charges of weapons smuggling , money laundering , and a “ wife - swapping and sex ring ” run out of the company ’s Moyock , North Carolina headquarters — ” unsubstantiated , ” “ offensive , ” and slanderous .
Earlier today , Blackwater / Xe spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke emailed me the company ’s statement on the allegations .
I ’ve updated my post from yesterday with the company ’s comments .
Given the nature of the charges , I ’m reprinting them again here ( typos and all ) .
The proper place for this case to be litigated is in the Court , and we will respond fully in our reply brief ( which will be filed on August 17 ) to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs .
Because the plaintiffs have chosen inappropriately to argue their case in the media , however , we will also say this : –
The brief filed by Plaintiff includes two anonymous affidavits state that their “ information ” has been provided to the Justice Department — we can gauge the credence given to those statements — which hold no water .
When the indictments were announced , the United States Attorney the United States Attorney made a point of stating that “ [t ] he indictment does not charge or implicate Blackwater Worldwide ” ; “ [ i]t charges only the actions of certain employees for their roles in the September 16 shooting . ”
He emphasized that the indictment was “ very narrow in its allegations ” : “ Six individual Blackwater guards have been charged with unjustified shootings . . . not the entire Blackwater organization in Baghdad .
There were 19 Blackwater guards on the . . . team that day . . . .
Most acted professionally , responsibly and honorably .
Indeed , this indictment should not be read as accusation against any of those brave men and women who risk their lives as Blackwater security contractors . ”

Burden of Billions | Cal global health experts break the silence on population growth .
| by Noelle Robbins On July 11 — World Population Day — the United Nations will mark the date that , 22 years ago , the earth ’s population first exceeded 5 billion .
Today , the number has increased to 6.8 billion , with no signs that growth will ever slow .
Yet for the past 40 years , an uncomfortable silence seems to have replaced a once - lively discussion of population growth and its relationship to the long - term future of humankind .
Now , though , the tide may be turning — with prominent U.C. Berkeley policy leaders Malcolm Potts and Martha Campbell , who have a lifetime of global health work ( not to mention a marriage certificate ) between them , at the forefront of a resurgent international effort to place slowing population growth back on the mainstream agenda .
“ We are very hopeful and optimistic people — we want to change the world , ” says Potts , an energetic and eloquent speaker described by Campbell as “ 74 going on 47 . ”
Since 1992 , Potts , the former medical director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation , has headed the Bixby Center for Population , Health , and Sustainability , a research institute at the U.C. Berkeley School of Public Health .
Campbell , the former director of the population program at the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and a lecturer at the U.C. Berkeley School of Public Health , founded and serves as president of an eight - year - old Berkeley - based nonprofit , Venture Strategies for Health and Development .
Working closely with the Bixby Center , Venture Strategies funds and implements family planning and health programs around the world .
So it was good news for the couple when , last January , Cal ’s School of Public Health received a $ 15 million gift from the Fred H. Bixby Foundation , allowing a significant expansion of the existing Bixby program .
( The schools of public health at UCLA and UCSF are also affiliated with Bixby programs , but the U.C. Berkeley center most consistently targets population growth as a crucial element in global public health . )
Guests at a reception celebrating the endowment included United Nations population experts , representatives from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , and public health policy advocates from Africa and China .
Over the next several days , the prestigious invitees would participate in a cutting - edge international forum on “ The World in 2050 , ” co-sponsored by the three Bixby programs .
In a voice filled with conviction , the British - born Potts described the mission of the Bixby Center to explore and draw attention to links between global population growth and the environment , economic stability , public health , education , and violent conflicts .
To many around the world , the topic of population growth remains contentious , but among those who heard Potts speak that winter night , the excitement was palpable .
For some , it may have been reminiscent of an era when population growth was topic one on college campuses like U.C. Berkeley , and among circles of concerned citizens .
In 1968 , Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich ’s The Population Bomb sparked fierce controversy , predicting that uncontrolled population growth would result in worldwide famine and starvation in the 1970s and ’ 80s .
In short order , “ Zero Population Growth ” became a rallying cry .
However , thanks to advances in food production most notably attributed to the “ Green Revolution ” ( a term coined by former United States Agency for International Development director William Gaud to describe agricultural advances that increased crop yields ) , Ehrlich ’s apocalyptic vision did not become a reality , at least not within the time frame he described .
And over the years , voices once raised on the question of population growth and its link to global well - being grew quiet .
— — — — — — — — — ——————
Campbell , 68 , has dedicated much of her research and writing over the years to exploring “ the perfect storm ” of circumstances contributing to the silence .
One , she says , families in developed countries are , in fact , having fewer children , so the effects of population growth are not as readily visible in places like the United States .
Two , research about increasingly scarce resources tends to focus on how much we consume , but often overlooks the issue of population growth .
Three , governments and international health agencies have prioritized the HIV / AIDS epidemic as a primary concern .
Four , conservative religious and political groups have been influential in reducing funding for international family planning .
And five , people mistakenly associate efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies with coercive family planning approaches , such as China ’s one - child policy .
Of these factors , the latter concerns Potts and Campbell the most .
“ Women want smaller families , ” Potts maintains .
“ If they are given the choice they will have fewer children .
They will benefit , their countries will benefit .
And in the end , this planet will benefit . ”
“ You do n’t need to tell anyone to have fewer children , you just need to make it easier for them , ” Campbell adds .
Even in the United States , where women have more control over family size than in many other parts of the world , there is room for improvement .
Citing barriers to family planning services such as high cost and lack of health insurance , Kate Bedford , the Bixby Center ’s communication manager , points out that 50 percent of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended .
That is a significant number , considering that , worldwide , only 40 percent of pregnancies are unplanned .
In developed countries other than the United States , the number is considerably lower .
— — — — — — — — — ——————
Potts ’s decades of experience in the global family planning field provide numerous examples of a non-coercive approach .
“ I used to work in Iran under the old Shah , and they had a top - down family planning system ” — in other words , a government - directed system — ” which had no effect on population growth , ” he says .
But “ under new leadership , family planning became a voluntary bottom - up effort , and religious leaders and people at the village level bought into it . ”
The result , according to Potts , was a dramatically declining birth rate that rivaled China ’s .
Access to voluntary family planning does n’t just improve lives , he asserts — it saves them .
“ One woman dies every minute either from childbirth or abortion around the world , ” he says , “ and 90 percent of those deaths are in the least developed countries . ”
Currently , the Bixby Center and Venture Strategies are collaborating to provide women in those countries with options for choosing family size — and improving their health .
One major effort is to decrease the incidence of massive hemorrhage , one of the leading causes of deaths related to childbirth .
The Bixby Center ’s role is to research causes of maternal deaths and medical solutions ; Venture Strategies follows up by working with pharmaceutical manufacturers , governments , and health experts throughout the world to make low - cost , high - quality , off - patent ( or generic ) medicines available to communities in need .
Interestingly , such health interventions do n’t necessarily involve medical personnel .
“ One of the primary focuses at both the Bixby Center and Venture Strategies is shifting family planning and maternal health tasks normally associated with doctors and nurses , to people in villages in developing countries around the world , ” says Potts .
Citing the example of a powerful new anti-hemorrhagic drug , Potts says , “ we can teach women to dose themselves and teach traditional birth attendants how to administer the drug to their patients . ”
Campbell and Potts have reason for optimism these days .
Shortly after his inauguration , President Obama lifted the Global Gag Rule , imposed by President Bush in 2001 , which restricted U.S. family planning funding for international nongovernmental agencies .
This move opens the door to increased financial support for voluntary family planning services and education worldwide .
Closer to home , both are heartened by the reaction of students who volunteered their time to the “ World in 2050 ” forum .
With backing from the Center , as well as the Sierra Club and Americans for Informed Democracy , the students founded Bixby Youth In Action to address the impact of rapid population growth .
They plan to lobby Congress , work to improve access to family planning services worldwide , and offer classes on the U.C. Berkeley campus on the topic .
In April , the youth group co-sponsored , with the Sierra Club , “ Sex and Sustainability , ” an art exhibit that examined the connection between population , poverty , and women ’s lives via artwork by U.C. Berkeley students .
A possible national tour is pending .
— — — — — — — — — ——————
To understand why Potts and Campbell see jump - starting the population discussion as an urgent need , it is important to look at our current world population .
Is 6.8 billion people too many ?
In 1968 , when Ehrlich published his frightening book , there were only 3.5 billion of us .
Current projections place the total number of humans on the planet by 2050 between 9 and 10 billion .
Many experts believe that the earth ’s environment could be sustained with a world population of about two billion people , notes Campbell .
In any case , she continues , “ There is no such thing as sustainable population growth — that is , growth that goes on forever . ”
Yet every day our planet experiences a net gain of about 200,000 people , which means thousands of babies are being born as you read this story .
Some might ask why it really matters how many people live on the planet .
According to religious groups that , for moral or spiritual reasons , oppose artificially limiting family size , it does n’t .
Conservative think tanks such as the Cato Institute claim that population growth ( a sign , they suggest , of decreasing global death rates ) has been accommodated by improvements in food and energy production , or that money should be spent on health care for women and babies — rather than directed toward family planning programs .
Campbell and Potts disagree , saying that poverty is the one - word answer to that question .
“ When people have a lot of unintended pregnancies , ” Potts explains , “ then whole societies suffer — they are poorer , less healthy , and sometimes more violent . ”
Rapid population growth , and high rates of unplanned pregnancies , the Berkeley couple asserts , can be linked with harm to the natural environment , lack of education , and poverty , but the links may not always be straightforward .
Take impact on the environment .
“ Population and global warming need to be separated because population growth is not the key cause of global warming , ” says Campbell .
Energy consumption levels , not human existence per se , raise carbon dioxide emissions , and the highest consumption rates are in America and Europe .
Smaller populations in developed countries , therefore , have a larger carbon footprint than larger populations in developing countries .
Nevertheless , says Campbell , it ’s poor people who will suffer the most from global warming , partly because there will not be enough water to go around .
Higher temperatures worldwide are drying up our fresh water supplies , but so are soaring numbers of thirsty people , she adds .
Violence is also exacerbated by population growth and unintended pregnancies , says Potts .
In his 2008 book , Sex and War : How Biology Explains Warfare and Terrorism and Offers a Path to a Safer World , Potts provides a complex , compelling argument about the connection between population growth and the threat of terrorism and warfare .
The current situation in Pakistan , embroiled in conflict with the Taliban , offers a case study , he says .
“ When a population grows so rapidly , as it is in Pakistan , that it outstrips the ability of the government to provide for basic needs such as food , health services , and education , religious groups step in to fill the void . ”
He points to the proliferation of Islamic madrassa schools , known for encouraging militant views toward the West .
“ For half a century , military analysts have pointed to a rapid population growth in certain countries as threatening global security , ” Potts notes in Sex and War .
In Berkeley as elsewhere , World Population Day offers an excellent opportunity to ponder the future of our increasingly crowded planet .
Potts and Campbell encourage individuals and groups to engage in discussion on this important topic , and are eager to speak to gatherings of 50 or more people .
These two lifelong activists , whose blended family includes six children and four grandchildren , have no plans to ride into the golden sunset of retirement anytime soon .
They believe their effort is too important — for the future of the planet , for the future of their family — to slow down now .
“ The most important thing is to continue to work to remove terrible and unnecessary barriers to family planning , in the U.S. and around the world , ” says Potts .
“ We want people to realize we live in a finite world , and that rapid population growth is harmful , but that it can be slowed in a way that respects human rights . ”

« Media thoughts coming off UFC conference call ( and UFC 100 buyrate discussion ) | Home | Sengoku 8/2 Saitama Super Arena »
By Zach Arnold | July 31 , 2009
When I wrote an article a couple of days ago stating the intentions of what a lot of MMA writers and media types displayed in regards to getting Fedor into UFC , I pointed out statements that displayed what their admitted intentions were .
Remember this quote ?
I ’m more than willing to be a pawn in this negotiations if it means we see Fedor vs. Brock in the UFC .
The intentions were made very clear here .
Now there ’s an attempt to shift the focus using a sleight - of - hand , hoping you do n’t catch the difference .
Facing heat both online and during a radio interview , Carmichael Dave of KHTK 1140 Hot Talk in Sacramento is on the defensive .
It was Dave ’s ‘ report ’ on what UFC allegedly offered Fedor that helped various activists claim that they would put pressure on Fedor to sign with the UFC and that if he did n’t sign that there would be ‘ pure viciousness ’ from online fans towards him .
Carmichael
Dave went on Sherdog to answer questions from fans online since he basically took the bait from a UFC source to push the ‘ contract rumors ’ that the company had allegedly offered Fedor .
A forum member asked :
“ Lets stop beating around the bush here Mr. Dave .
Was you source UFC ‘ management ’ or not ?
And do you believe you were used as a tool to carry out their propoganda ?
The fans deserve an answer . ”
Here is how Dave responded :
“ I will answer your second question , I can not answer your first .
Of course there was a bit of “ using ” and propoganda involved .
The info put out there was not an accident .
No one got high on drugs and fed me the info .
They knew who I was , and it was very clear what I would do with the info when I got it .
My concern isnt their agenda .
My concern is their credibility and involvement in the procedures , and whether the info leaked merits reporting or not . ”
Then , Carmichael Dave did an interview with ESPN 1100 Las Vegas ( audio here ) .
” Are we pawns in this game ?
Of course .
Even if the information is 100 - percent right all the time it still does n’t mean we ’re not being used .
It ’s politics of sport .
Of course you can be a pawn . ”
Anyone who has ever worked in media understands that sources are trying to work over writers .
It ’s been a part of the business forever .
Just ask any baseball , football , or basketball writer about what GMs and teams try to do to use writers when trading deadlines occur each season .
No one is arguing that sources try to work over writers like ‘ pawns . ’
This line of argument is a sleight - of - hand .
What the activists do n’t want the focus to be on is the fact that they publicly admitted that they purposely wanted to be a pawn in order to advance a personal agenda and that personal agenda was to see one of their favorite fighters fight in the UFC .
Whatever it was going to take to get it done was their motto .
Now that it ’s clear that a deal between Fedor ’s camp and UFC will not go through , watch for some of these activists to start backpedalling in the media .
Watch for them to try to blur the lines and confuse readers .
“ Well , we ’re all pawns , that ’s how it works in the media . ”
Watch for an attempt to put the focus somewhere else and distract away from the true focus on what their motives were for their attempted activism and why it was being done .
Several people this week took big credibility hits and they ’re trying to figure out a way to recover from it and repair their image .
Who knows if they will be successful at undoing their own self - inflicted damage .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Two years after the start of the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , policy - makers from around the world gather this week to think about how to prevent it from happening again .
Federal Reserve President Ben Bernanke ( L ) sits next to his European Central Bank counterpart Jean - Claude Trichet prior to their meeting at the fifth European Central Banking Conference in Frankfurt in this November 14 , 2008 file photo .

The Kansas City Federal Reserve ’s yearly conference at a mountain retreat in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , will draw central bankers and top economists together at a time when the crisis appears to be easing , with the global economy on the mend .
The event will be a showcase for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to reflect on the lessons learned and assess whether signs of recovery are lasting .
Bernanke , who speaks at 8 a.m. Mountain time ( 10:00 a.m. EDT ) on Friday , may build on the Fed ’s view that while the U.S. economy is regaining its balance after the deepest dive since the 1930s , any rebound will be slow and fraught with risks .
“ Bernanke ’s speech is the big deal , ” said John Silvia , chief economist for Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte , North Carolina .
“ Is this thing really over ?
Is it three - quarters over ? ”
Questions about Bernanke ’s reappointment to a second four - year term as chairman of the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- will also hang over the event .
His current term expires on January 31 and President Barack Obama has yet to indicate whether Bernanke will be renominated .
Analysts expect a decision by the end of October .
CRISIS EASING
A year ago in Jackson Hole , officials hunkered down for private behind - the - scenes crisis - management talks .
At that time , financial stress was intensifying , although the most virulent phase of the crisis would not be triggered until a few weeks later when Lehman Brothers bank collapsed .
Now , with Germany , France and Japan having pulled out of recession and the United States appearing in better health as well , officials are breathing easier .
Still , economies remain on life support , with full recovery not yet assured .
“ I am not convinced that the recovery is sustainable yet , ” European Central Bank governing council member Axel Weber told German weekly Die Zeit when asked about Germany ’s economy .
Speaking a little more than a week after the Fed declared the U.S. economy to be leveling from a deep recession , Bernanke will likely take a stand - back approach in keeping with the academic nature of the conference and his professorial roots .
Bernanke , European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet and other central bankers could use the occasion to claim credit for emergency programs that have helped restore financial stability , and could point to much - settled - down indicators of risk in money markets as evidence of success .
“ They can say , ‘ We ’ve taken a lot of actions ; we have a lot of success , ’ ” said BNP Paribas economist Julia Coronado in New York .
Even so , with pockets of risk remaining , such as the shaky U.S. commercial real estate market , policy - makers who failed to recognize the dangers of subprime mortgage exposures are likely to be cautious in declaring victory .
CENTRAL BANK EFFECTIVENESS
Participants at the conference , which runs into Saturday , will likely also debate how effective central banks can be in spotting asset bubbles , such as the run-up in U.S. housing prices that triggered the financial meltdown , and what tools they can use to prevent turmoil .
Bernanke will need to convey confidence in the Fed ’s path toward economic recovery without raising expectations for an assured bounceback that could lead financial markets to anticipate a quick withdrawal of the central bank ’s monetary support for the economy .
With hopes for a U.S. recovery pinned on reinvigorated auto sales and a long - awaited upturn in housing markets , analysts worry a rebound could die out in six months .
Even as he tamps down expectations about recovery , Bernanke will want to be emphatic that the Fed can pull back from the low interest rates and flood of cash it has pumped into the economy quickly enough when the time comes to avoid inflation .
Auto sales have been sliding down in the last one year while two of big Detroit automakers are bankrupt .
Shoppers are still not high on investing on a new car and the Detroit scene has been a bleak one .
The decline in the industry has paved way for huge losses and yet foreign cars are always making more business as local companies do n’t do well .
As automakers do not make great business car shoppers are not clear on how to venture to get a brand new car with trust .
The credit crisis also rises for many and belt tightening economy seems to be on order .
Car shoppers are too many now and mostly a dazed lot as compared to the usual great American car buying thrill that was widely enjoyed .
There are various car buying incentives on the market too but little to advice solidly on what would be the best decisions to make in this economy .
The new awards for the Best Cars for the Money in 2009 , is the latest addition to establish greater awareness of monetary value according to a car in this uncertain and shrinking economy .
There are big incentives in the market but that does not mean that customers are lured enough or attracted to be confident enough to step up .
Focusing on cars that would be winners could actually give a guideline and a back up to prove the economically rewarding cars of the year .
This is being the main derivative about to be received from the whole process .
But it would not mean that the car would be functioning throughout the lifetime but only acceptable in this economy .
The Awards include nominations and categories among different lines of auto ranking in the U.S.
The online place to look for the updates is Ranksandreviews.com .
The best of the cars and their classifications are to be found here .
There are also reviews from automotive press , the customers as well as expert opinions .
Over all it is a relative study which could largely guide you into buying the right automobiles for the next year but not always for the long term picture .
There are certain specific characteristics that are taken in consideration which are significantly incorporated within the nomination process .
But there are limitations to this process as well .
New car choices and ownerships are being encouraged through this ranking process as are guides available on why and how to buy them .
The data from IntelChoice also happens to be one of the number one sources to provide the statistics for the assessment involved here .
There is a way of assessing 5 year total cost process of the car which seems to be the path breaking feature that can help customers .
Over all collective opinion too plays a vital role in determining the new cars ’ values .
Customers are also guided well on expert maintenance , insurance policies and fuel charges as overall cost input for the car .
With all the logs , data and reviews there is bound to be some fruitful way through which one can determine the best cars to suit one ’s lifestyle .
The winners will come from 14 new classes .
Toyota is the sure winner with assessment so far .
The 5 Toyotas have come up to be the top 5 best cars of the year , in accordance to the money spent on them .
Lexus , Toyota Luxury Marquee class , Chevrolet , Mazda , Korean Upstart , Honda and Hyundai also make to the top list .
5 of the winners are also hybrid cars which come with some super values .
From Honda
Fit to hulking Chevrolet Tahoe , there are a lot of shared qualities and features among the winners .
These are all lower range cars with worry free ownership and easy maintenance .
After all that is what we are looking for to thrive in this economy and make it possible to come up with all costs .
Toyota makes for bulletproof quality covers for their cars and happens to be of excellent quality .
No wonder the first few notches are taken by it .
It also has low maintenance charges , a hassle everyone needs to avoid .
They retain the net value over other cars in a better way .
The winning cars have always received positive press reviews and customer feedback .
These are not the kind of cars that would be featured as luxury pieces but as the common people ’s choices their easy accessibility , good price , maintenance and usage .
These make overall popular choices among a wide range of people .
A vast majority of shoppers would be able to relate to these cars .
For instance the Lexus ES is an Upscale choice for cars with a total package coverage .
It is not as big as the Mercedes Benz C Class or gives a super smooth drive like the BMW 3 - Series but it is something that will be easy on your wallet and will give you a comfortable experience throughout its tenure .
Another winner like the Mazda5 is the Best Compact Crossover that gives incredible value for money .
It also stays in line with other such wonderful competitors like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR - V. Hyundai Elantra has been voted to be the Best Compact Car in this list with making solid and fruitful economical progress .

Pakistan 's cricketers are worried they will not be able to defend their title Earlier this week it was members of a pipe band from Pakistan that were denied visas to travel to Britain , now it is the country 's blind cricket team .
Pakistan 's blind cricketers are the reigning world champions .
The squad members have just finished attending a nine - day training camp , ahead of what was supposed to be a four - match UK tour ( on the invitation of Blind Cricket England and Wales ) .
But the team 's visa applications have been rejected .
The UK Border Agency says it did not have sufficient evidence to be convinced the players would return to Pakistan once the tour was over .
' Hurt and insulted '
Sitting in his Islamabad home , beside a table packed with sporting trophies , is the chairman of the Pakistan Blind Cricket Council , and former blind cricket captain Syed Sultan Shah .
It feels like we are being denied our rights
Syed Sultan Shah , Chairman of the Pakistan Blind Cricket Council
He says he is stunned by the decision : " We provided letters from our council , and from the Pakistan Cricket Board , who confirmed they would cover all costs , " he says .
" The English Cricket Board supplied our names and passport numbers .
The Pakistan ministry of sport gave us official leave to travel .
We all signed affidavits to say we would return , and if we did not , our families would be penalised .
What more could we do ?
" When we toured the UK in 2002 and 2006 , nobody stayed behind .
We just want to play cricket . "
Mr Shah says the players had all taken leave from work , and that hundreds of thousands of rupees ( thousands of pounds ) had been spent on the training camp , new kit and on the visa applications themselves .
" But it 's not the money .
It feels like we are being denied our rights .
We are all very hurt , very disturbed and feel very insulted by this , " he says .
No apology The UK Border Agency insists its ruling is justified .
" We will make no apology for maintaining tough border controls created to prevent abuse of the immigration system , " it states .
" If applications do not contain the necessary evidence and we are not satisfied individuals will return at the end of their visit their visas will be refused . "
The statement adds that " UKBA is committed to facilitating sporting , cultural and arts exchanges " .
Eighteen of the 21 Pakistani players and officials that applied to travel , including the manager and assistant manager , are totally or partially blind .
Many were part of the team that won the World Cup on home soil in 2006 , at a tournament in which England also competed .
" As a blind person , playing cricket changed my life , " says Mr Shah .
" I can't tell you how much confidence it gives us , and what it took to win the World Cup . "
" But this has really been a big blow .
And we are worried we wo n't be able to defend our title in the future . "
The next World Cup is scheduled to be held in England .

As all the right - wing Christian conservative blow - hard ( RWCCBH ) homophobes down there in the States continue to blather on about how gay marriage is going to destroy traditional marriage , I just keep scratching my head , struggling with all my might to understand just what the $ % they ’re talking about .
The fact is , here in Canada , same - sex marriage has been legal nationwide since 2005 and not one traditional marriage that I know of has ever been threatened or damaged in any way whatsoever .
That ’s four years and millions of marriages without even one — not one — being threatened in the slightest .
And you better believe that if one ever was it ’d be all over the news : “ Yes , yes , that ’s right , Your Honour , we were happily married for 20 long years , but then this gay - marriage bill passed and we saw gays getting hitched and it made our marriage seem so meaningless and empty .
Obviously we had no other option but divorce . ”
Personally , I know many people who have gotten divorced in this country , both before and after the legalization of same - sex marriage , and not one of them has ever cited the threat of gay marriage as even a mitigating factor in their relationship ’s demise .
I know my own marriage is still going strong , despite this seemingly imminent threat .
I ’m not really sure how other people getting married — whether they be straight , gay , or bi—is supposed to threaten my marriage , but I ’m guessing that , when it comes to the RWCCBH homophobes , it probably has something to do with a secret desire to be free of their present marital situations ( í la Larry Craig and Ted Haggard ) .
Now I ’m not saying that all right - wing Christian conservative blow - hard homophobes are secretly gay .
I ’m just saying that I find it quite interesting that they are all so totally and utterly obsessed with preventing gay marriage from becoming a legal option and that they so passionately insist that the availability of gay marriage is going to somehow threaten their own marriages .
And , by the way , I ’ve got no problem with any , or all , of the RWCCBH homophobes being gay , if that ’s what they indeed are .
Though I most certainly do have a problem with their hypocrisy .
Perhaps they should stop worrying about other people ’s love lives and life commitments , and instead focus on their own for a while .
Because , obviously , it does n’t matter who other people are marrying ; the fact is nothing threatens a person ’s marriage but the reality of their own relationship with their spouse ( though , sometimes , a really hot coworker full of lust and desire can be a bit of a threat too , I guess ) .
Procreation vs. love
As these RWCCBH homophobes clamour for reasons to deny gays the same rights they themselves enjoy , they ridiculously point to procreation and state that marriage is primarily intended to make babies .
Yeah , that ’s right ; not surprisingly , the main reason for getting married , according to these lovers of all things pre-Enlightenment , is not in fact love , but rather to simply produce offspring .
Not wanting to get into the obvious psychological deficiencies and personality disorders that have so clearly inflicted anyone in the modern world who marries for procreation over love , let me just say that I can’t really imagine these RWCCBH homophobes denying infertile individuals the right to marry .
Nor can I imagine them disqualifying postmenopausal women from marriage either .
So why the concern with baby - making abilities when it comes to gays ?
I mean , besides the obvious homophobia , hatred , and small - mindedness , of course .
Fear and loathing — and Bible study
What ’s with these people anyway ?
I mean , they ’re scared of everything .
If it ’s not God condemning them to hell for masturbating , it ’s “ socialized ” medicine turning their beloved homeland into North Korea , and / or it ’s “ liberal educated elites ” pushing evil , dangerous stuff down their children ’s throats .
Stuff like science .
Come on , guys ; you ca n’t be terrified of everything , can you ?
Me ?
The only thing that really scares me is them .
That is , the only thing that really terrifies me is the possibility of these right - wing Christian conservative blow - hard homophobes one day actually taking over America .
It may seem unlikely now , but seeing that their numbers continue to grow almost as fast as their minds continue to close , it is , sadly , a distinct possibility .
And , if it ever were to happen , forget about same - sex marriage .
How about life without science , government services , or masturbation ?
And in their place nothing but a shitload of Bible study ?
Yeah , I ’m talking about a takeover by the American Taliban .
In which case , I suspect that we here in Canada would feel a lot like the Dutch and Belgians in the late - 1930s .
That is , not exactly very safe or secure .

It is my intention to give you clips from documents , many from the United Nations that prove there is a plan to depopulate this planet .
I will also provide quotes from various people and organizations that further show this agenda is afoot .
I pray the guidance of the Lord God Almighty will be with me in this pursuit to warn others of this dark plot against humanity .
Everything written in this paper is easily verifiable .
It may take some time and effort , but I took great pains to make this paper as accurate as I possibly could .
The depopulation agenda is based on nature worship , or Gaia worship .
In Genesis , God clearly told Adam and Eve , and then Noah and his family to go forth and multiply to fill the earth .
Nowhere in the Bible does God rescind that clearly spoken commandment .
Therefore man is attempting to supercede the command of the Lord God in heaven : The Creator !
I ask you , who knows more about the state of the earth , the created , or the Creator ?
The basis for the depopulation agenda is a standard all elitist ’s hold dear .
This standard is called :
The Hegelian Dialectic :
Problem – Reaction - Solution
Create the Problem Cause a Reaction Offer a Solution
You will see exactly how they have created the problem ; caused a reaction so widespread it is really quite impressive how successful they have been ; and offered a solution : A deadly solution .
I ask that you please make an attempt to distribute this paper everywhere you possibly can .
The time grows short and so many are going to be caught unawares .
By getting the word out , you may be able to prevent someone from needless pain and suffering .
Aldous Huxley
William Benton , Assistant U.S. Secretary of State at UNESCO 1946 : ( UNESCO is the United Nations Education , Science and Cultural Organization )
“ As long as a child breathes the poisoned air of nationalism , education in world - mindedness can produce only precarious results .
As we have pointed out , it is frequently the family that infects the child with extreme nationalism .
The schools therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes that favor jingoism ( nationalism ) … we shall presently recognize in nationalism the major obstacle to development of world mindedness .
We are at the beginning of a long process of breaking down the walls of national sovereignty .
UNESCO must be the pioneer . ” ( Emphasis mine throughout )
Club of Rome , The First Global Revolution , 1991 :
“ In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill ( this is absolute proof that man made global warming is a fabrication ) … .
But in designating them as the enemy , we fall into the trap of mistaking symptoms for causes .
All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome .
The real enemy , then , is humanity itself . ”
Mikhail Gorbachev :
“ We must speak more clearly about sexuality , contraception , about abortion , about values that control population , because the ecological crisis , in short , is the population crisis .
Cut the population by 90 % and there are n’t enough people left to do a great deal of ecological damage . ”
Aldous Huxley , Brave New World 1946 :
“ There is , of course , no reason why the new totalitarians should resemble the old .
Government by clubs and firing squads , by artificial famine , mass imprisonment and mass deportation , is not merely inhumane ( nobody cares much about that nowadays ) ; it is demonstrably inefficient and in an age of advanced technology , inefficiency is the sin against the Holy Ghost . ”
Aldous Huxley , Lecture named Population Explosion 1959 :
“ … Let us ask ourselves what the practical alternatives are as we confront this problem of population growth .
One alternative is to do nothing in particular about it and just let things go on as they are …
The question is :
Are we going to restore the balance in the natural way , which is a brutal and entirely anti-human way , or are we going to restore it in some intelligent , rational , and humane way …
Try to increase production as much as possible and at the same time try to re-establish the balance between the birth rate by means less gruesome than those which are used by nature – by intelligent and human methods ?
… There are colossal difficulties in the way of implementing any large - scale policy of limitation of population ; whereas death control is extremely easy under modern circumstances , birth control is extremely difficult .
The reason is very simple : death control – the control , for example , of infectious diseases – can be accomplished by a handful of experts and quite a small labour force of unskilled persons and requires a very small capital expenditure . ”
Barry Commoner , Making Peace with the Planet :
“ There have been ‘ triage ’ proposals that would condemn whole nations to death through some species of global ‘ benign neglect ’ .
There have been schemes for coercing people to curtail their fertility , by physical and legal means that are ominously left unspecified .
Now we are told that we must curtail rather than extend our efforts to feed the hungry peoples of the world .
Where will it end ? ” Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen , April 28 , 1997 , Testimony before Congressional Committee : “ There are some reports , for example , that some countries have been trying to construct something like an Ebola Virus , and that would be a very dangerous phenomenon , to say the least .
Alvin Toeffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races ; and others are designing some sort of engineering , some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops .
Others are engaging even in an eco - type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate , set off earthquakes , volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves .
So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations .
It ’s real , and that ’s the reason why we have to intensify our efforts , and that ’s why this is so important . ”
Jacques Cousteau
Jacques Cousteau UNESCO
Courier 1991 :
“ In order to save the planet it would be necessary to kill 350,000 people per day . ”
Jacques Cousteau , Population : Opposing Viewpoints :
“ If we want our precarious endeavor to succeed , we must convince all human beings to participate in our adventure , and we must urgently find solutions to curb the population explosion that has a direct influence on the impoverishment of the less - favoured communities .
Otherwise , generalized resentment will beget hatred , and the ugliest genocide imaginable , involving billions of people , will become unavoidable . ”
“ Uncontrolled population growth and poverty must not be fought from inside , from Europe , from North America , or any nation or group of nations ; it must be attacked from the outside – by international agencies helped in the formidable job by competent and totally non-governmental organizations . ”
Bertrand Russell , The Impact Of Science On Society 1953
“ I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing …
War… has hitherto been disappointing in this respect , but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective .
If a Black Death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full …
The state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant , but what of that ?
Really high - minded people are indifferent to happiness , especially other people ’s …
There are three ways of securing a society that shall be stable as regards population .
The first is that of birth control , the second that of infanticide or really destructive wars , and the third that of general misery except for a powerful minority … ”
Henry Kissinger , 1978 :
“ U.S. policy toward the third world should be one of depopulation ”
David Rockefeller , 2000 :
“ We are on the verge of a global transformation .
All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . ”
David Rockefeller : Memoirs 2002 Founder of the CFR :
“ We wield over American political and economical institutions .
Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ‘ internationalists ’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political structure , one world , if you will .
If that ’s the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . ”
David Rockefeller , Co-founder of the Trilateral Commission :
David Rockefeller
“ We are grateful to The Washington Post , The New York Times , Time Magazine & other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promise of discretion for almost 40 years .
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plans for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years .
But , the world is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
Thomas Ferguson , the Latin American Case Officer for the State Department ’s Office of Population Affairs ( OPA ) ( now the US State Dept. Office of Population Affairs , est. by Henry Kissinger in 1975 ) : “ There is a single theme behind all our work - we must reduce population levels , ” said Thomas Ferguson , the Latin American case officer for the State Department ’s Office of Population Affairs ( OPA ) .
“ Either they [ governments ] do it our way , through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador , or in Iran , or in Beirut .
Population is a political problem .
Once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government , even fascism , to reduce it .
“ The professionals , ” said Ferguson , “ are n’t interested in lowering population for humanitarian reasons .
That sounds nice .
We look at resources and environmental constraints .
We look at our strategic needs , and we say that this country must lower its population - or else we will have trouble .
“ So steps are taken .
El Salvador is an example where our failure to lower population by simple means has created the basis for a national security crisis .
The government of El Salvador failed to use our programs to lower their population .
Now they get a civil war because of it ….
There will be dislocation and food shortages .
They still have too many people there . ” ( 1981 )
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen , April 28 , 1997 ; Testimony before Congressional Committee :
“ And advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool . ”
Sir Julian Huxley , UNESCO : its Purpose and its Philosophy :
“ Political unification in some sort of world government will be required …
Even though … any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible , it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care , and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable . ”
In the early 1950 ’s , former Communist Joseph Z. Kornfeder expressed the opinion that UNESCO was comparable to a Communist Party agitation and propaganda department .
He stated that such a party apparatus ‘ handles the strategy and method of getting at the public mind , young and old . ’
Huxley would lard the agency with a motley collection of Communists and fellow travelers .
President Richard Nixon believed abortion was necessary as a form of eugenics to prevent interracial breeding
Theodore Roosevelt to Charles B. Davenport , January 3 , 1913 , Charles B. Davenport Papers , Department of Genetics , Cold Spring Harbor , N.Y. :
“ I wish very much that the wrong people could be prevented entirely from breeding ; and when the evil nature of these people is sufficiently flagrant , this should be done .
Criminals should be sterilized and feebleminded persons forbidden to leave offspring behind them …
The emphasis should be laid on getting desirable people to breed … ”
Theodore Roosevelt
Theodore Roosevelt :
“ Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind … .
Any group of farmers , who permitted their best stock not to breed , and let all the increase come from the worst stock , would be treated as fit inmates for an asylum … .
Some day we will realize that the prime duty , the inescapable duty of the good citizens of the right type is to leave his or her blood behind him in the world ; and that we have no business to permit the perpetuation of citizens of the wrong type .
The great problem of civilization is to secure a relative increase of the valuable as compared with the less valuable or noxious elements in the population …
The problem can not be met unless we give full consideration to the immense influence of heredity … ” “ I wish very much that the wrong people could be prevented entirely from breeding ; and when the evil nature of these people is sufficiently flagrant , this should be done .
Criminals should be sterilized and feebleminded persons forbidden to leave offspring behind them …
The emphasis should be laid on getting desirable people to breed … ”
By Carl Teichrib :
“ The Georgia Guidestones , a massive granite edifice planted in the Georgia countryside , contains a list of ten new commandments for Earth ’s citizens .
The first commandment , and the one which concerns this article , simply states ; “ Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature . ”
Robert Walker , former chair of PepsiCo and Proctor & Gamble on water :
Water is a gift of nature .
Its delivery is not .
It must be priced to insure it is used sustainably .
Ted Turner makes the radical statement that , “ A total population of 250- 300 million people , a 95 % decline from present levels , would be ideal , ”
Margaret Sanger ( founder of Planned Parenthood , funded by the Rockefellers ) said in her proposed “ The American Baby Code ” , intended to become law :
“ The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it . ”
This is the woman ( Margaret Sanger ) whom Hillary Clinton publicly declared she looked up to , during the 2008 presidential debates .
Here is a short list of some advocates of eugenics ; Alexander Graham Bell , George Bernard Shaw H. G. Wells , Sidney Webb , William Beveridge , John Maynard Keynes , Margaret Sanger , Marie Stopes , Woodrow Wilson , Theodore Roosevelt , Emile Zola , George Bernard Shaw , John Maynard Keynes , John Harvey Kellogg , Winston Churchill , Linus Pauling , Sidney Webb , Sir Francis Galton , Charles B. Davenport Futurist Barbara Marx Hubbard ( who wanted to create a Dept. of Peace ) :
“ Out of the full spectrum of human personality , one - fourth is electing to transcend …
One - fourth is ready to so choose , given the example of one other …
One - fourth is resistant to election .
They are unattracted by life ever evolving .
One - fourth is destructive .
They are born angry with God… They are defective seeds … There have always been defective seeds .
In the past they were permitted to die a ‘ natural death ’…we , the elders , have been patiently waiting until the very last moment before the quantum transformation , to take action to cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of humanity .
It is like watching a cancer grow …
Now , as we approach the quantum shift from creature - human to co-creative human — the human who is an inheritor of god - like powers — the destructive one - fourth must be eliminated from the social body .
We have no choice , dearly beloveds .
Fortunately you , dearly beloveds , are not responsible for this act .
We are .
We are in charge of God ’s selection process for planet Earth .
He selects , we destroy .
We are the riders of the pale horse , Death .
We come to bring death to those who are unable to know God … the riders of the pale horse are about to pass among you .
Grim reapers , they will separate the wheat from the chaff .
This is the most painful period in the history of humanity … ”
Henry Kissinger
Alexander Haig is quoted referring to the US State Department Office of Population Affairs , which was established by Henry Kissinger in 1975 .
The title has since been changed to The Bureau of Oceans , International Environmental and Scientific Affairs :
“ Accordingly , the Bureau of Oceans , International Environmental and Scientific Affairs has consistently blocked industrialization policies in the Third World , denying developing nation ’s access to nuclear energy technology –the policies that would enable countries to sustain a growing population .
According to State Department sources , and Ferguson himself , Alexander Haig is a “ firm believer ” in population control .
Although the above stated quotes should be sufficient to prove that the elitists in power have definite intent to depopulate this planet to what they deem to be a sustainable level .
Some will argue these are only opinions and are of no real consequence .
I will now move on to providing bits of documentation showing this is a plan that has a worldwide scope of influence .
Most of these documents are at least 10 years old , some older .
That however , does not take away from the seriousness of the content .
Do not think them invalid due to their age .
It takes time to foment plans on such a grand scale .
But , if you are honest with yourself you can see glimpses of these things happening today .
I am going to cover some issues stemming from the UN Treaty on Biological Diversity ( Agenda 21 ) , which Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993 before it was sent to the U.S. Senate for ratification .
EPA Internal Working Document Ecosystem Management :
“ The executive branch should direct federal agencies to evaluate national policies …. in light of international policies and obligations , and to amend national policies to achieve international objectives . ”
“ In other words , our federal bureaucrats are writing U.S. law , independent of Congress who has Constitutional authority to do that .
They are changing regulations and creating laws out of thin air . ”
“ They are no longer working for the people of the United States .
They are working for the international community .
There are so many treaties written up that they have ( effectively ) bound the United States .
Whereas a few of the treaties were not a problem , the abundance ( 100 ’s ) of them have now taken control over all of our lives ” - Michael Coffman
UN Treaty on Biological Diversity Assessment on Desirable Culture :
“ … Traditional societies have considered certain sites as sacred , where most human activities are prohibited . ”
That is the heart of the Convention on Biodiversity .
Locking up nearly 50 % of the land area of the United States is their idea of protecting biological diversity .
- Michael Coffman
UN Treaty on Biodiversity Diversity Usage of Fertilizers Not Sustainable :
“ That fertilizers have played an essential part in producing the world ’s harvests is undisputed .
( It ) is estimated that if the use of fertilizers ceased , the world ’s harvests would be cut almost in half .
However , the negative side of the equation is that the nitrates from fertilizers seep into ground water aquifers and they are seriously implicated in the eutrophication of lakes , rivers and coastal ecosystems causing often drastic changes in the fauna and flora . ”
“ They are willing to take a course of action that will reduce the world ’s food supply by half , or more , as they will likely reduce the use of pesticides knowing full well how many people this will kill ” .
- Michael Coffman
UN Biodiversity Assessment on Sustainable Human Population ; US Senate September 9 , 1994 :
“ A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material standard of living would be one billion people .
This must be implemented within 30 - 50 years , 2/3 ’s of the population must be cut . ”
“ The UN says property rights are not absolute and unchanging , but are there for the convenience of whatever government wants to do . ” – Michael Coffman
“ Nobody owns biodiversity , so everything we do impinges on biodiversity .
Property rights become meaningless .
At the Rio De Janeiro Summit it was decided that the Global Environmental Facility would be the depository of all property rights . ” – Michael Coffman
UN Biodiversity Assessment The Worldview of Western Civilization Section 12.2.3 , Page 835 :
The western “ worldview is characteristic of large - scale societies , heavily dependent on resources brought from considerable distances .
It is a worldview that is characterized by the denial of sacred attributes of nature … ( which ) became firmly established about 2000 years ( ago ) with the Judeo - Christian - Islamic religious traditions . ”
This same treaty considers rocks to be living beings on an equal plane with human beings .
Rocks , many believe , will reincarnate into lower life forms ; and gradually into human beings .
Bureau of Land Management Internal Working Document
“ Soylent green is … humans . ”
Human Dimensions of Ecosystem Management Objective / Purpose : “ All ecosystem management activities should consider human beings as biological resources … ” ( Reminiscent of Soylent Green )
This document was brought before Congress .
This statement created such an uproar that it was removed .
Regardless of its removal , it still serves to prove the mindset of these people ; and just because this was removed from a document it does not mean it was removed from the thoughts and the intended goals of those who penned it ; or who believe it .
“ For the elite to be able to have management of the ecosystem , humans would have no more value than a rock . ” – Michael Coffman
UN Biodiversity Treaty UN Global Biological Assessment Sustainable Human Populations :
“ Population growth has exceeded the capacity of the biosphere ” ( i.e. the earth ) “ It is estimated that an ‘ agricultural world ’ in which most human beings are peasants should be able to support 5 to 7 billion people . ”
Now I feel is an appropriate time to cover some other areas of government , as well as private organizations that would like to see the population of the world decrease at an astounding rate ( up to 90 % ) .
This is a dark , bloody agenda that will cause terrible hardship and pain upon millions of people .
World Wildlife Fund , World Resources Institute International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) :
The IUCN involves the EPA , US Fish & Wildlife Service , the National Park Service , the United States Forest Service , Sierra Club , the Nature Conservancy , the National Wildlife Fund , the National Audubon Society , National Resources Defense Council , UNESCO , the Environmental Defense Fund , the U.N. Environmental Program , etc. .
IUCN 1992
Covenant
On the Environment and Development : “ Eventually a wilderness network would dominate a region and thus would itself constitute the matrix , with human habitations being the islands .
The remaining half of the US would be used as buffer zones . ”
“ The night before this treaty was ratified , Senator Mitchell withdrew it from the calendar and it was never voted on .
It took four men , devoted to God in prayer to stop this treaty .
The treaty still waits in the wings .
Upon ratification , the US will have no ability to protect its own citizens . ”
- Michael Coffman
Henry Kissinger had a similar plan to use food as a weapon in 1974 , found in the National Security Study Memorandum 200 : Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests ; which was adopted as official policy by then President Gerald Ford in November of 1975 .
This Memorandum outlined a covert plan to reduce population growth in lesser - developed countries by means of birth control , and implicitly , war and famine .
Brent Scowcroft , who had by then replaced Kissinger as National Security Advisor , ( the same post Scowcroft held in the Bush Administration ) , was put in charge of implementing the plan .
CIA Director George H.W. Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft , as were the Secretaries of State , Treasury , Defense and Agriculture .
This document has never been renounced , only certain portions have been amended , leaving it as the foundational document on population control issued in the U.S. Government .
The major players in the founding of this document are as follows :
Henry Kissinger Richard Nixon Margaret Sanger Paul Ehrlich Werner Fornos Timothy Wirth The United Nations Population Fund The United States Agency for International Development Planned Parenthood Federation of America International Planned Parenthood Federation The Club of Rome UNICEF WHO United Nations World Bank
The document can be read here in its entirety , along with the other organizations and individuals complicit in this abomination :
http://www.usmutes.com/NSSM200.htm
Adolph Hitler
Let it be noted that Adolph Hitler also used food as weapon , stating that food is “ a beautiful instrument … for maneuvering and disciplining the masses . ”
Food has been used as a weapon of war for centuries .
Why then would it be outrageous for the elite to use food as a weapon , both a physical and a psychological weapon , in a declared war on overpopulation ?
It would not be outrageous at all .
As has been said time and time again , history repeats itself .
Now we will cover the Earth Charter .
The Earth Charter ; A Radical Global Religion , created by Mikhail Gorbachev and Michael Strong : “ The Earth Charter initiative reflects the conviction that a radical change in humanity ’s attitudes and values is essential to achieve social , economic and ecological well - being in the 21st century …
The commission … plans to circulate a final version of the Charter as a People ’s Treaty beginning in mid-1998 .
The Charter will be submitted to the U.N. General Assembly in the year 2000 … ( where it will ) ensure a very strong document that reflects the emerging new global ethics . ”
This is unprecedented ( it is ) the first component of an authentic global governance .
We are working for dialogue and peace .
We are demonstrating our ability to assert control over our fate in a spirit of solidarity to organize our collective sovereignty over this planet , our common heritage . ”
The American people were not allowed to see this .
Americans as a whole do not want the UN to be the head of a world government .
The one thing the majority of this country values , above most everything else , is their freedom .
Or the semblance of freedom we have left should I say .
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , the Presidential Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 came to the conclusion that the world ’s human population should not exceed 500 million people .
That is a 93 % reduction in population !
According to the UN video , “ Armed to the Teeth ” ; and also in the Freedom From War Policy - put into effect by JFK in 1961 - general and complete disarmament and US military power was given over , in full , to the UN .
This is a loss of the sovereignty of America .
( Read this document at http://www.scribd.com/doc/5009662/Freedom From - War ) .
The Earth Charter ( 1992 ) , A Spiritual Vision : “ A consensus has developed that the Earth Charter should be …the articulation of a spiritual vision that reflects universal spiritual values , including , but not limited to , ethical values … a people ’s charter that serves as a universal code of conduct for ordinary citizens , educators , business executives , scientists , religious leaders , non-governmental organizers and national councils of sustainable development ; and a declaration of principles that can serve as a “ soft tax ” document when endorsed by the UN General Assembly . ”
In its original form , The Earth Charter failed miserably due to open , blatant pantheistic approach .
Gorbachev and Strong have worked diligently to change the language and make it appear less obvious .
You may be wondering what the Earth Charter has to do with depopulation .
It has everything to do with it .
Here is a very brief synopsis of what the Charter holds for us .
According to the Charter , we must :
* “ Recognize that all beings are interdependent and every form of life has value … ” ( Unborn children , of course , are not included in the UN ’s definition of “ every form of life . ”
The Earth Summit II documents continue to support the UN ’s pro-abortion policies . )
* “ Affirm faith in the inherent dignity of all human beings . ” ( UN agencies , however , support policies of euthanasia for those determined not capable of living a “ quality ” life . )
* “ Adopt at all levels sustainable development plans and regulations … . ”
( This is a prescription for global socialism in a super - regulated global state . )
* “ Prevent pollution of any part of the environment … ” ( Enforcing this dictum would mean stopping virtually all human activity . )
* “ Internalize the full environmental and social costs of goods and services in the selling price . ”
( This seemingly harmless sentence would empower the state to price , tax , and regulate all production and consumption . )
* “ Ensure universal access to health care that fosters reproductive health and responsible reproduction .
( This is a thinly disguised call for that includes abortion and population control . )
* “ Eliminate discrimination in all its forms , such as that based on race … [ and ] sexual orientation . ”
( This provision is clearly aimed at criminalizing those who refuse to accept homosexuality as positive and good . )
* “ Promote the equitable distribution of wealth within nations and among nations .

Earth Charter
The Earth Charter has not been ratified .
Do not make the mistake of assuming it has not been interwoven into our society , however !
It is being taught in our schools and promoted shamelessly by Hollywood , the UN , NBC ( owned by GE ) , ABC , CBS , CNN , HLN & all the Fox owned stations , with the exception of Fox News in order to keep the supporters blinded to the machinations of Rupert Murdock .
Do not be deceived !
The ability to freely procreate is soon to be removed from us , much as it has been in China for many years .
Not only will we not be allowed to have children , anyone who is termed a “ useless eater ” ( A term coined by Henry Kissinger ) will be euthanized : Mercilessly culled .
In Sweden , the “ Sterilization Act of 1934 ” provided for the voluntary sterilization of some mental patients .
The law was passed while the Swedish Social Democratic Party was in power , though it was also supported by all other political parties in Parliament at the time , as well as the Lutheran Church and much of the medical profession .

America is scheduled to become compliant to Codex Alimentarius ( CA ) as of December 31 , 2009 .
Codex Alimentarius is going to regulate virtually anything that you put into your mouth that is not a pharmaceutical .
The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) has accepted Codex Alimentarius and any nation that is a member of the WTO must become compliant with CA .
In any dispute between 2 countries , the one that is Codex compliant automatically wins .
This is quite an incentive for all nations to become compliant .
– Rima Laibow
CA guidelines set for vitamins & minerals are said to be voluntary , however , they are scheduled to become mandatory on December 31 , 2009 .
In 1994 , Codex Alimentarius declared nutrients to be poisons : See the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act ( DSHEA ) .
Yet fluoride is acceptable !
Why ?
It creates complacency .
Proper nutrients will ensure a longer , healthier life .
Not at all in keeping with a depopulation agenda .
From Esoteric Agenda , a documentary by Ben Stewart :
“ In 1962 it was decreed that there would be a move toward total global implementation of Codex Alimentarius .
The date set for implementation is December 31 , 2009 .
WHO and FAO are the commissions in charge of CA .
They fund it and run it at the request of the U.N .
According to WHO & FAO , epidemiological projections , it is estimated that according to the vitamin and mineral guideline alone ; when CA goes into global implementation on December 31 , 2009 , it will result in a minimum of 3 billion deaths ; 1 billion due through starvation .
The next 2 billion will die from preventable diseases due to malnutrition . ”
“ The U.N. has put out dozens of reports calling for an 80 % reduction in population ( most put the number at 90 % ) .
At the 1997 Women ’s World Conference in Beijing , the head of the U.N. Food Program said , “ We will use food as a weapon against the people . ” ”
In conjunction with Codex Alimentarius , food will be limited and water consumption will be decreased to 10 gallons per day , per person .
The average American uses 140 gallons of water every day .
The food provided will be Genetically Modified and nutrient deficient .
As of the Codex Alimentarius ( CA ) implementation date of 12/31/09 , if there were a famine anywhere in the world , it will be illegal to send any high nutrient density biscuits .
Or to distribute them !!
Once a country becomes CA compliant , CA can never be repealed .
Membership with the WTO robs the member nations of any and all sovereignty .
Germany is now CA compliant .
Codex Alimentarius goes hand in hand with Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Treaty .
The deadline to implement both Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Treaty is 2012 . ” ( Rima Laibow )
Agenda 21 was birthed out of the Rio Summit 1992 .
Agenda 21 ( A 21 ) , a.k.a. Smart Growth , Regionalism , Visioning Processes , Action Plans , Shared Values ; 20 / 20 , Best Practices ; Community Festivals & Public / Private Partnerships .
These are the names you will hear A 21 called , the buzzwords .
Every county must set up a council to oversee the implementation of A 21 .
A 21 is Sustainable Development .
Steven Rockefeller set up the Earth Charter , referenced above .
The Earth Charter is the new One World Religion : Earth worship .
The earth is considered to be ‘ sacred ’ , and its protection is a ‘ sacred trust ’ .
Global responsibility will demand basic changes in values , behaviors and attitudes of government , the private sector , and civil society .
Under Sustainable Development man is considered to be responsible for the pollution of the planet and is subordinate to all other living creatures .
This is a direct contradiction to the Bible where God placed man in a position of dominance over the entire earth .
The elite will worship and serve the creature , rather than the Creator .
“ The environmental agenda is a spiritual agenda with earth worship at its root .
As such , the following practices are all considered to be unsustainable : Fossil fuels , artificial fertilizers , modern systems of agricultural production , irrigation water , herbicides , pesticides , farmland , pastures , grazing of livestock , consumerism , dietary habits , salt , sugar , private property , paved roads , dams , reservoirs , logging activities , fencing of pastures ” .
– Joan Peros
“ Every environmental resource must be measured .
What can be measured can be managed under the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project . ” – Joan Peros
Among the things considered to be unsustainable , as listed above , these are included : Monotheism and the family unit .
The health care plan of President Obama is under A 21 .
Under this health care plan , the family unit is very much being attacked .
Anyone over age 65 must undergo ‘ end of life counseling ’ by their doctor every 5 years .
Abortion will be pushed that much harder , especially with the Science Czar wanting sterilants put into our water supply !
One of the new appointee ’s to the Obama Administration once said in a book he co-wrote that a child could be killed up to the age of 2 years old !
What kind of a monster could think that is acceptable ?

Israeli combatants in the Gaza war against Hamas were told by commanders to minimize their own casualties even if it meant risking the lives of Palestinian civilians , a group of Israeli soldiers have alleged .
On Wednesday , Breaking the Silence published 54 anonymous testimonies from more than two dozen soldiers on its website .
The organization , founded for the express purpose of compiling such accounts , accused the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) of sacrificing more rigorous rules of combat engagement for a political end : preventing high Israeli casualty numbers that would have splintered the country 's unity over the January war .
During and after the war , Israeli officials often referred to the IDF as " the most moral army in the world . "
Israel 's army , which received an advance copy of the testimonials on Tuesday – nearly a week after the press – disputed the anonymous accounts as impossible to verify and therefore unreliable .
The soldiers who gave the accounts included both conscripts and reservists active on all four military corridors of invasion into the Gaza Strip , according to the organization .
Some said that they were disturbed and disillusioned by what they saw as an erosion of the Israeli army 's code of ethics , which requires soldiers avoid deliberate harm to civilians .
" An IDF soldier does not shoot for the sake of shooting nor does he apply excessive force beyond the call of the mission he is to perform , " read one testimonial .
In another account , a soldier described a pep talk by one of his commanders that seemed to contradict that standard .
" ' I am not willing to allow a soldier of mine to risk himself by hesitating .
If you are not sure – shoot .
If there is doubt , then there is no doubt , " read the testimony .
" This is the difference between urban warfare and a limited confrontation .
In urban warfare , anyone is your enemy .
No innocents . "
" Shoot for the body , " soldier says he was told
The latest allegations of a policy to use overwhelming force with little regard to identity of the civilians jibes with allegations made by international and Palestinian rights groups .
The testimonials also claim to confirm the use of white phosphorous shells in civilian areas , widespread damage to homes , and the use of civilians as human shields .
In 2005 , Israel 's Supreme Court banned the use of civilian shieids , a widespread practice during the army 's 2002 invasion of Palestinian towns in the West Bank .
Breaking the Silence , which was started five years ago by a religious soldier and has since gained the respect of many Israeli human rights groups , held a press briefing July 8 and provided copies of its 112 - page report .
M. , a combat reserve medic , was the sole soldier present and spoke to reporters about his war experience on condition of anonymity .
M. said that before going into Gaza a rabbi exhorted his unit to " shoot for the body . "
M.'s reservist unit was sent in to secure territory already under Israeli control in central Gaza , which he said had been emptied of Palestinians .
Still , in order to boost security , one of their jobs included " exposure " of buildings .
" Exposure is a nice way [ of saying ] systematic destruction of the area , " M. said .
Army spokeswoman : Anonymity undermines credibility
Maj .
Avital Leibovitch , an Israeli army spokeswoman , responded that the anonymous nature of the testimonies made them impossible to verify and therefore could not be taken seriously .
" How do you know these people are soldiers ?
I do n't know who they are , " she told reporters .
" This is not credible and this is not reliable .
And this puts under considerable doubt the intention of the organization . "
Prominent Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard , who authored an opinion piece to coincide with the report , says that it is an offense under military regulations to be interviewed without the approval of the IDF spokesperson and notes that soldiers have been put on trial for leaks to the press .
In addition , the soldiers ' testimonies could incriminate them or their friends .
In a conference call with reporters Tuesday night , Major Leibovitch insisted that the army has already conducted an investigation into various claims of misconduct and found that , with few exceptions , Israeli soldiers conducted themselves in keeping with international rules of warfare and with the army 's code of warfare .
Another 10 or so soldiers are under investigation for war - related charges .
Shortly after the war , other testimonials about misconduct in Gaza came to light when the principal of a military prep school submitted a series of soldiers ' anecdotes to the army for investigation .
Though the army opened an inquiry , it was swiftly closed on the grounds that none of the charges was based on first - person knowledge of the incidents described .
" The goal [ of Breaking the Silence ] is part of the overall aim of anti-Israel propaganda , " says Gerald Steinberg , who runs NGO Watch , which monitors political activities of Israeli nonprofits .
" It 's to delegitimize Israel 's defense against terror , and to exaggerate in an extreme way the few incidents and soldiers that might violate basic norms . "
Clear victory needed after 2006 Hezbollah defeat
What emerges from the testimony is the dissonance between soldiers ' fear of and expectations for a tough house - to - house fighting against a determined foe akin to Hezbollah , and the reality of meeting relatively little resistance .
Breaking the Silence testimonials alleged open - fire guidelines did n't take into account civilians , a noticeable switch from the army 's stricter rules of engagement in the West Bank .
Instead , the soldiers said , any civilian who remained behind in the battlefield was considered a de facto combatant .
Yehuda Shaul , a combat veteran and a founder of Breaking the Silence , said the army needed a victory against Hamas to offset the perception that it lost a month - long battle with Hezbollah 2 - 1/ 2 years earlier .
Minimizing Israeli casualties was seen as a way to give the army enough time to create an air of victory .
" The story of [ Operation ] Cast Lead [ as the Gaza offensive was called ] is the Israeli army 's adoption of a different concept .
It 's the story of : ' In order to get a victory we need minimum casualties , and to do that we wo n't put our soldiers in danger .
We prefer the mistakes to be on their body count and not ours , " said Mr. Shaul at the media briefing .
" In a way the IDF replaced the meaning of being a civilian with being a soldiers . "
Mr. Sfard , the human rights lawyer , wrote that the testimony suggested the army was guilty of failing to distinguish between combatants and civilians .
" The No. 1 principle in international laws of war is the principle of distinction , " he wrote .
" Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants . "

Two licensed premises were found to have watered down their alcoholic drinks , according to the National Consumer Agency ’s ( NCA ) consumer protection list published today .
Bowes Bar in Kiltealy , Co Wexford , under licensee Ms Belinda O’Brien , and Barrack Street Brewery Ltd , Enniscorthy , Co Wexford both sold alcoholic beverages where the percentage alcohol by volume was less than that indicated on the bottle .
In contravention of Sections 42 and 43 of the Consumer protection Act 2007 both establishments were issued with a compliance notice .
A further 13 licensed premises are under investigation to establish whether they adulterated drinks .
Alcohol samples were taken from all premises by the NCA in November 2008 after a number of consumer complaints of adulterated drinks .
A spokeswoman for the NCA said it was still awaiting test results on the samples taken from the 13 premises .
However according to the NCA ’s annual report for 2008 it is likely the agency will be taking enforcement action against a number of licensed premises .
The consumer list published today outlines 85 enforcement actions taken against 67 businesses from July 2008 to the end of June this year .
There were six prosecutions for offences of non-price display , charging prices higher than the displayed price , failure to comply with the requirements of a compliance notice , and offering a clocked car for sale .
There was one prohibition order issued to a furniture company for misleading advertising .
Of the 31 compliance notices issued , 29 related to charging prices higher than the displayed price and two were for adulteration of alcoholic drinks .
National Consumer Agency chief executive Ann Fitzgerald said : " Consumers must be provided with accurate information regarding products and not exposed to unfair or misleading commercial practices .
" It is the agency 's intention to continue to use the various tools at its disposal to ensure traders comply with their legal obligations and give consumers the rights to which they are entitled .
Of course , we will continue to work with business to help bring about compliance . "

( CNN ) -- Searchers have recovered the bodies of three people who were aboard a Yemenia Airways jet that crashed off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean , a spokesman for Yemen 's Civil Aviation department said Tuesday .
A man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France .
Capt .
Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Qadir also told reporters that a child who was reported found alive was a 5 - year - old boy .
He did not give further details of the child 's condition .
" The French said that ( Wednesday ) they will send more French units to the accident location in order to retrieve the bodies and possibly that they may be able to locate people who are still alive , " he said .
The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday , carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen 's capital , Sanaa .
Qadir said the jet took off from Sanaa shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros ' capital , Moroni .
Searchers have not located the plane 's data recorders , Qadir said , and investigators were not speculating on the cause of the crash .
" The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong , reaching 61 kilometers per hour ( 38 mph ) , " he said .
" That 's one thing .
The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport . "
But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that several years ago France banned the plane , a A310 - 300 , because of safety concerns .
" People are talking about poor weather conditions , but for the moment , we are unsure , " Bussereau said .
" It seems the plane may have attempted an approach , put on the gas , and attempted another approach , which then failed .
For the moment , we must be careful because none of this information is verified . "
Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash .
" This plane is just like any other plane , " he said .
" It can have a malfunction , but we do n't know what really happened before the investigation is over .
And then we can determine if there is a technical issue , bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash . "
It was the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month .
On June 1 , an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris , France .
All 228 aboard are presumed dead .
The cause remains under investigation .

Former pilot and aviation analyst John Cox said there were no similarities between the two incidents .
" These are two dramatically different airplanes flown by two different airlines , " Cox told CNN's " American Morning . "
" The accidents happened at two different regimes of flight .
And Airbus has hundreds of millions of hours flying safely .
I do n't believe that ... we can draw any conclusions because the manufacturer was the same in these two very different types of accidents . "
At first , Comoros officials said there were no signs of survivors among the dead bodies floating in the choppy waters .
But then rescuers found the child .
Watch as airline describes child 's rescue »
Cox said it reminded him of the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255 in Detroit , Michigan , in which only a 4 - year - old girl survived while 156 others died .
" This has come up before , and it's where the toddler was seated ( during the impact ) that allowed them to survive , " he said .
" It 's a miracle and I 'm glad ... the toddler is safe .
I 'm just saddened for the loss of everybody else , " he added .
The Yemeni crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni .
The plane tried to land , then U - turned before it crashed , Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said .
Officials did not know why the plane could not land , he said .
Airbus A310 - 300 Launched in 1983 , entered service in 1985

Flight 626 was expected to be a four - and - a - half - hour flight .
The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni , off the east coast of Africa , about 2,900 km ( 1,800 miles ) south of Yemen .
The crash occurred about 1:30 a.m. , Nadhoim said .
There was no indication of foul play behind the crash , the official in Yemen said .
Yemenia
Air had used the jet since 1999 on about 17,300 flights , Airbus officials said .
The company said it would assist in investigating the crash .
" The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families , friends and loved ones affected by the accident , " the company said in a statement .
In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1 , United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s .
One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May , and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June .
The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage , according to the National Transportation Safety Board .

Blood clots in women on the Pill are rare Many women are not taking the safest brand of the pill , say researchers .
Two separate studies in the British Medical Journal found that some oral contraceptives were linked with a higher risk of blood clot than others .
But experts stressed that blood clots are a rare side - effect of the combined pill and the risk overall is small , whichever brand is used .
Women should not stop taking it but speak to a doctor if they are worried , the Family Planning Association said .
It has been known for a long time that the combined pill , which contains both oestrogen and progestogen , was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis - a blood clot that forms in a vein .
What this says is we should stick to prescribing the well - trusted favourites but the chance of having a blood clot when on the pill are very low anyway
Dr Nick Dunn , GP
In some cases a clot can be serious and occasionally fatal , particularly if it breaks away and travels to the lungs .
The levels of oestrogen in the pill have been reduced over the years to help cut the risks .
However , this risk is far smaller than the risk of a clot during pregnancy .
In the first study done by Dutch researchers - looking at data from 1,524 women who had developed venous thrombosis - they found that overall taking the pill was associated with a five - fold increased risk of a clot .
But closer analysis showed variation .
Women taking pills containing a progestogen called levonorgestrel ( for example , Microgynon ) had the lowest risk of thrombosis at four times that of women not on the pill .
Whereas those on contraceptives containing desogestrel ( for example , Mercilon or Marvelon ) had the highest risk , at seven times that of those not taking the pill .
Women taking a pill with norgestimate ( for example , Cilest ) had an almost six - fold extra risk as did those on drospirenone ( for example , Yasmin ) .
Those taking a drug containing cyproterone acetate ( for example , Dianette , which is often prescribed for acne ) had an almost seven - fold additional risk .
Impact " Currently available oral contraceptives still have a major impact on thrombosis occurrence and many women do not use the safest brands with regard to risk of venous thrombosis , " the researchers concluded .
The second study , by Danish researchers , also found that contraceptives containing levonorgestrel were associated with a lower risk than those containing desogestrel , gestodene or drospirenone .
Dr Nick Dunn , a GP and senior lecturer at the University of Southampton said it was interesting that Yasmine , the newest type of pill , did not offer any advantage over more traditional ones .
But he added that those recommended by the researchers were probably the most commonly prescribed .
" What this says is we should stick to prescribing the well - trusted favourites but the chance of having a blood clot when on the pill are very low anyway . "
He said if a woman wanted a particular brand maybe because of personal experience he would still prescribe it .
Lynn Hearton , from the Family Planning Association ( FPA ) , said : " Although the combined pill does slightly increase the risk of thrombosis , the risk is still really low .
" If any women are worried about the pill they should not stop using it .
" They should continue taking it and seek advice from a health professional . "

Haniska
Pett 's parents said they had warned her not to take illegal drugs
A 20 - year - old Kent hairdresser died after taking cocaine contaminated with a " highly significant " amount of ecstasy , an inquest has heard .
Haniska Pett , of Gravesend , died in Darent Valley Hospital on 19 October after suffering a fit when she took the drug at a friend 's house .
Ms Pett had been taking cocaine for about two years , it was revealed at the inquest at Dartford Crown Court .
The coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure on Monday .
The inquest was told the cocaine Ms Pett took contained a large amount of MDMA , an amphetamine called MDA and a drug known as BZP .
' Sad death '
Her brother , Joe , was called to help Haniska when she became very hot and started fitting at her friend 's house .
They called an ambulance but Ms Pett later died at Darent Valley Hospital .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Haniska , who was living with her parents at the time of her death , had taken the drug for about two years without suffering an serious side effects , the inquest was told .
The pathologist said it was likely that she died from " mixed drug intoxication " .
Her death was described as " sad " by the coroner .
Her parents Angela and Ian Pett held a candle - lit vigil to alert people about the dangers of drugs following her death .
They said they had warned their daughter but regretted not doing more .
If you find yourself trapped in the middle of the woods without electricity , running water , or a car you would likely describe that situation as a “ nightmare ” or “ a worse case scenario like after plane crash or something . ”
White people refer to it as “ camping . ”
When white people begin talking to you about camping they will do their best to tell you that it ’s very easy and it allows them to escape the pressures and troubles of the urban lifestyle for a more natural , simplified , relaxing time .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
In theory camping should be a very inexpensive activity since you are literally sleeping on the ground .
But as with everything in white culture , the more simple it appears the more expensive it actually is .
Camping is a multi-day , multi-step , potentially lethal activity that will cost you a large amount of both time and money .
Unless you are in some sort of position where you absolutely need the friendship of a white person , you should avoid camping at all costs .
The first stage of camping always involves a trip to an outdoor equipment store like REI ( or in Canada , Mountain Equipment Co - Op ) .
These stores are well known for their abundance of white customers and their extensive inventory of things for white people to buy and only use once .
If you are ever tricked into going to one of these stores , you can make white people like you by saying things like “ man , this Kayak is only $ 1200 , if I use it 35 times I ’ve already saved money over renting . ”
Note : do not actually buy the kayak .
Next , white people will then take this new equipment and load it into an SUV or Subaru Outback with a Thule or Yakima Roof Rack .
Then they will drive for an extended period of time to a national park or campsite where they will pay an entrance fee and begin their journey .
It is worth noting that white people are unaware of the irony of using a gas burning car to bring them closer to nature and it is not recommended that you point this out .
It will ruin their weekend .
Once in the camp area , white people will walk around for a while , set up a tent , have a horrible night of sleep , walk around some more .
Then get in the car and go home .
This , of course , is a best case scenario .
Worst case scenarios include : getting lost , poisoned , killed by an animal , and encountering an RV .
Of these outcomes , the latter is seen by white people as the worst since it involves an encounter with the wrong kind of white people .
Conversely , any camping trip that ends in death at the hands of nature or requires the use of valuable government resources for a rescue is seen as relatively positive in white culture .
This is because both situations might eventually lead to a book deal or documentary film about the experience .
Ultimately the best way to escape a camping trip with white people is to say that you have allergies .
Since white people and their children are allergic to almost everything , they will understand and ask no further questions .
You should not say something like “ looking at history , the instances of my people encountering white people in the woods have not worked out very well for us . ”
Note : this works for all races !

Current Position : Communications Director for the Senate Minority Leader ( since 2006 )
Boss : Sen .
( R- Ky . )
Stewart , or “ Stew , ” as he likes to be called , is widely considered one of the top communications directors in the Senate .
He is a workaholic , who sends e-mails and press releases throughout the night and knows how to promote his boss ’s agenda .
Stewart joined Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ’s ( R - Ky. ) office after the 2006 elections in an attempt by McConnell , who has often shied away from the spotlight , to bolster his communications office after becoming the Republican Senate leader .
Stewart was a key part of Sen.
McConnell ’s plan to build a strategic communications center to help Republicans redefine and promote their message starting at the beginning of the 110th Congress .
Stewart ’s game is definitely media and message control , and he became one of Washington ’s best and most aggressive communication directors while working for Cornyn . [...]
Stewart has worked in McConnell ’s office since the start of 2007 .
But his job puts him in direct contact with other members of the Senate Republican leadership , including aides to Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) and Senate GOP Conference Chairman Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) .
In particular , Stewart has strong Texas connections .
Before working for McConnell , he spent three years as communications director for Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) and three years in the press office of Sen. Phil Gramm ( R - Texas ) .
In McConnell ’s office , Stewart has worked alongside Chief of Staff Kyle Simmons , Simmons ’ deputy Sharon Soderstrom and Press Secretary Jennifer Morris .
I ’ll admit , Super Macro Your Cell Phone Camera With A DVD Lens is one weird title .
However , if you just moved to a blu ray DVD player and you ’re looking for some good use for your old DVD , cnflikt ( who also took the shots for this tutorial ) came up with a hack to enable you to take super macro shots with your cellphone .
Of course you ’ll need a camera phone for that .
cnflikt uses the notorious , yet old - skooled K800i , but any camera phone will work here .
1. Lensectomy Your old DVD Player
First thing is to get a lens for your camera phone .
Make sure your old DVD player is not connected to power .
Then take the screws off .
This is a great way to void your warranty .
It is also dangerous and you should really never do this .
Anyhow , if you went against my advice , you ’ll find the lens under the place where the disk goes .
Take it out .
2. Prepare A Lens Mount
Ok , I ’m only kidding on this one .
You do n’t really need a lens mount , you can use duct tape if you wanna go really ghetto or mount it on some cardboard .
If you opt for the cardboard option , just make a round hole in the cardboard .
3. Mount Your Lens
Just use some duct tape ( as indicated before ) to mount your lens directly , use or blue Tack to hold the card mount .
4. Macro Away
WOW .
This is some powerful macro .
Enjoy .
“ I do n’t think anybody in America wants people to starve to death , ” Mr. Reese said .
“ But if you want to help somebody , people can go to McDonald ’s or Kentucky Fried Chicken and give them a meal . ”
He said that the police would ignore “ isolated cases ” of violating the ordinance , and predicted that the law would ultimately help the homeless because they would be forced to seek meals at soup kitchens run by social service organizations that could provide other assistance as well .
But Maria Foscarinis , director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington , said the prohibition would do more harm than good .
“ Nobody wants the poor and homeless living in public spaces , ’’ Ms. Foscarinis said , “ but this kind of response is terribly misguided . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada , which opposed the ordinance , said it was preparing a legal challenge .
The group ’s general counsel , Allen Lichtenstein , called the measure absurd and said it was an unconstitutional infringement on free assembly and other rights .
Mr. Lichtenstein accused Mayor Oscar B. Goodman , who supports the new restriction , of waging a campaign against homeless people , whom the mayor has openly criticized .
At a June meeting of the City Council , Mr. Goodman suggested that panhandlers with signs asking for food be sued for “ false advertising ” because soup kitchens provide free meals .
“ Some people say I ’m the mean mayor , ’’ Mr. Goodman acknowledged , but he defended the ordinance as part of the effort to steer the homeless to social service groups , and said the city was taking part in a regional initiative to end homelessness in 10 years .
The ordinance , an amendment to an existing parks statute approved by the Council on July 19 , bans the “ the providing of food or meals to the indigent for free or for a nominal fee . ”
It goes on to say that “ an indigent person is a person whom a reasonable ordinary person would believe to be entitled to apply for or receive ” public assistance .
Image Recipients of Ms. Saccos handouts say that they are far from shelters and that they get little public assistance .
Credit ... Monica Almedia / The New York Times
Violating the ordinance is a misdemeanor , and can be punished by a fine of up to $ 1,000 or a jail term of up to six months , or both .
Diana Paul , a spokeswoman for the city , said the police would begin enforcing it after briefings from city lawyers .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Tesla
Motors turned profitable for the first time in July , when the electric car manufacturer shipped a record 109 vehicles , the company said Friday .
A surge in sales and reduced manufacturing costs of Tesla 's Roadster 2 sports car helped boost the company to $ 1 million in earnings and $ 20 million in revenue .
" There is strong demand for a car that is unique in offering high performance with a clean conscience , " said Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk , in a prepared statement .
" Customers know that in buying the Roadster they are helping fund development of our mass market electric cars . "
The Roadster has a range of about 244 miles per charge -- the first production electric vehicle to cross the 200 - mile mark , according to the press release .
The Roadster is the only highway - capable electric vehicle for sale in North America or Europe , and the company says it is faster than a Porsche and twice as energy - efficient as a Toyota Prius .
In June , privately owned Tesla borrowed $ 465 million from the Department of Energy to fund development of an all - electric sedan called the Model S -- slated to sell for $ 49,900 , or about half the price of the Roadster .
Tesla has also partnered with Daimler to develop an electric version of mini vehicles called Smart cars .
The company said it plans to launch a test fleet of 1,000 electric Smart cars in late 2009 .

Pictures of models , some of whom were partially - clothed , were taken inside and outside St Michael Penkivel Church near Truro .
Cornwall - based photographer Andy Craddock is the subject of legal action by the priest in charge for blasphemy .
However , Mr Craddock , 43 , of St Austell , described the pictures as " art " and said they were not offensive .
By anyone 's reasonable standards of decency this is beyond the pale
Jeremy Downing , Diocese of Truro Mr Craddock , who moved to Cornwall from London in 2008 , said he used the 13th Century church for the shoot because he had seen it in the comedy movie Keeping Mum .
He said he admired the architecture and wanted the pictures to add to his portfolio of fetishist and erotic photography .
He told BBC News : " I can understand why some people would find them offensive and inappropriate .
" But the general feedback has been very positive .
" I never wanted to offend .
This is done as art and shows the beauty of women . "
The solicitor 's letter describes blasphemy as the " publication of contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God , Jesus Christ , the Bible or the formularies of the Church of England " .
" Our clients believe that a number of these photographs constitute blasphemous material , " it adds .
Andrew Yates , the priest in charge of St Michael Penkivel , said in a statement : " No permission was ever sought by or given to Mr Craddock by the priest - in - charge or by the churchwardens for these photographs .
" I am deeply shocked that Mr Craddock could consider taking action that will inevitably cause great offence . "
' Entirely improper '
He said it had cause upset to " those who have connections to the church through being married at St Michael 's or through loved ones who are buried in the churchyard " .
Jeremy Dowling , a spokesman for the Diocese of Truro , which is supporting the legal action , said the church was used without permission .
" The Church deplores the use of sacred space in this way , " he said .
" Whether he 's gone in there legally or illegally he is using the setting for an entirely improper purpose .
" By anyone 's reasonable standards of decency this is beyond the pale . "

Having to peddle " government lies " about the safety of soldiers in Iraq led to a Ministry of Defence press officer suffering post - traumatic stress disorder , an employment tribunal will hear .
John Salisbury - Baker will claim that he suffered " intolerable stress " through having to " defend the morally indefensible " when responding to media inquiries about the ability of army vehicles such as the " Snatch " Land Rover to protect soldiers .
Mr Salisbury - Baker , 62 , says he found it impossible to support the official line on deaths and injuries after seeing the suffering of soldiers ' families .
After 11 years of service at Imphal Barracks near York , he could no longer keep working and is taking legal action against the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .

The case takes place amid accusations over the government 's attempts to claw back compensation from two injured soldiers , as well as a rising toll of casualties from improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan .
Mr Salisbury - Baker 's partner , Christine Brook , said : " John is an honest , sensitive and moral person , and having to peddle government lies that soldiers in vehicles such as the Snatch Land Rovers were safe from roadside bombs made him stressed .
" He was particularly plagued by the thought that some of the bereaved families he was visiting might have previously believed their loved ones were safe , because of what he himself had said to the media .
" He felt responsible .
He has been diagnosed as suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder by his doctor and is pursuing a claim for disability discrimination , on the grounds that the stress of what he was being asked to do effectively made him disabled . "
Mr Salisbury - Baker will say that about 30 per cent of soldiers killed in Iraq came from the area in which he was working .
Ms Brook said his job " was to visit families just hours after an officer had called to tell them the news that their loved ones were dead . "
He provided a " media shield " to help them deal with the press interest .
" He helped more than a dozen families through this traumatic time , whereas I believe the officers deployed to give the bad news to families only had this duty once , with the role passed on to someone else the next time , " she said .
" He sometimes attended funerals at the same church on more than one occasion . "
Ms Brook claimed that the MoD had failed to give her partner training on how to cope with the stress of dealing with the bereaved and this had contributed to his illness .
An MoD spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment when tribunal proceedings were pending . "
oh wow eww how did u get a close up on it without it running away ... its an awesome picture good job
PORTSMOUTH — Police said a man arrested at the scene of President Barack Obama 's visit to the city Tuesday was found to be in possession of an unlicensed loaded gun .
PORTSMOUTH — Police said a man arrested at the scene of President Barack Obama 's visit to the city Tuesday was found to be in possession of an unlicensed loaded gun .
Richard Terry Young , 62 , of 821 Ocean Blvd. in Hampton , was arrested around 9:40 a.m. , hours before Obama 's arrival , and charged with the misdemeanor crimes of criminal trespass and carrying a loaded pistol without a license .
Young was found inside Portsmouth High School , where Obama later in the day held his town hall - style forum .
Young was detained by the Secret Service and subsequently arrested by Portsmouth Lt. Corey MacDonald .
Young was carrying a pocket knife , police said .
A subsequent search of his vehicle , parked on school property , revealed a loaded hand gun , police said .
Police said Young is being investigated by the Secret Service for possible federal crimes resulting from the same series of events .
Bail was not immediately set , and Young was in the custody of Portsmouth police on Tuesday night .
Police ask anyone with information regarding the incident to contact Detective Lt. Corey MacDonald at 610-7548 , or remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 431-1199 or ( 207 ) 439-1199 or online at www.seacoastcrimestoppers.org.
The idea of a fluid lens whose focal plane can be mechanically adjusted goes back at least to an 1866 patent awarded D. A. Woodward , a Baltimore inventor .
Since then there have been a variety of attempts to commercialize the technology , but none have met all the criteria for success .
The lens must be thin , light , durable and easily adjustable .
Several years ago Dr. Kurtin had his epiphany .
A magnetically attached removable front lens would make for a compact and durable system .
Others have done research on approaches that do not involve a fluid , like systems of lenses and electro - optical technologies .
In 1964 , for example , Luis W. Alvarez , who in 1968 won the Nobel Prize in physics , designed a two - part lens that changed focus by sliding two glass components of opposing “ saddle - back ” shapes across each other .
Several international efforts are under way to adapt both fluid lenses and the Alvarez approach to the 1.3 billion people at the bottom of the economic pyramid that the World Health Organization estimates as having no access to eyeglasses .
Both the Center for Vision in the Developing World in Oxford , England , and U - Specs in Amsterdam are working on glasses that can be distributed at a fraction of the price that glasses cost in the developed world .
The TruFocals eyeglasses , which sell for $ 895 , are the first to become commercially available in the United States .
The glasses consist of a lens that is comparable in thickness to that of commercial eyeglasses , but which has three components : a back glass , a fluid - filled inner membrane that is essentially a piece of plastic - wrap - like material stretched across a ring whose surface curvature can be altered mechanically , and an outer prescription lens attached with magnets to the eyeglass frame .
To change the focus , the user moves the slider on the bridge .
The TruFocals lens must be round to ensure that the curvature of the interior lens is correct , but the company ’s founders do not think the shape is a fashion obstacle .
TruFocals come in a unisex frame with a variety of colors .
Even if TruFocals are not accepted as eyewear for all uses , they may find a market for a diverse set of wearers , like office workers who work at computer screens but who must also read books , magazines and newspapers , or people who have medical conditions that cause their vision to change .
“ This is not going to break open the whole market , but they do n’t need to break open the whole market , ” said Eli Peli , a professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and an investor in TruFocals .
For the moment TruFocals has the market to itself , but it may have competition next year .
PixelOptics , based in Roanoke , Va. , is pursuing an electro - optical approach , which will use a technology that is similar to an LCD display to change the refractive index of a transparent component that the company will embed in conventional lenses .
Did Twitter , Facebook , LiveJournal , YouTube , Google Sites and Google 's Blogger all get attacked yesterday to silence one man ?
According to the testimony of a Facebook executive , they did .
A blogger in the Republic of Georgia with the username Cyxymu was the victim , according to Facebook 's chief security officer Max Kelly .
The claims cement earlier reports that social networking sites have been dragged into the Georgia - Russia crisis , leading to the first simultaneous attack on the largest social media sites .
Kelly told CNet : :
" It was a simultaneous attack across a number of properties targeting him to keep his voice from being heard .
We 're actively investigating the source of the attacks and we hope to be able to find out the individuals involved in the back end and to take action against them if we can . "
Google is quoted as saying :
" We are aware that a handful of non-Google sites were impacted by a DOS attack this morning , and are in contact with some affected companies to help investigate this attack .
Google systems prevented substantive impact to our services . "
As part of the attack , spam was sent to LiveJournal users that appeared to come from cyxymu .
Political Motives
The claims back up earlier reports in the New York Times that Thursday 's attack was sparked by the conflict between Russia and Georgia .
The aim was to take down Cyxymu 's accounts , particularly the LiveJournal blog where he posted about the crisis .
While Google 's sites held up to the barrage , Twitter and LiveJournal proved less robust .
While DDoS attacks are notoriously hard to defend against , it 's clear that Twitter was far less equipped to cope with such an attack : no doubt they 'll be taking a closer look at how such issues could be handled in the future .

John Alva Keel , 79 , a friend , Fortean , fierce fighter for his theories , professionally a writer and journalist , has died .
A fellow admirer of Mothman and the anomalies all around us , such as the “ name game , ” is gone .
Keel , who lived most of his life in New York City , passed away on Friday , July 3 , 2009 , at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City , after some months in a nursing home near his Upper West Side apartment .
In 1994 , John A . Keel made a rare appearance at a birthday celebration held in his honor among a few of his closest friends .
Pictured are J. Antonio Huneeus , Keel , and Loren Coleman .
Photo by Patrick Huyghe .
Born Alva John Kiehle in upstate New York on March 25 , 1930 , John Keel began writing at a young age .
Indeed , Keel ’s first published story was in a magician ’s magazine at the age of 12 .
Keel would go on to become a scriptwriter for radio and television , and a stringer for newspapers .
He later moved to Greenwich Village and wrote for various men’s and speciality magazines .
Keel ’s first published book was Jadoo in 1957 , which was quickly serialized in a men ’s adventure magazine .
The paperback is his account of his journey of discovery to India to investigate the alleged activities of fakirs and holy men who perform the Indian rope trick and who survive being buried alive .
In Jadoo , Keel also told of tracking a Yeti , an Abominable Snowman , in the jungles of Asia .
John A. Keel ’s non-fiction look at the very real unplanned twists in life were recorded in his 1966 novel , The Fickle Finger of Fate .
It is a rare book , and few realize that Keel wrote this book .
Keel was an early admirer of Charles Fort ( 1874 -1932 ) , and while still doing the mainstream writing , began authoring articles for England ’s Flying Saucer Review ( FSR ) and a long series of columns for Saga .
Further influenced by Fortean Ivan T. Sanderson and ufologist Aimé Michel , in early 1966 , John Keel commenced a full - time investigation of monster , aerial and paranormal phenomena .
Over a four - year period , Keel interviewed thousands of people in over twenty U.S. states , especially in the Ohio River Valley of the United States .
More than 2,000 books were reviewed in the course of his investigation , in addition to thousands of magazines , newsletters , and newspapers .
Keel also subscribed to several newspaper - clipping services , which often generated up to 150 clippings for a single day during the 1966 and 1967 UFO “ wave . ”
Besides FSR , Keel wrote for several magazines including Saga with one 1967 article “ UFO Agents of Terror ” referring to the Men in Black .
He also wrote one of the first articles on Mothman in FSR , during this same time period .
Like other contemporary 1960s researchers such as J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallée , Keel was initially hopeful that he could somehow validate the prevailing nuts - and - bolts , extraterrestrial visitation hypothesis for UFOs .
However , a year into his investigations , Keel realized that the extraterrestrial hypothesis was untenable and did not explain , for him , based within his personality and belief systems , all the answers .
Keel ’s insights also included his view of cryptozoology .
I grew to know Keel after being introduced to him through mutual friends Brad Steiger and Ivan Sanderson .
I worked closely with Keel on contributing as yet - unpublished material of mine for his book , Strange Creatures from Time and Space ( 1970 ) , which would influence my and Jerome Clark ’s first two books The Unidentified ( 1975 ) and Creatures from the Outer Edge ( 1978 ) .
Keel ’s impact is far - reaching .
Keel ’s book , Strange Creatures from Time and Space was the inspiration for Craig Woolheater ’s interest in Bigfoot and eventually would stimulate the creation of Cryptomundo .
Love him or hate him , John Keel was popular and one of the most widely read and influential Fortean authors of the late 20th century .
Although his own thoughts about aerial , monster , and associated anomalous phenomena gradually evolved during the 1960s , Keel remained one of ufology ’s most original and controversial researchers .
It was Keel ’s second book , UFOs : Operation Trojan Horse ( 1970 ) , that alerted the general public that many aspects of contemporary UFO reports , including humanoid encounters , often paralleled certain ancient folklore and religious encounters .
Keel also argued that there is a direct relationship between UFOs and elemental phenomena .
Keel informed me often that he did not consider himself a “ ufologist , ” but a “ demonologist . ”
“ Ufology is just another name for demonology , ” John Keel told me , a week before the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center , which occurred just a couple of miles from where he lives .
… as noted in Mothman and Other Curious Encounters , page 114 , ( NY : Paraview , 2002 ) .
As Keel himself wrote , “ I abandoned the extraterrestrial hypothesis in 1967 when my own field investigations disclosed an astonishing overlap between psychic phenomena and UFOs …
The objects and apparitions do not necessarily originate on another planet and may not even exist as permanent constructions of matter .
It is more likely that we see what we want to see and interpret such visions according to our contemporary beliefs . ”
In UFOs : Operation Trojan Horse ( 1970 ) , Keel argued that a non-human or spiritual intelligence source has staged whole events over a long period of time in order to propagate and reinforce certain erroneous belief systems ( mirroring Vallée ) .
Keel conjectured that ultimately all anomalies , such as fairies , 1897 mystery airships , 1930s phantom aeroplanes , mystery helicopters , creatures , poltergeists , balls of light , and UFOs , are a cover for the real phenomenon .
It was during this time period that Keel maintained an enormous and active correspondence with other researchers around the world .
For example , I , Loren Coleman , was introduced to my now long - time friend Jerry Clark by John Keel , via letters .
These exchanges between Keel and his fellow writers and researchers , even as intellectual disagreements and different paths took many of us on varied journeys , cemented 40 years of solid friendships among a small group of dedicated Fortean writers .
In Our Haunted Planet ( 1971 ) , Keel coined the term “ ultraterrestrials ” to describe the UFO occupants .
He discussed the seldom - considered possibility that the alien “ visitors ” to Earth are not visitors at all , but an advanced Earth civilization , which may or may not be human .
Keel took no position on the ultimate purpose of the phenomenon other than that the UFO intelligence seems to have a long - standing interest in interacting with the human race .
UFO historian Jerome Clark wrote that Keel was “ a radical theorist who believes that UFOs are ‘ ultraterrestrial ’ rather than extraterrrestrial .
By that he means they are shape - changing phenomena from another order of existence .
These ultraterrestials are basically hostile to , or at least contemptuous of , human beings and manipulate them in various wasy for example by staging ‘ miracles ’ which inspire unfounded religious beliefs .
Ultraterrestrials and their minions may manifest as monsters , space people , ghosts and other paranormal entities . ”
( The UFO Encyclopedia , Volume 1 : UFOs in the 1980s , page 148 , NY : Agogee , 1990 ) .
After years of writing parts of the story in various articles and other books , in 1975 , Keel published The Mothman Prophecies , an account of his 1966 - 1967 investigation of sightings of the Mothman , a “ winged weirdie ” reported in and around Point Pleasant , West Virginia .
Keel corresponded with Ivan T. Sanderson , quietly for months , trying to determine what kind of bird might be involved with the sightings .
It was later , as Keel more fully revealed the tale of the sightings and concurrent phenomena , that other elements came into the mix .
The book was contemporarily adapted into a 2002 movie directed by Mark Pellington , starring Richard Gere , Debra Messing , Laura Linney and Alan Bates .
Two parts of Keel ’s personality were played by Gere and Bates .
Bates ’s character was “ Leek , ” which was “ Keel ” spelled backwards , and Gere ’s character was a newspaperman , “ John Klein , ” also a play on Keel ’s name .
Because Keel was ill at the time , Sony / Screen Gems cut back Keel ’s schedule of public appearances to only a few televised ones .
I assisted Keel by becoming the movie ’s publicity spokesperson on 400 radio shows , and appeared with Keel in the David Grabias documentary Search For The Mothman , which is in the Deluxe DVD of The Mothman Prophecies .
Keel often played , with tongue - in - cheek , on the Men - In - Black interest swirling around his work .
At the time of the release of the movie , a rumor circulated that Keel had died .
On January 14 , 2002 , a story rapidly made the rounds via the web that John A. Keel had just died .
John A. Keel , in 2002 .
I quickly put the rumor to rest by calling Keel , and confirming that Keel was , indeed , still alive , although Keel quipped that everyone should be told , “ his funeral is on Saturday and he will be wearing black . ”
Keel told me that this happened to him at least once before , in 1967 .
In recent years , Keel ’s appearances would be few and far between .
But his sense of humor never left him , including wearing an all white suit to the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant , West Virginia for the unveiling of the new Mothman replica .
Keel suffered a heart attack sometime before October 13 , 2006 .
He admitted himself to New York City ’s Lenox Hill Hospital on Friday the 13th of October , and underwent successful heart surgery on October 16 , 2006 .
Keel then was moved from the hospital to a rehabilitation center on October 26 , 2006 , as his close New York friend Doug Skinner told me soon afterward .
Skinner became invaluable in assisting Keel , and passing along messages to and from Keel ’s old friends .
Keel ’s impact cannot be underestimated , especially in terms of his analysis of patterns .
His work on “ windows ” ( specific hotspots of combined phenomenal appearances ) , “ waves ” ( cyclic appearances of the phenomena ) , and the “ Wednesday phenomenon ” ( the theory that a disproportionate number of UFO events occur on that day of the week ) are deeply influential across time and space .
Generations of readers of Fortean literature often do not even realize that Keel ’s writings may be behind “ name game ” discussions or authors ’ speculations on the fact that a certain location on a ridge might have a high rate of strange events occurring there after the 21st of the month on a Wednesday in a high - frequency month such as April .
Keel was there first trying to look at such patterns .
The popular cultural influence of Keel has been enormous .
It shall take future academic studies to fully realize his reach among the subculture that respects and are denizens of his ongoing intellectual playground .
On July 6 , 2009 , as word swept through the Internet , from Phyllis Benjamin at INFO and others , that Keel had passed away last Friday , tributes and sorrow were shared online in overwhelming fashion from his followers , fans , and friends .
John A. Keel will be missed .

Founded in Geneva , Switzerland in 1863 , the International Committee of the Red Cross is an " impartial , neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance . "
It also tries " to prevent suffering by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles . "
It 's legally mandatd to do it under the 1949 Geneva Conventions and has had a permanent presence in Gaza since 1968 .
Currently 109 ICRC staff work there , including 19 expatriates .
They remained throughout Operation Cast Lead and witnessed firsthand the carnage and destruction that took place .
Cooperatively with the Palestine Red Crescent Society ( PRCS ) , they evacuated hundreds of people , some severely wounded in the conflict .
As able , they also repaired power and water supply lines and provided hospitals with vital medicines and supplies .
In addition , ICRC surgeons performed operations in Gaza 's Shifa Hospital working alongside Palestinian doctors .
Post - conflict , ICRC and PRCS collected information on Israeli violations of international humanitarian laws .
They also distributed vital items , including plastic sheeting , cooking sets , mattresses , blankets , hygiene kits , and more to over 72,000 Gazans whose homes were partially or totally destroyed .
ICRC is currently providing eight hospitals with medicines , other medical supplies , equipment , spare parts , and is helping with needed repairs .
It 's also fitting amputees with artificial limbs and offering needed physiotherapy .
It 's helping to upgrade water and sanitation services to keep Gaza 's water network running as best it can .
It 's aiding farmers and others with land rehabilitation , compost production , and " cash - for - work . "
It promotes international humanitarian law and calls on all sides to observe it .
In June 2009 , it issued a report titled , " Gaza : 1.5 million people trapped in despair " that described the Territory as " look ( ing ) like the epicentre of a massive earthquake " in the wake of Operation Cast Lead and went on to detail how severely .
No Reconstruction Allowed - Public Health at Risk
Despite billions pledged for reconstruction , practically none of it has come because of Israel 's tight embargo on virtually everything needed .
As a result , thousands of displaced and destitute families live in cramped quarters with relatives or in tents as their only other alternative .
Some emergency repairs were carried out , but " only to the already unsatisfactory level prevailing before December 2008 . "
Overall , the infrastructure is inadequate , overloaded , and subject to breakdown .
Although chlorine is available to disinfect water , sewage and other waste matter seepage remains a major threat to public health .
Each day , 69 million liters of partially or untreated effluent are pumped into the Mediterranean for lack of an ability to handle it .
Poor Access to Health Care
Gaza 's health care system is in disrepair and can't adequately treat patients with serious illnesses .
In addition , with the Territory under siege and a strict embargo imposed , most people can't leave to seek care elsewhere .
Those allowed out endure a bureaucratic nightmare and wait months before permission is granted .
For some , it 's too late and for others their condition has worsened .
Twenty - six year old Do'aa is typical .
She has pancreatic cancer , needs surgery , yet explains her despair .
" At first , there was hope that I would be given an operation , but as time went by I stopped hoping .
I am in pain and I know all too well that my disease is life threatening . "
She 's waited six months for permission , so far not granted .
Reaching Jordan is no easy task .
It requires passing through Erez crossing into Israel and doing it is arduous .
ICRC describes the process :
" Patients on life - support machines have to be removed from ambulances and placed on stretchers , then carried 60 - 80 metres through the crossing to ambulances waiting on the other side .
Patients who can walk unassisted may face extensive questioning before they are allowed through the crossing for medical treatment - or , as sometimes happens , before they are refused entry into Israel and turned back . "
As for treatment in Gaza , everything needed falls short .
What 's available comes from the Palestinian Authority 's ( PA ) Ministry of Health in the West Bank , but the supply chain is unreliable given obstacles that Israel imposes and tensions between Fatah and Hamas .
Getting imports is more complicated still because of embargo restrictions of even the most basic items like painkillers and X - ray film developers .
Patients go wanting as a result , a serious problem for the most ill .
For those needing prosthetic appliances as well because getting them is a lengthy , arduous process .
Fourteen - year old Gassan lost his older brother and both his legs .
He loves football , but doctors told him he'd walk again .
Six months later , he 's still waiting for both of his limbs to be fitted .
A Strangled Economy
The combination of siege and Operation Cast Lead devastated Gaza 's already fragile economy .
On May 1 , the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce reported that unemployment reached 65 % , poverty hit 80 % , and the longer isolation continues the higher these figures will go .
Currently , about 96 % of Gaza 's industrial operations are shuttered , and over 80 % of its residents depend on humanitarian aid and supplies from the World Food Program , UNRWA , and what comes in through tunnels from Egypt to survive .
A May 2008 ICRC household survey showed that over 70 % of Gazans had personal incomes of $ 1 dollar a day excluding whatever humanitarian assistance they received .
On average , Territory workers have to support six to seven other immediate family members and several others in their extended family .
Cutting household expenses is essential , even at the cost of a healthy balanced diet , no longer affordable for most .
So cheap alternatives substitute for fruits , vegetables , meat and fish .
Vitamin and mineral deficiencies result .
Children , the elderly and sick are especially impacted .
For youths it means stunted bone growth , improper teeth development , and a reduced capacity to learn .
It makes everyone infection and illness - prone by lowering their resistance and destroying their overall state of well - being .
Most of the poor " have exhausted their coping mechanisms . "
Their savings are gone , and they 've sold personal belongings , including jewelry , furniture , farm animals , land , fishing boats , cars and other possessions - anything to raise cash .
They 've cut back on food and other essentials as much as possible .
Still their situation is grave .
Israel is slowly sucking life out of 1.5 million people with no opposition stepping up to stop it .
Farming in the Danger Zone
Farm families comprise over one - fourth of Gaza 's population , and they , too , been badly hit .
" Exports of strawberries , cherry tomatoes and cut flowers used to be " important cash crops .
No longer as they 've been virtually halted .
Farmers lost half their income and struggle to sell what they can internally at far lower prices than obtainable from exports to Israel or Europe .
Operation Cast Lead destroyed thousands of citrus , olive and palm groves as well as irrigation systems , wells and greenhouses .
In addition , many farmers lack fertilizers and many seedling types .
They also lost access to around 30 % of their land , the portion inside a " no - go " buffer zone straddling Israel and Gaza .
It extends up to a kilometer inside an Israeli - erected fence on which farmers risk being shot if they work there .
Under these conditions , productive agriculture is severely curtailed and in some places not possible .
Fishermen has been just as hard hit by Israel 's coastal restrictions extending up to six nautical miles offshore .
Reduced catches have resulted as bigger fish and sardines , comprising 70 % of earlier harvests , are found in deeper waters .
Trapped
ICRC states :
" People in Gaza are trapped .
Because Israel has shut the crossing points , Gazans have scant opportunity for contact with relatives abroad or for further education or professional training . "
Palestinian staff members of international organizations , including ICRC , are also impacted .
The emotional fallout especially affects families whose relatives are imprisoned inside Israel .
In June 2007 , Israel stopped ICRC - supported visits of about 900 families and prevented spouses and children from staying close to their loved ones .
Students , professors , teachers , and health professionals also get no exit permission for education , training , seminars , and other skills and expertise - building methods .
Ibrahim Abu Sobeih is a 24 - year - old Gaza student .
Pennsylvania 's Clarion University awarded him a scholarship , but he can't attend .
In frustration , he said :
" Being stuck here gives me a sombre view of the future .
I would like to be educated and to make something of myself .
I want to be able to help my family financially .

Get Colum McCann 's New Novel " Let the Great World Spin " for Free from Oprah
For the next two days , Oprah will be giving away the ebook version of Colum McCann 's new novel " Let the Great World Spin " on her website .
This is not the work of any bullshit - slinging pastel - focus hack writer either : this is a hyped - up new literary work by one of New York 's hardest - working expat novelists .
You have to register on Oprah 's website to download the book , but registration is quick and free .
This is like Oprah slipping forty dollars into your pocket .
Just take it and mumble " thanks . "
McCann 's new novel is a modern realist pastiche , centered around Philippe Petit , the mad French acrobat who walked across a tightrope between the twin towers in 1974 .
" Why did you do it ? " " There is no why .
" Goddamn right .*** Here 's an official synopsis from Random Haus :
" In the dawning light of a late - summer morning , the people of lower Manhattan stand hushed , staring up in disbelief at the Twin Towers .
It is August 1974 , and a mysterious tightrope walker is running , dancing , leaping between the towers , suspended a quarter mile above the ground .
In the streets below , a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary in bestselling novelist Colum McCann 's stunningly intricate portrait of a city and its people .
" Let the Great World Spin is the critically acclaimed author 's most ambitious novel yet : a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain , loveliness , mystery , and promise of New York City in the 1970s .
" Corrigan , a radical young Irish monk , struggles with his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx .
A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died in Vietnam , only to discover just how much divides them even in grief .
A young artist finds herself at the scene of a hit - and - run that sends her own life careening sideways .
Tillie , a thirty - eight - year - old grandmother , turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter , determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth .
" Elegantly weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives , McCann 's powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city 's people , unexpectedly drawn together by hope , beauty , and the " artistic crime of the century . "
A sweeping and radical social novel , Let the Great World Spin captures the spirit of America in a time of transition , extraordinary promise , and , in hindsight , heartbreaking innocence .
Hailed as a " fiercely original talent " ( San Francisco Chronicle ) , award - winning novelist McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense of what the novel can achieve , confront , and even heal . " ***" The artistic crime of the century , " free of charge for the next 48 hours .
I am " MiracleJo " in Oprah 's marketing database now .
Which is fine , I guess .

Less Is a Lot More , At Least When It Comes to Things to Appreciate Can we truly appreciate how wondrous our lives are ?
I was contemplating that last night as I drove home in my zippy red Hyundai , my Ipod blasting vintage Prince , fresh from enjoying a sumptuous dinner , watching the clouds turn a glorious pink as the sun set over New Mexico .
You 've probably experienced some variation of this recently .
There is not a religion or spiritual practice or Stuart Smalley desk calendar that does n't tell us we should express appreciation for everything we 're blessed with , whether it looks like we 're blessed or not .
With the exception of the sunset , we 've experienced something that 99 percent of the beings who have ever lived on this planet would never know .
But who 's missed out , us or them ?
I think it 's us .
We 've made true appreciation nearly impossible , at least in this country , in this time .
There was a PBS show a couple years back , " Frontier House , " that popped three modern families in the ol ' Wayback Machine and transported them to 1880s Montana .
As the cameras rolled , they built houses from trees they cut , made hay , raised livestock , hauled water , grew vegetables and wore uncomfortable clothes made from corn stalks .
( I made that last one up . )
Tensions ran high , in families and between families .
Food supplies ran low .
Wild animals threatened them .
Then there was the woman who cried about not having make - up .
Seriously .
By the end of the show , it was determined that one of the families would not have survived the winter ( most likely due to the great Make - up Famine of 1883 ) .
A second one had a chance .
The third would probably have made it .
It was good drama , as good as you can get on a fake reality show .
An experience like that might benefit some of us .
Instead of forcing everyone to buy health insurance , maybe the government ought to force us to re-live that show for a season or two .
I mean the best survival story some of us have is about living on ramen noodles and Pabst Blue Ribbon in college .
But let 's take it a step further .
How about we pretend we 're a tribe of hunter - gatherers ?
We 've got to traverse the steppes of central Asia and hunt down a mastodon with rocks and spears while we survive on ant dung .
Assuming you were n't gored , and the 15 of you dragged the bastard back to camp , skinned it , carved it up and put it on a spit -- over a fire it took three hours to get going , not counting hunting for wood -- would n't that meat taste great ?
The best tasting meat you 've ever had , right ?
Until next week , or next month , or whenever the next mastodon or the next squirrel , wandered by .
In the meantime , you might pray to the mastodon god or sacrifice a virgin or two .
That 's how much you 'd appreciate it .
I can't say I 've ever gone wanting , but I do recall a good lesson in appreciation .
A few years ago , I was invited to participate in a Native American sweat lodge ceremony .
Inside the structure , it soon became heatstroke hot , especially for a novice like me .
I remember one of the other participants asking if anyone ever died during one of the ceremonies , and the leader replying matter - of - factly that he 'd witnessed participants die , more than once .
As I sat there braising , I remember curling my fingers beneath the edge of the enclosure , just to feel the winter air outside and know that if I could keep my fingers cool , I might just survive .
About an hour or two into the ceremony , we each drank a few sips of water from a ladle passed around in the dark .
Still the best water I have ever tasted .
By the time we exited the sweat lodge , the temperature had dropped to below freezing and it was dark and snowing outside .
I crawled out , sweaty , clad only in my underwear , hands and knees sinking into deep mud , dazed and nearly blind ( without my glasses , I can't see shit . )
It was the most primordial feeling I 've ever experienced .
I stood up , unsteady .
I could not find my glasses or my clothes and I could feel the cold air , which for a few moments felt heavenly , begin to freeze the sweat on my back .
Someone managed to locate my glasses , or I would have known not only the spelling of hypothermia , but the actual meaning of it .
I dressed quickly and joined the rest of my fellow lodge - dwellers in a warm house , with wall - to - wall food .
But the feast was beside the point .
After the sweat , I would have eaten bark beetles with ketchup and liked it .
In a time when a life and death decisions revolve around what kind of Chardonnay to bring to the housewarming , things just do n't seem as precious , or miraculous , as they really are .
Nowadays it takes a death , or at least a near - death experience to register on our Richter scale of appreciation , and even that appreciation tends to fade with time .
Which begs the question , if we can't appreciate the simple gifts of daily life , can we ever really appreciate ourselves in a spiritual sense ?
For many of us , that is the crucial question .
If you are in the process of awakening you know that appreciation is a key .
If you further accept the Busting Loose proposition that we manifest our own reality from consciousness , and that we are infinitely abundant , powerful and loving beings , then there is a lot to appreciate -- both the amazing illusions we 've created and the Truth about ourselves .
It seems pretty simple .
But it also seems the bigger the miracle , the more we take it for granted .
I 'm thinking maybe the key to appreciation is in Robert Scheinfeld 's statement that Phase 2 is about feeling and experience .
No need to jump the Grand Canyon on a Harley .
But do something simple .
Men , next time you 're in the meat department of your grocery store selecting steaks for dinner , take a moment and imagine you 're picking up a slice of filet mastodon .
Go back about 10,000 years and remember just what a thrill it was to kill that sucker , and just how good that meat tasted .
Ladies , next time you 're in the cosmetics department holding some Estee Lauder Turbo Lash Motion Mascara , think back to the old days and imagine how long it took to gather the plants to make the dyes to allow you to paint blue and red spots on your face for the solstice celebration .
It 's a first step .

Brad ,
Thanks for your efforts !
Would be good at some point to assemble what to take from this hearing in terms of questions we can ask our congressmen when we go to the town halls that will likely be " over - atttended " by the righties as well .
Perhaps if we have a good list of questions here many can take with them , we can elevate the visibility of this case and what she 's been able to and not been able to say in it to both our congressmen , and any others attending and covering those town halls .

Yeah , will Holder do an Ashcroft , and try to retoractively gag all of this later ?
Message to Holder .
Technology is far more advanced today than it was then , and info will travel a lot farther and faster .
Hopefully that videotape will gather wings before any such attempt to do that would happen .
If that videotape gets out , in addition to written word which is probably already too late to stop now , any retroactive gag attempt would be useless and only damaging to Holder and the DOJ ...

Anything said about Joe Lieberman or Hillary Clinton or any other of her " dirty dozen " list that she had put out earlier ?
Or for that matter , why was the late Tom Lantos on the rogue 's gallery list , or did they avoid talking about him out of respect for those who have passed on ?
Did Eymur get discussed at all ?
Perhaps his role in the rogue 's gallery was n't as pertinent to the case at hand in terms of bribery of congress critters , but he seemed to be at the root of the recent revelations she discussed with you on the Malloy show on Bin Laden , etc .
Any word on who the other " question mark " entity was ?

I have to think that the DoJ 's resistance was half - hearted ; otherwise , they would have moved to quash the deposition subpoena .
There is , of course , still a distinct possibility that the DoJ will intervene , seeking a protective order that would prevent the release of the deposition and further prevent the attorneys , as well as litigants , from revealing the content of the deposition .
So these on - the - spot summaries before that could occur , Brad , are of vital historical importance .

Adding a legal perspective to Brad 's response @ 21 , even though Sibel has gone forward with her deposition testimony , given previously imposed legal restraints , she has to make on - the - spot decisions on what questions she can and cannot answer .
There is nothing unusual in that .
I have personally been involved in depositions where witnesses had to avoid divulging classified materials while otherwise providing accurate testimony on matters that are not classified .

Re JBMHN comment # 23 & 99's note .
The content of Brad 's piece reflects that it is indeed the " Bruce Fein . "
I agree with 99 that Bruce is one of the " good guys . "
I suspect that Fein 's client Schmidt ( R - OH ) may not be .
One has to distinguish the lawyer from the cause he or she represents .
Fein has an ethical obligation to vigorously represent his client --- an ethical obligation which , in this case , may require him to raise objections during the deposition .
Those objections do not make Fein a " bad guy . "
To the contrary , they probably reflect the fact that Bruce Fein is a very good lawyer , which I know from having read his past articles , he is .

Joe - that 's not a bad guess given the AIPAC stuff , but I 'm pretty sure it 's not her .
If my memory serves , in Sibel 's recent interview of Russ Tice , Sibel says something along the lines that she took some whistleblower cases to Harman .
She would not have done that if she knew that Harman was being bribed .

One concern I had with Mark Geragos handling the case was whether there would be problems with him having to get a secret clearance for any of Sibel 's testimony or preparation for it , since he already had been kicked off the case representing Brent Wilkes for not wanting to have a background check done .
Thankfully it sounds like this was n't an issue .
In retrospect , I 'm much happier with him getting off of Wilkes ' case moreso than Krikorian's .
Maybe that was by design on his part !
COMMENT # 60 [ Permalink ]
... Cascadiance said on 8/8/2009 @ 1:48 pm PT ...
Joe , interesting conjecture , but considering the pressure that Harman 's been having lately , perhaps it is likely it would have been exposed by now if true since there seems to have been a lot of folk after her lately .
Though she probably deserves a lot of the flak she 's been getting for some of the things she 's done .
If it were Harman , that might be another interesting reason that could explain Waxman 's resistance to having Sibel testify , since Harman 's in an adjacent district to Waxman's , and might give him a lot of trouble if he were the source of her undoing there .

The unnamed congresswoman blackmailed has been named by Wayne Madsen at his site : " Perhaps the most explosive part of the deposition involved the Turkish government being engaged in a sexual blackmail operation against a sitting member of the House of Representative .
In what the FBI termed a " hooking process , " an ATC female operative enticed a female member of the House into a lesbian sexual encounter at a Washington , DC townhouse . "
" The identity of the House member in question was not revealed during the deposition by Edmonds .
However , WMR has learned from another informed source that it is Representative Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , a strong supporter of AIPAC and Israel and a close political ally of President Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel . " from www.waynemadsenreport.com

I am so happy to have found this article .
I recall vividly the article in Vanity Fair about Ms. Edmonds and have often wondered what became of all of this .
I believe she is a true patriot and spoke out at a time that was very difficult to get any justice .
Thank you for covering this and best of luck to Ms. Edmonds .
She has my complete respect and thanks .

Madsen has his head lodged where he often keeps it lodged .
Schakowsky did not mysteriously backtrack on the Armenian genocide thing .
Harman did .
And you should read what Sibel has had to say about Harman previously in these very cyber - pages .
She was hinting at what she could not say .

I 've been looking and looking , and so far I 've found only one female member of congress who first supported the Armenian genocide resolution and then turned against it : Jane Harman .
Schakowsky voted for it .
The Armenian community is not angry at her ; they are angry at Jane .
Also , I may be wrong on this , but I do not think that Schakowsky has children .

99 ---
It is indeed the same Bruce Fein / resident scholar and former member of the Reagan Justice Department .
Fein took part in and made excellent contributions to an ABA study which challenged the legality of Bush 's more than 1,000 Presidential signing statements .
He has taken legal positions sharply critical of the Bush administration 's " Unitary Executive " theory .
Brad 's latest update suggests that Fein may have to withdraw from representation because he may be a potential witness in the case .
This ethical problem is not infrequent .
An attorney must withdraw if it is clear that the attorney must be a witness on matters of substance --- as opposed to procedural matters like the substance of agreements between opposing counsel .
But courts are sometimes remiss to permit one side to call opposing counsel as a witness unless it is truly necessary , lest the tactic be used to simply rid oneself of an effective opposing advocate .
There may be a significant problem with any effort to call Fein as a witness with respect to any organization with whom he has acted as legal counsel because his knowledge about those organizations would likely be shielded by attorney / client privilege .
If either Fein or the court determines that he must withdraw , this , standing alone , would not reduce the high regard I have for Mr. Fein 's work in the field of constitutional law .
It does suggest that Fein is in a difficult legal position .
It is quite possible that Fein will advise his client to retain alternative counsel .
But we will have to wait and see .

Yes , that crossed my mind , Ernie , but I figure if he was hired , it was for his expertise in the subject matter , and if he took the case , he did n't have a reasonable expectation that there would be anything involved that would turn into an issue of him needing to be a witness , but I 'm not paying that close attention to this stuff .
Un - American as that may sound , I 'm completely wiped on this issue of what Sibel has to say .
It seems to me she has said everything repeatedly , and that plenty of people know the scope of it , but it all comes out in these little dibs and dabs that are just more confusing after you have looked hard enough to get the gist .
Maybe there 's merit in reminding everyone about the Feds covering up drug trafficking and nukes trafficking and the dirty officials involved , but too many people are too confused , and that would be because nobody has ever sat down and very clearly outlined it .
It 's always these sensational hintings of stuff that never comes to much .
Maybe the video will clear things up .
Maybe Brad , when he 's slept enough , and Ghiraldi can get together with her and write a book , or Pulitzer - worthy essay and I 'll finally muster the vitality for it again , but in the meantime I still cling to my respect for Fein and revile that I must suspect the worst from every little nudge toward an opening for a functional DoJ ....

Luke :
Might it be that for Sibel to follow security protocols , that she needed to communicate then with someone from the " gang of eight " , which from this page looks like it had the following members : Denny Hastert
Nancy Pelosi
Porter Goss
Jane Harman
Bill Frist
Tom Daschle
Pat Roberts
Jay Rockefeller
In short , for whistleblower issues , she might not have had much choice and had to go to one of these people to not violate security protocols .

After reviewing our coverage , Edmonds clarifies that she did not discuss the specific voting record of the Congresswoman in question discussed above , because she did n't , and still does n't , know her record on that particular issue .
As Krikorian 's quote above may have been inadvertently misleading on that point , she wanted to correct that record .

Peter Lance implicates Fitzgerald in much of the 9 - 11 cover - up of failed FBI and SDNY policy .
Another culprit , Jamie Gorelick and the current World Bank President Zoellick are linked .
Was Valerie Plame the real target because as Sibel informs us she interdicted shipments of VX nerve gas from the Carlyle Group being sent to salt evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ?
What is the role of Wolfowitz and the World Bank in protecting Turkey ?
This is HUGE and I fear for honest Jewish people and others who are innocent of crime when this all comes out .

Anna Eshoo seems a possible candidate , but : 1 . She is not now married .
Sibel Edmonds specified that the blackmail victim was .
2 . Eshoo is also still strongly in favor of passing an Armenian genocide resolution .
If she had been blackmailed , then she would not now be in the forefront of that fight .
I see nothing that would have made the blackmail threat go away .
3 . Eshoo is of Armenian descent herself .
I think she would have told Turks to do their worst and go to hell .
The move to table the resolution was political .
Convinced that the resolution would not win , they decided to fight again another day .
Note that Brad Sherman --- whom I admire , and who does not appear to be blackmailable --- was also among the four .

If Harman is not the woman , then we have a serious problem .
The only other possibility is that Sibel Edmonds is a unreliable --- which was ( incidentally ) Larisa Alexandrovna 's assessment .
Before you vent your fury at me , consider : Sibel Edmonds was an FBI translator for only a brief stint --- December 2001 to March , 2002 .
The Armenian Genocide Resolution was not introduced until 2007 .
And yet Sibel says that the blackmail was conducted " in the context " of the Armenian Genocide Resolution .
That is one serious fucking problem .
And the problem is with us no matter WHO the unnamed congresswoman might be .
I will presume that when she worked for the FBI , Sibel was not getting dispatches from the future .
Yes , it 's true that we have this precis of Edmond 's testimony at second hand from Kirkpatrick .
But I do n't see how he could have brought up the resolution if Sibel Edmonds had not done so first .
I will withhold final judgment until I see the exact transcript .
But right now --- provisionally --- I would say that something smells of fish .

Joseph - I sent you an email with a link to Sibel 's clarification of what Krikorian said , in which she says she did n't say one way or another which the Rep had voted , because she had no idea .
Krikorian says it was " in the context of " that discussion , and Sibel knows that what she said was video - taped and transcribed and to be released publicly .
So why are you creating " something fishy " out of nothing fishy ?
But yes , the transcript will clarify your concerns , I 'd think , one way or another when it 's released .
BTW , since she was the first one to say ' Hey , I did n't say which way she voted , please correct that so folks are n't misled ' , I further am puzzled as to why you'd be making the insinuations you are .
There was ( as of now ) some kind of miscommunication between what Krikorian said and what he'd heard ( he even notes , in his direct quote , that he stopped taking notes at one point ) .
So why create something here that does n't exist ?
At least for the moment ??

Well , as noted in the clarification above , there is certainly a third choice ( perhaps even more ) .
Whether you accept that choice or not is beside the point .
So to say , again that there is " no situation in which he would have brought up the Armenian Genocide Resolution " is just silly .
The entire deposition focused on and around that issue .
He was being bombarded with names and crimes that he'd never heard before , all having to do with that issue , and related issues .
Why is it impossible to understand that he might have mispoken ?
Why would Sibel lie about something that she knows is now on the record , and that she 's hoping to see released ASAP ?
Why are you looking for hobgoblins where none seem to exist ?

Bruce Fein is one of the attorneys working for the Turkish - American Legal Defense Fund .
See TALDF 's contact page .
The other attorney listed there , David Saltzman , has a law partnership with Gunay Ovunc ( Evinch - Americanized spelling ) and their website has the appropriately named domain of turklaw .

Ovunc also happens to be the current president of the Assembly of Turkish American Associations ( ATAA ) .

HR 596 was suspended by Hastert more than a year before Sibel Edmonds was employed by the FBI .
So the chronology still seems off .
No , not really .
The wiretaps Sibel was asked to review went back to 1997 .
If you are looking for documentation go back to what David Rose wrote in his article : Vanity Fair has established that around the time the Dickersons visited the Edmondses , in December 2001 , Joel Robertz , an F.B.I. special agent in Chicago , contacted Sibel and asked her to review some wiretaps .
Some were several years old , others more recent ; all had been generated by a counter - intelligence investigation that had its start in 1997 .
“ It began in D.C. , ” says an F.B.I. counter - intelligence official who is familiar with the case file .
But “ it became apparent that Chicago was actually the center of what was going on . ”
Picked up on the wiretap recordings was references to bribed paid to Hastert , and that : Edmonds reportedly added that the recordings also contained repeated references to Hastert ’s flip - flop , in the fall of 2000 , over an issue which remains of intense concern to the Turkish government — the continuing campaign to have Congress designate the killings of Armenians in Turkey between 1915 and 1923 a genocide .
For many years , attempts had been made to get the House to pass a genocide resolution , but they never got anywhere until August 2000 , when Hastert , as Speaker , announced that he would give it his backing and see that it received a full House vote .
He had a clear political reason , as analysts noted at the time : a California Republican incumbent , locked in a tight congressional race , was looking to win over his district ’s large Armenian community .
Thanks to Hastert , the resolution , vehemently opposed by the Turks , passed the International Relations Committee by a large majority .
Then , on October 19 , minutes before the full House vote , Hastert withdrew it .
As you point out it does n't make sense if it's the 2007 Resolution .
The 2000 resolution explains your chronology problem .

If anyone doubts the depth of hatred carried on by the Turkish American establishment for all Armenians living and dead , google " ergun kirlikovali " who is the president elect of the assembly of Turkish American associations , ATAA .
Just a month ago , kirlikovali was quoted as threatening anyone who said the words " Armenian genocide " with lawsuits .
So far , the Turkish American Legal Defense Fund , which is part of the Turkish American establishment has brought three colossally stupid lawsuits in service of genocide denial .
First , they supported an action against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend how the Armenian Genocide is taught in public schools .
Case thrown out on summary judgment .
Strike one .
Added benefit : they inadvertently kept the AG and their denial efforts in the public mind .
Next : TALDF represented mean Jean Schmidt , who is barely smart enough to find Turkey on the map , in her action against David Krikorian before the OEC .
In addition to giving Sibel a platform from which to speak , they made public through her the corruption the TA establishment has engendered .
Their last genius bit of work was to sue the southern poverty law center for publishing a piece about AG agnostic historian Guenter Lewy .
As for Fein , he seems to make a nice living denying the AG for TALDF .
He will take a position on genocide based on what his clients need , rather than the facts .
For example , he argues that one cannot call the murder of Unarmed Armenians by the state a genocide because there has been no adjudication before a tribunal .
Yet , on behalf of his Tamil clients , he is not reticient about calling Sinhalese actions genocide , despite the same lack of an adjudication .
By the way , Rafael Lemkin , the Yale professor who invented the term " genocide " did so with the experience of the Armenians and European Jewry in mind .

I can see the argument regarding pre-9/11 material , but I have yet to find any evidence --- even that there was a congressperson who made a dramatic and mysterious turnaround on 596 , and who fit the following criteria : 1 . Female .
2. Married .
3 . With children .
4. Democratic .
5 . Served then and is serving now .
We may deduce another criterion .
The blackmail threat would not have gone away .
So this person cannot have voiced support for the Armenian cause at any point during the past eight or nine years .
( That rules out Schakowsky , who co-sponsored the most recent bill . )
I just can't find anyone who fits the bill .
Look , I do n't enjoy voicing suspicion of Edmonds .

Sibel / Brad : Just a suggestion .
But I think that Sibel should name the member of Congress .
That will resolve some of the questions being raised here .
Without evidence and / or an on the record source , I can not name this person .
But Sibel can , as she is the person with the first hand knowledge of these events and such .
She has already violated the States Secrets gag by naming the rogues .
This one is not going to be as legally dangerous as the rogues .
Just my 2 cents .
Go for it Sibel .
Name her : )
Brad , if you know who it is , you may wish to contact their office to try and get a denial or a confirmation .
I tried that a few years back , but they never got back to me .
You might have better luck now given that there is a new ( although similar ) administration in power and that such revelations might be handled differently given the amount of damage this information would cause politically .
The member of Congress may choose to get ahead of it and perhaps share their side of the story , that way , they have more control over the nature of the alleged affair revelations .
That is the offer you should pitch to them and see if they respond .
It ca n't hurt .
But this would be one hell of a scoop if you could get a denial or a confirmation from that office .
Again , just my 2 cents .

Thanks so much Sibel , Brad , Luke , et.al .... you restored my sense that justice will be done .
Last question ... why was she allowed to testify , as in what is the other side 's next move ?

You 'll pardon me if I doubt people would be very interested if the blackmail had something to do with , say , cheating on taxes .
It has been my understanding for a while that there have been many attempts to get a resolution re the Armenian Genocide , not just one , not just two , and the only thing that is a big deal about it at ALL is that lobbyists got themselves into position to blackmail any official .
We already know this is Sibel 's credible allegation .
Might as well bicker over Michael Jackson 's tortured existence .

Steve , that would require an actual DOJ , independent from politics and actually interested in busting criminals .
The Obama administration 's DOJ has apparently one interest : to cover up Bush - era crimes .
So unless we get a whole new country based on the rule of law , I do n't see anyone getting any justice for anything .
Not Siegelman , not Minor , not countless others , including Sibel .
We must all continue to share these stories and cover them if for no other reason than to create an accurate historical record .
But justice is no longer an American value .

Mr. Cannon ,
This will be my only response to you .
Enjoy it . 1 ) . You and I do n't talk .
The two times that we did , it was because you needed work and I was trying to help you - silly me ( lesson learned ) .
2 ) . We did discuss Ms. Edmonds , but not in the manner you claim .
I never said she was unreliable .
Everything I said to you , I have said to Siebel herself during a period when we were having some issues , which we resolved .
Whatever your many issues , however , they have nothing to do with me or anything I have said ( as evident from the direction your blog has taken over the last year ) .
3 . Do n't invoke my name or claims about me for your own issues .
Just focus on perhaps waiting for the transcript before you jump to conclusions - and you are jumping .
It is not Jane Harman .
Now just wait for the transcript and see if some of your questions wo n't be answered .
4 . I cannot name the person as it would be unethical .
I have no evidence and the person making the allegations wo n't name them .
That is why I suggested Sibel simply naming the person in question .
5 . Do n't address me again .
You know what I think of you .
I really do n't care what you think of me .
So let 's not engage each other at all .
If you still feel you need to obsess over me as you have done with your insane rants , feel free to do so .
But do n't address me again .
Hope I have made myself clear .
Now I am heading back to my pro-Obama conspiracy with Kos , Brad ... and who else did you claim ?
No matter , I am sure I will find out at our secret meeting this evening ( shhh , Brad ) .

Agent ,
Yes , it was a delusion because we were somewhat friendly and I was trying to help out a person in need .
The person shared private matters about their life with me and that privacy has not been violated by me .
I am sure that if the person in question had indeed taped those phone calls , they would have no issues with making them public .
Respect , privacy , decency , gratitude are not present over yonder .
If in doubt , go read some of the garbage written about me as being so pro-Obama that I am drinking the kool - aid .
Then go read my actual writings and see if there is a serious disconnect from reality .
:D [ed note : Damn , I thought I unposted my snark to Cannon about your expectation of a person with at least a basic level of morals on the other end of the line .
I decided not to post the comment because it does n't do any good to take issue with that guy .

Would this have happened , if Bush / Cheney were still in there ?
Admittedly , it 's now become a very very low bar .
But yes , the fact that they did n't invoke " State secrets " and only seem to have issued a tepid " Hey - do n't do that , Sibel " in their legal maneuvers over the last two days , which seemed more CYA than anything else , is certainly a marked diff from Bush / Cheney and commendable .
At least as close as we come to it these days .
Sibel 's attorney Michael Kohn noted same in his comments today , as quoted in my article above : " We 're delighted that the Justice Department did not intervene and allowed the testimony to go forward . "
He said it was " a breath of fresh air from the previous administration . "
He did n't " think it would have happened with the previous administration . "

An even more interesting conflict question :
An earlier post mused on the question of whether Fein might need to recuse himself because of his positions with the Turkish American establishment .
I suspect not , because his role is legal , and there is unlikely to be any demand by Krikorian for his testimony as a non legal percipient witness .
If there were , OEC would likely quash unless there was a compelling need for such testimony .
Courts disfavor lawyer depositions , as they disturb the attorney client relationship .
However , there might be a real or potential conflict between Schmidt and some part of the TA establishment , such as the ATAA , which TALDF might represent or be part of .
Schmidt almost certainly knew nothing about the TA establishment when she took it 's PAC money .
To her , the PAC might have seemed like a few Turkish Americans wanting cat worst to play ethnic politics .
She might be understandably pissed if nobody - like her benefactors at TALDF , for example - told her about the wider claims of espionage they were defending .
If the hometown papers pick up the story that she is accused of taking T money and is represented by TA lawyers , it may harm her .
I predict she will get new lawyers , and quietly dismiss the case in a few weeks , maybe even before the video is out .
Maybe Bruce is calling Mark tonight looking for a dismissal with an agreement to seal the transcript and video .
Doubtful David would allow it .
He knows he has a strong political and legal case , plus he owes release of the evidence to the memory of his grandparents generation .

Anyone here ever watch Akira Kurosawa 's classic film Rashomon ?
I think what Sibel has said is absolutely honest and candid to the best of her ability and knowledge , but that does not necessarily mean that everything is actually true , and without some nuance or need for future qualification .
She may have misunderstood some of the documents she had access to , or did not have enough of all of the information and communications to put the information she did have as translator into proper context .
Simon , above , raises some more important issues about the prosecution of Scooter Libby relating to Valerie Plame affair that no one seems to have latched on to yet .
How does what Sibel say about Brewster Jennings cover being destroyed and the CIA front dismantled well before the Plame affair square with Fitzgerald 's prosecution ?
According to Sibel , there logically should have been nothing to prosecute .
Brewster Jennings was kaput ; it no longer existed after August 2001 ( and before 9/11 ) .
So what has been going on here ?
I think Sibel has but one piece of the whole puzzle .
No one can really understand the whole picture until a number of other players voluntarily come forward , or are subpoenaed to testify , to address some apparent criminal activities that have occurred .

There are several intertwined threads to the tapestry of apparent treason by Grossman and Feith , the outing of Brewster Jennings , and the bribery of Congress members by ATC .
Let 's try to separate them out .
First , this is just a snapshot of a much larger , darker picture of foreign espionage and influence peddling in Washington .
Sibel has certain language skills , which explains why she can tell us what she heard on the FBI wire about some of the black ops carried out by the Turks , and those who Turkish intelligence was talking to and working with , such as Pakistani ISI , the Israelis , and the American neocons .
Second , let 's not lose sight of the roles played by other partners in this network .
There is a strand that extends from Feith and the OSP " cell " in Rumsfeld 's Pentagon spy shop through Larry Franklin to Naor Gilon , Mossad Chief of Station , at the Israeli Embassy .
The other end of that stretches to Marc Grossman and Richard Armitage in the State Department connected to Vice President Cheney , who orchestrated many things , including the outing of Valerie Plame and the destruction of operations run by the CIA Counter - Proliferation Division ( CPD ) .
That , in turn , links in with the WMD falsification conspiracies supporting the Iraqi invasion .
This is part of something much bigger and more sinister .
The FBI and NSA apparently has a lot more on tape .
More will come out , but this is just the first step toward learning the awful truth .
We must demand the whistleblowers be allowed to finally speak so we can hear the rest .

Well if you 're all through fighting about this , I thought it might be of assistance if you knew a new part of the story .
Armenian Genocide Resolution
" TUSIAD DELEGATION IN FRANCE The Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen Association ( TUSIAD ) Delegation , currently in France , met with the directors of the MEDEF ( Employers ' Confederation ) yesterday .
The recent crisis between Turkey and France due to France 's approval of the so - called Armenian genocide bill and possible ways to overcome the recent financial crisis in Turkey were among topics discussed during the meeting .
Promising to convey Turkey 's views on the Armenian issue , MEDEF said it will visit Turkey during July of 2001 .
/ Cumhuriyet / "
http://www.byegm.gov.tr
You see the ATAA , ATC etc. has been around for quite a while .
They 've re-introduced the official resolution on the Armenian Genocide nearly every year in a different format .
Most likely that is exactly what Sibel and her colleague was referring to .
Something about this is still a mystery , as every time one of these Lobby groups attempts to deny the resolution - but as you can see they also adopted it as law in California .
Strange to be sure .
If the ATAA and AIPAC really work together in co-operation , then this might explain a lot regarding the revolving door enterprise of Lockheed Martin .
According to Turkish news Lockheed Martin has repeatedly gotten expanded contracts , every season , each with the same representatives assisting the hand off all the way along since year 2000 .
When was Grossman appointed ?
This is Military Industrial Complex inc .

Ewastud , interesting points about the Plame prosecution ... and how what Sibel knows is part of a whole picture Sibel may or may not fully know or understand .
I had read that Plame had n't been overseas in her covert work for some years --- with inference from her that it was because her twins were young and inference from the right that she was no longer a NOC --- but the Fitsgerald prosecution proved she was still a NOC on duty to serve in covert operations .
But , this information gives me some satisfaction to my wonder why Fitzgerald investigated only the outing of Plame and not her cover company , which Novak revealed in a second column a week after he outed her .
Few ever mention the outing of B - J and the deaths I 've heard at least one former CIA say are known to have occurred as a result of it .
Now I can understand that complexity better , with this information Sibel reportedly revealed yesterday .

Ewastud and Cheeky , I was wondering about the same thing .
" Novak has nothing to do with it .
Wilson has nothing to do with it .
Valerie Plame has nothing to do with it .
The whole operation has to do with something totally different and it had to do with the American Turkish Council and the Turkish clients who were about to hire Brewster Jennings as an analyst ... and Grossman found out about it , and tipped off his diplomatic contact who was a target of the FBI counter - intelligence , and that person notified the ISI [ Pakistani intelligence agency ] , etc . "
She says that Brewster Jenning was then " dismantled as soon as the FBI notified the CIA , " after which " FBI requested CIA to do a damage assessment , to see if lives would be lost . "
All of this , she re-iterated , was " long before , three years before , " Novak outed Valerie Plame as a CIA operative in his newspaper column .
Brewster Jennings was " absolutely " dismantled in August of 2001 .
This from an earlier Bradblog post :
When Raines expressed to Plame Wilson during today 's interview that he felt the allegations bear further investigation she said again , " I agree !
It is stunning , " adding , " It 's a very frustrating period ... I do n't have any terrific suggestions on how to get this story played in the United States . "
When asked about the allegations that Grossman outed her covert Brewster Jennings network , she said she was unable to speak to those charges .
" Not only can I say , ' no comment , ' but I mean ' no comment ' because I do n't know anything to add to it , " she claimed .
" Certainly during the run-up to the war and until I was outed , I was focused almost to the exclusion of anything else on just trying to run safe and effective operations , trying to figure out what the hell was going on in Iraq , what were the scientists , what were they doing , where were their secret sites . "

Plame does n't deny the existence of Brewster - Jennings in her answers .

True , the congresswoman 's alleged subjugation by blackmail likely is n't criminal on her part , but it is unethical to vote based on self - interest .
Moveover , it raises suspicion about what " dirt " the Turks have on every politician who has " changed his / her mind " about acknowledging the Armenian genocide or even scheduling a vote on the biennial resolution .
The fact the Turks find an innocuous , nonbinding US House resolution about century - old history such a threat raises a red flag as to what is really behind it all .

If Americans could get their heads out of their collective a .... , this could n't be used as leverage against otherwise honorable people .
Sure , cheating on a spouse is nasty but it has nothing to do with the task at hand .
Neither does bisexuality or homosexuality .
That being said , the congresswoman being " protected " is probably a progressive , and for that reason .

COMVERSE & KOBI ALEXANDER : Kobi Alexander is the founder of the Israeli high - tech company Comverse and is wanted by the FBI for alleged financial wrongdoings .
After fleeing the law in the US , Alexander was found and arrested in the African country of Namibia and has posted bail .
Cheney effectively has him right where he wants him , and despite being wanted here in the US , the US Government is clearly in no hurry to get him back here .
Gee , I wonder why ?
The U.S. wants Alexander to face charges related to stock - option backdating , including conspiracy , securities fraud , making false filings to U.S. regulators and money laundering .
SO WHAT DID KOBI HAVE TO DO WITH WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING ?
WHAT DID KOBI HAVE TO DO WITH 9/11 ?
ASK FOX NEWS : http://www.informationcl...use.info/article7545.htm
And this official DEA report : http://www.whatreallyhap...reportisraelispying.html
Kobi Alexander should be arrested and interrogated about his knowledge of the events of 9/11 .
His company acquired the other Mossad firm , Odigo , shortly after it was revealed that Odigo employees had been forewarned of the attacks on the World Trade Center .
Kobi and Dov Zakheim .
Why are they free ?

The High Court of Namibia has ruled to allow Jacob “ Kobi ” Alexander to remain , and work , in Namibia pending decisions on both the renewal of his work permit and the U.S. extradition request filed in July 2006 .
The SEC filed a complaint in 2006 against Alexander and two other executives of Comverse Technology Inc. , a New York company that designs and manufactures telecommunication systems and software .
The men are accused of backdating millions of Comverse stock options to days when the shares traded for lower prices for their own personal gain .
Authorities allege that Alexander made $ 8 million , David Kreinberg $ 1.5 million , and William F. Sorin more than $ 1 million from the scheme .
While Kreinberg and Sorin surrendered to authorities in August 2006 , while Alexander went on the lam .
In 2006 , he was arrested in Namibia .
So , to be clear , Clinton can fly to N. Korea to secure the release of two alleged spies , but the United States is powerless to secure the extradition of Kobi Alexander for trial here in the US from the likes of Namibia , of all places ?
Sure , you bet .

LUKE or BRAD ........
I politely took Clemons to task for remaining mute in the face of Sibel 's earthshattering testimony .
You can read the exchange here ...
http://www.thewashington...he_final_hachi/#comments
I was very suprised when Steve responded , ( as you will see if you visit the exchange ) , with the following comment ....
" Sibel Edmond pissed me off incredibly on one occasion in a way that made me unwilling to go near anything she says .
I 'm just not interested any longer , though i tried to be at one point --- in part because of your prodding . "
" I wo n't write about her and her case again until I see something completely fresh and new about her case that does not emanate from her .
best , steve " ( end quote ) I 'm curious what happened .
Can you shed some light on this , or perhaps Sibel can respond ?
Its inexplicable to me that personalities could clash so severely that Steve would respond in such a manner .
I have a great deal of respect for Steve , and his response troubles me .
Any idea what transpired ?
This is far too epic an issue for personalities to come into play .
Unless Sibel is lying through her teeth , which I strongly doubt , her allegations surpass the Watergate affair in their import , and are even of greater gravity than the Watergate affair and the Downing Street memo revelations combined .
What the hell transpired with Clemons ?
Can Sibel and Steve get past it so that the issue recieves Steve 's attention , and , hopefully , exposure on his blog ??

" Spokesman of British Petroleum has refuted the allegation of Georgia about Russia ’s air attacks on the oil pipeline .
According to Georgia , Russia ’s jets unsuccessfully attacked Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline Saturday .
They fired 51 missiles and explosion craters are seen at the distance of a few dozen meters from the facilities .
The thorough check did n’t reveal any traces of bombing in the pipeline area , said a representative of BP .
Some employees of BP are still in Georgia but they will probably leave the country after the British Foreign Office urged all British residents to hasten out of it while the air traffic is available and the border is open . "
Look up Baku - Ceyhan trans corridor pipeline project commonly referred to as " Pipelineistan "
These wars without end have been about much more than some land for the Zionist block , it 's been about large scale energy corridors from Georgia , to Turkey , to Israel .
The same folks profiting off these wars are the ones who accused Russia of hate crimes when they dared to kick the Georgians out of their city and step on British Petroleum 's toes ....

Two out of three major bond - rating firms now agree : California is a B - grade credit -- and maybe worse .
Moody ’s Investors Service on Tuesday cut the state ’s debt rating two notches , to Baa1 from A2 , warning that the risk was rising that California could have trouble paying its bondholders if the budget stalemate in Sacramento did n’t end soon .
The firm said the state remained on its “ watchlist ” for further downgrades .
Moody ’s Baa1 rating is just three notches above the level at which California ’s $ 59 billion in general obligation bonds would be considered “ junk , ” or no longer investment - grade in quality .
Next would be Baa2 , then Baa3 , then the junk rating of Ba .
Advertisement
The state has never had a junk rating before , and some Wall Street analysts doubt that the rating firms would cut California that low , short of a deeper crisis that would seriously threaten the state ’s ability to make bond payments .
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer has insisted that California would never default on its bond debt .
The state Constitution mandates debt payments , which must come before all other state spending except funding for education .
Lockyer ’s spokesman , Tom Dresslar , said the state would continue to manage its cash to assure that there was sufficient money to make bond payments .
Advertisement
The state this month began issuing IOUs to pay vendors and other so - called non-priority creditors .
The decision to use IOUs was partly spurred by the need to retain cash for bond payments .
Moody ’s rival Fitch Ratings on July 6 cut its rating on the state ’s debt to BBB from A - minus .
Standard & Poor ’s , the other member of the Big Three , still has California at A .
Most states are rated AAA or AA .
Moody ’s said its latest downgrade “ reflects the increased risk to the legally or constitutionally required payments ( ‘ priority payments ’ ) as the state deadlock continues .
Advertisement
“ Moody ’s believes that as the days and weeks go by without enacted solutions to the current cash crisis and the $ 26 - billion budget gap , the risk to priority payments , and eventually debt service payments , is increasing . ”
The firm said that a continued delay in balancing the budget “ could result in a further downgrade in coming months . ”
What ’s more , Moody ’s indicated that a budget resolution would n’t necessarily mean a rating upgrade from current low levels .
That would depend on whether the steps taken “ provide long - term solutions or quick fixes , ” the firm said .

<< Prev
Several years ago when I still considered myself a democratic socialist ( and a strong supporter of independent labor unions ) , I wrote an article in support of strikers at GM during Independence Day .
The first comment I received about the article was , " This sounds like an anarcho - syndicalist treatise . "
That was the first time I ever heard of the term .
I looked it up .
I had never seriously read much about anarchism before that point .
It made me wonder if the American revolutionaries were anarcho - syndicalists without knowing it - or if the early anarcho - syndicalists had taken their inspiration from the American Revolution .
Today I wonder just how many of us have truly read the contents of the original Declaration of Independence and understood the implications of what the document was proposing .
The article below will hopefully help illustrate just how " radical " those same ideas would sound to many of us today .
When in the Course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the economic bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all women and men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Corporations are instituted among Women and Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the employed .
That whenever any Form of Corporation becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Corporation , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Corporations long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Corporation , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Unions ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Corporation .
The history of the present Chief Executive Officer is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these Unions .
To prove this , let Facts be submitted to a candid world .
He has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good .
He has forbidden his Unions to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained , and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them .
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people , unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in a Union , a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only .
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their public Records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures .
He has dissolved Representative Unions repeatedly , for opposing with righteous firmness his invasions on the rights of the people .
He has refused for a long time , after such dissolutions , to cause others to be elected ; whereby the Union powers , incapable of Annihilation , have returned to the People at large for their exercise ; the Company remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of dissolution from without , and convulsions within .
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these Unions ; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Organization of Unemployed ; refusing to pass others to encourage their employment hither , and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Companies .
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone , for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their campaign finances .
He has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people , and eat out their substance .
He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies , without the consent of our unions .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power .
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation :
For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Terminations which they should commit on the Workers of these Unions :
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world :
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent :
For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Peer Jury :
For transporting us beyond States to be tried for pretended offences :
For taking away our Charters , abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Unions :
For suspending our own Unions , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever .
He has abdicated Corporation here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us .
He has plundered our seas , ravaged our Coasts , burnt our forests , and destroyed the lives of our people .
He is at this time transporting large Armies of paramilitary Mercenaries to complete the works of death , desolation and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized company .
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Union , to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren , or to fall themselves by their Hands .
He has excited internal insurrections amongst us , and has endeavoured to co-opt and bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers , the merciless Scab Savages , whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes , faiths , races and conditions .
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms .
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A Prince , whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
Nor have
We been wanting in attentions to our deunionized brethren .
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us .
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our organization and assembly here .
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations , which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence .
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity .
We must , therefore , acquiesce in the necessity , which denounces our Separation , and hold them , as we hold the rest of mankind , Enemies in War , in Peace Friends
We , therefore , the Representatives of the United Unions of America , in General Congress , Assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the Name , and by the authority of the good People of these Assemblies , solemnly publish and declare .
That these United Assemblies are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent Companies ; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Wall Street Crown ,
and that all corporate connection between them and the State of the CEO is and ought to be totally dissolved ;
and that as Free and Independent Companies , they have full Power to levy Security , conclude Mergers , contract Alliances , establish Employment ,
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Companies may of right do .
And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government is covertly testing technology in China and Iran that lets residents break through screens set up by their governments to limit access to news on the Internet .
The “ feed over email ” ( FOE ) system delivers news , podcasts and data via technology that evades web - screening protocols of restrictive regimes , said Ken Berman , head of IT at the U.S. government ’s Broadcasting Board of Governors , which is testing the system .
The news feeds are sent through email accounts including those operated by Google Inc , Microsoft Corp ’s Hotmail and Yahoo Inc .
“ We have people testing it in China and Iran , ” said Berman , whose agency runs Voice of America .
He provided few details on the new system , which is in the early stages of testing .
He said some secrecy was important to avoid detection by the two governments .
The Internet has become a powerful tool for citizens in countries where governments regularly censor news media , enabling them to learn about and react to major social and political events .
Young Iranians used social networking services Facebook and Twitter as well as mobile phones to coordinate protests and report on demonstrations in the wake of the country ’s disputed presidential election in June .
In May , ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown , the Chinese government blocked access to Twitter and Hotmail .
Sho Ho , who helped develop FOE , said in an email that the system could be tweaked easily to work on most types of mobile phones .
The U.S. government also offers a free service that allows overseas users to access virtually any site on the Internet , including those opposing the United States .
“ We do n’t make any political statement about what people visit , ” Berman said .
“ We are trying to impart the value : ‘ The more you know , the better . ’
People can look for themselves . ”
In addition to China and Iran , targets for the FOE technology include Myanmar , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan and Vietnam , he said .
Berman , however , said there would be modest filtering of pornography on the system .
“ There is a limit to how much ( U.S. ) taxpayers should have to pay for , ” he said .

WHAT IS DMT ?
Introduction from the Wikipedia article on DMT :
N , N - Dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ; “ Ayahausca ” ; “ Dimitri ” , “ Disneyland ” , etc ) , or merely dimethyltryptamine , is a naturally - occurring tryptamine and potent psychedelic drug , found not only in many plants , but also in trace amounts in the human body where its natural function is undetermined .
Structurally , it is analogous to the neurotransmitter serotonin and other psychedelic tryptamines such as 5 - MeO - DMT and 4 - HO - DMT .
DMT is created in small amounts by the human body during normal metabolism by the enzyme tryptamine - N- methyltransferase .
Many cultures , indigenous and modern , ingest DMT as a psychedelic in extracted or synthesized forms .
Pure DMT at room temperature is a clear or white to yellowish - red crystalline solid .
A laboratory synthesis of DMT was first reported in 1931 , and it was later found in many plants .

Justice for JJ and Tylee : Everything to Know About the Daybell Case
Duration : 06:44
How did an Arizona hairdresser and an Idaho author end up at the center of a case involving five suspicious deaths , " cult - like " religious beliefs and a must - state investigation ?
Chad and Lori Vallow Daybell are due to go on trial in 2021 on felony charges related to the disappearance and deaths of Joshua " JJ " Vallow , 7 , and Tylee Ryan , 16 .
Both have pleaded not guilty , and remain under investigation in the deaths of their spouses , Charles Vallow and Tammy Daybell .
Kaelyn Forde reports .
Purple carrots - dark on the outside , orange on the inside - are set to appear in shops this summer , while green , yellow , red , white and black varieties may follow .
Growers say the change of colour is entirely natural , as carrots occurred in variety of different colours before the Dutch bred an orange variety in the 16th century that became an overwhelming commercial success .
Temple drawings show that as long ago as 2000 BC the Egyptians had a purple - coloured plant thought to be the carrot .
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin report that by the 1300s , purple and yellow varieties of carrot had spread from origins in Afghanistan to Europe and China .
Red and white carrots were also grown .
Orange carrots contain high levels of betacarotene , a pigment which is a form of vitamin A , that encourages good vision in dim light and healthy skin .
Purple carrots also contain anthocyanin , which may help prevent heart disease by slowing blood clotting .
The first crop of dark purple carrots is being grown at Yaxley , Suffolk , and will be available in supermarkets from the end of July .
Sainsbury 's , which is stocking the carrots called Purple Haze , said they were looking at introducing a " rainbow coloured bunch " soon , but a spokeswoman said no other colours had been planted yet .
Modern agriculture has led to a loss of genetic diversity .
According to a Worldwatch Institute report in 1999 , less than 20 % of the vegetable seeds available at the turn of the last century were commercially grown 100 years later .
Over 90 % of carrot varieties have been lost .
In 1903 there were 287 varieties of carrots being grown , but 80 years later there were only 21 types of carrot seed in the US national seed storage laboratory , according to the World Resources Institute .
At Sainsbury 's , they are hoping for a more prosaic result .
Russell Crowe , a buyer for the supermarket chain , said : " Hopefully this unusual colour will influence children to eat more vegetables , while parents can rest assured there is nothing artificial about the carrots . "
Civil unrest alert !
A few years ago Jefferson County , Alabama bought 17 interest rate swaps from JP Morgan , Lehman Brothers and Bank of America with the intention of hedging interest rate risk .
Today the county said it may need the National Guard to hedge the the " anarchy risk " it now faces as a result of the fiscal disaster its venture into " sophisticated " derivatives turned out to be .
In a sequence of events that played out in state capitals , city halls , and school and public utility boardrooms throughout the country , Jefferson County officials bought into complex interest rate swap contracts they did n't understand , at much higher prices than the going rate , only to face hundreds of millions of dollars in sudden collateral calls when the subprime mortgage crisis began .
Jefferson County 's collateral calls came when credit rating agencies downgraded the monolines insuring its swaps contracts , Financial Guaranty and XL Capital Assurance , last year , when all the major monolines were beset with downgrades following a fatal foray into the business of " insuring " subprime mortgage - backed CDOs and other asset - backed securities .
Two researchers from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia ( UPC ) and the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom have shown for the first time that the law of brevity in human language , according to which the most frequently - used words tend to be the shortest , also extends to other animal species .
The scientists have shown that dolphins are more likely to make simpler movements at the water surface .
" Patterns of dolphin behaviour at the surface obey the same law of brevity as human language , with both seeking out the simplest and most efficient codes " , Ramón Ferrer i Cancho , co-author of the study published in the journal Complexity and a researcher in the Department of Languages and IT Systems at the UPC , tells SINC .
The law of brevity , proposed by the American philologist George K. Zipf , along with others , shows that the most frequently - used words are the shortest ones .
Ferrer i Cancho , together with the scientist David Lusseau from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland ( although they actually carried out this study while working at the Universities of Barcelona and Dalhousie in Canada , respectively ) have shown that when dolphins move on the surface of the water they tend to perform the most simple movements , in the same way that humans tend to use words made up of less letters when they are speaking or writing , in so - called " linguistic economy " .
The research study includes the case of Oscar Wilde 's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray .
The most - used word is the three - letter article " the " , while other larger ones , such as " responsibilities " are hardly found at all .
Among bottlenose dolphins in New Zealand , the researchers looked at their behaviour patterns at the surface of the water .
Each pattern is made up of up to four basic units .
So , the " tail slap " pattern is made up of the units " slap " , " tail " and " two " , while the " spy hop " pattern is made up of the units " stop " , " expose " and " head " , and the " side flop " pattern " comprises " leap " and " side " , and the " tail - stock dive " only involves the " dorsal arch " unit .
In total , the scientists counted more than 30 patterns of behaviour and their related units , and have shown that dolphins carry out more behaviour patterns made up of just one unit , while those involving four units are used less frequently .
" The results show that the simple and efficient behaviour strategies of dolphins are similar to those used by humans with words , and are the same as those used , for example , when we reduce the size of a photographic or video image in order to save space " , says Ferrer .
The researcher says that studies such as this one show that human language is based on the same principles as those governing biological systems , " which leads us to the conclusion that the traditional barriers between disciplines should be removed " .

The New York Times reports that the " centrists " are celebrating that they seem to be getting their way in the healthcare reform debate , and their way means no public option .
Meanwhile , the Washington Post is pushing this same " centrist " idea .
Media Matters has the story .
The Washington Post described an " emerging " bipartisan health care reform bill that would " abandon the government insurance option that President Obama is seeking " as a " move toward " the " center , " but in fact , several recent polls show that a majority of Americans support a public plan option .
The media have repeatedly cast the public plan option as a far - left proposal , skewing the health care debate .
From the August 6 article , " Senators Closer To Health Package , " bearing the subhead " Bipartisan Talks On Reform Move Toward Center " : Senate negotiators are inching toward bipartisan agreement on a health - care plan that seeks middle ground on some of the thorniest issues facing Congress , offering the fragile outlines of a legislative consensus even as the political battle over reform intensifies outside Washington ....
It 's just a rush to the squishy middle where the Village wants us all to be , regardless of either what 's good policy , or where public opinion really is .
MM continues :
Most recent polls show that the majority of Americans support a public option .
Recent polling from Washington Post / ABC
News , Time , and McClatchy all show more than 50 percent support for a public option ; two Quinnipiac polls and a New York Times / CBS News poll show more than 60 percent support ; and an NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll shows 46 percent support for a public option : Quinnipiac : 62 percent support " public option . " ...
Washington Post / ABC
News : 54 percent support a " government - run plan . " ...
Time : 56 percent favor a " government - sponsored " option ....
NY Times / CBS
News : 66 percent favor a " government administered " plan ....
McClatchy : 52 percent say " it is necessary to create a public health insurance plan . " ... NBC News / Wall Street Journal : 46 percent favor a plan " administered by the federal government . " ...
Remind you of anything ?
How about polling on Iraq in September of 2005 , or October , 2006 ?
Remember when war opponents were the DFH minority ?
And how did the elections of 2006 and 2008 turn out ?
The anti-war position was no more " leftist " than support for a public option is now .
HF112 - Beware of the Leaven of the Pharisees
To : Hebraic-Foundations@yahoogroups.com
From : " Pastor Buddy Martin " < Bro.Buddy@ChristianChallenge.org >
Date : Fri , February 6 , 2004
Subject : Bible Study HF112 - Beware of the Leaven of the Pharisees
Hebraics ,
In this study we want to consider what Jesus meant in his warning to " beware of the leaven of the Pharisees . "
You may be surprised to learn that the issue of leaven is n't merely a Pharisee problem .
It is an issue that has plagued the church from the beginning .
Let 's look into this problem area .
This is Bible Study HF112 - Beware of the Leaven of the Pharisees .
We recently completed a series entitled , " Struggles in Israel . "
In that series I shared quotes from the Talmudic writings .
In this study we will draw but little from the Talmud .
It should be understood that when the Lord speaks of the leaven of the Pharisees , this is what He is referring to - that " the traditions of the fathers " evolved into the vast library of Talmudic teachings .
However , it must also be understood that the issue of leaven extends far beyond Talmudism .
There are Christian groups today who have leavened teachings .
Leaven represents any form of teaching that corrupts the true gospel of Jesus Christ .
Just as the Pharisees had corrupted the teachings of Moses , there are Christian groups today who corrupt the true message of the cross .
They do this by adding things to the message that do not belong .
Here is where a point must be made .
A person can be truly born of heaven and yet have his or her understanding filled with leavened teachings .
This is the primary reason that believers begin to feel a loss of their liberty in Christ .
A new believer begins with a great sense of joy and liberty , but something happens over time .
They began to lose their sense of freedom in Christ .
Paul deals with this quite extensively in his letter to the Galatian believers .
He said , " You foolish Galatians , who has bewitched you , before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified ?
This is the only thing I want to find out from you : did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law , or by hearing with faith . "
He also said , " It was for freedom that Christ set us free ; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery . "
The yoke Paul was speaking of was not simply the Law of Moses .
It had to do with all the additions that the Pharisees had appended to the Law .
Just as there was a Pharisee element in the early Church , there is also a Pharisee element in many churches today .
In this case the new covenant is being marred with leavened doctrines .
Now back to the warning itself .
Jesus often drew attention to the corruptible teachings of the scribes and Pharisees .
Sometimes
He would include the teachings of the Sadducees , but it was the Pharisees who became the primary distorters of the writings of Moses and of the prophets , and it was this same group that infiltrated the early Church .
Let 's trace the Pharisee issue just a bit .
The disciples came to Jesus and said , " Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement ? "
Jesus responded , " Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be uprooted .
Let them alone ; they are blind guides of the blind .
And if a blind man guides a blind man , both will fall into a pit . "
( Cf. Matt15:10 - 14 )
What was it that so offended the Pharisees ?
It was when Jesus undermined their teaching on what defiles a person .
In the traditions of the elders , every minuscule of life was regulated - you can't do this , you can't eat that , etc ...
The list is endless .
The Lord had said , " It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the man , but what proceeds out of the mouth , this defiles the man . "
The Pharisees considered themselves to be experts of the Law .
When
He said this to the multitude , the Pharisees became incensed .
It is a little later that Jesus tells the disciples , " Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
After some discussion among themselves , the disciples finally figured it out .
It says , " Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
Since we 've discussed the Talmudic writings in the prior series of studies , let 's see if we can bring this closer home .
Keep in mind that with a view to the gospel , leaven would represent any form corrupted teaching , thus anything that takes away from or adds to the finished work of the cross can be considered leavened teaching .
( This is where members need a good grasp on the work of the cross and on the new covenant . )
For the sake of this study I 'll call attention again to an experience I had as a young preacher .
This took place some 35 years ago .
---
When I first came to the Lord , my life was filled with joy and peace .
My passion for Jesus overflowed - it does to this day - but over time something began to happen .
I still loved the Lord passionately , but I begin to feel something was amiss .
I just did n't know what it was .
One day I said to my wife , " Honey , I feel like I 'm caught in a net and I do n't know what it is . "
Of course she did n't know either .
Never for a moment would either of us had identified the net with bad doctrine , but that is exactly what it was .
Though I was truly born of God 's Spirit , the group that I was associated with had a number of teachings that did not accord with the truth of the gospel .
One of this group 's major teachings was that a person had to speak in tongues to be saved .
That was only a beginning .
If a woman cut her hair , she was lost .
If you had a television in your home , you were lost .
The list was endless .
While their regulations did not approximate that of the Pharisees , many of their standards were of the same nature .
The people were kept in a moment of tension .
The burden was heavy and the net kept tightening - no divine assurance .
To be saved you had to belong to that group .
They alone had the truth .
In my case I had a couple of advantages that perhaps some of the others did not have .
For one thing , my mom had been raised in the strictest sect of Pentecostalism .
When she escaped she never looked back .
She instilled in me that I had a good mind , and that the future held good things for me .
My mom never wanted me to get caught in the net of religion .
In fact I did not know what a church was until I was about 10 years old , yet I prayed to the Lord in heaven every night .
The other advantage I had was that I had a true " born - from - above " experience .
It happened to me in spite of the Pentecostal dogma .
When I was around my Pentecostal friends , I was always puzzled why most of them did n't know if they were saved or not .
It was difficult for me to understand that .
For me that was never a question .
Jesus personally invited me into His kingdom .
I was saved and knew it - but I still had the net to deal with .
Looking back , I can now see the trail of deliverance .
The Lord weaved into my life those I needed to hear from at the right time .
As my eyes were opened to the truths of the cross , the net began to rip .
The moment I saw the net tearing , I swam through it as fast as I could .
Ever since that time , I 've been trying to cut the net for others .
Let 's come back to the Galatian believers for a moment .
They were free !
They enjoyed the awesomeness of the Lord 's presence in their lives .
They were overflowing with peace and grace , then something began to happen .
Their liberty was eroding .
The net was coming into place .
Who was putting the net over them ?
It was the same spirit that Jesus had to deal with - the spirit of the Pharisee .
If you recall this is what the Acts 15 council of the church was about .
Peoples from the nations were being born of God 's Spirit , but a group kept coming behind Paul and Barnabas teaching a doctrine that did not belong to the covenant of Christ .
It says , " Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren , ' Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you can not be saved . ' "
( Acts 15 )
Is n't that amazing ?
Here you have a people who are already saved , who have the Spirit of Christ indwelling them , but someone comes along and says they are n't saved ?
As young believers , their steadiness in Christ was being shaken .
Boy did this ever anger Paul !
The apostle wished the deceivers would castrate themselves .
( Do n't you feel a little like that when you see young believers being mislead ? )
Out of this came the council of the apostles and elders .
Everyone gathered in Jerusalem to see what needed to be done .
This was a serious moment .
Paul and Barnabas began sharing the wonderful news of their travels and of the salvation of the Gentiles .
Then it says , " But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up , saying , ' It is necessary to circumcise them and direct them to observe the Law of Moses . ' "
The battle lines were set .
The debate swung back and forth .
Finally the man of Pentecost stood up to speak .
Everyone got silent .
Peter said , " Brethren , you know that in the early days God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe .
And God , who knows the heart , testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit , just as He also did to us ; and He made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by faith . "
No one spoke .
Peter 's words were settling upon the gathering .
Then comes the clincher .
What Peter says next brings us back to the warning Jesus gave concerning the leaven of the Pharisees .
He continues , " Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the necks of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , in the same way as they also are . "
Did you catch it ?
Everyone is saved the same way .
We are all saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus .
We are saved by grace alone , through faith alone , in Christ alone .
There is no yoke of the law in the new covenant .
We have been yoked to Christ alone .
His Spirit is within us to guide us in the paths of truth and righteousness .
Of course the outcome in all this was the silencing of the Pharisee party , but that was only temporary .
The battle was far from over .
In fact , every generation of God 's people have to battle against the leaven of deceitful doctrines .
The wonderful side in this is that the Lord is always present in the lives of His people to help them process life as He intends .
He weaves us together .
He opens our understanding .
He breaks the nets with the power of truth .
There is so much more to be said about the leaven of the Pharisees , but I want to stop at this point and leave things open for discussion among members .
Just keep in mind what the main thought is behind this aspect of leaven .
The leaven of the Pharisees had to do with teachings that actually nullified or took away from the truths of God .
Think about it .
The study is open .

Buddy

" See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God ; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble , and by it many be defiled . "
( Heb12:15 )
( CNN ) -- Fresh fighting erupted Sunday between Somalia 's transitional government forces and Islamist rebels , continuing a wave of violence that a top United Nations official called a " grave violation of human rights " that could possibly amount to war crimes .
The fighting restarted Sunday with heavy fire in a district north of the capital , Mogadishu , Somalia 's Shabelle radio reported , quoting officials and witnesses .
On Saturday , the security director for the transitional government was killed and at least 40 people , mostly civilians were rushed to Mogadishu hospitals , according to Shabelle .
The United Nations ' human rights chief said the strife in Somalia has caused " enormous suffering and massive displacement . "
" In this new wave of attacks , it is clear that civilians -- especially women and children -- are bearing the brunt of the violence , " said Navi Pillay , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights .
She said attacks against civilians have been a signature feature of the conflicts that have plagued the Horn of Africa nation .
" There needs to be a much greater effort to protect civilians .
Displaced people and human rights defenders , aid workers and journalists are among those most exposed , and in some cases are being directly targeted , " she added .
Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting .
The transitional government has struggled to establish authority , challenged by Islamist groups that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south .
The United Nations estimates that more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee Mogadishu since the latest round of fighting began in early May between the government and the Al - Shabab and Hisb - ul - Islam groups .
U.N. investigators , who spoke with refugees and internally displaced persons , reported that militants had carried out executions , planted land mines , bombs and other explosive devices in civilian areas , and used civilians as human shields , according to a statement from the office of the high commissioner for human rights .
The high commissioner also said there were reports of torture and evidence of child recruitment by forces fighting in Somalia .
" Some of these acts might amount to war crimes , " Pillay said .
It ’s official .
The United States is no longer engaged in a “ war on terrorism . ”
Neither is it fighting “ jihadists ” nor locked in a “ global war . ”
President Obama ’s top homeland security and counterterrorism official on Thursday declared as unacceptable the terms crafted by the George W. Bush administration .
It is now solely a “ war with al Qaeda ” and its violent extremist allies , said John Brennan , head of the White House homeland security office , during a speech Thursday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
The semantic shift is intended to bring precision to the way the president and his aides talk about the nation ’s efforts to defeat al Qaeda , though Bush administration officials say the policies that are being put to use have not changed dramatically .
To say the United States is fighting “ jihadists ” is wrongheaded , Mr. Brennan said , because it is using “ a legitimate term , ‘ jihad , ’ meaning to purify oneself or to wage a holy struggle for a moral goal , ” which “ risks giving these murderers the religious legitimacy they desperately seek but in no way deserve . ”
“ Worse , it risks reinforcing the idea that the United States is somehow at war with Islam itself , ” Mr. Brennan said .
As for the “ war on terrorism , ” Mr. Brennan said , the administration will not use the phrase “ because terrorism is but a tactic - a means to an end , which in al Qaeda ’s case is global domination by an Islamic caliphate . ”
He also dismissed “ global war ” as a term that feeds al Qaeda ’s vision of itself as a “ a highly organized , global entity capable of replacing sovereign nations with a global caliphate . ”
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in March that the administration was not using the term “ war on terror ” but no specific directive had come from the White House itself .
Mr. Obama used the term “ war on terror ” Jan. 23 , his fourth day as president , but he has not used it since .
Juan Zarate , a former deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism to Mr. Bush , was in the audience and dismissed Mr. Brennan ’s speech as cosmetic .
“ It ’s a straw man .
The question is : How do you deal with the policy ? ” said Mr. Zarate , who disagreed with Mr. Brennan ’s suggestion that the Obama administration is not continuing Bush - era policies .
Critics on the left and the right have pointed out that the Obama administration has continued such Bush - era policies as extraordinary rendition and drone attacks in Pakistan .
There remains an international and domestic surveillance program that is cloaked in mystery , and the war in Afghanistan , where Mr. Obama has increased the number of U.S. troops and the military continues to house enemy combatants at Bagram Air Base .
In addition , the White House is still considering the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects .
“ A challenge for John and the administration is to preserve the perception of a new approach while still continuing with counterterrorism strategies that have proven effective , ” Mr. Zarate said .
Mr. Brennan ’s speech was aimed at outlining ways in which the Obama administration intends to undermine the “ upstream ” factors that create an environment in which terrorists are created .
The president ’s adviser talked about increasing aid to foreign governments for building up their militaries and social and democratic institutions , but provided few details about how the White House will do that .
James K. Glassman , who served as Mr. Bush ’s ambassador to the Muslim world as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy , said the focus on “ upstream ” factors was “ a good strategy because it ’s the same strategy that we had . ”

Seeing bears scale walls on ladders puts us one step from living in “ the Golden Compass ” , where armored bears form an army of indestructible killing machines , but at least their discovery of this Rosetta Stone , the key to unlocking new ways to catch and eat us , was a random accident that could n’t be avoided .
A bear that got stuck in a skateboard park climbed up a ladder to make its escape .
The animal had been stuck in the sunken skating bowl overnight and could not get up the steep - sided concrete walls on its own .
Officials in the town of Snowmass , Colorado lowered down a long ladder , which the bear walked across before heading back to the woods .
The bear was uninjured by its experience .
Well Jesus do n’t teach the bears how to climb ladders !
We need those walls , to separate the bears from our succulent arms and legs .
What ’s the second part of your plan , coat doorknobs in honey ?
Jesus Fuckin Christ , I ’m scared to even turn around right now , one of these new Super Bears may have snuck up behind me .
( hq jump here .

FUKK THOSE BEARS UPDATE – luckily the great Jimmy Norton of the Opie and Anthony show has a plan to deal with the bears ( very NSFW language ) .
Does it involve flame - throwers ?
Of course it does .
Why would n’t it .

( CNN ) --
The American Psychological Association concluded Wednesday that there is little evidence that efforts to change a person 's sexual orientation from gay or lesbian to heterosexual are effective .
The report looks at 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007 .
In addition , the 138 - page report -- covering 87 peer - reviewed studies -- said that such efforts may cause harm .
" Contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation , " said Judith M. Glassgold , chairwoman of the task force that presented the report at the group 's annual meeting in Toronto , Canada .
The Washington - based association represents more than 150,000 members .
" At most , certain studies suggested that some individuals learned how to ignore or not act on their homosexual attractions .
Yet , these studies did not indicate for whom this was possible , how long it lasted or its long - term mental health effects .
Also , this result was much less likely to be true for people who started out only attracted to people of the same sex . "
In response , the group 's governing Council of Representatives passed a resolution Wednesday urging mental health professionals not to recommend to their clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or any other methods .
The group 's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation reached its conclusion after its review of 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007 and finding " serious methodological problems " in the vast majority of them .
Those few studies that did have " high - quality " evidence " show that enduring change to an individual 's sexual orientation is uncommon , " it said .
In addition , the report cited evidence that efforts to switch a person 's sexual orientation through aversive treatments might cause harm , including loss of sexual feeling , suicidality , depression and anxiety .
Many who tried to change and failed " described their experiences as a significant cause of emotional and spiritual distress and negative self - image , " it said .
The six - member task force was appointed two years ago to address concerns about " efforts to promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed through psychotherapy or approaches that mischaracterize homosexuality as a mental disorder . "
The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1975 .
The task force noted that some people attempt to change their sexual orientation because it conflicts with their religious beliefs , and recommended that their mental health care providers help them " explore possible life paths that address the reality of their sexual orientation , reduce the stigma associated with homosexuality , respect the client 's religious beliefs , and consider possibilities for a religiously and spiritually meaningful and rewarding life . "
" In other words , " said Glassgold , " we recommend that psychologists be completely honest about the likelihood of sexual orientation change , and that they help clients explore their assumptions and goals with respect to both religion and sexuality . "
Alan Chambers , president of Exodus International , a network of more than 250 ministries that he said " reach out to men and women and families that are affected by what we call ' unwanted same - sex attraction ' " disagrees .
He offered himself as proof that such efforts can work .
" The fact is that there are tens of thousands of men and women just like me who once identified as gay , " Chambers said in a telephone interview .
" For me and for these people , the truth is change is possible . "
Chambers said his transformation from gay man began more than 18 years ago , when he attended a support group at the organization he now leads .
Chambers , who said he married a woman nearly 12 years ago , has written a book , " Leaving Homosexuality , " which was published last month .
" You ca n't refute a personal story , " he said , adding that about a third of those who try to switch their sexual orientation through the group 's ministries wind up doing so .
" We 're not talking a light switch that you turn on and off , we 're talking about very deep and complex issues that , I think , take years to resolve . "
Though all mainstream health and mental health organizations concluded years ago that homosexuality is not a mental disorder , the American Psychological Association formed the task force to work on the report two years ago after noting a resurgence of groups that identified homosexuality as a defect or spiritual or moral failing .

The EyeWriter
Samuel Taylor Coleridge said , ” My eyes make pictures , when they are shut . ”
Well , my friend Tony ’s eyes make graf and they are wide open .
Behold the latest ocular assault weapon from the Graffiti Research Lab , openFrameworks and The Ebeling Group : The EyeWriter .
It is a low - cost eye - tracking apparatus + custom software that allows graffiti writers and artists with paralysis resulting from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to draw using only their eyes .
Tony Quan testing the EyeWriter in Los Angeles
The EyeWriter project is on ongoing collaborative research effort to empower people , who are suffering from ALS , with creative technologies .
The project began in Los Angeles , Caifornia in 2009 , when members of the GRL , FAT , OF and TEG communities teamed - up with a legendary LA graffiti writer , publisher and activist , named Tony Quan , aka TEMPTONE .
Tony was diagnosed with ALS in 2003 .
The disease has left him almost completely physically paralyzed … except for his eyes .
But , the ALS has n’t touched Tony ’s sharp mind , creative energy or his desire to write graffiti .
In August of 2009 , artist from around the world : London , Hong Kong , Madrid , Amsterdam and New York City , converged for 10 days in southern California , converted Mick and Caskey Ebeling ’s Venice Beach house into a laboratory and began to work with Tony on a low - cost , open source eye - tracking system that would allow ALS patients to draw using just their eyes .
EyeWriter hardware prototype V1.4 sketch
10 days later the EyeWriter 1.0 prototype was finished .
This system is constructed from material found in local Venice Beach hardware and electronics stores and the software is written using an open source set of C++ libraries for creative coding from openFrameworks .
Phase 1 of development culminated on April 12th when TEMPT drew his tag for the first time in over 5 years .
His tags were transmitted in real - time and projected outside on a wall he could see from his hospital room window .
Tempts first count of “ eye vandalism ” in real elapsed time , using a GRL MBU , two wireless broadband USB sticks , the mytobii eye tracking systems and custom software Zach wrote in the back of the Wildcat .
Tempt ’s throw - up from the 80’s and his first “ eye- tag ” in 2009 .
The output of the Phase 1 research effort was conclusive : a low - cost , DIY system can be made that will allow ALS patients , with the help of their family and caregivers , to make visual art .
Furthermore , it was demonstrated that when combined with Mobile Broadcast Units , or similar outdoor projection system , a networked version of the EyeWriter can enable patients to have a large - scale , uncurated presence in public spaces .
The GRL MBU
Thanks to Parsons Communication , Technology +
Design program and TEG , Phase 2 of the EyeWriter project will begin in August .
The goal will be a stable 2nd prototype and the online publication of DIY instructions , open source software and video documentation of the project ( available in September 2009 ) .
The long - term goal is to create a professional / social network of software developers , hardware hackers , urban projection artist and ALS patients from around the world who are using local materials and open source research to creatively connect and make eye art .

The following texts , photos and videos document the 10 - day , Phase 1 development of the EyeWriter in Los Angeles , California from April , 2rd to the 12th .
Phase 2 begins August 16th .
Stay tuned for daily updates on FAT and openFrameworks .
The EyeWriter will be featured in upcoming exhibitions in Canada ( CAFKA ) , Japan ( CREAM ) and Paris in 2009 and 2010 .

DAY # 10
Last year me and Evan met a guy named Mick .
Mick had an idea .
It seemed a little … you know … out there .
He told us about a man named Tony , a graffiti writer , who needed our help .
He said Tony had a real bad disease .
Said he could n’t move a muscle , that the disease had only spared his eyes .
Said maybe WE could help him to write again .
And we were arrogant or foolish enough to think maybe , with the help of our friends , that we could .
But in the end , something unexpected happened .
It was Easter and there was an actual miracle .
Because at the end of the day , it was Tony who helped all of us : he helped us to know hope , showed us what it means to be strong , to be a survivor , to be a graffiti writer , to be alive .
It was his father , mother , brother and crew who showed us the meaning of the word family .
It was the Ebelings who showed us what it means to have a vision .
It was through Tony ’s eyes that we finally saw what graffiti was really all about .
So , consider this the beginning , these words an introduction .
If you do n’t already know him , let me tell you about my hero .
His mama named him Tony .
The streets crowned him Tempt .
The disease said he was finished .
But me and my crew , we call him the Eye Writer : a living legend , the first man to bomb with his eyes .
Tempt ’s first tag in seven years
Stay tuned to FAT and GRL , in the next few weeks , to see the whole story , to learn more about TemptOne in his own words , to find out about the EyeWriter V1.0 and to become a part of the project to enable other heroes all over the world , surviving ALS , to once again make art .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
At a time when the government is ostensibly trying to cut health costs , why is it trying to ban something that might help people quit smoking tobacco , perhaps the most devastating health problem in the U.S. ?
The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) held a press conference late last month to scare Americans about the so - called “ e- cigarette ” — claiming it was loaded with harmful “ toxins ” and “ carcinogens . ”
The agency was implicitly saying : Stay away from these newfangled , untested cigarette substitutes — better to stick with the real ones , the ones that we are more familiar with , the ones that cause over 450,000 deaths annually in the U.S .
In making its distorted , incomplete and misleading statement , FDA was violating its long - cherished tradition of sticking to sound science as the basis for its policies .
And in doing so , it is putting the lives and health of millions of Americans at risk .
The truthful part of the FDA statement was that e-cigarettes have not been through formal efficacy and safety tests at the FDA , and they have only been around a few years .
But in the press conference , here is what the FDA did not tell you but should have :
c Traditional cigarettes are lethal not because of the trace level presence of specific “ carcinogens ” and “ toxins , ” but because by using them , smokers inhale enormous amounts of smoke — otherwise known as “ products of combustion . ”
It is the inhaled smoke that kills in so many ways — from cancers , cardiovascular and lung disease , and more .
c The cigarette was a relatively obscure product in our society until the invention of a cigarette rolling machine , and sales rose quickly prior to World War I .
Before that , tobacco was used relatively safely — in chew , pipes , cigars — because little if any smoke was inhaled .
Cigarettes changed all of that .
c The e-cigarette — a cigarette - mimicking device made up of a battery , an atomizer and a cartridge — allows smokers to inhale , getting a dose of the nicotine they crave , and then sending steam out the other end ( with little or no odor ) to mimic the ritual and feel of smoking normal cigarettes .
c The FDA complained that the e-cigarette was a “ nicotine - delivery system . ”
Well , it got that much right .
But again , it ’s the smoke that kills , not the nicotine .
Yes , nicotine is highly addictive , and it is what keeps the smoker hooked .
But getting the nicotine without the smoke is an enormous health advantage for cigarette smokers ( the nicotine inserts come in various strengths and the users can adjust them downward as they wish ) .
c The FDA has approved other nicotine - delivery systems in the form of gums and patches — and they have been abysmal failures .
The smoking cessation rates using these devices is less than 15 percent after one year , condemning millions of addicted smokers to a lingering death .
We desperately need other alternatives .
But the FDA has now joined a long list of so - called public - health organizations — including the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and the American Lung Association — whose collective motto seems to be “ quit or die . ”
Not only do they reject e-cigarettes , but they also condemn other smokeless products like snus , which have a mere fraction of the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes .
c More than 1 million smokers are now using the e-cigarette — a product that offers some , if not all , of the “ social amenities ” of the real thing — holding the cigarette , taking a drag , seeing a plume of “ smoke . ”
The FDA , lacking data that e-cigarettes pose a health hazard , was so desperate , it called on consumers to phone in adverse side effects of e-cigarettes so they could begin to build a case against them and proceed with their intended ban .
They neglected , however , to request smokers who successfully quit using the e-cigarette to also call in .
Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States today .
Any alternative acceptable to addicted smokers should be taken seriously .
Instead of condemning the e-cigarette , the FDA should be sponsoring studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy — leaving it on the market in the interim .

Perfect Dark was one of those games I heard about , but never actually played .
We all have one .
" That game " the masses went Beatlemania over , but which , for one reason or another , we never got around to .
Every time I read a '90s gaming retrospective -- the original came out in 1998 - - it 's like a finger wagging .
Call it parochial ludological guilt .
If you 're like me and do n't have a spare Nintendo 64 lying around , you 'll have a chance to see what all the fuss was about when the Xbox Live Arcade high - def makeover arrives sometime this winter .
That 's right , the entire game , overhauled and enhanced .
In geek - speak , we 're talking 1080 p visuals ( 1920x1080 lines of resolution — the original could run at 640x480 max with severe performance penalties ) purring along at 60 frames per second .
I still can't tell the difference between 30 and 60 ( perhaps , as GTA IV's Brucie might say , I 'm ocularly - inferior ) but if " six - zero - fps " trips your trigger , check out these brand new comparison shots , just posted , and do a little happy dance for included ( formerly absent ) online multiplayer and leaderboard scoring modes .

Feingold Set to Oppose Further Troop Boost for Afghanistan
Created : August 05 , 2009 14:12 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen . Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) ( WDCpix )
If Gen. Stanley McChrystal proposes , as expected , an increase in U.S. troops for the Afghanistan war , Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) is “ likely to oppose it , ” the senator told TWI .
Feingold ’s opposition to what would be the second U.S. troop increase in Afghanistan this year is the most forceful Senate dissent so far to a war that President Obama has embraced .
It represents a preemptive warning to both Obama and to McChrystal , the new commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , who is scheduled to give the Pentagon an assessment of what additional resources he requires for the war next week .
And it highlights what some progressives also opposed to escalation see as an opportunity this summer to change public debate about the eight - year war .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
“ I do n’t think the case has been effectively made for continuing to send more and more troops into Afghanistan , ” Feingold said in a Wednesday interview .
“ I am very unhappy with the answers I ’ve received about the issue of whether constantly increasing troops is helping the situation in Pakistan or making it worse .
I suspect it could be making things worse . ”
Feingold fears that increasing troops in Afghanistan might lead insurgents to cross the border into Pakistan , which is engaged in its own fight against a distinct but affiliated insurgency , and he told The Nation magazine ’s Jeremy Scahill recently that the administration has yet to address that concern .
Next week , McChrystal will present to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen the results of a review compiled for him by a team of about a dozen outside advisers of what changes in tactics , emphasis and resources are necessary to reverse a deteriorating situation .
At least one of those advisers , Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , stated last week that “ Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that McChrystal may defer a decision on additional troops for several more weeks .
As part of a campaign promise to refocus on a neglected war in Afghanistan , President Obama ordered troop levels increased in March by 17,000 combat forces , along with 4,000 troops to train and advise Afghan soldiers and police , and the new forces are scheduled to be in place by next month .
Senior administration officials have expressed concern over a second troop increase this year .
Reportedly , Jim Jones , the national security adviser , told McChrystal and his deputies that any such request would not be welcomed by Obama .
In January , Gates told a Senate panel that he would be “ very skeptical ” of a troop increase much over what Obama ultimately approved .
Obama stated in March that the goal of the troop increase and a new intertwined civil - military strategy for both Pakistan and Afghanistan was to “ disrupt , dismantle and defeat ” al - Qaeda .
Yet at his June confirmation hearing , McChrystal said little about al - Qaeda , and pledged to adopt what he called a “ classic counterinsurgency ” strategy of protecting the Afghan population from insurgent attacks to eventually deny the Taliban - led “ syndicate ” of insurgent groups — some of whom have marginal ties to al - Qaeda — popular support .
Interviews granted by McChrystal and his deputies since arriving in Afghanistan have occasionally downplayed the counterterrorism goals of the strategy , with one anonymous official telling the Los Angeles Times ’s Julian Barnes , “ We have been overly counter - terrorism - focused . ”
Feingold said that he was “ a little worried ” that McChrystal ’s focus for the war is “ much broader ” than Obama’s .
“ I ’m a little worried that it ’s ‘ Let ’s do the surge again , like we did in Iraq and it ’ll all work out fine , ’ ” Feingold said .
“ It strikes me as not fairly in tune with the history of Afghanistan and the geopolitics of the region .
I ’m willing to listen and I ’m willing to give the general a chance to articulate it and maybe it ’ll improve .
But it strikes me as ‘ Let ’s just keep sending more troops in and see what we ’ll do with them after they get there , ’ rather than having a clear vision of what the real goals are . ”
So far , opposition to Obama ’s Afghanistan plans have yet to coalesce in the Senate .
While some members of the House have raised doubts about sending additional troops to Afghanistan — a March 16 letter signed by 14 representatives urged Obama to “ reconsider ” his troop increases and “ resist pressure to escalate even further ” — discussion in the Senate has mostly centered around Armed Services Committee members querying Pentagon officials about whether they have sufficient resources for the war .
Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) took a lonely position against Obama ’s initial escalation .
But Feingold said he was beginning to hear discontent from senators of both parties , particularly as the 40 U.S. troop deaths last month made July the deadliest month of the war for the U.S. to date .
“ A nervousness has developed , not only among Democrats , but Republicans as well , ” Feingold said .
While he said he could n’t “ put a number ” on how many of his colleagues share that concern , he added , “ I ’m hearing more and more misgivings at this point .
One thing I ’m hearing from some of the Republicans is that they know very well that even if you believe that the surge was the key in Iraq [ to reduced violence ] , that this is n’t the same situation . ”
Some war opponents see signs of that nervousness around the country ; a CBS / New York Times poll last week found 57 percent of respondents believing the war was going badly .
Members of Get Afghanistan Right — a coalition of progressive writers , bloggers , filmmakers and activists that launched a website to forestall the Obama administration ’s plans to increase troops in Afghanistan — are looking to the next several months as a key period for public discussion of an expanded war .
One coalition member , the filmmaker Robert Greenwald , plans to screen a film he ’s put together from Afghanistan in key congressional districts during August to pressure lawmakers to come out against the war .
“ There ’s a huge opportunity for elected officials to take a leadership role here , ” Greenwald said .
Greenwald ’s Brave New Films launched a project earlier this year called Rethink Afghanistan , which presents a series of short online videos about the financial and human costs of the war and urges viewers to take action .
The current installment , a video about the plight of women in Afghanistan , is paired with a donation tool allowing readers to get involved .
In advance of a scheduled October theatrical premiere for the entire film , portions of it will be screened at events in districts of select members of Congress , and discussions of the war will be led by a new group of Afghanistan veterans , called Rethink Afghanistan Veterans , that the project has brought together .
“ The reality is this is not a problem that can be solved with a military solution , and most politicians have n’t been there or do n’t really recognize the problems , ” said Jake Diliberto , a member of Rethink Afghanistan Veterans who deployed to Afghanistan in 2001 with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit .
So far , the group has held film screenings or Afghanistan - related meetings in the districts of Maxine Waters ( D - Calif . ) and Laura Richardson ( D - Calif . ) .
Next comes the northern California district of Rep. Mike Thompson ( D - Calif. ) on August 9 and 18 ; the districts of Mike Michaud ( D - Maine ) on August 26 and Chellie Pingree ( D - Maine ) on August 28 ; and hawkish Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) on Sept. 3 .
“ Some folks on the left , the far left , are fairly divided .
Waters and [ Rep. ]
Jim McGovern ( D - Mass . ) think a military solution is not feasible , ” Diliberto said .
“ But there are others like Nancy Pelosi who will support the president till the ships get buried at the bottom of the ocean . ”
Alex Thurston , a blogger at The Seminal who plays a leading role with Get Afghanistan Right , said his individual efforts in the coming weeks would “ focus simply on keeping Afghanistan on people ’s radar , ” and working to prevent Afghanistan from being overshadowed by domestic debates .
He and Brave New Films plan to sponsor a blogger specifically to cover Afghanistan .
“ I believe that when Americans sit down and really reflect , on an informed basis , about how things are going in Afghanistan , they will increasingly oppose troop escalations , ” Thurston said in an email .
( Full disclosure : The Seminal is hosted by the same blog network as my personal blog , and Greenwald and I will speak on a panel on Afghanistan policy at the Netroots Nation convention next week . )
Feingold agreed that domestic worries like health care and the economy have “ almost drowned out ” Afghanistan .
But after attending some recent constituent meetings in Wisconsin , he said , concern was “ starting ” to develop .
“ As usual , ” Feingold said , “ the people are ahead of Washington and the politicians . ”

From my post in October 2008 about my election issue wishlist :
Universal Healthcare .
Everyone I know that freelances
or works a day job and wishes they could quit and follow their dreams
of launching a company complains about the lack of healthcare .
Whenever
I used to talk about freelancing at tech conferences , the first
question was always about healthcare coverage .
I 've heard that in
places like Berlin where you do n't have to worry about where your
healthcare is coming from or how much it costs , up to 35 % of working
age adults are freelancers .
It may sound crazy and anti-capitalist to
consider healthcare for all , but if we flipped a switch tomorrow and
everyone had health coverage I swear a million small businesses would
launch overnight .
I know lots of people that keep a job just to get
healthcare that are wasting their creative talents because they had a
cancer scare or were born with a defect or otherwise are deemed
uninsurable on their own .
I remembered this because I 'm hearing about an ongoing debate about National Healthcare and seeing an economy growing in fits and starts but one that could use a shot in the arm .
I still believe we are losing a great deal of innovation , we are living in a world without inventions , and we 're stagnating in an economy that could benefit from entrepreneurial expansion .
The global economy is constantly changing and though the US used to export things , we now just export ideas , and America could continue to lead with ideas and innovation if the business environment was a welcome place for new entrepreneurs wanting to jump in .
I still know scientists , programmers , designers , photographers , and musicians that hold jobs and dream of someday walking away to work on their real dreams , but the question of how on earth will they pay for healthcare ( stories like this are abundant when you consider 50 % of bankruptcies arise from healthcare bills ) is a major hurdle .
I do n't see how someone could be strongly pro-business and not see an upside to extending the already existing national healthcare for seniors down to age zero .
How many more Googles , Facebooks , and Twitters are we missing with the way things are ?
Sorry , I do n't buy this proof .
In the last code block : sub halts { my $ machine = shift ; my $ input = shift ; is_whatever_nullary ( qq{ run_turing_equivalent ( " \Q$machine\E " , " \Q$input\E " ) ; sub whatever ( ) {} ; } ) } [ download ] is_whatever_nullary ( ) can certainly easily return a true value without having to execute run_turing_equivalent ( ) .
The whatever prototype is a compile - time property and the run-time impact of whatever run_turing_equivalent ( ) does will not change the fact that whatever ( ) is " nullary " at compile time .
But it is quite obvious that Perl code can't be reliably parsed without running Perl code by the simple example of : BEGIN { if ( 0.5 < rand ( ) ) { eval " sub whatever ( ) { } ; 1 " or die $ @ ; } else { eval " sub whatever { } ; 1 " or die $ @ ; } } whatever / 25 ; # / ; die " this dies ! " ; [ download ]
You can , of course , replace the above conditional with some high - falutin ' comp sci construct of your choosing .
But I find that such just detracts from the obviousness .
You have to run " 0.5 < rand ( ) " in order to parse the last line of the above Perl code ( which perl can parse differently each time that it is run , as shown below ) .
> perl - MO=Deparse above.pl # ... whatever / 25 ; - syntax OK > perl - MO=Deparse above.pl # ... whatever (/ 25 ; # / ) ; die ' this dies ! ' ; - syntax OK [ download ] - tye
You spotted an unclarity in my presentation .
I was vague about what " time " the code strings are to be run .
Perhaps this is better : sub halts { my $ machine = shift ; my $ input = shift ; is_whatever_nullary ( qq{ BEGIN { run_turing_equivalent ( " \Q$ machine\E " , " \Q$input\E " ) ; sub whatever ( ) {} ; } } ) } [ download ] Using rand ( ) is indeed more obvious and it was how I tested my code snippets ( I lent my Halting Oracle to a friend and she never returned it ... but do n't get me started . )
I did not use it in the presentation because while it makes the proof more obvious , it 's a proof of a weaker theorem .
If you interpret rand ( ) as truly random ( and not as pseudo - random ) , then we 're dealing with non-deterministic programs .
Someone might then say , " as long as there is no non-determinism while compiling , Perl 5 is statically parseable . "
But it 's not and a proof using the Turing machine simulator shows it is not .
That Perl 5 is unparseable even when the code is completely deterministic is a much stronger result , and the distinction makes a difference in practice .
The Turing simulation in this case is brought in for very practical reasons .
I can't claim the credit for that .
Adam Kennedy 's hint took me in this direction .
I suspect he also knew the business about rand ( ) .
But with his many hours of real life experience trying to statically parse Perl , he focused on the stronger proof -- the one that would give him the most information about what he was up against in creating PPI .

You pretty much nailed it exactly .
From a practical perspective there 's about 5 - 10 things that , in various combinations , make Perl impossible to parse .
However , there 's a big difference between what we believe and what we can prove .
And so from the perspective of knowing absolutely that Perl 5 can't be parsed , the Halting Problem approach was by far the most straight forward way to do it ( at least to a layman like me ) .
This realization let me finally put the possibility of a complete parser out of my mind , and once I was n't distracted by completeness any more , I had the chance to evaluate and actually define what " good enough " would mean for a " Perl 5 parser " .
And that perspective on the problem was the one that took the code in the direction of the working solution .
I do n't really find " If you do n't try to solve the halting problem , then you can parse Perl " to be a " stronger " conclusion than " If you do n't do something random , then you can parse Perl " , other than , of course , the presence of high - falutin ' comp sci lingo in the former .
It is a rather simple fact that you can't reliably parse Perl without running Perl code ( arbitrary Perl code ) .
It reminds me of showing my kids a clock face and asking them to list the properties of the numbers on it .
They never mention that they are sorted , because that just seems too obvious .
The fact that you can't parse Perl is obvious .
Adding useless complication to the conjecture makes it sound more like a rigorous proof , but I do n't believe it actually helped your proof .
A proof that you can't parse Perl , is : BEGIN { my $ proto= " " ; $ proto= " ( ) " if run_some_perl_code( ) ; eval " sub whatever $ proto { } " ; } whatever / 6 ; # / ; [ download ]
The fact that run_some_perl_code ( ) can be any arbitrary Perl code is quite clear .
I guess this then boils down to the argument that somehow static analysis could be used to predict the results of run_some_perl_code ( ) without actually running it .
But the rand example clearly shows that not to be the case .
As does using if @ARGV or if < STDIN > =~ /^y / i or if LWP :: Simple : : get ( " http://perlmonks.org/secretAlgorithm.pl " ) =~ / true / or if unlink " /etc / passwd " or if find_prime_of_length ( ~0 ) % 3 == 1 . Sure , the fact that run_some_perl_code ( ) could be trying to solve the halting problem also demonstrates something .
Of course , if I 'm writing Perl support for an IDE , I 'm not seriously concerned that the declaration of function prototypes is being based on answers to instances of the halting problem , so I 'm likely to just dismiss your proof ( based on your own reaction to the rand case ) .
I find " You might have to run arbitrary Perl code " to be both a stronger statement of the result and a more interesting and useful one .
I also think there is a flaw in your proof in that it confuses solving the halting problem with running code that may or may not halt .
So your conclusion would need to be more like " Here is some code that will either determine that whatever ( ) is nullary or that will never terminate . "
Since just because the code has been taking 400 years does n't mean that you can determine that it will never halt , so your code does n't even have the potential of solving the halting problem .
So the lemma that is needed here is that " Static analysis of a program in a Turing - complete language ( along with its ' input ' ) can be insufficient to determine its output " .
Frankly , this is where it becomes uninteresting to me .

That 's some mighty fine left brain thinking there ( especially for a Monday morning ) , but does it in anyway affect any practical aspect of Perl ?
Like can it be used to show that Perl is more or less reliable / secure ?
This is n't a criticism of your node , but I left college 35 years ago , and this sort of analysis seems very ivory - tower - ish to me now .
It 's sort of like saying " one can not prove self - existence " .
Is the fact that Perl cannot parse itself a good or bad thing , or can other languages do it ?
Does that make them superior ?
Should it be a design criteria for Perl6 ?

As Jeffrey pointed out it means that you can't reliably parse perl code without executing it .
This means that things like static code analysis , code transformation and syntax hilighting will never be reliable .
This is a drawback indeed , but on the other hand it means that modules can extend Perl 's syntax , and that other nifty stuff can be accomplished .
So I understand this node as a proof of a property that is seldom fully understood .
Let 's see :
You can't statically analyse a dynamic language .

I do n't think the fact that Perl is dynamic has anything to do with it .
Lisp ( of any dialect ) is a dynamic language and is trivially easy to parse .
The grammar of the language and its type system are two entirely different things .
It means Perl is alive , ALIVE !!

Would you mind if I converted this to POD and included it the documentation for PPI ?
More to the point here ... what should be done about your findings ?
Perl - 5 obviously is “ in production , ” thousands of times over , and so can not be changed .
The only thing that can be influenced is therefore Perl - 6 ... if that .
We have had “ unresolvable ambiguities ” over the years in a great many languages that have nonetheless proved to be practically successful .
Ergo ... what ?
In the sense I think you might mean , nothing should be done .
I use Perl 5 , I like Perl 5 .
I do n't see a need to regard static unparsability as a problem and " solve " it .
Larry apparently is going to static parsability in Perl 6 .
I do n't have a firm opinion about whether that is bad or good .
I do think that it 's proved wise in the past to listen to Larry in these matters .
The reason for a proof is there had been considerable question about whether Perl 5 was statically unparsable just for practical purposes , or just given present parsing techniques .
Adam Kennedy 's PPI man page says that the module name Parse : : Perl had been reserved in case someone invented a way to statically parse Perl .
Opinion shifted to the point where the most people felt certain that no static parser for Perl existed .
But I think it 's nice to get the issue completely nailed down .
Lack of static parsability is an obstacle for many utilities that deal with Perl 5 code .
That 's definitely a downside .
But it 's not the whole equation , and the ability to do Turing - equivalent fiddling at BEGIN time is an upside .
Larry apparently is going to static parsability in Perl 6 .
You seem to be missing a " not " in that sentence .
The last time I brought this up with Larry , which was admittedly a year ago , he was n't going to budge on either of the dual - nature of " / " or the ability to prototype a subroutine to influence the number of parameters .
Indeed , part of the difficulty in having implemented Perl 6 so far is not being able to have a clean lexical phase , thanks to this wonderful " perfect storm " of desirable features .
You must execute Perl code at compile time , even in Perl 6 , in order to even tokenize the remainder of the file .
The only concession I heard from him is that the results of that executed code would not be promised to be carried forward into the result of the compilation , which seems a bit odd , as it would break things like : my $ x ; BEGIN { $ x = time } [ download ]
Unless the BEGIN block is executed both at compile time and once at pre-run time .
Of course , I might be a few months out of date .
I got bored following all the Perl 6 stuff , so I 'm working on Smalltalk for a while until Perl6 gets a bit closer to a release .

Actually Perl 6 is even harder to ( statically ) parse than Perl 5 , because it is much easier to change the syntax .
You can , for example , introduce new operators very easily : multi sub prefix : < foo > ( Str $ a ) { return $ a eq " foo " ?? " bar " !!
" foo " ; } [ download ]
This will define an unary prefix operator that takes one string as an argument .
When somebody writes foo " foo " ; [ download ]
You can't know if that 's a method call or a call to an operator .
You'd think it makes no difference - but wait until precedence comes into the play : BEGIN { eval " multi * prefix : < foo > ( Str $ a ) is tighter ( &infix : <~ > ) { return $ a eq ' foo ' ?? ' bar ' !!
' foo ' ; " ; } # and later in the code : foo " fo " ~ " o " ; [ download ]
If that foo parsed as a sub call the precedence is lower than that of the concatenation ~ , and the other way round if it 's parsed as an operator .
This is quite a complicated example , but there are much easier ones with " real " macros .
( But since no implemenation really implements macros by now , I do n't really know much about them ) .
Just wondering : does this same idea apply to any language that allows constructs within the code itself to affect the syntactic structure of that code ?
Take , for example , the following theoretical Haskell expression : foo =+= bar //|/ baz =+= qux [ download ]
The parsing of this expression depends on the relative precedence of the two operators and possibily , but not necessarily , on the associativity of =+=
It may also result in an error , if //|/ has higher precedence and =+= is declared as non-associative .
However , the parsing of this does not depend on executing any code in the sense that the OP means , I think .
That is , there must be a static declaration somewhere else in the code that says what the properties of these two operators should be .
It need not lexically precede the usage , but it has to appear somewhere in the relevant scope , and it cannot be dynamically generated in any way .
How would that fit in ?
As with Perl , you cannot make sense of an individual source file without having already seen its dependancies .
And , if you are correct about Haskell allowing use before definition ( which I did n't think it did but ... ) , then multiple passes may be required .

Correctly parsing a Haskell file requires parsing its dependencies , but it does n't require running any Haskell code , since infix declarations are quite static .
What it does mean is that to parse Haskell , you need to figure out the imports and infix declarations before actually parsing expressions .
That 's not very hard to do .
You could , for example , initially parse expressions just into either lists of identifiers or rose trees regardless of precedence .
Once you have the AST for a source file , it 's easy to see the declarations that you need , and then use the information to fix up the expressions based on precedence .
If I catched all correctly , halts ( ) returns true _after_ ran Turing machine $ machine halts .
And , consequently , halts ( ) runs till $ machine runs ...
Any language which has any sort of an eval construct “ cannot be parsed ” statically , because “ that which is to be parsed ” is determined at runtime .
So it really does n't take computer science to prove that .
Furthermore , let the record show that when you input any Perl program into the Perl compiler , it will be parsed , and you 'll either get results or error - messages .
Bottom line is : what 's the point here ?
What are you saying about Perl , and about what ( if anything ) should be done to address this “ issue ? ”
What does this formality actually do for us as practitioners who make our daily bread from this tool ?
This is nonsense .
Eval does not preclude parsing , unless results of evaluating something can alter the parse of another part .
There are many languages that have " eval " and yet have unambiguous parse trees for the actual code of the program ( as opposed to the code evaluated at runtime ) .
If you run this Python program you 'll see it prints out a complete parse tree of the program BEFORE it runs eval .
Before you jump down my throat , I 'm not saying that this makes Python a better language than Perl .
It 's just a fact that a language can be constructed so that " eval " is totally handled at runtime and does not affect the parsability of the program .
import sys import parser print parser.suite ( open(__file__).read ( ) ) .totuple ( ) x = eval ( sys.stdin.readline( ) ) if x : print " yes " , x else : print " no " , x [ download ]
To bring this back to the original post , the " parser " module is the Python equivalent of what Parse : : Perl would be if Perl parsing were possible .
He is saying that in order to statically parse an eval block , you must know when_it_halts - or in otherwords - what it does ; this is impossible with out actually running the eval block , and is clearly related to the halting problem .

I know my post is a little late ...
Maybe we have a disctinction in our definition of " static parsing " , but I think that no language can actually be statically unparseable as long there is a finite number of parsing rules .
Under this condition , there should be a finite number of possible derivations for a certain number of generated symbols .
In Kennedy 's example :
whatever / 25 ; # / ; die " this dies ! " ;
Two interpretations are possible .
There should not be any problem if the compiler find the two ways and produces a check branching to the two interpretations .
Something like this :
if ( is_nullary ( whatever ) ) { whatever / 25 ; } else { whatever (/ 25 ; # / ) ; die " this dies ! " ; }
When we think about it , the Perl interpreter already does this .
So technicaly , parsing Perl is not a undecidable problem .
You only proved that there could not be a single way to parse Perl - and yes , it is a problem for text editor 's syntax - highlighting .
It 's never too late .
Your workaround assumes that somehow is_nullary can determine , if perhaps only at run time , whether whatever is nullary or not .
But an arbitrary function 's prototype is not in general decidable , even at run time .
Here 's some hand - waving , which I hope can render the basic idea plausible : Suppose you can determine whether a piece of arbitrary code establishes ( or not ) a nullary prototype for whatever .
Since the code is arbitary , it can contain lots of stuff , so you 've said you can do more or less a complete analysis of what Perl code does .
That of course includes whether it ever finishes or not .
So you 've also solved the Halting Problem .
But that you can not do .
The two issues -- Halting Problem and undecidability , are intimately connected .
Perl is unusual in allowing Turing - equivalent computing before the parse is determined , and in allowing this pre-parse computing to do things which will affect the parse .
That 's why Perl parsing is undecidable , while the parses for most languages are decidable .
I 've just finished the second of a series of articles in The Perl Review on undecidability in the Perl context .
In TPR I lay the proof out more slowly than I did here in perlmonks .
My discussion in TPR is aimed at Perl programmers who may not have had any interest in Theory for its own sake .
Eventually , I 'll put that series of articles on the Internet .
This is a genuinely difficult area .
Even those academics who've mastered the notation and memorized the results , have a very hard time with the ideas .
This is why IMHO these topics so often are poorly explained .
Your workaround assumes that somehow is_nullary can determine , if perhaps only at run time , whether whatever is nullary or not .
But this is an entirely different problem .
No one claims that calling halt ( ) does n't make any sense just because it is statically undecidable .
This is true for arbitrary programs ( functions ) in a Turing complete language and no one claims that function composition is useless because we can never know whether all of them terminate .
The implicit assumption of your article is that the parser derives one and only one parse tree ( solves all ambiguities ) from an expression and only this assumption has to be given up .
The assertion becomes much weaker then : A Perl parser can't resolve all ambiguities of a Perl program by context sensitive analysis and the solution to this to derive multiple parse trees for an expression and wrap them into a common node that can represent a conditional expression for example .
Type inference ( and as a consequence parsing ? ) in ML ' and I suspect many other functional languages , is complete in deterministic expotential time .
For any practical reasons that 's as close to undecidability as possible .
No , you can parse SML without doing type inference .
The ( only ) tricky part of SML parsing is operator fixity , which does n't depend on types at all .
And yes , SML type inference is superexponential , but only for contrived examples .
So for " any practical reasons " , it 's not even remotely close to undecidability .
I 'm confused by this proof and I do n't buy it , especially since the definitions , including that of " parsing , " are too imprecise to warrant some reduction proof .
You also do n't need reduction to show the existence of an example , which is what you 're essentially trying to do .
You seem to be making the claim that when you have code BEGIN { x ( ) ; sub foo { } } [ download ] then foo( ) will be declared only when x ( ) terminates .
But that 's like writing this Java code for ( ; ;) { } int x ; [ download ] and asking whether " x " will ever be declared , which says absolutely nothing about how this program is parsed ( and it 's parsed fine ) .
Cheers .
In a series of three articles in The Perl Review , now available online , I laid this proof out much more carefully , in three different versions .
The most bullet - proof version derives the result directly from Rice 's Theorem .
You are right that the proof would not go through if the only way of establishing a prototype for a Perl function was via a function definition .
As I said in Perl Review ( 4.3 , p. 28 ) : I must show that I can use Turing - complete Perl code to determine the prototype of the dunno subroutine at compile time .
A function definition wo n’t work .
Summarizing from that article , there are at least two ways that the prototype of a subroutine can be established using Turing - complete Perl code .
One is with symbol table manipulation , for example : BEGIN { * dunno = sub () { 3 } } A second way is to put the function definition into a string which is eval 'd in a BEGIN block .
I believe clever monks will be able to think of others .
You seem to be making the claim that when you have code BEGIN { x ( ) ; sub foo { } } [ download ] then foo( ) will be declared only when x ( ) terminates .
That particular example has a flaw , but it 's easy to demonstrate that the argument holds : use Modern : : Perl ; sub x { say " In x ! " } BEGIN { x ( ) } sub foo ! bar { say ' In foo ! bar ! ' } BEGIN { foo ! bar ( ) } [ download ]

Sorry I did n't get this at all , A binary executable called perl is called so when it can execute programs written in perl programming language .
If perl ( binary named so ) cannot parse perl programs its not perl at all !!!
perl exists , so it can parse every perl program ever written , or perl does n't exit at all ...
And we all know perl exists .

You see the problem .
You need the coffee early in the morning , and yet you have to make the coffee early in the morning .
People should not be required to make coffee until they have some coffee .
I know that many people purchase coffee at a Starbucks or other retail coffee purveyor .
In order for me to do that , however , I would have to get dressed , and one of the great blessings of my current job is that I do not have to get dressed to do it .
( Let me reassure you : I am in fact dressed as I type this .
Just because it's a clothing - optional profession does n't mean there are lots of naked writers around .
Composing prose while nude is unsanitary , marginally abnormal and , in warm weather , painful .
I know for a fact that John Updike was fully clothed while writing each and every one of his 92 novels , 436 short stories and 1,203 essays about art .
I 've had my coffee now .
Can you tell ? )
Because I am bound by the laws and customs of the East Bay , I buy my coffee at Peet's .
I used to buy coffee beans , which meant I would have to start each morning interacting with a machine whose operating principle is sharp blades whirling around at high speeds .
Was this a good idea ?
I think not .
Then one day , after having had a cup of coffee made from ground - at - the - store Sumatra , I realized : I can't tell the difference .
Indeed , I discovered that I do not have very many opinions about coffee .
I know this marks me as an outcast .
If the coffee is grown on the north side of the lush mountains of Jamaica and stored at a temperature of 47 degrees and hand - ground just moments before the hot ( but not too hot ) water comes into contact with it , swell .
If not , also swell .
I like my coffee fresh and hotter than room temperature ; beyond that , I really do n't care .
It 's not that I can't taste the difference between various kinds of coffee ; it 's that I do n't care about the differences .
I suffer from opinion deficit disorder .
To start the day , I enjoy a mock latte .
A mock latte is made with coffee , milk and a little spinning gadget that whips the milk up into a fine froth .
Mock lattes are not quite as good as -- well , yes , they are .
To my taste , anyway .
Just as good .
I could buy a $ 5,000 espresso machine and use up all of my remaining available counter space , but to what end ?
Besides : hot steam in the morning ?
Are you mad ?
So here is what I must do in the morning .
( Please pay attention to this , despite its boring details , as you would to the instructions for assembling your child 's dollhouse , or to an article on freight trains by John McPhee . )
I must take the coffee , the caffeinated coffee ( we have the other kind too ) , and put it in a cone - shaped filter made from wire mesh .
Then I must place the filter into a filter caddy that rests atop the coffee cup .
Then I must fill the back of the Krups coffee machine with water and turn it on .
Then I must take the large Pottery Barn glass and fill it one - quarter full with milk and pop it in the microwave for 40 seconds .
I remove the glass from the microwave , throw a little Splenda brand chemical sugar into the milk , whip the whole thing up and pour the coffee into the glass .
Imagine the possibilities for error .
I do n't have to imagine them , because I 've already done them .
Coffee , pot on , no water -- check .
Water , pot on , no coffee -- check .
Water , coffee , pot not on -- check .
Milk in microwave , but microwave not turned on -- check .
Milk in microwave , microwave turned to four minutes instead of 40 seconds -- check .
( I almost grasped the glass on that occasion , but the fiercely bubbling lava - pit - like milk tipped me off in time . )
Putting coffee where the water goes -- check .
Pouring cold water directly on the coffee -- check .
Putting the water in and starting the pot without putting the coffee filter back in -- check .
( Lovely flood . )
Putting salt into my coffee instead of fake sugar -- check .
( Do n't you think that the makers of salt should be required to put a harmless chemical dye into their product , so that it turns orange and becomes readily distinguishable from sugar ?
I do .
I once gave my granddaughter Cheerios with salt on top .
She loves telling that story .
She remembers nothing else from when she was 3 , but she remembers that . )
I understand we 're touching on addictive behavior here , but has anyone marketed injectable caffeine ?
Not much , you understand -- just enough to get the coffee started .
It 's a grand business opportunity .
There 's nothing like a good cup of coffee , unless it 's another good cup of coffee , which is actually like it in every way north of the atomic level .
