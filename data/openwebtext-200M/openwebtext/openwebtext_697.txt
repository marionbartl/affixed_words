Rejecting aerospace giants Lockheed and Boeing , NASA has awarded $ 3.5 billion in contracts to start - up companies to deliver cargo to the International Space Station after the U.S. space shuttles are retired .
The two start - ups due to start cargo shipments to and from the space station in 2010 : Space Exploration Technologies -- also known as SpaceX - - which is a Hawthorne , Calif . - based company headed by PayPal founder Elon Musk , and Dulles , Va. - based Orbital Sciences .
The $ 100 - billion space station -- being assembled in stages with modules for living and research -- is a joint project of the United States , Russia , Canada , Japan , and European nations .
NASA decided to use commercial contractors for deliveries rather than relying on the Russian Progress cargo vehicles , which help deliver supplies to the space station .
Russia will transport U.S. astronauts to and from the station on its Soyuz capsules after the U.S. space shuttles are retired in 2010 .
The proposed replacement for the shuttles will not be ready to fly until about 2015 .
" These commercial carriers will carry about 40 to 70 percent of our cargo to ( the ) space station , " NASA 's associate administrator for space flight , Bill Gerstenmaier , told reporters on a conference call earlier this week .
SpaceX and Orbital Sciences beat out a Chicago - based consortium called PlanetSpace that included three of the U.S. space agency 's prime contractors -- Lockheed Martin , Boeing , and Alliant Techsystems .
SpaceX 's contract is for 12 flights for $ 1.6 billion , while Orbital will make up to eight flights for $ 1.9 billion .
Both companies had previously been awarded NASA contracts , worth a combined $ 500 million , to develop their orbital cargo delivery systems .
SpaceX plans to launch from a complex it built at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , beside the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
Orbital plans to fly from NASA 's Wallops Island facility in Virginia .

Everyone 's got their favourite console , and usually that choice goes arm - in - arm with the games they grew up with .
Some machines were better than others , but what 's really important is what gave rise to today 's enormous gaming landscape .
Raise a glass , then , to 10 landmark home gaming machines .
Some were smash hits , others were dismal failures - but they 've all earned a proud place in history .
1. Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48 K
A singularly British machine ( it was Sir Clive Sinclair 's finest hour ) , its graphical and sound limitations made it , on paper , more a computer than a gaming platform .
Everyone still bangs on about copying its cassette - based games and the horrible loading noises , but that 's doing its great legacy a huge disservice .
It clocked up well over 10,000 games during its long history - it was the first home to the likes of Manic Miner , Dizzy and Rebelstar , and received ports of most of the major arcade titles at the time .
Never mind that its keyboard felt like zombie skin - the thing was relatively easy to program for , and as such was something of a training ground for many of today 's big developers and unrepentant geeks .
Hell , people are still making games for it even today .
2. Mattel Intellivision
In 1980 , the Atari 2600 reigned supreme - which inevitably inspired a slew of other technology companies to seek a piece of home videogaming pie .
Perhaps the most successful was Mattel 's ' intelligent television ' , with its infamously hyperbolic ( " the closest thing to the real thing " ) ad campaign that shouted about its technical superiority over the incumbent Atari machine .
The Intellivision sold an impressive 3 million units , despite a games library of just 125 , before becoming one of the major casualties of the 1983 videogame crash .
While the history books give it less space than its major rival , it 's notable as being the first 16 - bit home games machine , the first with 16 - way directional controller , the first with real - time voices ( so long as you had the Intellivoice add - on ) and the first with downloadable games - which vanished when you turned the thing off , as it lacked writeable storage .
3. Sega Dreamcast
The turn of the 21st century does , of course , belong to the PlayStation 2 , but Sega 's final console was the first of that sixth - generation of home gaming systems , and to this day inspires unbelievable loyalty amongst its fanbase .
Hardware shortages , mediocre marketing , the lack of EA 's otherwise omnipresent sports games and Sega 's bad rep off the back of the preceding Saturn and 32X consoles meant it could n't compete with the PS2's eventual blitzkrieg .
It was a pioneer of online gaming , however - the shining light of the modem age .
Its MMO Phantasy Star Universe still runs to this day .
It even had a web browser and supported keyboards ( the latter was also memorably employed in bonkers spelling - shooter The Typing of the Dead ) .
The Dreamcast might be long off the shelves , but its scene continues to thrive - which is at least partly due to the crazy ease of running pirated and homebrew games on it .
4. Nintendo Gameboy Advance
The heyday of pre-3D home gaming in your hand .
While Nintendo's portable consoles ' huge success tends to rely on the kiddie market , the third - gen Gameboy really hit all the right beats for nostalgics and the hardcore .
Gorgeous remakes of classic Marios and Zeldas made it seem like the NES / SNES golden years never ended , while new sequels to beloved series kept 2D gaming very much alive in an age obsessed with 3D .
The GBA still lives to this day , its design simplicity and lack of gimmickry lending it an appeal its follow - up , the DS , never quite managed .
5. Atari 2600
The flagship of the first big home console boom , the Atari 2600 popularised the idea of games appearing on swappable cartridges ( the more costly forerunner to today 's CDs and DVDs ) rather than being built - in to the hardware .
In 1977 , home gaming was Pong , Pong and more Pong : the Atari ( as it was simply known to most ) changed all that , reinvigorating the market with ports of arcade darlings such as Space Invaders .
Unfortunately I have nothing but sleep and wake problems with my brand new Unibook MacBook Pro .
Before anyone asks :
Yes , I did install the latest 1.6 firmware update .
The latest incident :
I just unplugged my MBP from my external screen and the power .
I did not close the lid first .
What I do is that I wait for the menu bar to move from the external screen to the MBP screen .
Then I close the lid .
I moved to another room and opened it .
No problem and I worked on it for a bit .
Then I closed it and made a coffee .
Now I ’m back and open the MBP and the screen stays dark .
The white power led did turn off .
There is no way to get the screen back on .
Only a reboot works .
I lose my workspace and some open files .
Lame .
What is this ?
Some Wintel piece of crap ?
For the record : I run no strange software on this Mac .
This is my main development machine and I depend on it daily .
So I do my best to keep it as standard as possible .
It ’s a default 10.5.5 install with the most non-standard thing on it being LaunchBar .
This is getting so annoying that I am now thinking about selling this Unibody MacBook Pro and getting the previous model .
This is pretty much an unworkable situation for someone like me who moves around a lot .
Lame .
Backwardization Of Gold And The Upwardization Of Gold And Silver Prices
Systemic crises are caused by the inability of systems to respond to stress .
When systems can no longer adequately respond , systemic collapse ensues .
We are currently witness to the end of a system of paper money based on credit and debt , a system now in the final stages of collapse .
THE COMING DESTRUCTION OF PAPER MONEY IS GOING
TO MAKE SHERMAN’S MARCH TO THE SEA
LOOK LIKE A SUNSHINY DAY
In Sherman ’s “ march to the sea ” , a military campaign that broke the back of Confederate resistance during America ’s Civil War , according to Wikipedia , the Union general , Sherman , applied the principles of scorched earth , ordering his troops to burn crops , kill livestock , consume supplies , and destroy civilian infrastructure along their path .
The American South , preferring to see the war in terms of a conflict between the industrial North and the agrarian South instead of over slavery , never forgave the North for Sherman ’s “ scorched earth ” campaign and its victory .
This Southern resistance lasted for one hundred years , from the end of the American Civil War in 1865 to the 1960s .
But in the 1960s , societal change swept through America and the resurgent issues of civil rights and women ’s liberation set in motion a massive Southern backlash that sent the Democratic Southern voting bloc into the welcoming arms of the Republican Party .
This new alliance , composed of Republicans and former “ Dixiecrats ” , shifted the balance of power in America for the next fifty years ; and consequently consolidated economic power in the hands of America ’s financial and corporate elites in the Republican Party .
The concomitant unraveling of the wealth and power of the elites and the Republican Party in 2008 is not coincidence .
Another more powerful shift than even the 1960s is now underway and current power structures and economic elites are being swept away in its presence .
This shift is not yet over .
It has only just begun .
While change happens in increments , sometimes those increments are seismic in scope instead of imperceptible and constant .
Such are the changes in motion today .
When they are over , the world as we know it will be gone .
It ’s getting worse very quickly …
It ’s like an avalanche in that it gains momentum .
And that ’s what we ’re in right now , so it ’s a real crisis .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , Republican Governor of California , December 1 , 2008
Buckminster Fuller in his book on mankind ’s future , The Critical Path ( 1981 ) , called this crisis , the Twilight Of The World ’s Power Structures .
And just as Fuller predicted , the world ’s economic power structures began to fall .
Communism collapsed in 1991 and now in 2008 , Capitalism is following in Communism ’s footsteps .
All managed markets — whether managed by government allocation as under Communism or by government sponsored central bank credit as in Capitalism — are doomed to failure .
The triumph of free markets over managed markets is coming .
WHEN SYSTEMS COLLAPSE RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
Hope that recent political changes can resuscitate the system of central bank credit and paper money is futile .
The new economic team appointed by President - elect Barack Obama is but a resuscitated version of the old team , the very ones responsible for the present system and its fatal problems .
From the November 28 , 2008 Wall Street Journal :
Thanksgiving Cheer From Obama
He 's assembled a first - rate economic team
By Karl Rove
Mr. Obama … picked as Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner … Mr. Geithner has been a key player with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in confronting the financial crisis .
Every major decision in the rescue effort came only after the three agreed .
The National Economic Council director - designee , Larry Summers , is another solid pick .
Mr. Summers has been an advocate for trade liberalization , he was the Clinton administration 's negotiator for the financial deregulation known as Gramm - Leach - Bliley …
Obama appointee Lawrence Summers ’ 1999 support of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley bill is indeed noteworthy as Gramm - Leach - Bliley repealed the Glass - Steagall Act , specifically passed in 1933 to prevent another depression .
Clinton ’s signing of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley bill in 1999 directly led to the financial deregulation responsible for the decimation of financial markets in 2008 .
Former Bush advisor Karl Rove is right .
Acknowledgment is due both Summers and Clinton for their collective contribution to today ’s “ free ” falling markets .
It is no coincidence that both Lawrence Summers and another Obama appointee , Paul Volker have been instrumental in the past in the manipulation of the price of gold , the very indicator that bears witness to the false promises of paper money .
In 1988 , Summers co-authored a paper , Gibson 's Paradox and the Gold Standard , wherein he postulated that by fixing the price of gold , interest rates could be stabilized ; an assertion as absurd as believing fixing the temperature of thermometers can prevent global warming .
Clever boys
Far too clever
For their own good
And others
Summers ’ confederate ( def. , one who assists in a plot ; an accomplice ) in the war between paper money and gold on Obama ’s “ team of hope ” , Paul Volker , is best known for his courageous raising of interest rates in 1981 .
Volker is less known for his remark that it was a mistake not to have earlier “ managed ” the price of gold .
Volker , Geithner , Summers , et. al. are all insiders in the imploding system of paper money .
Appointing Volker to head the President ’s Economic Recovery Board may raise the hopes of the desperate but it will do nothing to stem the tides of change .
When systems fail , even those as able as Confederate General Robert E. Lee cannot prevent their collapse ; and , when the present system fails — and it will fail , it will result in a far better world — a world in which we will again be free from slavery to debt , imposed by a conspiracy of bankers and politicians .
THE BACKWARDIZATION OF GOLD AND THE UPWARDIZATION OF GOLD AND SILVER PRICES
Those fortunate enough to attend the final session of Gold Standard University Live in Canberra , Australia ( attendees from Europe , North America , South Africa , Asia as well as Australia and New Zealand ) , heard Professor Antal E. Fekete explain the origin and significance of trading the basis with respect to gold and silver .
Professor Fekete recently posted his article , Red Alert : Gold Backwardization !!! , in which he alerted readers that for the first time in history the cash price of gold is higher than the nearest futures price , indicating that buyers value the present physical possession of gold more highly than future possession .
Professor Fekete stated that when gold recently moved into backwardization on December 2nd , a historical line had been crossed , a line which signified whether or not the present system could be saved .
Now , according to Professor Fekete , with gold in backwardization , it cannot .
While the war between paper money and gold and silver is still being waged , according to Professor Fekete the outcome is no longer in doubt as the present system is now beyond redemption .
This has profound implications for the future price of gold and silver and for gold mining shares .
In the last Great Depression , the shares of Homestake Mining , the world ’s largest gold mine , went from $ 4.19 in 1929 to $ 495 in 1935 , paying a $ 56 dividend that year .
In the coming depression , gold and gold mining shares should do just as well — and , after the onset of the depression , just imagine what they will do during hyperinflation .
THE COMING CAPITULATION OF PAPER
Physical gold and silver , whether in hand or in the ground will be the last refuge for the trillions of dollars still invested in paper assets .
With an estimated $ 27 trillion of wealth already lost this year , the day is coming when the last believers in paper assets will finally look to gold and silver to preserve their dwindling wealth .
But when that day comes , those owning monetary metals will not exchange their gold and silver for paper money at any price , i.e. permanent backwardization ; and the last believers in paper assets will be stuck with now worthless government issued coupons which previously had passed for money .
The recent historic backwardization of gold is a clear indication that sometime in the future a state of permanent backwardization will occur — and on that day , the world will finally be free from the tyrannical slavery of central bank induced indebtedness .
Freedom , oh freedom
Someday we will be free
Freedom , oh freedom
How sweet that day will be

About Darryl Robert Schoon
In college , I majored in political science with a focus on East Asia ( B.A. University of California at Davis , 1966 ) .
My in - depth study of economics did not occur until much later .
In the 1990s , I became curious about the Great Depression and in the course of my study , I realized that most of my preconceptions about money and the economy were just that - preconceptions .
I , like most others , did not really understand the nature of money and the economy .
Now , I have some insights and answers about these critical matters .
In October 2005 , Marshall Thurber , a close friend from law school convened The Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN ) , a group of individuals whom Marshall believed to be " out - of - the - box " thinkers and I was asked to join .
The PDN became a major catalyst in my writings on economic issues .
When I discovered others in the PDN shared my concerns about the US economy , I began writing down my thoughts .
In March 2007 I presented my findings to the Positive Deviant Network in the form of an in - depth 148 - page analysis , " How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper In The Process . "
The reception to my presentation , though controversial , generated a significant amount of interest ; and in May 2007 , " How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process " was made available at www.survivethecrisis.com and I began writing articles on economic issues .
The interest in the book and my writings has been gratifying .
During its first two months , www.survivethecrisis.com was accessed by over 10,000 viewers from 93 countries .
Clearly , we had struck a chord and www.drschoon.com , has been created to address this interest .

Brains , not brutality needed , former interrogator argues David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008
Print This Email This
Not only is torture cruel and immoral , according to its critics , but a former US Air Force interrogator says that it does n't even work -- at least , not nearly as well as kindness .
The author of How to Break a Terrorist , who is using the pseudonym of Matthew Alexander because he is still in the Reserves , told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Wednesday , " It 's extremely ineffective , and it 's counter - productive to what we 're trying to accomplish . "
" When we torture somebody , it hardens their resolve , " Alexander explained .
" The information that you get is unreliable .
...
And even if you do get reliable information , you 're able to stop a terrorist attack , al Qaeda 's then going to use the fact that we torture people to recruit new members . "
" How long is it going to take to undo that damage ? "
Olbermann asked , referring to Alexander 's observation that " I learned in Iraq that the No. 1 reason foreign fighters flocked there to fight were the abuses carried out at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo . "
" I'm an optimist on that point , " Alexander answered .
" In the book , I tell several stories about how I sat down with some hardened members of al Qaeda , and by treating them nicely , by showing them respect .
...
In one case ... in a matter of six hours I was able to convince him that we could work together and get over the past and work toward a better Iraq . "
When Olbermann asked what advice he would give to President - elect Obama , Alexander instantly replied , " I think we have to outlaw torture across the government .
...
Every agency , no exceptions . "
" Then the next thing we need to do , " continued Alexander , " we need to improve the way we train interrogators . "
He described his own method as " rapport - based relationship - building approaches , where we get to know the person , we build a relationship of trust . "
In his book , Alexander explains in more detail , " It means , ideally , getting to know the subject better than he knows himself and then manipulating him by role - playing , flattering , misleading , and nudging his or her perception of the truth slightly off center .
...
Respect , rapport , hope , cunning , and deception are our tools . "
" Interrogations overall is just one one facet of how we execute this war , " Alexander told Olbermann in conclusion , " and it has to be conducted in a way that 's consistent with American principles . "

Reggie Bush & Kim Kardashian Engagement Plans
According to New Orleans Saints running back , he is feeling some pressure to announce his engagement to his Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star girlfriend
The couple chatted it up with ET reporter Kevin Frasier and seem to suggest that an engagement announcement is forthcoming but it will be on their terms and on their time schedule .
According to the NFL player : " We 've still got time .
We 'll know when the time is right .
We 're not planning according to what other people think or what they think we should do , or when they think it should happen .
It 'll happen , and we 'll both know it 's the right time , and when it does , we 'll make it happen . "
Kardashian , who did a short stint on Dancing with the Stars , gave her own spin with the comment , " He 's trying to make it a good surprise . "

A former Los Angeles priest pleaded guilty Tuesday to molesting a young boy 20 years ago and admitted to three other cases that he cannot be charged with because of a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision , the district attorney ’s office announced .
Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Ann Marie Wise of the Sex Crimes Division said the admission by George Miller , 70 , means that the three victims whose cases cannot be prosecuted will be allowed to address the court when he is sentenced Jan. 30 by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Cynthia Ulfig .
Miller , who has been free on bail since his arrest in July 2007 , faces a three - year prison term , Wise said .
He must serve at least 85 % of that term before being eligible for parole consideration .
“ No amount of prison time is sufficient for the crimes he has committed , ” Wise said .

The defendant was charged with molesting a boy that he met while assigned to the Guardian Angel Church in Pacoima .
Authorities said Miller befriended the victim ’s mother and became a frequent guest at the family home .
He was charged with molesting the boy between March 1988 and March 1991 .
In 2002 , Miller was charged with molesting the victim ’s older brother and two other boys .
But those charges were later dismissed after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the California law that had extended the statute of limitations on child molestation for decades - old sexual abuse .
The district attorney ’s office also had to dismiss more than a dozen other cases against priests or former priests accused of child molestation .

The new case against Miller was filed in July 2007 after the victim came forward .
The defendant was charged with six molestation counts .
Miller pleaded guilty to a lewd act on a child under the age of 14 .
The remaining counts will be dismissed after Miller is formally sentenced .
Miller ’s victims were among the more than 500 civil plaintiffs who received a record $ 660 - million settlement last year from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles .
Miller ’s confidential church files are the subject of a more than four - year court battle involving the district attorney ’s office and the archdiocese .
Church officials argued that their disclosure to a county grand jury would violate priest - bishop communications and priests ’ privacy rights .

The archdiocese yielded after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 declined to hear an appeal .
Church officials said they got complaints about Miller in 1977 and 1989 .
In both cases , he denied wrongdoing .
In 1996 , after Miller was accused of molesting a child , he was placed on leave .
Church officials said Miller never returned to ministry and was reduced to lay status by the pope in May 2005 .

Times staff writer Duke Helfand contributed to this report .
Marie Theriault - Sabourin is a manager in the registrar 's office at Algonquin College in Ottawa .
She has a master 's degree in business administration .
Quami Frederick used her bachelor 's degree to get into Toronto 's Osgoode Hall law school and was offered a job articling with a Bay St. law firm .
Armed with his Ph.D in political science , police tactical trainer Augustus Michalik counts various Canadian and U.S. law enforcement agencies as his clients .
The problem is , their university degrees are fake .
They are among at least 220 Canadians with bogus academic credentials uncovered in a recent probe .
Worldwide , fake degrees are a billion dollar industry , even threatening government security , investigators say .
Last week , an undercover Star investigation exposed Peng Sun , a York University grad who forges university degrees from real Canadian universities for $ 4,000 .
Sun 's client list was not available , but the Star obtained a list of Canadians who bought fake degrees from an American diploma mill busted three years ago by the U.S. Secret Service and Homeland Security .
St. Regis University , which granted degrees under various names , was a complete fake .
Canadians on its " buyers list " gave the Star one of three explanations : some admitted the degrees were bogus , some claimed they submitted course work ( but did not provide proof to the Star ) , and others thought they were awarded real degrees for life experiences .
" I do n't want my name in ( the story ) , " said Theriault - Sabourin , who is the manager of scheduling in the registrar 's office at Algonquin , a 16,000 - student college in Ottawa .
She said she now understands the master 's degree she purchased in 2000 for $ 1,350 is bogus .
Her husband , Leo , bought two , a bachelor 's degree in business and an MBA in marketing .
The couple have a turbulent financial past and it's unclear what role the fake degrees played .
Leo was found guilty in an Ottawa court of tax evasion and fraud last May for evading almost $ 5 million in income taxes he prepared for dozens of clients , mainly chiropractors .
Marie declared bankruptcy earlier this year with more than $ 680,000 in debts and Leo declared bankruptcy in 2002 , owing $ 483,000 ( Leo was discharged from bankruptcy , and Marie 's more recent bankruptcy is facing a court hearing ) .
" I never used it , and never will use it , " Marie said of her degree , which she obtained just before she began her duties at Algonquin .
Her husband , who is awaiting sentencing , could not be reached for comment .
Responsibilities of the registrar 's office at Algonquin include authenticating degrees from other educational facilities .
A college spokesman would not comment .
The couple 's degrees came from a Washington State diploma mill .
Eight ringleaders pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud charges .
They set up 120 fake schools with names like St. Regis University and James Monroe University .
There were no courses or classes .
The head provost of St. Regis University was a high school dropout .
The gang raked in more than $ 7 million in sales to 131 countries .
It sold everything from high school diplomas to PhDs and medical degrees .
Dozens of U.S. government employees are on the list , including a White House staff member , National Security Agency employees , a senior State Department official , and a Department of Justice employee .
Tens of thousands of people are walking around with " ticking time bombs in their resumes , " says Allen Ezell , a former FBI agent who has spent a big chunk of his career investigating diploma mills .
This week Quami Frederick 's blew up on her .
A third - year Osgoode Hall Law School student , Frederick , 28 , is on the list as having paid $ 1,109 for a " B.A. " in Business Administration , plus a transcript of marks .
Using the degree transcript , Frederick got into Osgoode as one of 290 students selected from 2,500 applicants in 2006 .
Contacted by the Star several weeks ago , Frederick initially denied everything , suggesting she might be the victim of identity fraud .
" I 'm not worried because I never bought any degree from any university , " said Frederick , who expected to graduate next year and has a job lined up with Wildeboer and Dellelce , LLP .
The law firm noted her degree on its website , welcoming her aboard as an articling student .
This week , after much soul searching , Frederick changed her story .
" I 'm sorry .
I should n't have lied to you , " Frederick said .
" I should 've levelled with you .
I figured you 'd call the university and they would n't tell you anything and that would be the end of it . "
The change of heart came after the Star found she never attended St. George 's University in Grenada , from where she claimed to have an undergraduate degree .
Frederick 's case is different from others .
St. George 's is a real university and it appears the degree mill forged documents from there .
Frederick now says " the truth " is she spent $ 8,000 for a six - month , " fast - track " online business degree in 2004 .
School spokesperson Lisa O'Connor said St. George 's does not offer this type of online course .
" Her degree is completely bogus , " said O'Connor , noting the fake transcript shows Frederick spent four years at the school and made the Dean 's honour list with a near perfect 3.93 grade point average .
" No one by the name of Quami Frederick has ever been a student at our school . "
Frederick told the Star this week that the associate dean of Osgoode Hall Law School at York University has launched an investigation into " a potential breach of academic honesty " and she may be expelled .
A York spokesperson said they have a department that verifies applicant 's credentials , but would not comment on Frederick 's case .
The law firm removed her name from its website yesterday and is investigating .
The St. Regis degree mill was shut down in August 2005 after a Secret Service agent , posing as a retired Syrian army weapons specialist , applied for three degrees , saying he needed them urgently to stay in the United States .
The only requirement St. Regis made of this potential terrorist was whether he would be paying with Visa , MasterCard or American Express .
Two weeks and $ 1,277 later , the fictional Mohammed Syed got his degrees in chemistry and environmental engineering , based on his " life experience . "
Seeing St. Regis as a threat to national security , a task force comprised of eight federal agencies moved quickly .
In six years of operation , St. Regis had spread its tentacles around the globe ensnaring clients across Europe , Russia , the Middle East and Asia .
Operators used email to spam potential customers with tempting offers that included , " buy one degree at full price , get a second free . "
Wayne Victor Cook bought two .
A former provincial and municipal candidate in Ontario , Cook claims his public affairs company Wayne Cook Public Affairs Consulting confers with the president of the United States at the White House .
He also claims on his website that he played a key role in getting John Tory elected as leader of the Ontario Conservative Party .
Listing numerous blue chip companies and Ontario universities as employers and clients on his curriculum vitae , Cook also claimed to have an Executive MBA from the very real Heriot - Watts University in Edinburgh , Scotland .
He does not .
What he does have is two bogus degrees , an MBA and a Ph.D. , purchased from the St. Regis diploma mill in 2004 .
Cook , who ran for the Ontario Liberals in Beaches - Woodbine in 1981 and Toronto City Council in 1997 , losing both times , paid $ 1,133 for a Ph.D. and an MBA in Human Resources Management .
Just hours after being contacted by the Star , Cook 's online bios underwent radical changes .
His Executive MBA from Heriot - Watts is now " expected " in 2010 .
All references to his MBA and PhD were deleted .
" I do n't have an interest , and really do n't have any comments for you , " Cook replied when asked to explain the vanishing degrees .
A spokesperson for John Tory denied Cook played any role in his election as leader .

Design engineer Terry A. Hrushka is so proud of his three degrees from St. Regis that he 's posted them on his website – a Bachelor of Science in Natural Physics in 1992 , a Master of Applied Science in 1994 , and a Doctorate in Process Physics in 1996 .
The problem is St. Regis University , which falsely claimed it was accredited by the government of Liberia , did n't issue any degrees , bogus as they were , until 1999 .
What they did do was graduate any student with a credit card on any date they wanted .
" What you have written to me has devastated my life , " Hrushka said in an email to the Star , responding to written questions .
Hrushka said he thought his degrees were real .
" I have now wasted six years of my life and just over $ 50,000 U.S. "
" I wish I had the records to prove all this , " Hrushka wrote , claiming he took correspondence courses from St. Regis .
" But unfortunately they were lost over time as I moved around a great deal . "
Martial arts expert Augustus Robert Michalik counts the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , the U.S. Navy Seals , CIA agents and police officers from across Ontario as students of his Police Tactical Training and Black Arts courses he has taught for years .
Proudly posted on his website are certificates of achievement including one issued to " Dr. Augustus Michalik , PhD " , by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research for courses in Global Terrorism .
Author of several books , including The Knife Fighting Anti-terrorist Handbook , Michalik purchased his degree in " Political Science " for $ 1,340 in 2003 , and paid for it with a credit card , according to the information compiled by the U.S Justice Department .
" You 've got the wrong guy , " Michalik said when reached on his cell phone at his base in London , Ont. , saying he had just returned from a consulting job in the Philippines .
" That 's not me . "
His Ph.D. is in " political philosophy dealing with terrorism , " Michalik said , but refused to name the university .
" If you want , you can talk to my lawyer , " Michalik said , then hung up .
Days later , all references to his Ph.D. disappeared from the website of Homeland Security Inc. where Michalik is the CEO .
The Star was unable to determine which officers from the RCMP or other forces Michalik has trained .
One degree recipient , Dr. Anthony Alsayed , says he has instructed his lawyer to sue the people behind St. Regis in an attempt to clear his name .
A Lebanese - born Canadian with a medical degree from People 's Friendship University in Moscow , Alsayed admits he made a mistake in trying to piggyback a PhD from St. Regis on to his medical degree from Russia .
" I'm a victim in this .
It 's not as if I 'm a plumber who was looking for a PhD in education , " Alsayed , said in an interview at his Mississauga home .
" I have my MD .
I 'm a real doctor . "
His medical degree is recognized in Canada , Alsayed said , but he is not licensed to practice as a physician .
Until recently he ran a company that prepped students to take their medical exams .
Alsayed showed the Star a receipt for $ 1,659 for his PhD in " Medical and Health Care Education . "
He also paid $ 650 to a U.S. degree certification company that checked out St. Regis and told Alsayed his degree was issued by a bona fide university accredited by Liberia .
What Alsayed did not know was that the St. Regis scam artists had fooled everyone , creating a website purporting to be that of the Liberian government , which heaped praise on St. Regis as a great university .
To add insult to injury , St. Regis took the marks Alsayed got from his medical courses in Russia , and lowered them in the transcripts they sold to him .
When he protested , they sent him an email saying a PhD in " Medical Management " from St. Regis was a very tough degree to earn .
" My wife says I 'm naïve , " Alsayed said of how he fell for the scam .
" I thought this was the way they did things in North America . "
Teacher Kin-Yau " Kenny " Wong has a real master 's in business from the University of Toronto , then went and endangered his career by adding a bogus Ph.D. from Belford University to his academic record .
" I tried to use it at my school , but later on I found out that was wrong , " Wong said .
" I can frankly say I did not use it for any financial gain , " said Wong , who paid $ 1,540 for the bogus Ph.D. in education .
" I admit I did something wrong , " Wong said .
" I just tried to satisfy my own ego . "
Bogus degrees are a billion - dollar - a - year industry , says former FBI agent Ezell , who has spent most of his career investigating the sale of counterfeit and bogus college credentials and is now vice - president for corporate fraud investigation for Wachovia Bank .
Ezell , who headed the massive FBI investigation in the late 1980s , estimates there are 400 Internet diploma mills spewing out 200,000 bogus diplomas a year .
More than 85 per cent are located in the U.S .
The fallout from the St. Regis bust is just now being felt across America .
Fourteen New York firefighters were fined more than $ 135,000 after they submitted bogus degrees from St. Regis in attempts to gain promotions .
Six Chicago - area police officers also purchased bogus degrees .
One cop even submitted his " tuition " from St. Regis for reimbursement from the department .
His superior , who signed off on the expense , had also obtained a bogus degree from the same diploma mill .

Putin planned to topple the president of Georgia and ' hang him by the b****' , says Nicolas Sarkozy 's chief adviser
Vladimir Putin threatened to oust the President of Georgia and ‘ hang him by the b****’ , it emerged yesterday .
The threat came during a meeting with Nicolas Sarkozy after the French President had flown to Moscow to broker a peace deal following Russia ’s invasion of Georgia .
Putin ’s outburst was overheard by Sarkozy ’s chief adviser Jean - David Levitte during the talks between the two leaders on August 12 .
' Threat ' : Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin threatened to hang out Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili ' by the balls ' during a summit with French president Nicolas Sarkozy it is claimed
In an interview with the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur , Mr Levitte said it happened after Sarkozy told Putin the world would not accept Russia toppling Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili and installing a puppet government .
Mr Putin stormed : ‘ I am going to hang Saakashvili by the b****.’
Mr Sarkozy responded : ‘ Hang him ? ’
Putin said : ‘ Why not ?
The Americans hanged Saddam Hussein . ’
Mr Sarkozy replied : ‘ Yes , but do you want to end up like Bush ? ’
Mr Putin was briefly lost for words before answering : ‘ Ah , you have scored a point there . ’
Mr Sarkozy ’s advisers said later the exchange marked the moment that Mr Sarkozy persuaded Mr Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev to begin withdrawing troops from Georgia .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy greeting Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili in Paris on Thursday a day ahead of the European summit
Yesterday President Saakashvili – on a state visit to France – laughed nervously when told of the threats during a live radio interview in Paris .
He went on to voice dismay at France ’s haste in trying to restore EU relations with Moscow .
Putin 's menacing tirade was overheard by Sarkozy 's chief adviser Jean - David Levitte during talks between the two leaders
He said : ' I never imagined a few months ago that I would be saying such things but unfortunately those are the facts .
' I do n't feel that Europe has abandoned Georgia just yet .
But if it happens , all my values , all my personal principles , all my promises to my people , will be destroyed . '
Meanwhile , U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates accused Russia last night of trying to intimidate Barack Obama into dropping American plans for a new missile defence system in Eastern Europe .
‘ Within hours of the conclusion of the American election , Russian President Medvedev responded by threatening to place missiles in Kaliningrad – hardly the welcome a new American administration deserves , ’ said Mr Gates .
President Medvedev has told French daily Le Figaro that Moscow was ready to reverse its decision to station missiles close to the Polish border if the new American administration after Bush decided to abandon its own anti-missile system in central Europe .
Mr Medvedev added : ' We hope to build frank and honest relations and resolve with the new administration the problems that we have not managed to resolve with the present one .
' The new American president enjoys great confidence .
He has been elected in a very complicated time and I wish him a lot of luck in his post . '
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Recent data suggests that many borrowers who received help with mortgage modifications earlier this year tended to re-default on their payments , a top U.S. banking regulator said on Monday .
John Dugan , head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , listens during the annual Reuters Regulation Summit in Washington January 11 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Mannie Garcia
“ The results , I confess , were somewhat surprising , and not in a good way , ” said John Dugan , head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , in prepared remarks for a U.S. housing forum .
“ Put simply , it shows that over half of mortgage modifications seemed not to be working after six months , ” he said .
Dugan said based on data collected from some of the biggest U.S. institutions , like Bank of America , Citibank and JPMorgan Chase , home foreclosure starts fell 2.6 percent in the three months ended in September .
However , data which is to be issued by the OCC and the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) next week could throw cold water on a push by some U.S. policymakers for loan modifications as the key remedy for the ailing U.S. financial and economic crisis .
Dugan said recent data showed that after three months , nearly 36 percent of borrowers who received restructured mortgages in the first quarter re-defaulted .
The rate of re-default jumped to about 53 percent after six months and 58 percent after eight months , Dugan said , without providing an explanation for the trend .
Regulators speaking at an OTS - housing forum did not provide any explanations for the causes behind the data .
“ We do n’t know the answers yet , but these are the types of questions that we have begun asking our servicers in detail , ” Dugan said .
Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , who has been pushing for fast and systematic loan modifications , said regulators need to examine re-default data more closely .
“ I think it ’s very important to look at this data carefully and know what it says and what it does n’t say , ” Bair said .
Dugan said the third - quarter report will show many of the same disturbing trends as other recent mortgage reports , as credit quality continued to decline across the board and delinquencies rose for subprime , alt - A and prime mortgages .
He said the report will also show that the greatest delinquencies were in prime mortgages .

I used to think Lara was cool .
She had a can - do , can 't - die attitude did stuff that looked like fun .
Just hours in to her new adventure it dawned on me that Lara is n't a heroine at all .
She 's an egocentric bitch .
She is , at best , a completely self - centred anti-hero , and the �good� results of her actions ( saving the world , etc ) are completely secondary to her own selfish goals .
She is not an archaeologist .
She 's a destroyer .
When she comes across an ancient temple , she does n't revere it or study it with a dedicated team who love what they do for the sake of science and history , no , she tears it down single handedly because she wants to get to the loot inside before anyone else .
Not so she can put it in a museum , but because she wants it because it is somehow tied tofamily andfamily alone because herwas anand herdiedso everyone else is secondary and anything she destroys in her way is completely understandable because she 's rich and can afford to stuff around .
That 's without mentioning the complete disregard she holds for life .
The creature she comes across in the first level of Underworld is a magnificent beast .
Kind of cranky , sure , but you would be too in those circumstances .
Without a thought she kills it fucking dead , a priceless creature not seen in hundreds of years , noble and long lived , and she kills it dead because it 's blocking a bloody doorway .
Lara Croft is a bitch .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iran has executed a man found guilty of spying for Israel , state media reported Saturday .
Tehran 's Revolutionary Court convicted Ali Ashtari , 45 , in June of spying for Israel 's intelligence agency , the Mossad , in exchange for money .
While Ashtari was put to death by hanging on Monday , the execution was officially announced by the government Saturday .
" Evidence of Ashtari 's crime was overwhelming , " Iran 's intelligence ministry director told Iran 's state - run IRNA news agency .
According to Ashtari's " confession , " published by the news agency Fars , Ashtari was a salesman who obtained high - end but security - compromised electronic equipment from Mossad and sold them to military and defense centers in Iran .
During the trial prosecutors displayed spying tools that Mossad had allegedly provided , Iranian Student 's News Agency said .
Iran and Israel have been engaged in an escalating war of words .
Iran accuses Israel of trying to destabilize the republic .
Israel has not ruled out military action to halt Iran 's nuclear aspirations .
One of the biggest new features of the next version of MythTV ( version .22 ) will be its new user interface .
This new interface will offer many new features to MythTV , including animation , better interactivity , and faster and easier development for themers and developers alike .
MythTV is an open - source DVR that was created by Isaac Richards back in 2002 because of his frustration with his low quality cable box .
Since then MythTV has progressed into a full featured DVR / media player .
It has users all over the world and a huge number of developers working to make the software even better .
Now , lets get back to what you came here to see .
Currently , the interface is fairly static , theme designers can change the look of the screens and move around the preexisting elements , but are very limited in what other changes they can make .
It is possible to add new elements to the interface but these ca n’t be dependent on information in the database .
The image above simply shows a curved list in the new UI , it ’s not overly exciting , but it was n’t possible before either .
The first pictures below show the existing Watch Recordings screen and how it looks after being recreated in the new interface .
As you can see the green dots , to indicate a current recording , were added to this layout .
These would n’t have been possible with the old system .
Continue reading to see some more drastic changes .
Below is an image that contains some of the bigger changes that could show up in the Watch Recordings screen in the new version .
The pieces of elements can now be moved and rearranged ( the groups have been moved to the top and horizontally ) .
Before a list could ’ve been shown vertically or in a Grid , they were predefined in the program and all the theme designer could do was change the placement and size , now they have much more freedom .
Another new feature is animation , it ’s kind of hard to display this in pictures , but you can imagine what possibilities this provides .
Transitions between screens ( which is technically in there already , at least for menu transitions ) , transitions between elements ( such as smoothly sliding between elements ) , or status messages that have motion , which is what is being shown in the gallery below .
Of course , this is n’t just about the Watch Recordings screen ( though that ’s the screen I use the most ) , the rest of MythTV including the plugins benefit from this new UI .
On the right is the Netflix Browser plugin showing a possible stylized list .
It shows how the selected element can be changed to display different information than the other elements .
Below are a few images of MythTV ’s photo plugin , MythGallery .
The image on the left is similar to the current version , but it ’s showing how an information window could be popped up over the other elements on the screen .
The image on the right shows the same data but in a much nicer looking layout ( this is the same screen , only the theme has changed ) .
You can imagine how the new animation effects will look on this screen .
The images could slide in from the right and out on the left and the new highlighted picture will slide forward .
You can also see the reflections on the images taking further advantage of the OpenGL effects added in the last version of the software .
On a more technical side MythUI ( the new User Interface library that provides these new features ) allows for inheritance and many other advantages for MythTV Developers .
According to the MythTV Wiki :
“ Mythui aims to make theme creation easier by introducing the concept of inheritance .
The basic style of widgets can be defined once and then copied from each other or from global definitions .
This reduces the amount of copying and pasting required and means that theme - wide changes can be made by editing just a couple of lines . ”
“ MythUI brings a lot of code simplifications , migration of plugins to mythui has so far eliminated thousands of lines of code .
It seeks to remove layout and behaviour responsibility from the programmer , handing it to the themer instead .
There are fewer widgets to understand and there will be greater consistency across screens . ”
These are just a few examples of what ’s possible with the new User Interface .
Personally , I ca n’t wait for this new version to be released .
Because of the new user interface the next version of MythTV ( .22 ) looks like it will not only be prettier but even more functional than it currently is .
If you ’d like to know more about MythTV check out the website , the wiki , and more importantly the incredibly active users mailing list .
There are even a few books about MythTV : Practical MythTV and Hacking MythTV they ’re both a little outdated , but they explain the concepts behind MythTV very well .
Do n’t forget to thank your friendly neighborhood MythTV developer , it ’s their hard work that ’s gotten MythTV so far .
Nanite is Ezra Zygmuntowicz 's newest addition to Engine Yard 's cloud computing strategy : a " self assembling cluster of ruby processes " to form the backend of a highly scalable web application ( see Ezra 's announcement ) .
Nanite consists of two parts : agents and mappers .
Agents implement the functionality of your application and are managed by mappers , the control nodes of your system .
Agents periodically advertise their status and ( per default ) their average load to the mappers , so the mappers can distribute work to the least loaded agent .
For more information and examples , take a look at the Nanite Readme file .
Nanite is built around RabbitMQ , " a complete and highly reliable Enterprise Messaging system " built with Erlang .
According to a comment in his blog , it should also work with any other AMQP compatible messaging middleware .
InfoQ : Ezra , are you using Nanite at Engine Yard ?
Yes Nanite is used as the backend for our new engine yard as a service platform .
It is used for autoscaling EC2 instances as your traffic grows as well as being a core part of our service exposed to users so they can use Nanite agents as part of their apps with zero fuss .
InfoQ : Do you see other applications for Nanite besides the web ?
Nanite has many applications outside of the web I think .
Anytime you need to control a set of resources across a number of servers from Ruby then Nanite is a good fit .
InfoQ : We talked about Vertebra — the next generation cloud computing platform — a few months back , what 's the relation between Nanite and Vertebra ?
Nanite and Vertebra will eventually be able to work together via the rabbitmq / xmpp bridge .
Nanite is more for scaling individual applications in a cloud environment .
Vertebra is more for connecting multiple disparate systems together where each agent in the system could be on a different customers servers .
Rabbitmq 's security model is based on vhosts , so anything in a vhost can talk to anything else in the same vhost .
This works well for having a vhost per application space and scaling apps that way .
Nanite is also higher performance messaging for application workloads where users are waiting on results .
Vertebra is about coordinating multiple machines while keeping them secure form each other .
Nanite is available on GitHub , and Vertebra should be released as open source before Christmas , around December 15 .
Ron Howard : Jon Stewart should do Bush exit interview David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Director Ron Howard has a new movie about to open , Frost / Nixon , which dramatizes a series of interviews of the former president conducted in 1977 by David Frost .
Howard described the interviews to The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart on Thursday , saying , " It was combat .
With these two guys -- with those intellects , those egos ... I think it 's fair to say it was a life and death struggle . "
" Did Nixon think he lost ? " Stewart asked .
" I think Nixon felt that he gave away more than he wanted to give away , " Howard replied .
" He was n't that good an actor -- I think that was his problem with television .
You knew what he was thinking . "
" Imagine anybody getting to sit down for 14 hours with uh , George , uh -- ahh , the name escapes me , " suggested Stewart , implying that he has already managed to forget President Bush .
" That would be the next thing , " Stewart added , more seriously .
" I 'd pay to see that . "
" I 'd be nominating you as the guy , " Howard replied as the audience cheered .

The Ten Egg Challenge : Part 5 Day 5 : Hard Boiled
On day 3 , I remarked that scrambled was the easiest style of egg because you pretty much can't screw it up even if you wanted to .
Hard boiled comes in a marginally - close second for ease .
I have to admit that hard boiled eggs have never really been my favorite .
I know that some people swear by them , and certain hotels even feature them as a staple of their continental breakfasts .
But to me , hard boiled eggs just are n't a breakfast food .
They 're more of an add - on to other , real foods in my book .
I cut them up and put them in my salads and casseroles , for instance .
But on their own , they 've never done it for me .
And I have to admit I 've always enjoyed the white part more than the yolk , even though I know the yolk is where all the protein is at .
Here 's what you 'll need to cook a hard boiled egg : A pot full of boiling water ,
A pair of tongs ( or just a spoon ) , and
An egg Seriously !
That 's all you need !
While the other cooking styles call for things like butter , milk , and even vinegar , all that you need to make a hard boiled egg is an egg and water .
Heat the water to bubble , bubble , toil , and trouble temperatures , then drop your egg in - gently , laying it down in the pot using your tongs .
You obviously do NOT want any type of boiled eggs to crack .
Then just wait .
A good 12 to 15 minutes will do - so you want to make sure that your pot is large enough so that the water wo n't completely evaporate away over the course of 15 minutes .
Then , when the time 's up , take the pot off the burner , use your tongs to extract the egg from the water and put it somewhere else while you dispose of the water .
Then , take the egg in your hand and ( quickly ) run it under a constant stream of cold water .
Do this long enough so that egg cools down to a temperature that 's comfortable to hold without burning your hand .
This will halt the internal cooking process of the yolk and blah blah technical food stuff .
Then , when it 's cool enough to hold onto , give it a quick - but - firm tap on the top , and then just peel the eggshell away .
Voila !
The results were exactly what I expected : a hard boiled egg .
I would be in trouble if after 27 years of Western living I did n't know what a hard boiled egg tasted like .
And as I said before , they do n't do it for me as a standalone food .
I 'm giving it a 2 out of 10 .
I did add salt to the yolk tonight , and that certainly helped , as salt has a way of making anything better .
And I 'm not trying to imply that it's a bad taste , per se ; I just prefer many of the other styles over this one .
And I feel like I could make hard boiled eggs with two arms tied behind my back , so while I was preparing this egg I had a couple other things comprising my dinner cooking simultaneously on the stovetop .
And Emerald was " helping " me cook tonight while I prepared this egg , too .
For awhile she was dwelling in the secret place of the most cat ( aka hiding in the cupboards ) .
I picked a quick - and - easy style tonight because again I was busy .
I have a somewhat regimented weekly schedule ( I 've actually been working on making it more regimented ) : on Wednesday nights at 7:30 PM , I attend the church service over at First Church of Christ , Scientist , Madison .
Tonight 's service had readings about Jesus ' birth ; it was very Christmassy .
At every Wednesday service , anyone in the audience ( whether they 're a church member or not ) has the opportunity to stand up and speak a " testimony . "
A testimony is simply an expression of gratitude for how God has been working in your life , giving specific examples .
Often people talk about challenges and struggles overcome .
I 'm actually one of those standing up to praise God myself a lot of weeks at these services .
So if you , dear blog reader , are in Madison , I 'd love to have you join me for a service on Wednesday night !
There 's also an online form that allows people to submit their remarks in advance , to be read for them by someone else during the service ( once screened ) .
While no one has actually used this form yet , I think that 's still nice to have .
Sometimes it 's easier to talk about things when you 're " anonymous , " and sometimes you just can't be there in person !
Lastly , if you 've been following this challenge , you know that I was lamenting my poor egg - flipping skills last night with over easy .
Well I 've thought of an idea that should help me quickly improve .
The only spoiler I 'm going to give is that it is pink .
Tune in tomorrow to see which kind of egg I cook up next .
The challenge is already halfway done , and that is eggcellent .
( Groan ... well admit it , you knew I had to make that pun sooner or later . )
The Ten - Egg Challenge : Part 4 Day 4 : Over Easy
Tonight I tried another style that I had never tried before .
I learned a few things tonight .
I learned that over easy is basically the same as sunny side up , except with one extra flip ( which leads some people to refer to this style as " sunny side down " ) .
And I also learned another lesson tonight : I am bad at flipping eggs .
At least , for now .
Right now I 'm trying to type up this post super fast before I have band practice .
More on that later .
To cook an egg " over easy , " here 's what you 'll need : A frying pan ,
A spatula ,
Some butter , and
An egg Grease the pan with copious amounts of butter and make sure it spreads around well .
Heat the burner to a medium heat .
Then just crack an egg in and wait !
The waiting takes about two minutes or so - just until the egg whites have solidified .
As you can see I have a diagram pictured above , showcasing an egg that is not ready for a flip , then almost ready , and finally ready .
Once it reaches the point where the whole of the whites are opaque ( but the yolk is still bright yellow ) , you want to give it a flip .
I 've seen that the master chefs do this without a spatula - they actually just flip the egg up into the air using the pan and then catch it flawlessly .
Since I 'd never cooked this way before , and since I was in a rush , I did n't even attempt that .
I just used a spatula .
And I used a spatula poorly , as you can see below .
Once the egg has been flipped , do n't touch it .
Even if you did a miserable flip job like I did , resist the temptation to fix it , otherwise you might break the yolk .
Just wait another 45 seconds for the bottom to cook over , and then using your spatula , remove it from the pan , flipping it back to its original orientation , and onto your serving plate .
When cut open , the yolk should still be nice and runny .
You can probably already guess two additional styles I 'll be trying later on in this challenge : over medium and over hard .
The fact that the whole yolk is still runny distinguishes this style from those .
The results ?
Well , even though my egg may not have been the most aesthetically pleasing due to my presently poor egg - flipping abilities , it was extremely pleasing to my taste buds !
In fact , I really wanted to make another one right after I finished this one !
But , alas , I had to hold off , as I promised myself to use exactly 12 eggs for this challenge - no more , no less .
I 'll give this an 8 out of 10 .
Plus , I 'm in a bit of a rush tonight because it 's Tuesday , and on Tuesday nights I have band rehearsal .
I play French horn in the Verona Area Concert Band , which is really a fantastic little group , run by conductor and Verona Area High School band teacher Eric Anderson .
Our next free concert will be on Thursday , February 7th at the Verona High School , so if you 're in the area , come check us out !
I 'm off to practice now ; check back tomorrow to see which style I cook next !
The Ten - Egg Challenge : Part 3 Day 3 : Scrambled Egg
Most of the eggs I 'll be making for this challenge are done in ways that I 've never attempted before .
Scrambled is not one of those ways .
I 've done scrambled eggs many , many times before and I have a method to it to ensure they turn out perfectly .
Of all the different styles , scrambled eggs get cooked the most and there 's really no way to screw them up .
Here 's what you 'll need to cook them : A bowl ,
A whisk ( or a fork ) ,
A spatula ,
Some butter ,
Some milk ,
A frying pan , and
An egg Because I only did a single egg , I used a measuring cup in lieu of a bowl .
I like my eggs mixed up with milk because I think it gives them a lighter and fluffier texture .
So begin by cracking your egg (s ) into the bowl and adding in 1 tablespoon ( or less ) of milk per egg .
Use the whisk to mix them all together until the color is consistent throughout .
Grease the pan with butter ( again I used copious amounts of butter - as a former roommate used to say to me , " the secret ingredient is butter " ) and set the burner to a medium - high or even high heat .
Pour the egg - milkxture into the pan and let it sit there for about 1 or 2 minutes .
Then perform a litmus test by prodding the side with a spatula .
You just want to check if the bottom has solidified .
The top is going to be bubbly and liquidy no matter what , but the bottom should harden up .
Once it 's hard enough to be flipped , flip it .
Flip it good .
( Cu-rack that egg ! )
Use the spatula to chop it up into bits , and flip the bits as necessary .
Some people like to keep the egg in way too long until it actually starts to brown .
That 's way too long .
I prefer my scrambled eggs still light and fresh , so as soon as all the liquidy parts are gone , it 's done .
Then just take the pan off the burner and slide it onto a plate !
Scrambled eggs are my favorite , so of course the results were magnanimously delicious .
As usual , I added salt to taste .
Although , I have to admit that I really did enjoy that poached egg on Day 1 , so perhaps by the end of this challenge I 'll have some new favorites .
Still , I 'm doubtful that anything else can truly dethrone scrambled as king of the egg - cooking styles .
One thing I should mention : because I mix my eggs with milk before scrambling them , you sometimes get white spots .
That 's okay , and is to be expected .
As you can see in the photos , there really were n't any major white spots this time , but then I used a little less milk than I sometimes do .
One of the reasons I picked scrambled tonight was because I was rather busy this evening ( not that I 'm not any other evening ... ) and they 're a time - tested method for me that is quick and simple .
My plans for the evening included typing up this post while listening to a live audio podcast called Every Day 's a Celebration , and then watching the newest episode of a TV drama I 'm addicted to .
The online podcast was based heavily on an online , ecumenical project called Radical Acts .
If you 're not already familiar with Radical Acts , it 's a program designed to encourage each of us to live Jesus ' teachings more fully in our daily lives .
Check it out !
Anyways , despite the fact that I got this post typed up and then lost all of it thanks to a browser glitch , and despite the fact that they canceled the latest episode of REVOLUTI N so they could air " Blake Shelton 's Not - So - Family Christmas " instead - two things that could otherwise ruin a perfectly good evening ( okay , so perhaps " ruin " is exaggerating a bit ) - these eggs were still good enough that I was n't phased at all ( well , maybe I was a little phased .
I mean Blake Shelton ?
Really ? ) .
The only thing that could have made them better is bacon .
Actually , to be precise , a breakfast consisting of a scrambled egg , a single piece of buttermilk toast , some strips of bacon , and a glass of orange juice is pretty much ambrosia in the morning .
I know I said I would be coming back through these posts after completing the challenge to rank them , but I 'm already going to give scrambled eggs a solid 10 out of 10 .
Check back tomorrow to see which style is next !
The Ten - Egg Challenge : Part 2 Day 2 : Sunny Side Up
I 'm continuing on with my Ten-egg Challenge with what is probably the most basic of all egg styles : sunny side up .
But despite its ease to make , this is another style that , prior to today , I had never made before !
And as I understand it , this style provides the foundation for a number of other styles I 'll be trying out .
Here 's the completed egg :
To make this type of egg , you will need : A frying pan ,
A little bit of butter ,
A spatula , and
An egg Grease the pan with butter - I actually used copious amounts of butter here , but that 's not so bad - and heat it up on a medium heat , making sure the butter gets spread on the whole pan .
Then just crack the egg and drop it in !
It does n't take very long to cook an egg sunny side up , so you have to watch it carefully .
I 've heard that certain restaurants actually refuse to serve eggs this way because , of all the different styles , this borders the closest to serving raw egg .
Of course you can leave it in the pan for longer to ensure it gets cooked better , but then there 's also the risk of burning it on the bottom .
On my very first try , it turned out perfectly .
It was n't too hot or too cold like the big or mid-sized bears , but cooked " just right , " as Goldilocks says .
It almost was n't , though !
At one point when I thought it looked ready , I softly touched the yolk and , lo and behold , it was still cold .
Thankfully it's not rocket science , and obviously a cold yolk is not going to be something you 'd want to eat .
So ... I let it continue cooking for another minute or two , before sliding it out of the pan with a spatula .
The results ?
Decent - but not my favorite .
Not by a long shot .
The egg whites were good , the yolk was nice and runny ( but still cooked ) , and I added salt , as usual , because I like salt a lot .
But I do n't think I 'll be ordering sunny side up eggs nor making them for myself any time soon .
I 'm giving this style the lowest score of all : 1 out of 10 .
It was edible but it did n't wow me .
Still , now if someone else were to ask me to make sunny side up eggs for them , I would be able to comply and not look like a fool in the process !
And that is a good thing ; it 's good to be prepared .
I made this egg this evening , just before writing this post and just after enjoying a chicken dinner .
So I wonder if my disinclination to really get into this style was just the protest of the egg 's mother on my taste buds ?
Honestly , it probably could have been improved if I knew anything about seasoning .
But anyways , I 've now successfully eliminated vegetarians from my blog readership !
Mission accomplished .
Tune in tomorrow to see which kind of egg I cook next .
And I promise I 'll start fulfilling the sub title of this blog soon by actually blogging about things other than food .
The Ten - Egg Challenge : Part 1 Hello world !
After taking a several year hiatus from blogging , I 'm back , but perhaps not with a vengeance .
You may notice that my website looks nothing like it used to .
For that , we have my good friend and coworker , Kristi Trefftzs , to thank .
So a HUGE thank you to her !
Recently I was watching an episode of " Master Chef " where they had a challenge to the hopeful cooks to prepare an egg in four different ways : poached , sunny side up , soft boiled , and a 3 - egg omelette .
While some of the hopefuls were still relatively young , the masters insisted that anyone serious about cooking should know how to do eggs in all sorts of different ways by now .
That got me thinking .
I 'm 27 , and I 've never cooked eggs in any of the ways they had called for in that challenge .
So , I 'm setting out to fix this in what I 'm calling the 10 Egg Challenge .
This is a challenge that spans 10 days and should use exactly 12 eggs - assuming I do n't break any .
I 'm going to challenge myself to learn 10 different styles of cooking eggs , and I 'm going to chronicle my journey here on my blog .
Day 1 : Poached Egg
This is something I 'd never done before , and it 's really not that hard .
Admittedly , I suspect I 'll probably be typing " it 's really not that hard " every day of this challenge .
But , you never know until you try it yourself .
On every day of this challenge , I 'm going to explain how to prepare the egg in this way .
But before I do that , allow me to showcase a photo of the finished , poached egg :
To make a poached egg , you will need : A pot full of water ,
1 or 2 teaspoons of white vinegar ( can be white wine vinegar or rice vinegar ) ,
A bowl ,
A slotted spoon , and
An egg .
You want to make sure to fill the pot well , so that it 's not too shallow ; the egg needs some room to swim around in .
Bring the water to a boil , and then immediately reduce the heat to a medium , or even low , simmer so that 's it not bubbling any more .
Then add your teaspoon (s ) of vinegar .
I did n't actually measure this ; I just guessed .
It does n't need to be a precise science .
But one thing to note : do not add any salt to the water !
It will ruin the whole process if you do .
Crack the egg into a bowl first ( do not drop it directly into the water ! ) , then hold the bowl just over the surface of the water so you can gently drop the egg in .
Watch the egg .
It should be fine on its own , but you can use the spoon to try to corral the whites around the yolk .
But be gentle !
You do not want to puncture anything .
I found a number of websites that said you should keep the egg in the water for no more than 3 to 4 minutes .
I kept mine in for about 5 or 6 , though I may have used a slightly lower heat than others .
Just watch it .
Throughout the process , I would periodically take the spoon to lift the egg from off the bottom of the pan , still keeping it submerged in the warm water .
After about four minutes , I gently picked it up with the spoon , out of the water , and lightly tapped it with my finger just to see if it was done yet .
It was n't .
Thankfully I was gentle enough to not damage the egg , but I could tell it was still somewhat fragile at that point .
After another minute or two , I tested it again , and it was more solid ( though it still had some spring - which is good ! ) .
So at that point I turned off the burner , and used my spoon to pull it out of the water and onto a serving plate .
There was an outermost perimeter of " messy " whites surrounding the inner solid whites .
I used a knife and trimmed those off and threw them away , leaving only the perfectly formed poached egg .
The results were delicious .
The yolk was nice and runny , the egg whites tasted great , and I added the perfect amount of salt .
I 'm giving Poached Eggs a solid 9 out of 10 .
And in case you 've ever wondered how to make " eggs benedict , " you now know how .
Eggs benedict is just an English muffin with ham and a poached egg ( and usually Hollandaise sauce as well ) .
So there you have it !
So far I 'm really liking this challenge .
Check back tomorrow to find out what style of egg I 'll make next !
Major Updates
My website is going through some major updates !
Check back here over the next couple weeks as I actually start blogging again .

I first became aware of Charles Babington when I read a Washington Post article , soon after George W. Bush took the White House , that quoted Richard Perle saying encouraging things about Bush ’s foreign policy skills ( Charles Babington , “ Leaders Urge Bush to Face Foreign Policy Issues . ” Washington Post , 20 March 2001 , no longer online ) .
Babington portrayed Perle as a conservative ( but nonpartisan ) objective observer of the new Bush Administration — in reality , he ’d been an adviser to the Bush campaign .
When I wrote Babington to ask him why he ’d chosen a Bush partisan to cite in the article , he claimed complete ignorance of Perle ’s role .
Babington has not learned to choose his sources more carefully or fact - check himself .
Which is another way of saying he ’s still shilling for the Republicans as a reporter for the Associated Press :
John McCain was in his favorite campaign setting , a town hall meeting , when he spotted a promising target .
“ I ’d love to recognize you first , sir , ” the Republican presidential candidate said to a man in a Vietnam War veteran ’s hat .
Instead of a softball opening question from a fellow vet , however , McCain got a lengthy harangue , as the man insisted the senator had opposed better medical benefits for veterans .
McCain , who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war , politely said the man was mistaken .
He finally broke it off , saying , “ I ’ll be glad to examine what your version of my record is . ”
Babington ’s account , using a loaded verb to portray the questioner as aggressive and McCain as forbearing , gives the impression that the man in the Vietnam War veteran ’s hat was wrong .
Babington ’s covering up McCain ’s lies about his record on veterans issues and the support he is n’t getting from veterans ’ organizations .
Babington even tries to portray McCain ’s “ town halls ” as somehow more democratic and courageous than Obama ’s campaign appearances .
But I do n’t remember any reports of people being barred from entering an Obama event because they do n’t agree with him on an issue ( as described in Babington ’s own article ) or arrested for exercising First Amendment rights .
Straight Talk Express ?
So - called journalists like Babington make McCain ’s campaign the Stenography Express .
In one sense the Federal Open Market Committee ’s decision today to move its intended Federal Funds rate down to “ a target range … of 0 to 1/4 percent ” was historic — never , since it began announcing the target rate in the early 1980s , has the Fed gone below 1 % .
But it ’s also something of a nonevent : the actual Federal Funds rate has already spent the past week and a half below 0.2 % , and the interest rates the Fed really wants to reduce are not those on short - term Treasury securities , but those being charged on longer - term Treasuries and on loans to states , cities , businesses and consumers .
The really historic development on this last front came in October , when the Fed began conducting monetary policy in an entirely new way .
It could do so because it got permission , as part of the same bailout legislation that gave Hank Paulson $ 700 billion to play with , to start paying interest on the excess reserves that banks leave with the Fed .
It is now that interest rate on excess reserves , which the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) dropped from 1 % to 1/4 % today , that sets the floor on interest rates within the banking system .
This leaves the Fed to steer its open market operations — used for the past few decades mainly to manipulate the Federal Funds rate — toward other goals .
From the FOMC statement :
As previously announced , over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage - backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets , and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage - backed securities as conditions warrant .
The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer - term Treasury securities .
Early next year , the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses .
The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity .
This is what has come to be called quantitative easing , also known as printing money .
How does that work ?
“ The Fed , as the nation ’s central bank , is the only instution that has the capacity to write unlimited checks on itself , ” says long - time Fed hand Marvin Goodfriend , now a professor of economics at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie - Mellon University .
Basically , when the Fed buys something , it can create the money to pay for it out of thin air .
Current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke described this process in hypothetical terms in his famous “ helicopter drop ” speech in 2002 .
But despite all its frenzied acronymical activity since the current crisis began in August 2007 ( I was at a conference last week where the New York Fed ’s Til Schuermann jokingly tried to lure people up to the front few rows of seats with what he called a CSFF , or Conference Seating Funding Facility ) , the Fed avoided quantitative easing until recently .
It would trade Treasury securities that it already owned for mortgage securities and the like , but it would n’t create new money to do so .
That was partly because some at the Fed were worried about goosing an already high inflation rate .
With the Consumer Price Index now falling , that ’s no longer an issue .
What I did n’t realize until talking to Goodfriend this afternoon is that the paying - interest - on - reserves change has been a major factor too .
As he put it in an admirably clear ( if still tough going for the layman ) 2002 paper ( pdf ! ) that first sparked interest in the idea in Fed circles :
Open market operations would cease to support the interbank rate in the new regime . …
Therefore , open market operations would be free to pursue another monetary policy objective .
When the Fed started paying interest on bank reserves in October , this “ new regime ” was upon us , and the folks at the Fed ’s open market desk in New York could stop worrying about keeping the Federal Funds rate steady and concentrate on pumping money into the economy by whatever means possible .
( If you ’re having trouble wrapping your head around all this , do n’t feel bad ; I ’ve had the interest - on - reserves change explained to me several times by current and former Fed officials and I feel like I ’m only barely starting to get it . )
So for the next year or so at least , the number that will really tell you how aggressive the Fed ’s monetary policy is wo n’t be the interest rate but the size of the Fed ’s balance sheet , which has already ballooned from $ 1.4 trillion at the beginning of October to more than $ 2.2 trillion as of Dec. 10 .
Can this quantitative easing work ?
Goodfriend thinks so .
“ Technically and mechanically , the Fed ’s power to write checks on itself has the potential to be highly stimulative , ” he says .
A similar approach was tried in Japan early this decade .
It seemed to work , albeit less than spectacularly well , and the Fed ’s efforts have been far more aggressive than the Bank of Japan’s .
The Fed itself engaged in a sort of quantitative easing during World War II by buying Treasury securities of all different durations to finance the war effort .
That worked out great .
The big issue , Goodfriend says , will be the exit strategy .
At some point the animal spirits of businesses and consumers ( and bankers ) will return , and if the Fed does n’t act quickly to retire most of those hundreds of billions of new dollars it ’s been creating , the result will be inflation .
But that ’s tomorrow ’s problem .
Dec. 26 , 2008 --
The FDA has approved Latisse , the first drug to promote eyelash growth , according to Allergan , the company that makes Latisse .
Latisse , which will be available by prescription starting in the first quarter of 2009 , contains the active ingredient of the glaucoma drug Lumigan , which is also made by Allergan .
Eyelash growth is a known side effect of Lumigan .
But Lumigan and Latisse are used differently .
Lumigan is an eyedrop , and Latisse gets dabbed along the lash line on the upper eyelids to promote longer , thicker , darker lashes .
Allergan states that " Latisse users can expect to experience longer , fuller , and darker eyelashes in as little as eight weeks , with full results in 16 weeks . "
If Latisse is stopped , eyelashes will gradually return to their previous appearance as new eyelashes grow in .
Allergan also notes that Latisse may cause darkening of the eyelid skin , which may be reversible , and it " may also cause increased brown pigmentation of the colored part of the eye , which is likely to be permanent . "
Latisse may also promote hair growth in other skin areas that it frequently touches , so Allergan recommends blotting it off any skin other than the upper eyelid 's lash line to prevent that side effect .
According to Allergan , Latisse was well - tolerated in its clinical trials , with the most common side effects being eye redness , itchy eyes , and skin hyperpigmentation .
Earlier this month , an FDA advisory panel recommended that the FDA approve Latisse and also recommended further studies in certain groups of patients , such as young patients and people who lost their eyelashes to chemotherapy .
Move over California .
Hawaii is taking the lead on this one .
The island state announced Tuesday that it will be the first state to have a comprehensive electric - car station program .
[ social_buttons ]
While California plans to use the same company , Better Place , to build a limited number of stations , Better Place will have some 50,000 to 100,000 spots to charge electric cars in Hawaii by 2011 .
The company will also buy renewable energy from Hawaii ’s largest electricity company .
The electric car is good only if it has the infrastructure it needs to be efficient .
Although Hawaii is small , the governor and Better Place hope that the program will make the state a leader in electric car technology .
And Hawaii ’s small size actually benefit it in this venture : because the state is surrounded on all sides by water , i has limited imports and exports of cars , reports the Washington Post .
The governor of Hawaii said that the program will help the state in its goal to reduce its fossil fuel consumption by 70 percent .
Right now , Hawaii uses foreign oil for 90 percent of its energy .
Hawaii can hopefully be an example in not only the need to build up a new infrastructure for electric cars , but also for cars with types of alternative fuels .
These programs sometimes are only as good as the support they get from state and country leaders to make states accommodating to new technology .

OWINGS MILLS , Md.  Tony Romo is the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys .
So of course , in light of recent turmoil ( real or manufactured ) , he was asked why he missed Terrell Owens ' birthday bash .
" Because I could n't walk , " Romo said Wednesday .
He sustained what the Cowboys described as a back contusion early in Sunday night 's victory against the New York Giants .
Romo laughed with his answer .
WEEK 16 PICKS : Our analysts ' projections
" It would have been very difficult for me to stay in one position for any extended period of time , so I pretty well laid up for the last couple of days , " said Romo , who stayed in the game against the Giants despite the injury and threw for two touchdowns .
Dallas hosts the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night in a game with huge playoff implications .
It will be the last regular season game played at Texas Stadium , to be replaced next season , and the Cowboys are n't likely to get a playoff home game even if they make the postseason .
Romo spoke about his absence from the party Monday night in Grapevine , Texas , to celebrate T.O's 35th birthday ( which actually was Dec. 7 ) in a conference call Wednesday with Baltimore - area reporters .
What 's the prognosis for Romo for Saturday night ?
" I 'm sure it will be fine by Saturday , " he said .
" It 's like anything .
It 's still sore .
… I think it 's just part of playing football .
Everyone gets banged up this time of year , and you go back out there and you play . "
The victory against the Giants came after a week of scrutiny about whether the Dallas locker room was divided , whether Owens and other receivers were riled in a belief that Romo was too fond of throwing to tight end Jason Witten .
What 's Romo 's relationship like with Owens ?
" It 's good .
It has n't changed any , " Romo said .
" Four weeks ago to last week to this week , it 's all the same , just different people like to talk about different stuff . "
Romo said that " stuff that really is n't a story " was basis of the recent drama .
" If I was following sports , I 'd be like ' Enough already ' sometimes when they talk about us , " he said .
" Things that really would n't be a story at other places they make them out to be here .
…
You let it roll off your back and move right along . "
Cowboys coach Wade Phillips did attend Owens ' birthday party , as did many other Dallas players .
The nightclub party was held to benefit Owens ' foundation , Catch A Dream .
Phillips was asked whether the Cowboys had to overcome distractions last week .
" I do n't think there 's as much going on as what 's reported , " he said .
" As far as the team , we were pretty focused last week on playing the game and I think we 'll be the same way this week .
I do n't know that there are that many distractions that are bothering our team . "
Prior to the Cowboys - Giants game Sunday night , the NBC telecast had an opening in which Romo , Owens and Witten were together in a bar , eating popcorn and smiling .
" Oh , right before the show we did that , " Romo said .
" No , just kidding . …
We did that , I think , in the offseason . "
Graham
Hill will get a new note for each one he pieces back together A binman who found cut - up £ 10 and £ 20 notes in two litter bins has been told he can exchange them for new ones if he can piece the bits together .
Graham Hill discovered an estimated £ 10,000 in two bags dumped in City Square in Lincoln .
Lincolnshire Police held the money for six months while an investigation was carried out .
After nobody came forward to claim it , the force gave it to Mr Hill as there was no evidence of criminal activity .
Det Con Nick Cobb said : " Following extensive inquiries , there was no evidence that the money was stolen or linked to any criminal activity .
" This was a very unusual case and , despite our inquiries the circumstances of why and how the money came to be torn up and put in the bin , remains a mystery . "
It is a massive jigsaw puzzle
Det Con Nick Cobb
The binman will get a new note for each one he pieces back together , but this could prove difficult .
Det Con Cobb added : " It would appear that they might have been cut - up with scissors .
" Obviously whoever cut it up took a long time , a very , very determined effort to cut the money up .
" The biggest piece of money was about an inch square ...
It is a massive jigsaw puzzle . "
A Bank of England spokeswoman said : " Providing the bank notes meet the evidence requirements , then an application for reimbursement should be successful . "

When President George W. Bush was recently interviewed on CNN regarding the economy , he left us with another “ Bushism ” that will likely go down in history along with the economy his interventionist policies are destroying , “ I ’ve abandoned free - market principles to save the free market system . ”
Bush incoherently believes that corporatism ( e.g. , the bailouts ) and the Federal Reserve ’s hyper-expansion of the money supply ( e.g. , monetary socialism and debasement of the dollar ) are crucial to make free enterprise viable , despite his claimed devotion to the Christian , natural - law , moral principle that the end never justifies the means .
However as with most politicians ( including Obama , Dodd , McCain , Pelosi , Schwarzenegger , Frank , Reid , Cheney , Biden , Clinton , . . . ) , for Bush , means are ethically situational depending on one ’s own personal and political fortunes .
A classic Calvin and Hobbes cartoon by Bill Watterson illuminates many of the key factors at work here ( i.e. , vanity , arrogance , intolerance , ignorance , narcissism , fraud , greed , indifference , foolishness ) .

Rep. Linda Sanchez : Pregnant Now , Marriage Later
** An updated version of this story appears in the print edition of Fri. , Nov. 21 and online here .**
Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - Calif. ) is pregnant with her first child , the Los Angeles Times reports this morning .
Which is hardly unusual -- several other congresswomen have given birth in office -- except for the fact that Sanchez is n't married . . . yet .
The dad is Sanchez 's serious beau of more than a year , Connecticut consultant Jim Sullivan , and she tells LAT op - ed columnist Patt Morrison that they 're " unofficially engaged . "
But since she 's 39 , they did n't want to wait any longer to start making a family .
So , no wedding date set yet .
Their baby is due May 21 , the Times reports .
" I do n't know how it 'll be received , " Sanchez told Morrison .
" I hope people will recognize that to be able to plan that in your life -- I do n't think that marriage and childbirth are black and white .
There are certain instances in which you have to do things in reverse order . "
Sanchez -- who with older sib Rep. Loretta Sanchez is half of Congress 's first sister act -- easily won reelection in her SoCal district this month ; it 's a pretty safe seat .
Still , her decision is a powerful sign of the times , Morrison writes :
Twenty years ago , it simply would n't have been possible -- pregnant , single and a member of Congress ?
Oh , the scandal !
But Hester Prynne has morphed into Juno MacGuff . . . and " unwed mother " has been recast as " single mom . "
Who do we have to thank for that ?
Thousands , from Madonna to Dan Quayle .
In 1992 , Quayle waged moral warfare on the sitcom character " Murphy Brown " -- famous , rich , single and pregnant .
. . .
And , of course , Bristol Palin .

The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem has released graphic video footage showing settlers fighting with Palestinians in Hebron and shooting two men at close range in the hours after a settler house was evacuated by police yesterday .
The film , recorded by a Palestinian resident in Hebron , shows settlers attacking his house , which was in a valley close to the three - storey building where dozens of settlers were evicted by Israeli riot police .
In the hours after the eviction , Jewish settlers rioted in Hebron , throwing stones at police and Palestinians and setting fire to Palestinian trees and attacking Palestinian homes .
Most of the violence took place between the evicted house and the nearby hardline Jewish settlement of Kirya Arba .
The footage shows a settler firing a handgun and injuring two Palestinians , Hosni Abu Se'ifan , 40 , who was hit in the chest and is now in a stable condition in hospital , and his father , Abd al - Hai Abu Se'ifan , 65 , who was hurt in the arm .
Others from the family then overpower the gunman until armed Israeli security guards from the Kiryat Arba settlement arrive and shoot several rounds over the heads of the Palestinians .
The Abu Se 'ifan family have frequently been targeted by settlers in the past .
B'Tselem handed the video to Israeli police in Hebron last night and was " demanding that the assailant is immediately brought to justice and that the involvement of the security guard be investigated " .
" Additionally , the security forces must investigate the failures that allowed settlers to riot throughout the afternoon and evening in Hebron 's Palestinian neighbourhoods , " the rights group said .
Since early last year B'Tselem has given out more than 100 small video cameras to Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank to allow them to record human rights abuses , and particularly the increasingly violent clashes with settlers .
The group says the video recordings encourage accountability and are frequently used as evidence to bring cases against soldiers and settlers who break the law .
There are around 470,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and east Jerusalem and their numbers are increasing every year , even though all settlements in the occupied territories are illegal under international law .
The settlers at the Hebron house claimed they had bought the building legally nearly two years ago from a Palestinian and said they had documents and videotape as proof .
However , the Palestinian has since denied selling the building to the settlers and last month the Israeli supreme court said the house should be evacuated until the ownership dispute was settled .
The 15 settler families were joined by dozens of supporters ahead of the eviction and the house quickly became their latest symbol of defiance against the Israeli government .
The concept of “ found money ” is delightful .
We cherish the cash that turns up under the bed , in a coat pocket , or in a long - forgotten bank account .
And found money may be key to the success of Barack Obama ’s presidency .
No , the federal government is n’t going to discover new billions under some rock in a national park .
But with the economic downturn , the new president ’s imperative will be to spend as fast as he can , to the tune of perhaps $ 500 billion , to keep the economy from going belly up .
That ’s a huge reversal of the normal pattern .
Victorious candidates typically discover that their campaign promises are more expansive than government finances allow .
Breaking pledges becomes a test of fiscal responsibility .
No recent president suffered more from the fiscal squeeze than Bill Clinton .
In 1992 , candidate Clinton promised middle - class tax cuts , welfare reform and major spending on job training , education and other worthy programs .
But as soon as he was elected , the green - eyeshade crowd was all over him .
Deficits were raising interest rates and his priority had to be a balanced budget .
So Clinton junked his tax cut , failed to put up new money that would have made welfare reform easier , and scaled back other pledges .
There ’s certainly a case that Clinton made the right bet .
We would gladly trade in the current economy for the roaring ’90s .
But the political costs of Clinton ’s choices were high .
By reneging on his middle - class tax cut , Clinton gave ammunition to Republicans , helping them take over Congress in 1994 .
And by failing to push through welfare reform when Democrats were in control , Clinton was later forced to acquiesce to a more tightfisted overhaul of public assistance with the new Republican majority .
Obama ’s luxury is that the economic demands of the moment almost perfectly coincide with his political interests .
When even conservative economists are urging Obama not only to cut taxes but also to spend and spend and spend some more , he has the opportunity to keep a whole raft of political promises all at once .
Middle - class tax cuts ?
Practically a done deal .
New investments in green technologies ?
No problem .
“ Smart ” meters to help households save on energy costs , plus a new electricity grid ?
A natural .
Universal broadband ?
It ’s about future growth .
Investments in medical information technologies ?
Good for jobs now , good later for cost containment , better treatment and health insurance reform .
Already , there is grumbling that Obama should n’t try to do anything special with the stimulus ; only old - fashioned programs need apply .
The critics are grousing : How dare Obama try to use the crisis to transform the country !
But this view is shortsighted .
If the government has to spend a lot of money , why not use it for programs that lift the economy now and have a long - term payoff later ?
Insisting on the same old approach to a stimulus means demanding only backward - looking investments that leave us with the same old problems once the spending spree stops .
Of course , the stimulus should include some tried - and - true measures .
There is nothing wrong with spending on roads , bridges and mass transit , along with school construction and rehabilitation .
It ’s a good time to make up for our longstanding underinvestment in infrastructure , that boring but hugely important word .
State and local governments also need fiscal help if they are to avoid retrenchment that would only negate federal stimulus efforts .
And as a recent report by Sharon Parrott of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities warned , the downturn “ is likely to cause significant increases both in the number of Americans who are poor and the number living in ‘ deep poverty , ’ with incomes below half of the poverty line . ”
The poor should have first call on the new spending .
They need help — and they will spend the money quickly because they have to .
What we should fear most is not that Obama will get to keep some of his campaign pledges but that the stimulus will fall victim to classic logrolling .
With so much cash on the table , the temptation will be enormous to lard up the package with a slew of unproductive projects and all manner of narrow tax breaks for interests you probably never knew existed .
In light of this danger , it would be far better if the new president started the debate with an imaginative proposal .
Without a vision , the stimulus will perish in a pile of pork , and half a trillion dollars would be a terrible thing to waste .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Overall compensation for the nation 's top executives rose more than expected last year , but the rate of increase was the lowest in six years , according to a study released Tuesday .
The Corporate Library , an independent corporate governance group , said the median pay raise for the 1,864 executives who received one in 2007 was 7.5 % .
Total actual compensation for chief executives at 2,701 companies - including those with pay cuts or no change - was a median $ 2.05 million .
While the increase was larger than the 5.15 % bump the group had forecast earlier this year , it marked the first time that CEO pay rises have shown a single - digit percentage change since 2001 , when the Corporate Library first began tracking the data .
At that time , the median increase was just under 10 % .
The study showed that the increase in total actual compensation , which includes base salary , bonuses , perks and equity - based compensation , was due largely to value realized on stock options .
The median base salary rose 4 % .
Base salaries were a median $ 590,500 last year .
Total annual compensation , which is base salary plus bonuses and perks , was also a median 4 % higher .
The median CEO received $ 1.1 million in total annual compensation in 2007 .
CEOs at companies with a larger market capitalization , including those in the S&P 500 , received larger pay increases than those at small cap companies , " showing that even the slowdown in pay rises was not experienced by the whole economy , " according to the report .
In some cases , the pay increases were dramatic , with 30 CEOs receiving total compensation increases of 1,000 % or more .
The sharpest pay increase went to Richard Fairbank , CEO of the bank Capital One , whose total compensation went up 46,574 % last year .
At the same time , the study showed some significant declines in CEO pay with 25 CEOs seeing their total compensation fall by 90 % or more .
Top executives at retail business and builders had the most significant median declines in total annual compensation .
While most of the data in the study comes from regulatory forms filed for fiscal year 2007 before economic conditions deteriorated sharply , the study still reflects a disparity between executive pay and the challenges facing rank - and - file employees , said Paul Hodgson , senior research associate at the Corporate Library .
" You 're still seeing a dichotomy between the experience of some employees that may be losing their jobs and the CEOs who do n't seem to be as affected , " Hodgson said .
Indeed , some of the highest paid executives in the study were at companies that have since collapsed or been forced into mergers .
Richard Fuld , former CEO of Lehman Brothers , the brokerage that went under in September , was the 13th highest - paid executive of the 30 highest paid executives in the study .
Fuld took home $ 71.92 million in total compensation last year , including more than $ 40 million in value realized from stock options .
The third highest - paid executive on the list was Angelo Mozilo , former CEO of Countrywide Financial Corp .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) bought Countrywide in March after the nation 's largest home lender reported huge losses on subprime loans .
Mozilo 's total actual compensation for 2007 was $ 124.69 million , according to the study .
Spam marketing messages on Facebook have been getting worse over the last year as the site has grown — but maybe such spamming is about to stop .
On Friday , the company won a court battle against spam perpetrator Adam Guerbuez and his front company , Atlantis Blue Capital :
An $ 873 million award it will likely never be able to fully collect .
You can download the ruling here ( PDF ) .
Ads included objectionable ( if not inaccurate ) material for things like “ legal marijuana ” and male enhancement products .
Samples below the article .
The civil action was filed under the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , a 2004 law that , among other things , prohibits false or misleading marketing emails .
Guerbuez ’s messages were sent by fake or compromised Facebook accounts , using the site ’s messaging system — such messages are being interpreted by courts as applicable to CAN - SPAM .
From Facebook :
Does Facebook expect to quickly collect $ 873 million and share the proceeds in some way with our users ?
Alas , no .
It ’s unlikely that Geurbuez and Atlantis Blue Capital could ever honor the judgment rendered against them ( though we will certainly collect everything we can ) .
But we are confident that this award represents a powerful deterrent to anyone and everyone who would seek to abuse Facebook and its users .
Rival social network MySpace won a $ 230 million award against a notorious spammer named Sanford “ Spamford ” Wallace in March of this year .
Guerbuez is based in Montreal , Canada .
Facebook has served him with the judgement and will be taking as much of his money as it can .
It hopes this will have a deterrent effect on other individuals targeting its site .
Given the difficulty of enforcing such laws around the world , its likely that spam will continue .
Guerbuez , in any case , is also banned from Facebook for life .

Sir Paul McCartney has teamed up with a Nobel Prize - winning scientist to urge people to become vegetarian to save the planet from the greenhouse gases created by rearing livestock .
In a letter to The Independent , the musician joins Rajendra Pachauri , the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , to blame worsening global warming on a rise in the number of people who eat meat .
The musician and Mr Pachauri , who are both vegetarians , also believe that global food shortages are exacerbated by the planting of cereal crops for animal fodder .
A mass switch to a more vegetarian diet will , they say , help the poorest people in the world .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Becoming vegetarian , or at the very least eating less red meat , is " the single most effective act " anyone can take to lessen greenhouse gas emissions .
As well as producing the greenhouse gas methane , the livestock business uses up increasingly scarce sources of fresh water and increases other forms of pollution through its need for agricultural chemicals , they argue .
" Unfortunately , with higher incomes , societies , even in developing countries , are turning to greater ... consumption of animal protein , which reduces the availability of food grains for direct consumption by impoverished human beings , " they say .
" Already 60 per cent of food crop production in North America and western Europe is being diverted for production of meat . "
Sir Paul and Mr Pachauri also suggest that people switch off lights , turn down their central heating , buy compact fluorescent lamps and use bicycles .
Dr Pachauri , who accepted a half - share in this year 's Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the IPCC , has long advocated vegetarianism as a way of fighting climate change .
He has been a vegetarian for eight years , while Sir Paul stopped eating meat about 30 years ago largely because of his concerns about the welfare of farm animals .
" With growing awareness of ... the need to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases , citizens across the world often ask what it is that they can do to mitigate emissions , " they say in their letter .
" There are several reasons for a shift to a much lower input of meat in human diets if not complete vegetarianism ...
We are writing this letter not because vegetarianism is a fad or an emotional issue but because it is a very attractive option for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and stabilising the Earth 's climate and ensuring global food security . "
They cite a 2006 report by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation which stated that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to climate change because 70 per cent of former forests in the Amazon have been turned over to grazing and livestock now use 30 per cent of the world 's land surface .
I often get asked to contribute to blog post roundups and try to help whenever I can .
Most want my one best idea .
The illusion that there is one best idea by 50 people is a mini-paradox .
By definition , it is acknowledging business and life is not simply about picking one thing .
A collection ought to be different ideas .
My default , when asked , is to answer with a view that takes a look at the bigger picture and where to start .
I ’ve watched how we tend to get going before deciding what outcome we want .
and I advise a better way .
Here ’s the answer I shared .
“ What ’s your best tip for growing / scaling your business ? ” I know a business is ready to scale when the owner stops saying “ we need more sales ” and starts talking about the numbers that make sales happen .
We call that an ROI formula .
Optimize ROI to Optimize Growth
Most small businesses use the term “ return on investment ” as a catch - all for anything that makes money .
I prefer to use an investor ’s definition and calculates the NET PROFIT from money invested .
Calculating ROI
Analyze any potential investment by adding up ALL the costs , the cash , resources and labor .
Even if going to do some of the labor yourself , estimate the costs as if you were going to pay someone .
Not accounting for your own labor value will keep you small because you cannot scale your own time .
Speaking of time , an investment must return enough to cover all costs in a specific amount of time .
In finance , you ’d call that the Interest Rate earned on investment .
Let ’s say you invest $ 500 in marketing that brings in $ 5,000 in sales .
Subtract any fulfillment costs for that sale ( inventory , labor , etc ) , let ’s say $ 1,500 .
That leaves $ 3500 , minus the initial $ 500 for a Gross Profit of $ 3,000 to apply towards paying the rent and other fixed expenses .
Spending $ 500 to net $ 3,000 with a repeatable process can make you rich …
IF you can do that in a reasonable amount of time .
If it takes a year , to get the money back , you ’ll be broke before you the year is out .
If you could do it in a day , you can invest that $ 500 and have $ 15,000 by the end of a week .
Calculate an estimate of ROI on any growth opportunity .
Optimize by repeating the winners and scaling .

Los Angeles based artist paints John McCain as " Two Face " from the Batman series .
The acrylic painting on wood is 4 ' x 8 ' .
He also paints Sarah Palin as the Joker .
This image is also acrylic on wood , 2 ' x 4 ' .
The son of a prominent Republican official , the artist wishes to remain anonymous .
The artist said " I felt that John McCain was revealed to be the ultimate " Two Face " in the 2008 election .
While asking us if we know the real Barack Obama , I had to wonder who is McCain ?
And I ask myself what happened to the heroic man of honor we all respected .
Who is this mud slinging , fear and hate monger who insinuates the worst about a man who may soon be the leader of the free world ?
Is this his way of reaching across the aisle ?
I do n't recognize this McCain at all .
He has become Harvey Dent / Two Face , a cartoon character who has lost his way and shown us the really dark side of himself .
While almost visibly shaking with rage , he tells us we need a steady hand at the tiller .
When I looked at Sarah Palin in the debates I instantly thought of the Joker .
While Wall St , crumbles and Iraq burns , she winks at the crowd as if to ask , " Hey , why so serious ? "
She cracks jokes as others weep and she throws stones while living in a very fragile glass house .
She is ambition without scruple .
I would not go hunting with her or Cheney for any amount of money .
" Offered as parody , the Joker and Two - Face are also great Halloween images .
It 's been a dark , scary October in California .
The artist is currently selling these designs on a variety of products through Cafepress.com .
Because he has seen the homeless and the animal communities suffer so much during the last 8 years , proceeds from the sales will be given to two local non-profit groups that help the homeless and animals .
Check back to see new images .
He is looking into the danger of pushing the theme of the Dark Knight too far .

It 's inevitable that some laws meant to solve a problem will surprise us with unintended consequences that lead to new , potentially bigger problems .
And other laws are just doomed from the start .
Case in point : A report from the International Planned Parenthood Federation finds that more and more countries are criminalizing the spreading of HIV , in a ( hopelessly - misguided , destined - to - fail ) effort to halt the disease .
According to the AP :
Since 2005 , seven countries in West Africa have passed HIV laws .
In Benin , simply exposing others to HIV is a crime , even if transmission does n't occur .
And in Tanzania , intentional transmission of the virus can lead to life imprisonment ...
In the U.S. , 32 states have laws criminalizing HIV transmission .
Experts estimate that thousands of people have been charged across the country with spreading HIV .
Since 2001 , 16 people in the United Kingdom have been prosecuted for spreading HIV .
Why is this such a bad idea ?
you may ask .
Despite all the medical advances in treating and curbing the spread of HIV / AIDS , there are still an estimated 3 million new cases of HIV a year , and nearly all of them are the result of risky ( and therefore preventable ) behavior .
Should n't those who fail to take precautions be punished for endangering the lives of others ?
Well no , not if it means driving said risky behavior underground to avoid criminal prosecution .
Which is precisely what is likely to happen , and thereby make things even worse :
Health officials fear the trend could undermine gains made in fighting the AIDS pandemic and provoke a surge in cases ...
" If the law is applied badly , this could set us back and do incredible damage , " said Paul de Lay , an AIDS expert at UNAIDS ...
De Lay said the laws could result in forced testing and drive the epidemic underground as people hide their HIV status , allowing the virus to spread unnoticed .
Plus there 's the small matter of the counter - productivity , inefficiency , and downright cruelty of putting a bunch of HIV - positive people in jail .

OpenSolaris 2008.11 , released the first day of 2008.12 , is now available .
This second OpenSolaris release comes with even more software packages than before , more hardware support , and a few nifty features revolving around ZFS .
In this article , we review OpenSolaris 2008.11 and cover some of the new features they ’ve added .
Last month ’s overview of OpenSolaris itself is a good starting point for the uninitiated .
The question we cannot avoid is , “ can it replace Linux ? ”
Yes , yes it can .
The install is identical to all other Linux distros , and it uses the familiar GNOME desktop .
OpenSolaris on the right hardware is basically the same as running Linux , from a casual user ’s perspective .
See Figure 1 for an example of the standard login screen .
Provided that you have supported hardware , there ’s no reason you ca n’t run OpenSolaris on your desktop or laptop ; we all know it runs as a server very well .
All the same software is available , but by default only a subset has been adopted so far .
If you use the “ pending ” and “ contrib ” repositories , you gain access to thousands of other software packages that are destined for “ main ” soon .
To enable these , just add a new repository in Package Manager : http://pkg.opensolaris.org/contrib.
Packaging
The package manager , Image Packaging System ( IPS ) , is something that has been missing from Solaris for years .
Most Solaris server administrators installed blastwave.org ’s pkg - get program , and used it to install open source software much like debian ’s apt - get .
This worked well , but was not supported by Sun .
To have a fully supported and vendor - authorized Solaris server , you had to rely on the packages Sun provided .
Now , they provide IPS and the Ubuntu Synaptic lookalike frontend called Package Manager as seen in Figure 2 .
You can easily and quickly install 1500 + packages ( the default number in the main repository ) at the click of a button .
For server administrators , there ’s the pkg command that does the same thing .
Wow , Cool !
IPS also lets you update the entire system , much the same way that Linux package managers work .
As we mentioned in our previous OpenSolaris article , this is how you now install “ patches , ” which are really just package updates now ( think : Linux ) .
There are no more patches from Sun you need to download , everything here operates the same way Linux distros with package management have done it for years .
The really interesting part , however , is that it ’s much safer in OpenSolaris to update the entire system .
We all know that things can go horribly wrong at times .
IPS will create a new “ boot environment , ” or BE , which is essentially a ZFS snapshot of the root file system , before making any changes , as seen in Figure 3 .
If things do n’t work out as planned , you can just select the previous BE from the GRUB menu upon boot and you ’re back to the pre-update state .
Now that is cool .
Other ZFS automation in 2008.11 comes to us in the form of Time Slider .
Just like Time Machine in OS X , you can schedule automatic backups and visually recover files that were deleted .
Unlike OS X , OpenSolaris leverages ZFS to take snapshots instead of just copying your files to another device .
That is good and bad ; you have snapshots ( like shadow copies in Windows ) which save tons of space , but you also have no backups .
In the future , expect this addressed with the new ZFS replication support that was recently added .
As seen in Figure 4 , Time Slider is very easy to enable .
Lately , I ’ve been simultaneously using less and less of what I learned in school while discovering more and more skills that are vital to success which were never even offered in school !
If I were to be 100 % honest , probably the most valuable skill I learned in college was how to talk to girls ( certainly a vital skill for happiness and success , but not what I was there to learn ) .
The economics classes ?
Nope , mostly academic mumbo- jumbo that is entirely useless to all but a handful of policy makers .
The computer science classes ?
Hmm , maybe about 10 % of that I ’ve used , but it ’s nothing I could n’t have picked up with a couple good books , which I routinely do now .
The history , English , philosophy , and physics ?
Aside from giving me a general understanding of the world and making me sound smart at cocktail parties , I ca n’t think of anything in there that I really use on a day to day basis .
Much of college gave me a bad taste for education .
It made learning a real drag .
I got through it to get the degree , but it was n’t until after school that my education really began .
So what are the top skills that should be taught to every man , woman , and child who enters our education system ?
I ’m glad you asked …
How to make people like you and network
For a skill so essential to success that affects every area of your life ( from dating , to family , to work ) it ’s amazing how little people know about this .
I can hear you saying …
” I thought some people were just born with it and the rest of us were out of luck !
You mean it ’s something you can study ? ”
Well , yes !
Advertising
There is great power in knowing you can reach out to your network whenever you have a problem to solve , to be able to reach key influencers at conferences and meetings , to make an impression on audiences , to project confidence and trustworthiness , and to make friends with other successful people .
The shy folks lurking in the corners at cocktails parties will never reach their full potential as human beings because our school system did n’t place enough value on “ being social ” .
President Bush did n’t get the best grades at Princeton , but boy did he know how to network , and look where that got him .

How to speed read and the power of audio books
Yes , speed reading and speed comprehension is real .
The nominal investment of time it takes to learn pays off in spades for the rest of your life .
After all , how would your life be different if you were able to read an extra book each week ?
The same goes with audio books .
If you spend an hour per day in the car learning instead of cursing at other drivers or listening to Britney Spears , you will have attended the equivalent of an entire semester course .
Every major book today comes out on audio book , and you can read ( listen to ) them all without taking any additional time out of your day .
Why would n’t you ?
Looking at all the “ required reading ” links in this article might seem a little overwhelming , but I was able to listen to them all on audio books while driving around town .
It was actually fun .

How to set goals and manage time
Want to know how to get anything done in life ?
Our school system does n’t feel that this is worth teaching apparently , but call me crazy , I think it ’s important ( I ’m probably preaching to the choir on LifeHack.org , but still ) .
The research that has come out lately is groundbreaking … everything from eliminating multi-tasking , using blocks of uninterrupted time where phone and email are off , prioritized to - do lists , urgent but unimportant vs. non-urgent but important tasks , etc .
If you have ever found yourself being busy all day only to wonder what you accomplished at the end of it , then you need to learn this stuff .
Understanding productivity will give you such an advantage over other people it ’s hardly even fair .

How to read a financial statement
Robert Kiyosaki is fond of saying that the rich teach their children how to read financial statements and the poor do not .
He is right .
Schools have never been very good at teaching people how to get rich , probably in no small part because professors are generally poor and would n’t know how to teach it .
Advertising
Yet with 95 % of our population retiring at or below the poverty level , the economy in the dumps , and many people losing their homes to foreclosure , I bet plenty of Americans wish their school system had been a little more focused on money .
After leaving college my friends could tell you the symbolic meaning behind the Brother ’s Grimm Fairy Tales , but they could n’t tell you the difference between a balance sheet and income statement .
Nice job school system !

How to negotiate , use contracts , and not get taken advantage of
If you want to accomplish anything of significance you ’re going to have to work with other people .
Whether its contractors , outsourcing , employees , etc … there is a certain art to structuring good contracts with these people , knowing how to find good talent , measuring results , knowing how to fire them , and not getting completely taken for a ride in the process .
School teaches you none of this and most people have to learn it from the school of hard knocks by literally get taken advantage of several times .

How to be successful in life
Sounds sort of broad , does n’t it ?
Yet some people have devoted a lifetime to understanding what makes people happy and successful .
There are the big three : health , wealth , and relationships .
People need to find what they really want to do with their life ( something few of us ever really think about ) .
We need to figure out how to do scary things that would be good for us , break bad habits , how to let go of bad things in the past , etc .

How to spread an idea and basic marketing
Finally , I ’ll just say that the basics of marketing are something everyone should understand .
Even if you do n’t think you ’re in marketing , you ’re in marketing .
If you have an idea at work , or want to get a raise , or want to convince your kids to go see a movie then there is something applicable from the marketing world .
Even just picking out a good headline for something you ’re writing so that it will actually get read requires some basic marketing skills .

Conclusion
Until the school system comes around , I suppose its up to each of us to take care of our own education .
That means reading , finding mentors , audio books , going to conferences , and of course blogs are a great resource .
What did you miss out on in school that you wish you ’d learned ?
Or if you ’re an educator do you feel there is a mismatch between what is taught and what ’s important ?

“ The FreeBSD project is finally , after much work , pleased to announce the availability of an official FreeBSD web based discussion forum .
It is our hope that this forum will serve as a public support channel for FreeBSD users around the world and as a complement to our fine mailing lists . ”
The bank responds that the loan agreement makes clear that it has a right to do everything it has done , and that Mr. Trump should live up to his obligations , paying $ 40 million of the $ 334 million outstanding balance on the construction loan .
The rest is owed by the Trump - controlled company sponsoring the project but is not personally guaranteed by him .
If Mr. Trump was forced to pay the $ 40 million , he would be unlikely to permanently lose it , since his company would owe it to him .
If the project went under , his claim would rank higher than the Fortress loan .
Deutsche will make nothing from its investment in the junior loan if Mr. Trump does lose any money .
Some sort of settlement seems wise .
It is in everyone ’s interest that construction be completed , and in fact the bank advanced $ 13 million to pay contractors ’ bills this week .
Mr. Trump has not said by how much he thinks the apartments are overpriced , and he did not tell me .
But it seems unlikely that sales will be very good until prices are cut .
In his suit , Mr. Trump claims that the bank ’s “ predatory lending practices ” are harming his reputation , “ which is associated worldwide with on - time , under - budget , first - class construction projects and first - class luxury hotel operations . ”
The bank seized on the opportunity to discuss Mr. Trump ’s reputation .
“ Trump is no stranger to overdue debt , ” it said in asking that his suit be thrown out of court .
It noted that Mr. Trump ’s casino operations have filed for bankruptcy twice , adding , “ This suit is classic Trump . ”
The bank did not discuss why that history did not dissuade it from making the loan .
One explanation might be that the fees it got for arranging the loan more than offset the risk from the small part of the loan it kept on its own books .

Hannah's 4th Super Mario Galaxy Cake
It brings a tear to my eye to sucker my 3 year old daughter to want a Super Mario cake .
Since she had a different answer everyday for what party she wanted I suggested the Galaxy cake since we were playing it on our second time through with Luigi .
After getting the 121st star I had her all suckered in :) .
I had an extremely hard time deciding what to put on the cake .
If you 've played the game you might understand .
There are so many levels its ridiculous .
I had to have the castle and one round world .
And for some reason I got bent on having the glass pill looking planet thing which I just thought would look cool on a cake .
The silver disc was an add on at the end of my decision so I could add Luigi and the spinning move specific to Galaxy .
Seriously , I had the worst time cutting out worlds I wanted on here .
Here are some sketches from planning .
Sketch 1 Sketch 2 Luigi and spinning mech ( not used as drawn ) round world stuff 3D model wood cutouts .
I made some scale drawings of the structure to make it faster since I started just a week and a half before the party .
I printed them to scale , glued them on the wood and cut away .
From there it went together fairly quickly with some modifications due to wiring actual motor sizes etc .
I grabbed as many decent pics of planets as I could find on internet without having to screen grab from my own game .
I was able to get very decent images without resorting to work .
Then I photoshopped the space background and added the planets and effects .
This is what I ended up with .
I also photoshopped the spinning vortex and printed it on a transparency , you see that spinning in the background .
Here is my initial test for the spinning Luigi .
I did n't like the speed afterward so I put a higher RPM motor over the top of this motor later .
As you can see , the slow motor presses the button to close the circuit to make Luigi spin and also ( though I do n't have a video of it ) presses the red spike guy up the disc which is yanked back by some elastic when the rod slides down the steep angle of the mech .
Second test video and one more picture .
Never did take the slow motor off , I figured it could be a backup if my speedy motor blew up or something .
The round world was a bit of a pain only because I could n't fit the motors I wanted inside .
I had 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 30 , 40 and 145 rpm motors available but the only speed I liked for Mario was the 12 which was of course the largest of them .
I decided to allow it to stick out and place the gun over top to camouflage it pic 1 pic 2 pic 3 .
The other 2 motors were easy .
One straight to the star .
For the piranha plant , a generic linkage I made by smashing some sheet metal ( back tab of a PC case ) into a rotating lever arm ( seen in the previous pictures , upper left ) .
By the original design , the pill planet was stationary .
Then by extreme chance I was looking for who knows what and found that I 'd ordered an angled joint which would allow me to spin the table at an angle .
I had to do it .
It took an extra night 's work but it was worth it .
I attached a lazy suzan to the table .
Then routed out the the pill bottom to allow rotation around the lazy suzan and some structure in the center of the lazy suzan for the joint to attach and spin the pill .
Once attached , the joint fit into the wood center .
This might be more complicated than it should be but I wanted that part hidden inside the structure and not 3 " thick , once the foam was put over the top you could n't see a thing .
To make the inside , we made six 6 ” dia by 2 ” thick molds of Rice Krispy treats , then cut those into 6 ” x1 ” giving us 12 to stack .
From there it was just stacking and cutting to make a playable level .
The fondant stuck really really really well to the rice krispies ( go figure )
If you look you ’ll see that it could be played if Mario were really there .
The star bits bouncing around under the castle rock were done with a previously created motor ( Dinosaur babies ) .
It is just some bent metal with 3 small springs ( does n't have to be springs ) some fishing line and fishing weights to keep tension so it does n't tangle up .
The paper circles on the side also keep the line from crossing .
Here is a pic inside the castle rock which is under the castle .
You can see Bowser 's motor there .
Very simple , motor goes round , Bowser rocks back and forth .
The vortex is a straight shaft from the printed transparency to the motor , though looking back I wish I 'd grabbed a faster motor , this was too slow when compared to the game .
The characters , Mario , Luigi , Peach , Bowser were bought .
The rest are either fondant frosting or painted Sculpy clay ( goombas , turtles , coins , piranha plant , red spinner , star , lumas , etc ) .
The star bits are shiny beads for necklaces .
The background was printed and attached to foamcore then scored and bent .
I could n't find a way to fit Rosalina in there .
I had her from buying the character set but could n't get her in the design .
Motors :
Mario and bullet
Star
Piranha Plant
Vortex
Star bits ( 3 separate strands moving around under the castle rock )
Bowser
Spinning spike guy ( this motor moves both the spinning red guy and presses the button to activate Luigi 's motor to spin )
Luigi
Pill planet
Lights :
100 strand of fiber optics in space background ( attached to a LED star field fiber optic box )
Flickering EL wire ( simulates electricity )
Sound :
There were 21 songs from the game playing from the mp3 player and speakers crammed in with the mass of wires in the base .
Luckily someone had posted the music on youtube already so I did n't have to rip them myself .
The songs were : Good Egg Galaxy , Gusty Garden , Buoy Base , Final Battle , Space Junk , Battlerock , Doomship , Ghostly , Drip Drop , Toy Time , Honeyhive , Beach Bowl , Dusty Dune , Bonefin , Purple Coins , Star Festival , Galaxy Gateway , Bowsers Reactor , Obstacle Course , Toy Robot and Comet Observatory .
I believe it is 7 batches of Rice Krispies and 7 cakes .
What parts are edible you say ?
The top ~ 60 % of the round planet is cake .
The entire castle is cake and the castle towers are Rice Krispies .
The pill planet is Rice Krispies .
The silver disc is cake .
My favorite part of the cake has to be the fiber optic shimmering lights in the background of space .
Not so easy to see in the video or pics but I thought that looked really neat .
I bought those cables years ago as a just in case I need them item , and here they are !
My second would be the bouncy star bits .
So what ’s missing ?
For sure a crystal with star bits in it .
Was planning to glass candy some but ran out of time .
I ’d also a ring of star bits that Mario and Bullet Bill flew through , thought of that after the party of course .
I was planning a ring of star bits ( rotating of course ) in space but somehow forgot about that in the craziness of everything else .
Rosalina .
I also would n’t have minded a couple more characters in there somewhere moving around .
Here is the cake afterward , the party is all done ....
Enjoy .

“ Chinese medicine , ” often called “ Oriental medicine ” or “ traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) , ” encompasses a vast array of folk medical practices based on mysticism .
It holds that the body ’s vital energy ( chi or qi ) circulates through channels , called meridians , that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions .
Illness is attributed to imbalance or interruption of chi ..
Ancient practices such as acupuncture , Qigong , and the use of various herbs are claimed to restore balance .
Traditional acupuncture , as now practiced , involves the insertion of stainless steel needles into various body areas .
A low - frequency current may be applied to the needles to produce greater stimulation .
Other procedures used separately or together with acupuncture include : moxibustion ( burning of floss or herbs applied to the skin ) ; injection of sterile water , procaine , morphine , vitamins , or homeopathic solutions through the inserted needles ; applications of laser beams ( laserpuncture ) ; placement of needles in the external ear ( auriculotherapy ) ; and acupressure ( use of manual pressure ) .
Treatment is applied to “ acupuncture points , ” which are said to be located throughout the body .
Originally there were 365 such points , corresponding to the days of the year , but the number identified by proponents during the past 2,000 years has increased gradually to about 2,000 [ 1 ] .
Some practitioners place needles at or near the site of disease , whereas others select points on the basis of symptoms .
In traditional acupuncture , a combination of points is usually used .
Qigong is also claimed to influence the flow of “ vital energy . ”
Internal Qigong involves deep breathing , concentration , and relaxation techniques used by individuals for themselves .
External Qigong is performed by “ Qigong masters ” who claim to cure a wide variety of diseases with energy released from their fingertips .
However , scientific investigators of Qigong masters in China have found no evidence of paranormal powers and some evidence of deception .
They found , for example , that a patient lying on a table about eight feet from a Qigong master moved rhythmically or thrashed about as the master moved his hands .
But when she was placed so that she could no longer see him , her movements were unrelated to his [ 2 ] .
Falun gong , which China banned several years ago , is a Qigong varient claimed to be “ a powerful mechanism for healing , stress relief and health improvements . ”
Most acupuncturists espouse the traditional Chinese view of health and disease and consider acupuncture , herbal medicine , and related practices to be valid approaches to the full gamut of disease .
Others reject the traditional approach and merely claim that acupuncture offers a simple way to achieve pain relief .
The diagnostic process used by TCM practitioners may include questioning ( medical history , lifestyle ) , observations ( skin , tongue , color ) , listening ( breathing sounds ) , and pulse - taking .
Six pulse aspects said to correlate with body organs or functions are checked on each wrist to determine which meridians are “ deficient ” in chi .
( Medical science recognizes only one pulse , corresponding to the heartbeat , which can be felt in the wrist , neck , feet , and various other places . )
Some acupuncturists state that the electrical properties of the body may become imbalanced weeks or even months before symptoms occur .
These practitioners claim that acupuncture can be used to treat conditions when the patient just “ does n’t feel right , ” even though no disease is apparent .
TCM ( as well as the folk medical practices of various other Asian countries ) is a threat to certain animal species .
For example , black bears — valued for their gall bladders — have been hunted nearly to extinction in Asia , and poaching of black bears is a serious problem in North America .
Dubious Claims
The conditions claimed to respond to acupuncture include chronic pain ( neck and back pain , migraine headaches ) , acute injury - related pain ( strains , muscle and ligament tears ) , gastrointestinal problems ( indigestion , ulcers , constipation , diarrhea ) , cardiovascular conditions ( high and low blood pressure ) , genitourinary problems ( menstrual irregularity , frigidity , impotence ) , muscle and nerve conditions ( paralysis , deafness ) , and behavioral problems ( overeating , drug dependence , smoking ) .
However , the evidence supporting these claims consists mostly of practitioners ’ observations and poorly designed studies .
A controlled study found that electroacupuncture of the ear was no more effective than placebo stimulation ( light touching ) against chronic pain [ 3 ] .
In 1990 , three Dutch epidemiologists analyzed 51 controlled studies of acupuncture for chronic pain and concluded that “ the quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre .
. . .
The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful . ” [ 4 ]
They also examined reports of acupuncture used to treat addictions to cigarettes , heroin , and alcohol , and concluded that claims that acupuncture is effective as a therapy for these conditions are not supported by sound clinical research [ 5 ] .
Acupuncture anesthesia is not used for surgery in the Orient to the extent that its proponents suggest .
In China physicians screen out patients who appear to be unsuitable .
Acupuncture is not used for emergency surgery and often is accompanied by local anesthesia or narcotic medication [ 6 ] .
How acupuncture may relieve pain is unclear .
One theory suggests that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various “ gates ” to these areas .
Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce narcotic - like substances called endorphins , which reduce pain .
Other theories suggest that the placebo effect , external suggestion ( hypnosis ) , and cultural conditioning are important factors .
Melzack and Wall note that pain relief produced by acupuncture can also be produced by many other types of sensory hyperstimulation , such as electricity and heat at acupuncture points and elsewhere in the body .
They conclude that “ the effectiveness of all of these forms of stimulation indicates that acupuncture is not a magical procedure but only one of many ways to produce analgesia [ pain relief ] by an intense sensory input . ”
In 1981 , the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs noted that pain relief does not occur consistently or reproducibly in most people and does not operate at all in some people [ 7 ] .
In 1995 , George A. Ulett , M.D. , Ph.D. , Clinical Professor of Psychiatry , University of Missouri School of Medicine , stated that “ devoid of metaphysical thinking , acupuncture becomes a rather simple technique that can be useful as a nondrug method of pain control . ”
He believes that the traditional Chinese variety is primarily a placebo treatment , but electrical stimulation of about 80 acupuncture points has been proven useful for pain control [ 8 ] .
In 1998 , Parade magazine published an article in which Isadore Rosenfeld , M.D. described how he had observed a woman undergo what he believed to be open heart surgery using acupuncture for anesthesia .
However , close analysis of the story indicates that there was fakery involved because the incident could not have taken place as described [ 9 ] .
The quality of TCM research in China has been extremely poor .
A 1999 analysis of 2,938 reports of clinical trials reported in Chinese medical journals concluded that that no conclusions could be drawn from the vast majority of them .
The researchers stated :
In most of the trials , disease was defined and diagnosed according to conventional medicine ; trial outcomes were assessed with objective or subjective ( or both ) methods of conventional medicine , often complemented by traditional Chinese methods .
Over 90 % of the trials in non-specialist journals evaluated herbal treatments that were mostly proprietary Chinese medicines .
. . .
Although methodological quality has been improving over the years , many problems remain .
The method of randomisation was often inappropriately described .
Blinding was used in only 15 % of trials .
Only a few studies had sample sizes of 300 subjects or more .
Many trials used as a control another Chinese medicine treatment whose effectiveness had often not been evaluated by randomised controlled trials .
Most trials focused on short term or intermediate rather than long term outcomes .
Most trials did not report data on compliance and completeness of follow up .
Effectiveness was rarely quantitatively expressed and reported .
Intention to treat analysis was never mentioned .
Over half did not report data on baseline characteristics or on side effects .
Many trials were published as short reports .
Most trials claimed that the tested treatments were effective , indicating that publication bias may be common ; a funnel plot of the 49 trials of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke confirmed selective publication of positive trials in the area , suggesting that acupuncture may not be more effective than the control treatments . [ 10 ]
Two scientists at the University of Heidelberg have developed a “ fake needle ” that may enable acupuncture researchers to perform better - designed controlled studies .
The device is a needle with a blunt tip that moves freely within a copper handle .
When the tip touches the skin , the patient feels a sensation similar to that of an acupuncture needle .
At the same time , the visible part of the needle moves inside the handle so it appears to shorten as though penetrating the skin .
When the device was tested on volunteers , none suspected that it had not penetrated the skin [ 11 ] .
In 2004 , a University of Heidelberg team proved the worth of their “ sham acupuncture ” technique in a study of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) in women who underwent breast or gynecologic surgery .
The study involved 220 women who received either acupuncture or the sham procedure at the acupuncture point “ Pericardium 6 ” on the inside of the forearm .
No significant difference in PONV or antivomiting medication use was found between the two groups or between the people who received treatment before anesthesia was induced and those who received it while anesthetized [ 12 ] .
A subgroup analysis found that vomiting was “ significantly reduced ” among the acupuncture patients , but the authors correctly noted that this finding might be due to studying multiple outcomes .
( As the number of different outcome measures increases , so do the odds that a “ statistically significant ” finding will be spurious . )
This study is important because PONV reduction is one of the few alleged benefits of acupuncture supported by reports in scientific journals .
However , the other positive studies were not as tightly controlled .
Harriet Hall , a retired family practitioner who is interested in quackery , has summed up the significance of acupuncture research in an interesting way :
Acupuncture studies have shown that it makes no difference where you put the needles .
Or whether you use needles or just pretend to use needles ( as long as the subject believes you used them ) .
Many acupuncture researchers are doing what I call Tooth Fairy science : measuring how much money is left under the pillow without bothering to ask if the Tooth Fairy is real .
Risks Exist
Improperly performed acupuncture can cause fainting , local hematoma ( due to bleeding from a punctured blood vessel ) , pneumothorax ( punctured lung ) , convulsions , local infections , hepatitis B ( from unsterile needles ) , bacterial endocarditis , contact dermatitis , and nerve damage .
The herbs used by acupuncture practitioners are not regulated for safety , potency , or effectiveness .
There is also risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition .
The adverse effects of acupuncture are probably related to the nature of the practitioner ’s training .
A survey of 1,135 Norwegian physicians revealed 66 cases of infection , 25 cases of punctured lung , 31 cases of increased pain , and 80 other cases with complications .
A parallel survey of 197 acupuncturists , who are more apt to see immediate complications , yielded 132 cases of fainting , 26 cases of increased pain , 8 cases of pneumothorax , and 45 other adverse results [ 13 ] .
However , a 5 - year study involving 76 acupuncturists at a Japanese medical facility tabulated only 64 adverse event reports ( including 16 forgotten needles and 13 cases of transient low blood pressure ) associated with 55,591 acupuncture treatments .
No serious complications were reported .
The researchers concluded that serious adverse reactions are uncommon among acupuncturists who are medically trained [ 14 ] .
In 2001 , members of the British Acupuncture Council who participated in two prospective studies reported low complication rates and no serious complications among patients who underwent a total of more than 66,000 treatments [ 15,16 ] .
An accompany editorial suggested that in competent hands , the likelihood of complcations is small [ 17 ] .
Since outcome data are not available , the studies cannot compare the balance of risks vs benefit .
Nor do the studies take into account the likelihood of misdiagnosis ( and failure to seek appropriate medical care ) by practitioners who use traditional Chinese methods .
There is also financial risk .
Online information suggests that the cost per visit ranges from about $ 50 to $ 100 per treatment , with the first visit to a practitioner costing more .
Herbal products , which many practitioners commonly prescribe , could range anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per month .
Questionable Standards
In 1971 , an acupuncture boom occurred in the United States because of stories about visits to China by various American dignitaries .
Entrepreneurs , both medical and nonmedical , began using flamboyant advertising techniques to promote clinics , seminars , demonstrations , books , correspondence courses , and do - it - yourself kits .
Today some states restrict the practice of acupuncture to physicians or others operating under their direct supervision .
In about 20 states , people who lack medical training can perform acupuncture without medical supervision .
The FDA now classifies acupuncture needles as Class II medical devices and requires labeling for one - time use by practitioners who are legally authorized to use them [ 18 ] .
Acupuncture is not covered under Medicare .
The March 1998 issue of the Journal of the American Chiropractic Association carried a five - part cover story encouraging chiropractors to get acupuncture training , which , according to one contributor , would enable them to broaden the scope of their practice [ 19 ] .
The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ( NCCAOM ) has set voluntary certification standards and offers separate certifications on Oriental medicine , acupuncture , Chinese herbology , and Asian bodywork therapy .
In 2007 , it reported that its certification programs or exams were be recognized for licensure in 40 states and the District of Columbia and that more than 20,000 practitioners are licensed in the United States [ 20 ] .
( The Acupuncture.com Web site provides information on the licensing status of each state . )
The credentials used by acupuncturists include C.A. ( certified acupuncturist ) , Lic. Ac. ( licensed acupuncturist ) , M.A. ( master acupuncturist ) , Dip. Ac. ( diplomate of acupuncture ) , Dipl.O.M. ( diplomate of Oriental medicine ) , and O.M.D. ( doctor of Oriental medicine ) .
Some of these have legal significance , but they do not signify that the holder is competent to make adequate diagnoses or render appropriate treatment .
In 1990 , the U.S. Secretary of Education recognized what is now called the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ( ACAOM ) as an accrediting agency .
However , such recognition is not based on the scientific validity of what is taught but upon other criteria [ 21 ] .
Ulett has noted :
Certification of acupuncturists is a sham .
While a few of those so accredited are naive physicians , most are nonmedical persons who only play at being doctor and use this certification as an umbrella for a host of unproven New Age hokum treatments .
Unfortunately , a few HMOs , hospitals , and even medical schools are succumbing to the bait and exposing patients to such bogus treatments when they need real medical care .
The National Council Against Health Fraud has concluded :
Acupuncture is an unproven modality of treatment .
Its theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge
Research during the past 20 years has not demonstrated that acupuncture is effective against any disease .
Perceived effects of acupuncture are probably due to a combination of expectation , suggestion , counter - irritation , conditioning , and other psychologic mechanisms .
The use of acupuncture should be restricted to appropriate research settings ,
Insurance companies should not be required by law to cover acupuncture treatment ,
Licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out .
Consumers who wish to try acupuncture should discuss their situation with a knowledgeable physician who has no commercial interest [ 22 ] .
The NIH Debacle
In 1997 , a Consensus Development Conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and several other agencies concluded that “ there is sufficient evidence . . . of acupuncture ’s value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its physiology and clinical value . ” [ 23 ]
The panelists also suggested that the federal government and insurance companies expand coverage of acupuncture so more people can have access to it .
These conclusions were not based on research done after NCAHF ’s position paper was published .
Rather , they reflected the bias of the panelists who were selected by a planning committee dominated by acupuncture proponents [ 24 ] .
NCAHF board chairman Wallace Sampson , M.D. , described the conference “ a consensus of proponents , not a consensus of valid scientific opinion . ”
Although the consensus report described some serious problems , it failed to place them into proper perspective .
The panel acknowledged that “ the vast majority of papers studying acupuncture consist of case reports , case series , or intervention studies with designs inadequate to assess efficacy ” and that “ relatively few ” high - quality controlled trials have been published about acupuncture ’s effects .
But it reported that “ the World Health Organization has listed more than 40 [ conditions ] for which [ acupuncture ] may be indicated . ”
This sentence should have been followed by a statement that the list was not valid .
Far more serious , although the consensus report touched on Chinese acupuncture theory , it failed to point out the danger and economic waste involved in going to practitioners who ca n’t make appropriate diagnoses .
The report noted :
The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow ( Qi ) through the body that are essential for health .
Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease .
The acupuncturist can correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin .
Acupuncture focuses on a holistic , energy - based approach to the patient rather than a disease - oriented diagnostic and treatment model .
Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the “ acupuncture points , ” the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial .
Even more elusive is the scientific basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of Qi , the meridian system , and the five phases theory , which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture .
Simply stated , this means that if you go to a practitioner who practices traditional Chinese medicine , you are unlikely to be properly diagnosed .
Very few publications have mentioned this , which strikes me as very strange .
Even Consumer Reports magazine has advised readers who want acupuncture treatment to consult a practitioner who is NCCAOM - certified .
I advise people to avoid “ certified ” practitioners .
Because the training needed for certification is based on nonsensical TCM theories , the safest way to obtain acupuncture is from a medical doctor who does research at a university - based medical school and does not expouse such theories .
Diagnostic Variability
In 1998 , following a lecture I attended at a local college , an experienced TCM practitioner diagnosed me by taking my pulse and looking at my tongue .
He stated that my pulse showed signs of “ stress ” and that my tongue indicated I was suffering from “ congestion of the blood . ”
A few minutes later , he told a woman that her pulse showed premature ventricular contractions ( a disturbance of the heart ’s rhythm that could be harmless or significant , depending on whether the individual has underlying heart disease ) .
He suggested that both of us undergo treatment with acupuncture and herbs — which would have cost about $ 90 per visit .
I took the woman ’s pulse and found that it was completely normal .
I believe that the majority of nonmedical acupuncturists rely on improper diagnostic procedures .
The NIH consensus panel should have emphasized the seriousness of this problem .
Subsequent research has confirmed that TCM diagnosis has very little to do with people ’s real health problems .
At least six studies have found that when multiple practitioners see the same patient , their TCM diagnoses vary considerably .
In a study published in 2001 , a 40 - year - old woman with chronic back pain who visited seven acupuncturists during a 2 - week period was diagnosed with “ Qi stagnation ” by 6 of them , “ blood stagnation ” by 5 , “ kidney Qi deficiency ” by 2 , “ yin deficiency ” by 1 , and “ liver Qi deficiency ” by 1 .
The proposed treatments varied even more .
Among the six who recorded their recommendations , the practitioners planned to use between 7 and 26 needles inserted into 4 to 16 specific “ acupuncture points ” in the back , leg , hand , and foot .
Of 28 acupuncture points selected , only 4 ( 14 % ) were prescribed by two or more acupuncturists . [ 25 ] .
The study appears to have been designed to make the results as consistent as possible .
All of the acupuncturists had been trained at a school of traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) .
Six other volunteers were excluded because they “ used highly atypical practices , ” and three were excluded because they had been in practice for less than three years .
The study ’s authors stated that the diagnostic findings showed “ considerable consistency ” because nearly all of the practitioners found Qi or blood stagnation .
However , the most likely explanation was that these are diagnosed in nearly everyone .
In another study , six TCM acupuncturists evaluated the same six patients on the same day .
Twenty diagnoses and 65 acupoints were used at least once .
The diagnosis of “ Qi / Blood Stagnation with Kidney Deficiency ” and the acupoint UB23 were used for every patient by most acupuncturists .
However , consistency across acupuncturists regarding diagnostic details and other acupoints was poor .
No diagnoses , and only one acupoint , were used preferentially for a subgroup of patients .
Some diagnoses and treatment recommendations were dependent more on the practitioner than on the patient .
Fine - grained diagnoses and most acupoints were unrelated to either patient or practitioner .
The researchers concluded that TCM diagnoses and treatment recommendations for specific patients with chronic low back pain vary widely from one practitioner to another [ 26 ] .
Another study examined TCM diagnoses and treatments for patients with chronic low - back pain using two separate sets of treatment records .
Information from more than 150 initial visits was available for analysis .
A diagnosis of “ Qi and Blood Stagnation ” or “ Qi Stagnation ” was made for 85 % of patients .
A diagnosis of kidney deficiency ( or one of its three subtypes ) was made for 33 % - 51 % of patients .
Other specific diagnoses were made for less than 20 % of the patients .
An average of 12 - 13 needles was used in each treatment .
Although more than 85 different acupoints were used in each data set , only 5 or 6 acupoints were used in more than 20 of the treatments in each data set .
Only two of those acupoints ( UB23 , UB40 ) were the same for both sources of data .
More than half of the patients received adjunctive treatments , including heat ( 36% - 67 % ) , and cupping ( 16 % - 21 % ) .
There was substantial variability in treatments among providers [ 27 ] .
In a larger study published in 2004 , three TCM practitioners examined the same 39 rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients separately at the University of Maryland General Clinical Research Center .
Each patient filled out a questionnaire and underwent a physical examination that included tongue and pulse diagnosis .
Then each practitioner provided both a TCM diagnosis and a herbal prescription .
Agreement on TCM diagnoses among the 3 pairs of TCM practitioners ranged from 25.6 % to 33.3 % .
The degree to which the herbal prescriptions agreed with textbook recommended practice of each TCM diagnosis ranged from 87.2 % to 100 % .
The study ’s authors concluded :
The total agreement on TCM diagnosis on RA patients among 3 TCM practitioners was low .
When less stringent , but theoretically justifiable , criteria were employed , greater consensus was obtained .
. . .
The correspondence between the TCM diagnosis and the herbal formula prescribed for that diagnosis was high , although there was little agreement among the 3 practitioners with respect to the herbal formulas prescribed for individual patients [ 28 ] .
The University of Maryland researchers then repeated the above study using 40 RA patients and three practitioners who had had at least five years of experience .
The results were nearly identical to the previous findings [ 29 ] .
In another study , 37 participants with frequent headaches were independently evaluated by three licensed acupuncturists said to be highly trained in TCM .
The acupuncturists identified the meridians and type of dysfunction they believed were contributing to the participants ’ symptoms .
The acupuncturists also ascribed one or more TCM diagnoses to each participant and selected eight acupuncture points for needling .
Some variation in TCM pattern diagnosis and point selection was observed for all subjects .
“ Liver Yang ” and “ Qi dysfunction ” were diagnosed in more than two thirds of subjects .
Acupuncture points Liver 3 , Large Intestine 4 , and Governing Vessel ( DU ) 20 were the most commonly selected points for treatment [ 30 ] .
It would be fascinating to see what would happen if a healthy person who needed no medical treatment was examined by multiple acupuncturists .
The Bottom Line
TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health , disease , and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community .
TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses .
Even if they could agree , the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care .

Imagine a self - powered cellphone that charges by the pressure waves formed when you talk or walk .
Researchers have found a certain type of piezoelectric material that can covert energy at a 100 percent increase when manufactured at a very small size ( specifically 21 nanometers in thickness ) .
This suggests that disturbances in the form of sound waves could be harvested for powering nanodevices and microdevices of the future .
Here ’s how it works .
Piezoelectrics are ( usually ) crystal or ceramic materials that generate voltage when a form of mechanical stress is applied ( think car cigarette lighters ) .
It ’s an old technology now powering dance floors in Europe .
Combine piezoelectrics with the strange , infinitessimally small nanoworld , where many materials change their properties dramatically ( gold turns red , toxic , and liquid at room temperature ; opaque materials like copper become transparent ; insulators like silicon become conductors ) .
Piezoelectric materials at 21 - nm thick turn into power - harvesting titans .
The findings could have potentially profound effects for low - powered electronic devices like cell phones and laptops .
Many contain nano - sized components ( 1 nanometer equals one - billionth of a meter ) .
All need a lot of recharging .
But pressure - senstitive , self - powered piezoelectrics could harness energy from the sound waves in your speech or your walk .
Free of charge takes on a whole new meaning .

Earlier this week we reported on the court case between Apple and PsyStar , stating they went into settlement negotiations .
Details , however , were sparse .
The law firm representing PsyStar has now replied to the matter , and there ’s good news for those of us who hope to see crazy EULA clauses tested in court .
It ’s a “ non-story ” , a lawyer for PsyStar said .
The fact that both parties are entering negotiations does n’t really say anything .
“ The Northern District [ of California ] requires you to go through ADR .
It ’s standard practice , not for all courts , but the practice is growing .
Quite frankly , all the talk about entering negotiations is really a non-story . ”
He reiterates that the case is still “ very much alive ” .
The lawyer explains that according to him , the real story is PsyStar ’s reply to Apple ’s motion to dismiss .
Apple claims that “ Neither the federal nor the state antitrust laws require competitors to stop competing with , and instead to start helping , each other . ”
“ Apple is nothing if not tenacious , ” PsyStar argues , “ Having previously asserted this very same argument in attempts to dismiss antitrust claims related to Apple ’s iPod , iTunes Music Store , and iPhone ending in the Northern District of California . ”
PsyStar claims all those attempts to dismiss antitrust claims were denied too , and cited several rulings to support this claim .

That data has revealed signs of a complex Martian history of climate changethat produced a diversity of past wateryenvironments .
Among themajor findings during MRO 's primaryscience phase was the revelation that the action of water on and near thesurface of Mars occurred for hundreds of millions of years .
Thespacecraft also observed that signatures of a variety of watery environments , some acidic , some alkaline , increase the possibility that there are places on Mars that could reveal evidence of past life , if it ever existed .
Since movinginto position 186 miles ( 300 km ) above Mars ' surface in October 2006 , theorbiter has imaged nearly 40 percent of the planet at a resolution that canreveal house - sized objects in detail , and 1 percent in enough detail to seedesk - sized features .
The orbiteralso assembled nearly 700 daily global weather maps , dozens of atmospherictemperature profiles , and hundreds of radar profiles of the subsurface and theinterior of the polar caps .
" Theseobservations are now at the level of detail necessary to test hypotheses aboutwhen and where water has changed Mars and where future missions will be mostproductive as they search for habitable regions on Mars , " said RichardZurek , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter project scientist at NASA 's Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
The MarsReconnaissance Orbiter has found repetitive layering in Mars ' permanent polarice caps , which may record possible effects of cyclical changes in Mars ' tiltand orbit on global sunlight patterns .
Recentclimate cycles are indicated by radar detection of subsurface icy deposits outsidethe polar regions , where near - surface ice is not permanently stable .
Otherresults reveal details of ancient streambeds , atmospheric hazes and motions ofwater , along with the ever - changing weather on Mars .
MRO alsoimaged its surface - bound teammates , including the Mars rover Opportunity poisedon the rim of Victoria Crater and NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander duringits descent earlier this year to the surface .

Bernard L. Madoff is alleged to have pulled off one of the biggest frauds in Wall Street history .
But there were multiple red flags along the way , including a series of accusations leveled against Mr. Madoff 's operation .
Now some are asking why regulators and investors did n't pick up on the alleged scheme long ago .
" There 's no smoking ...
Longtime Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley has been indicted on more than 100 felony and misdemeanor counts stemming from a suspected failure to disclose interests in millions of dollars worth of property and other business dealings .
A joint investigation by the Maricopa County Attorney 's and Sheriff 's offices alleged that Stapley failed to disclose millions of dollars of loans , hundreds of thousands of dollars in deposits from checking accounts into business accounts , real - estate deals in Pinal County , and other assets .
The investigation reportedly turned up irregularities in Stapley 's financial - disclosure forms going back to 1994 .
For example , the County Attorney 's Office said that Stapley also failed to reveal a bankruptcy by one of his companies and that the assets listed on a 2006 loan application varied from the assets he listed on his 2006 - 07 financial - disclosure form .
Under state law , government officials must complete annual financial - disclosure statements .
On Nov. 20 , a Maricopa County grand jury handed up an indictment on 118 counts , including perjury , forgery , false swearing ( all felonies ) and filing an incomplete and / or false financial - disclosure form , a misdemeanor .
Stapley was out of the country and was not served with the indictment until Tuesday .
He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday .
" The allegations all pertain to non-disclosure at this time , " County Attorney Andrew Thomas said .
" We do n't have all the answers yet .
The sheriff does n't , either .
But we made a commitment to get to the bottom of this . "
Thomas ' office sought to have Stapley arrested , but a Maricopa County Superior Court commissioner refused to issue a warrant .
Thomas and Sheriff Joe Arpaio want to investigate whether any conflicts of interest occurred with the land parcels in question .
In his role as a county supervisor , Stapley makes decisions on land developments , rights of way and purchases of county property .
Also of concern was the potential participation of a felon who was an associate of Stapley .
Arpaio was concerned about whether other county employees tipped Stapley to the investigation .
Arpaio said that after deputies questioned employees in the county Board of Supervisors office and asked them to keep the matter confidential , Stapley filed amended disclosure forms .
" We are going to pursue any cover-ups in the case , " Arpaio said .
Stapley did not return calls but released a statement through his attorney .
" I have served in public office for 14 years , " he said .
" I 'm proud of that service .
I have always put the interest of the public first , including full and complete disclosure of any assets .
I stand falsely accused of failure to disclose financial information .
I have disclosed all the information and income required by law during my time in office .
I am shocked and disappointed that such accusations are being made .
I cannot fathom where these accusations came from or what motivated them , but if my integrity is being questioned , I assure you that I stand on my record of complete integrity and disclosure and will fight these allegations .
This matter should be quickly dismissed . "
Stapley 's family has been in the Phoenix area for 130 years .
A Republican , he was first elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1994 to represent Scottsdale , Mesa , Paradise Valley , Gilbert and parts of Phoenix .
He has risen to national prominence during his 14 years in office .
He is president of the National Association of Counties , which represents more than 2,000 county governments .
" We fully expect that he will continue to lead our association . . . in the months and years ahead , " association representative Jim Phillips said Tuesday .
Stapley has come under scrutiny before for his real - estate dealings .
He became a licensed real - estate agent in 1995 .
Then , in 1997 , he was the target of an Arizona Department of Real Estate investigation during his first term as a Maricopa County supervisor .
The department accused Stapley and others of illegally splitting acreage in the Santan foothills south of Queen Creek into smaller parcels for profit .
The practice carves up land without providing for adequate roads and utilities and violates Arizona laws designed to prevent haphazard development .
Three years later , in 2000 , the Department of Real Estate charged his associates in the land deal with land - splitting violations but did not charge Stapley .
The current investigation began earlier this year after a confidential tip to the County Attorney 's Office .
Thomas stressed that the investigation is ongoing .
He and Arpaio , both Republicans , said there are no political overtones to the investigation or the indictment .
" It 's sad sometimes when you have to do things against county officials you deal with every day , " Arpaio said .
" We have to do our job .
No one is immune . "

THE lizard people have eaten a vote in Beltrami County .
That ’s not so strange in a recount like the one underway in Minnesota  voters do all kinds of inexplicable things like inscribing “ lizard people ” in the write - in slot , as one did , invalidating his ballot .
Much more alarming is that hundreds of votes have disappeared in the still too - close - to - call Senate race between Norm Coleman , the Republican incumbent , and Al Franken , the Democratic candidate .
The missing ballots expose a fundamental flaw in our way of doing elections  one that proves the recount in Minnesota is futile .
Before the recount began on Nov. 19 , Mr. Coleman and Mr. Franken were within about 200 votes of each other .
With a little under three million ballots cast in the election , that margin was unbelievably small : a few thousandths of a percent separated the two candidates .
So , as Minnesota law requires , election officials began counting , by hand , every single ballot from the more than 4,000 precincts around the state .
Some missing ballots were misplaced : officials in Ramsey County  to their great embarrassment  discovered 171 uncounted ballots in a compartment of a voting machine .
Some errors were typos : a clerical mistake wiped out 25 votes in Blue Earth County .
During a military judicial hearing on Monday in GuantÃ¡namo Bay , Cuba , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other detainees charged with coordinating the attacks of September 11th told Judge Col .
Stephen Henley that they wished to stop filing legal motions and to confess in full .
However , some of the detainees hedged their statement - suggesting they might change their minds if they could not be assured of execution .
By January , some of the nearly 250 men at GuantÃ¡namo Bay Detention Facility will have been locked up for seven years .

Could Indiana 's constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage and civil unions make a comeback after all ?
While I wrote yesterday that the marriage amendment 's chances were slim according to the Indianapolis Star , WIBC radio has a different story to report .
The radio station says that the amendment will be back , but in a modified version to try and stymie activist 's arguments against the ban .
Opponents in 2007 argued the proposal would have unintended consequences , such as making it impossible to file domestic violence charges involving unmarried heterosexual couples .
Supporters disagreed , but with the amendment starting from scratch , Marion Representative Eric
Turner says he 's tweaked the wording to answer those objections .
Turner says the new version is modeled on amendments in other states which have stood up to similar scrutiny .
Turner notes about half of House Democrats voted for the amendment in 2005 , and says he expects some Democrats to file their own version of an amendment this year .
He says he hopes they 'll be able to persuade [ House Speaker Pat ]
Bauer to allow a hearing .
Rahm Emanuel : Obama Chief of Staff Contender ( Photos )
The nameis being floated around as thepick for White House chief of staff .
The 48 year old Chicago native is U.S. Representative D - Illinois since 2003 , representing the 5th district which encompasses the north side of Chicago .
The son of an immigrant , he began his career with the consumer rights organization Public Action , where he fought against big rate increases by local utilities .
A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in 1981 , he received a Master 's Degree in Speech and Communication from Northwestern University in 1985 .
Emanuel is the fourth ranking Democrat in the House behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Leader Steny Hoyer and Whip Jim Clyburn .
He served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the 2006 elections .
He was then elected the next chairman of the Democratic Caucus .
Rahm , who served as a political and policy adviser to President Clinton , continued their relationship as chairman of the DCCC , talked strategy with him at least once a month .
His strong style and fund raising prowess have elevated his stature considerably .
He co-authored the 2006 book The Plan : Big Ideas for America and is a member of the New Democrat Coalition .
Rahm knows policy , knows politics and knows Capitol Hill .
Obama could make the announcement as early as this week according to ABC News Chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos .
Emanuel and his wife have three children and reside in Chicago 's Ravenwood neighborhood .

The outrageous decision to make the Irish vote again shows the EU is thoroughly anti democratic .
The Irish voted No , and that should be that .
I hope the Irish vote it down even more heavily next time .
It also appears that there are changes to the Treaty , over the number of Commissioners .
This means it should be put again to the people and Parliaments of the EU everywhere .
This time the Uk government should honour its promise to give us a vote .
A cow called Metana is the center of an experiment led by Argentine Institute of Farmer Technology to reduce the methane released by cow flatulence .
Methane adds to the greenhouse effect , which causes global warming ( Image : Redux / Eyevine )
COWS , sheep and goats may seem like innocent victims of humanity ’s appetite for meat , but when it comes to climate change they have a dark secret .
Forget cars , planes or even power stations , some of the world ’s worst greenhouse gas emitters wander idly across rolling pastures chewing the cud , oblivious to the fact that their continuous belching ( and to a lesser degree , farting ) is warming the planet .
Take New Zealand , where 34.2 million sheep , 9.7 million cattle , 1.4 million deer and 155,000 goats emit 48 per cent of the country ’s greenhouse gases in the form of methane and nitrous oxide .
Worldwide , livestock burps are responsible for 18 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions – more than produced from all forms of transport combined .
Methane accounts for the bulk of ruminant green house gas emissions , one tonne of the gas has 25 times the global warming potential of the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide .
 Livestock are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transport combined 
Rising populations and incomes are expected to double the global demand for meat and milk from 229 to 465 million tonnes and 580 to 1043 million tonnes , respectively , by 2050 .
This will almost double the amount of greenhouse gases produced by livestock , dwarfing attempts to cut emissions elsewhere .

Are you in automotive R&D ? Experience and successful track record in automotive marketing ?
Worried about your job ?
Polish up your resume .
Chinese automakers are hiring .
“ After considering the risk of buying US auto manufacturers ’ assets , Chinese automakers realized that targeting their research and development ( R&D ) talent would be a more realistic and profitable option , ” writes China Daily today .
China Daily called around .
Zeng Qinghong , General Manager of Guangzhou Automobile Group , for instance said that his company is not interested at all in buying brands or whole companies in the U.S.A .
However , he ’s very interested in US auto professionals .
The head of his research center had already been on a recruitment trip to the US , and he was surprised : “ Interest shown by US auto talents in Guangzhou Auto exceeded expectations . ”
Xu Heyi , board chairman of Beijing Automotive Industry Corp said that they are also interested in talent from the US .
Even the Chinese government is prodding their auto industrialists to buy themselves some foreign know - how .
Says China Daily : “ In recent years , China ’s auto industry experienced a rapid annual growth of over 20 percent .
However , a shortage of technical experts and high level management executives became a bottleneck for the growing industry .
A capable auto R&D engineer in the US typically has eight to ten years of experience in the industry , while higher education for professional R&D experts in China is still a thing of the future . ”
Shanghai Securities
News finds a fly in the ointment : Money .
They figure , the annual after tax wages of an auto engineer with ten years of R&D experience in the US is between $ 120,000 and $ 140,000 , “ a salary Chinese auto manufacturers are not able to afford . ”
Not true .
I happen to know what joint ventures pay for top talent , and it ’s way above that .
Add to this the perks of a serviced apartment , a live - in maid that charges you $ 200 a month if you pay a lot , cost of living way below the US , and the prospects look quite interesting .
If you are single , half of China will want to marry you .
If you are married , your wife wo n’t want to go home where she has to cook and make her husband do the dishes .
Life in Guangzhou , Shanghai , or Beijing would definitely be better than in Detroit .
Just do n’t let them lure you to the smaller cities inland .
You ’d go bonkers .
France celebrated the 100th anniversary yesterday of the birth of one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century .
This was not just a centenary .
It was a genuine birthday .
Claude Lévi-Strauss , the father of structuralism and modern anthropology , born on 28 November 1908 , is still alive .
His work , after going out of fashion several times , is more alive than ever .
In an extraordinary career , which took him from the Amazon rainforests to US academia , by way of King 's Lynn , Lévi-Strauss stood anthropology on its head by refusing to see Western civilisation as superior and unique .
He was the first man to argue scientifically that the minds and cultures of so - called " primitive " or " savage " peoples were not inferior – or even different – to those of the allegedly " civilised " West .
His work developed the idea of " structuralism " , broadly speaking , the idea that patterns of thought and behaviour are determined by characteristics of the human brain which remain fixed wherever it may live .
His arguments influenced a new approach to the understanding – or some say over - analysis – of art and literature , which remains influential to this day .
He was also one of the first modern thinkers to challenge the notion of " progress " and to warn of the likely fate of mankind if we continue to ravage the planet .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
After studying law and philosophy at the Sorbonne , the 23 - year - old Lévi-Strauss set out on a completely new path after a late - night conversation with Lewis Daly , a British crypto-zoologist , or expert on mythical creatures .
Their conversation was in , of all places , King 's Lynn in Norfolk in 1931 .
The young Frenchman , born into a French - Jewish artistic family in Brussels , took an academic job in Brazil .
His pre-war studies of allegedly " primitive " Amazon peoples became the basis for his life 's work .
To mark his centenary , there are several exhibitions in Paris , including a free tour of Lévi-Strauss collections in the museum of non-Western art at the Quai Branly in Paris , which opened two years ago .
No less than 1,478 of the South and North American artefacts in the museum were brought by Lévi-Strauss .
He remained active into his 90s and attended meetings of the Académie Française until three or four years ago .
He lives in the 16th arrondissement of Paris , where he was brought up .
His last public appearance was at the opening of the Quai Branly museum in 2006 .
Although Lévi-Strauss is sometimes claimed as an intellectual of the left , he believes in the profound importance of tradition .
He campaigned against the admission of women to the Académie Francaise on the grounds that it had never been allowed before .
He was also one of the few French intellectuals to attack one of the great gurus of the French left , Jean - Paul Sartre .
Lévi-Strauss dismissed Sartre 's existentialism – the assertion that each individual is responsible for the morality of his own actions – as a " trashy novel philosophy " .
In his books , such as Tristes Tropiques ( 1955 ) and La Penseé Sauvage ( 1962 ) , Lévi-Strauss argues the opposite , that there are " universal laws of human thought " which sustain all cultures .
The same founding myths and the same kinship patterns , rooted in an abhorrence of incest , appear independently in cultures all over the world .
In his last published interview , in Le Monde in 2005 , Lévi-Strauss was pessimistic .
" The world I knew and loved had 2.5 billion people in it , " he said .
" The terrifying prospect of a population of 9 billion has plunged the human race into a system of self - poisoning . "
SocialMedian was barely a thought for people back in February , but it has gained a solid following in the 9 months of its existence .
Many people would ask why this startup has gained any traction .
It is yet another social news site with voting and commenting .
Did we really need another ?
Given the amount of traffic that socialmedian is getting , it is obvious that they are onto something .
With this in mind , I figured it was time to chat with SocialMedian Founder and CEO Jason Goldberg and find out if things were actually as good as they sounded .
A look Back
During the summer , there was rapid growth as SocialMedian added Google Reader and other service integration , as well as replize .
These features were added because of user feedback .
Goldberg has stated several times , " Our model at SocialMedian has been : small , fast , and listen to users . "
You have probably noticed that you do not see any advertising or many press releases plastered all over the major news sites .
Essentially , SocialMedian has been built through its user base .
The only " press coverage " you tend to see are reviews from various blogs , including here on Mashable .
Almost a month ago , SocialMedian integrated with Facebook and users saw a large amount of traffic coming from the popular social network .
Also , in the weeks leading up to the election , socialmedian announced partnerships with the Washington Post and The Guardian .
Their election widget was gaining adoption , and Goldberg stated that the few days following the widget release had seen a 300 % increase in traffic .
Why ?
It is probably due to the partnerships created through the Election Talk widget .
A chat with SocialMedian
Rob :
How big of a traffic boost did the Facebook integration give you ?
Jason :
We got a nice initial boost when we launched our Facebook integration as our existing members were suddenly easily able to find and follow their Facebook friends and to invite new friends to check out SocialMedian .
Since then , Facebook has been a steady boost for us as our users have amplified their SocialMedian activities to their Facebook friends and new users have also taken to our Facebook features .
On a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of overall impact to our growth and engagement , I 'd say Facebook integration has been about a 7 , but has the potential to be a 10 with some new developments we have planned to even better leverage the Facebook platform .
One thing the Facebook integration launch did though was it really went a long way towards starting to mainstream SocialMedian .
I used to measure our growth entirely on new registrations .
It taught me that awareness comes first then adoption .
The Facebook integration made a whole bunch of new people suddenly aware of SocialMedian via their Facebook friends .
After seeing SocialMedian postings on their friends '
Facebook pages for the 5th , 10th , 50th time , you start to see adoption .
The second thing it did was really up the engagement level on SocialMedian .
Suddenly it was really easy to follow people via Facebook .
That hit our currently active users with a slew of new follow messages , which ignited them .
Rob : Obviously , the Washington Post and Guardian partnerships are a big deal .
Do you see SocialMedian making several partnerships like this ?
Jason : YES !
It took us two weeks to put together the micro-site election .
socialmedian.com for the Washington Post and then 1 phone call to get The Guardian excited about taking the widget .
Now we know how to do it fast and know better to get ahead on working with more partners to include them .
We also built this in a way in which we can replicate it again and again and again with only 2 days to get a micro-site up and running for any topical SocialMedian news network .
We 'll do our second one next week for the Monaco Media Forum event in Monaco November 12th , where the Prince of Monaco brings together 300 leaders in the transformation of media .
It 's a closed event but SocialMedian will enable people to follow every blog post , video , picture , and tweet from home .
You heard that here first .
The page for that will be http://mmf.socialmedian.com.
Rob :
Do you see any scalability problems with the micro-site idea ?
Meaning how often can you do these without affecting how much staff you must maintain ?
Jason : No .
It basically builds right on top of our " news network " concept in which anyone can create a news network to gather and discuss news about a particular topic .
For these microsites like election.socialmedian.com or mmf.socialmedian.com , all we really do now is apply a template created for the election site which adds some additional views like " rising fast " in addition to " popular " and " recent " and which enables anyone to grab and embed a widget for the news network .
We can do hundreds of these without any negative resource impact .
Rob :
At the beginning of November Quantcast showed SocialMedian at just over 160 K page views , what is the real traffic ?
I saw the email regarding the 300 % increase over 3 days .
Does that give you over 475K pageviews ?
Jason : Conservative estimates had socialmedian at 500K pageviews ( rolling 30 days ) .
October ended consistently above 20 K per day .
Overall , there were 225K pageviews in September , 280K in October , and 120 K the first week of November with traffic rapidly increasing as we got closer to the election .
Quantcast has significantly more conservative numbers .
Rob :
So how do you measure user engagement ?
Jason : Clips / day is our best measure of engagement .
Clips aggregate all user activities : clipping , sharing , like / dislike , and 1st comment a user makes on a story .
In the past 60 days we 've gone from averaging 1500 clips / day to more than 3500 .
We have seen the same sort of increase in comments as well .
We attribute our replize feature , where users reply to other users vs. just leaving comments , as the key to the rapid rise in comment levels .
One thing worth noting is that Mixx has probably 4 - 5 x our traffic , but we are far higher than them on clips / story vs. their votes , and comments / story .
In other words , we have more quality traffic we think and more engaged users .
Rob :
Have you seen a traffic boost due to the election partnerships ?
Jason :
We see that our user growth has been more about the tech community suddenly all talking about SocialMedian at once vs. being all about the election .
Over the past 4 days we 've added more new registered users than in the previous 4 weeks .
We 've seen our 3 biggest traffic days yesterday ( on a Sunday ! ) and the two prior days .
It happened because users started talking publicly about how they seem to be getting value from SocialMedian .
Nothing beats positive word of mouth .
And we 've worked really hard to cultivate that , while spending $ 0 on outbound marketing .
It 's all about satisfying users and getting them engaged in the service .
Then , when they recommend the service to their friends or readers , it helps that newbies see a party going on when they get to SocialMedian ( a vibrant community ) that they can join in on vs. have to create .
Notably , our strongest area is still tech news and we still have a very tech - oriented early user base , but at the same time our users have created more than 2000 news networks on all sorts of topics .
Rob :
Will end of election season hurt traffic significantly , or are you seeing increased engagement from the new users ?
Jason :
So far we are holding up very nicely as new people introduced to SocialMedian because of the election and from Twit.tv seem to largely be staying around .
This past Sunday was our biggest Sunday in history and Monday was better than the Monday before the election ... so far so good .
I think it 's fair to say that the election helped draw people in but the discussion continues around the news of the day .
Rob :
What is the biggest complaint from users and how are you addressing it ?
Jason :
The biggest feature request we have is for us to add topical news search .
We have none right now .
That 's coming in just a couple of weeks .
We 're also working on better filters and cleaning up the UI , which have been big user requests / complaints .
Rob :
What do you see as the biggest reason for success ?
Jason :
The biggest reason for success is simple .
We listen to users .
We have done very little to focus on growth and marketing and instead focused almost entirely on helping one users at a time find value and get more engaged with the service .
Our theory is that one happy user will bring 10 over time .
That 's our focus .
Looking forward
Obviously , things look to be going very well for Jason and SocialMedian .
It is still too early to determine whether the traffic will decrease now that the election is over , but the micro-sites give SocialMedian the ability to have focused coverage on any major event or conference .
SocialMedian is maturing nicely , and I would definitely keep an eye on their future .
The biggest U.S. Internet service providers , which include the largest phone and cable companies , will roll out updates to their network over the next two months that promise to make some peer - to - peer traffic faster and more efficient , we have learned .
The results wo n't be immediate for consumers or ISPs , but the updates could make P2P downloads faster or video streams better over time .
And just as important , the updates could someday save service providers money on bandwidth and capex -- which their investors would welcome .
The upgrades could also potentially rejuvate the peer - to - peer content delivery industry , which -- despite high expectations -- has n't been able to win much business from big media clients .
The software , dubbed ' P4P ' , is a product of an industry association whose members include the two largest U.S. phone companies , AT&T ( T ) and Verizon ( VZ ) ; the largest U.S. cable company , Comcast ( CMCSA ) ; content delivery networks ( ' CDNs ' ) like NYC - based Pando , BitTorrent , and Grid Networks ; and tech companies like Cisco ( CSCO ) and VeriSign ( VRSN ) .
What does P4P do ?
It makes peer - to - peer transfers -- a huge chunk of all the bandwidth used on the Internet -- more efficient by sending more traffic , when possible , across the ISP 's internal network -- as opposed to across the broader Internet .
It can also prioritize P2P traffic from networks with which ISPs have so - called symbiotic " peering " relationships , which could save them money .
Big ISPs , such as AT&T , Verizon , and Comcast , have been testing the P4P technology for the last year or so and will start rolling it out nationwide in the next 60 days , we understand .
The move is especially symbolic for Comcast , which got heat earlier this year from the FCC for disrupting some of its subscribers '
P2P transfers , and has since switched to a network management system that does n't single out P2P .
What might the updates mean for consumers and ISPs ?
In the most recent P4P tests , announced yesterday , download speed increased an average 59 % over traditional P2P , and up to 150 % for the fastest class of users .
Efficiency improved , too :
The percentage of data delivered interally within each ISP -- best - case scenario -- increased from 14 % for normal P2P to as much as 89 % for P4P delivery .
P4P wo n't immediately work with the BitTorrent transfers that music and movie pirates prefer .
But it might someday if both ISPs and BitTorrent software makers support the technology .
( Hard to tell if this will happen : ISPs understandably do n't want to be perceived as helping pirates in any way .
But at the same time , they 're under pressure to make their networks as efficient as possible .
And pirates , of course , want speed . )
Instead , we understand , P4P will initially favor more " legitimate " companies who have participated in the testing process so far .
That 's potentially good news for P2P companies like Pando , who have had a tough time competing with content delivery giants like Akamai Technologies ( AKAM ) and Limelight Networks ( LLNW ) .
P2P 's pitch has long been " we 're cheaper ! " but Akamai , Limelight , and smaller competitors have lowered prices so much in the last few years that big media companies have n't had much reason to look at P2P as an alternative .
Media companies have also been skeptical about P2P because of several shortcomings , such as the need to download a third - party plugin , sketchy DRM and security features , and the lack of proven reliability .
But consumers have recently shown they 're happy to install third - party software when beneficial to them -- millions downloaded Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Silverlight plugin to watch the Olympics online , for example .
And Pando CEO
Robert Levitan says his company has made some much - needed changes , too , like security and reliability improvements , including the ability to connect to Akamai , Limelight , or any CDN to fill in the gaps when a P2P network is n't providing enough bandwidth .
Levitan also says the downturn has gotten media companies to pay more attention to pricing than they did even a few months ago .
He says Pando has recently seen " a huge influx of inquiries , " and that some media companies who did n't care about CDN pricing six months ago now say it 's their " number one issue . "
Disclosure : Our parent company shares investors and office space with Panther Express , a content delivery network .

The biggest story in UK Internet circles the past couple of days has been the censorship of Wikipedia by the UK ’s Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) .
For those of you not entirely sure what it ’s all about – after a tipoff the IWF blacklisted the Wikipedia article ( NSFW ) on the Scorpions ’ 1976 album “ Virgin Killer ” , thanking the IWF for bringing it to his attention ) .
The album in question contains the picture of a naked prepubescent girl ( with a fake lens crack obscuring her genitalia ) , and was not only freely available all over the Internet ( including Amazon ) but has never been classified as child pornography nor has anyone been prosecuted for it .
The IWF ’s blacklist is used by many major ISPs without question , and so they added wikipedia.org to a list of sites routed through their transparent proxy servers , normally use to deal with traffic aimed child pornography sites in Russia and other poorly - regulated areas of the world .
The transparent proxy works in a roundabout way .
With my provider , O2 , rather than blocking off the entire site , it scanned all requests to wikipedia.org ; any that were n’t to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Killer it OK ’ed , but any for the offending page , it would produce a fake 404 message .
This was ridiculously dumb , as it did not block the image directly , but only the container webpage – as the filter was over - precise , in practice the image was still accessible through a variety of other methods , though you had to hack .
Not only was it dumb but also oppressive – by blocking the text and discussion around the image rather than the image itself , they censored all discussion of its legality , the controversy around it or accounts of the band ’s reaction to it and why it was eventually pulled and replaced .
Simply , this is censorship of the most despotically stupid kind .
The transparent proxy also had an unfortunate technical consquence – it limited 95 % of UK access to wikipedia.org to just a few IPs .
With anonymous edits this meant it was impossible to tell who was a vandal and who was not , meaning well - meaning anonymous editors were summarily blocked , and prevented from creating accounts that could allow them to edit via a login .
A terrible impact on the many contributions UK - based contributors make to Wikipedia ( disclosure : I am a Wikipedia administrator , but am a volunteer only and hold no post with the Wikimedia Foundation ) and something that usually affects countries with strict Internet controls such as Singapore or Qatar .
Thankfully , after a considerable backlash , this evening the block was lifted , and from about 1930 this evening I ’ve been able to access the page ( as can much of the UK by now , no doubt ) .
In the meantime , no doubt , thousands of people wondering what the fuss is about have looked at and downloaded the “ Virgin Killer ” artwork , thereby ruining the IWF ’s original intention .
The IWF is a curious beast .
It ’s nominally an independent charity , but in practice acts with the blessing of the Home Office as an unaccountable pseudo - government censor for the Internet , against “ potentially illegal online content ” .
This ranges from child pornography to incitement to racial hatred , though they generally concentrate on the former .
Given its enormous impact , the office is surprisingly tiny .
From The Guardian :
Normally the IWF , which is paid for by the EU and through a levy on the internet industry , works quietly away in its Cambridge offices .
A team of four police - trained “ analysts ” plough through 35,000 URLs sent to them each year that are under suspicion of being obscene .
That works out to an average of 700 per week , or 140 per working day , or 35 per working day per analyst – giving each an average workload for a seven - hour day of 5 URLs per hour .
Typically about one - third of the URLs are deemed illegal .
So that ’s four people ( whose qualifications are not fully disclosed , nor how they were selected ) , are responsible for what 95 % of the UK online population cannot see , after a typical review of just 12 minutes .
Their decisions are implemented through BT ’s Cleanfeed system , used with almost blind obedience by ISPs .
The blacklist cannot be legitimately seen or reviewed by anyone outside of the IWF ( although ironically , Cleanfeed ’s architecture may open a backdoor to the blacklist ) and site administrators are not notified , so unless you find your own site there by accident ( as in the Wikipedia case ) then you ’ll never know .
And the appeals process is conducted via the IWF , without recourse to a independent authority or means of oversight .
The Wikipedia appeal , incidentally , was the first to be brought in the IWF ’s history .
The IWF / Cleanfeed system of judge , jury & executioner is obviously broken , both technologically and socially .
And in an ideal world a system such as the IWF would not exist , but it ’s clear that it ’s either that or full - on government regulation .
Which to be honest , probably would n’t look that different from the current system anyway .
So in the ugly world we live in , how can we make the current sociotechnical system of censorship less broken and as minimal as possible ?
For starters , we have no way of knowing what we see is actually being censored .
The blank “ 404 error page ” for blocked sites breaks HTTP status code conventions – although there is no HTTP code for censorship .
While some sites such as Google will be good enough to mention if their search results have been censored thanks to the IWF or copyright takedowns under the DMCA , in co-operation with the Chilling Effects project ( e.g. ) .
Why was there such reluctance for provision of a notice that says to the effect of “ We have been advised by the IWF that this page contains illegal material and has been blocked . ” ?
Was it because telling people what they ’re reading is subject to censorship would have looked bad ?
Surely however that ’s not as much a PR disaster as this ?
As well as this , Cleanfeed broke Wikipedia by munging IPs and forcing people through a few proxies – not only damaging Wikipedia but any other site that uses source IP checks as part of its efforts to prevent session or identity hijacking .
It also failed to filter alternative URLs , or to combat one of Wikipedia ’s most pervasive legacies – the free licensing which means articles can also be reproduced on mirrors such as wapedia or Answers.com .
In short , it was horribly ineffective while breaking a lot of conventions and testing the goodwill of one of the largest and most open - minded online projects around .
From the more social side , IWF ’s approach is broken as well .
The blacklist is secret – with at least one good reason – it prevents paedophiles from easily finding a whole new list of sites to bookmark .
But this blacklist secrecy lends problems of accountability .
It ’s a tricky problem – I for one see little gain in opening the list to all , but there ’s nothing stopping them publicly releasing one - way hashes of the URLs , say , so researchers and webmasters can check to see if any given site is on it .
The blacklist should definitely be open to an oversight committee , independent of the IWF – specialist police officers , civil servants , lawyers specialising in cases such as this , for their oversight , and these same people should handle appeals to be taken off the list as well , rather than the IWF .
An independent board of technologists meanwhile should be tasked with overseeing implementation , testing its robustness independently , and to make sure that blocking and site redirection are properly dealt with according to established RFCs , and not by fake 404 messages .
As for the people who make the decisions , four people in an office with some police training does n’t sound enough given the impact of the censorship they are inflicting .
A review of how many staff there are and what level of training they get , and whether they need to be supplemented by , say , senior police officers .
A clearer mandate on the material they should be looking for and blocking is required – the “ potentially illegal ” is too fuzzy and the censorship of text surrounding images utterly misguided .
This fuzzy remit should be especially borne in mind given their other work on “ incitement to racial hatred ” , and from January 2009 , what has been termed “ extreme ” pornography .
If the IWF are going to be as clueless about content on Wikipedia then I have no confidence in their ability to deal with these new ( and untested ) laws when they come into place .
Finally a note : the IWF are not evil .
Child pornography is n’t just illegal but morally wrong , and their intentions are noble , even if we know what kind of road those intentions can pave .
Preventing the spread of child pornography online , particularly when the perpetrators and distributors are beyond usual remits , is not an easy nor a thankful task .
But letting them act unilaterally can lead to damaging consequences , as we ’ve just seen .
Good intentions must be backed up with independent cynical controls , or they are no use at all .
Further reading ( updated 10/12 ) : The Open Rights Group has a good post summarising with some questions of their own and there ’s a couple of good posts over at Septicisle – which also points out the IWF is the one that has pushed for the “ Girls Aloud ” case to be prosecuted , the first obscenity case covering fictional text in over two decades , which opens another can of worms .

Tom sez , " An international protest against undue surveillance is being held next month on the 11th of October .
It is 'a broad movement of campaigners and organizations is calling on everybody to join action against excessive surveillance by governments and businesses ' .
We need to get this on the radar for the elections in the USA this year , the EU parliamentary elections next year and many more . "
Surveillance mania is spreading .
Governments and businesses register , monitor and control our behaviour ever more thoroughly .
No matter what we do , who we phone and talk to , where we go , whom we are friends with , what our interests are , which groups we participate in – " big brother " government and " little brothers " in business know it more and more thoroughly .
The resulting lack of privacy and confidentiality is putting at risk the freedom of confession , the freedom of speech as well as the work of doctors , helplines , lawyers and journalists .
The manifold agenda of security sector reform encompasses the convergence of police , intelligence agencies and the military , threatening to melt down the division and balance of powers .
Using methods of mass surveillance , the borderless cooperation of the military , intelligence services and police authorities is leading towards the construction of " Fortresses " in Europe and on other continents , directed against refugees and different - looking people but also affecting , for example , political activists , the poor and under - priviledged , and sports fans .
People who constantly feel watched and under surveillance cannot freely and courageously stand up for their rights and for a just society .
Mass surveillance is thereby threatening the fabric of a democratic and open society .
Mass surveillance is also endangering the work and commitment of civil society organizations .
These hard times mean it's a good time to take a fresh look at so - called virtual assistants .
We 're not talking living , breathing admins who handle administrative chores from afar via the Web and a cell phone .
Rather , the automated systems that combine call routing , personalized messaging , conversational agents and now business telephony to make your work time more about work and less about making your office feel and sound like an actual place of business .
Digital virtual assistants have not been a happy layer of the gadget - o- sphere , particularly for the small enterprise .
Yes , there has been much dabbling with the technology that seeks to soften the line between what is human and what is not in digital communications .
Most major telephony vendors like
Alcatel - Lucent
( ALU )
,
Nortel Networks
( NT )
and
Juniper Networks
( JNPR ) - Get Report
-- and to a certain extent , players like
Nokia
( NOK ) - Get Report
,
Motorola
( MOT )
and even
Cisco
( CSCO ) - Get Report
-- have flooded the market with automated attendants , call - routing software and other riffs on synthetic / human interfaces .
And , yes , some of these products are standard issue for larger enterprises .
But they are brutally expensive .
And the jury is still out as to whether automating the relationship with customers helps or hurts service - oriented small - biz bottom lines .
Enter San Francisco - based Toktumi , ( $ 14.95 per month per line ) the latest entrant in these automated assistant wars .
The company is the brainchild of Peter Sisson , 45 , who founded and later sold a white - label version of Skype to
Microsoft
( MSFT ) - Get Report
. Toktumi recently announced a respectable sales deal with
Dell
( DELL ) - Get Report
and spiffy new features to upgrade a service the company already has with
Staples
( SPLS )
.
I have spent the past few days tinkering with this jazzed - up Toktumi .
And while my final judgment must wait for a full multi- month examination -- there are many , many ways these sorts of tools can frustrate even the most geeked - up small biz -- overall , I found Toktumi to be a reasonably cost effective way to quickly create a phone - based business identity .
What you get
For a single , fixed monthly rate , you get a second phone number that you can route to your existing phones , both personal and business , landline or mobile .
This number becomes the one you give out to your professional contacts .
You then provision the system to make and route your calls , give out targeted messages , take phone mail , manage your contacts and many other features .
And since the system is using your current phone infrastructure , there should be no noticeable degradation in quality .
Not bad .
Toktumi gets lots of credit for easy setup .
Simply log in , choose a city , state or area code , and pick a number .
You then create a numeric access code .
Yup , another number to remember , but what can you do ?
Next , Toktumi makes a call to your cell phone , asks for your confirmation number and then prompts you through about 10 different intro demos , which are of varying usefulness .
All in all , setup is relatively simple .
Allow yourself an hour or two , and bring your new - technology sense of humor .
You should be fine .
Right off , there is a lot to like :
For $ 15 a month , the system essentially renders a perfectly reasonable imitation of a real , live business phone .
It has a centralized call - management system that lets you tie specific voice messages to a given number .
You can monitor calls .
It allows you to create a virtual auto attendant that can route calls to different phone lines .
And assuming you enable the software for your PC , you can make outbound calls from your computer , too .
It 's well done for an entry - level system .
In light , early usage in my testing , Toktumi behaved as advertised .
What you do n't get
Do n't expect complete control over the number you choose , vanity numbers or any sort of coherent set of exchanges for your employees .
In the New York area , for example , 212 numbers were not available .
The company says that as features grow and it gains more clout , its ability to offer these services will improve .
Also , Toktumi will not win an interface design award .
The look and feel is basic .
Also , support was email only , as far I could see .
And the most important limitation : Toktumi is not a phone .
It is a digital service that
runs on
your phone .
So every call changes from the one - step process of picking up the phone and making a call into a multi-step affair of accessing the service and then commencing with your business telephony .
In some configurations , that was as simple as dialing a speed dial , and Toktumi does automatically recognize numbers if you so instruct it .
But in less - optimal calling situations -- say , on foreign landlines or in high - volume environments -- the system 's complexities could easily overwhelm its utility .
Bottom line
For the small - business newbie , or the operation that has light phone usage and wants to save some cash on business extensions , Toktumi is worth considering .
But move slowly .
This is your customer , after all , who is getting handed around by what is in effect a virtual dumb waiter .
But considering that $ 9,000 a year is not that much money for a small - business to spend on phone service , a product that can cut those fees in way more than half is certainly worth considering .

In a talk with Bits about what Xbox " want[s ] to be when we grow up , " Microsoft 's Shane Kim clearly has video on the brain .
With Netflix , he says , they 're " just beginning to scratch the surface . "
Advertisement
As examples , Kim mentions watching pro sports games on the Xbox while chatting with your friends , and reveals that they 're thinking about adding a music service .
( Zune ?
Hopefully not another service . )
Here 's where it gets interesting —
Kim says they 're not planning on a browser or anything that completely busts open the Xbox .
Rather , Kim says " " We are about delivering higher quality experience , not having the most varied experiences . "
Bits ( unfortunately ) paraphrases the next part :
He argued that while there may be hundreds of video sites , most of the activity is concentrating on a handful of sites like Hulu and YouTube .
So his first instinct is cut a handful of deals that integrate the Xbox more deeply into such sites .
Advertisement
Hulu on the Xbox 360 totally would be a " higher quality experience " — one that would blow our mind .
The deal would make sense for both parties too :
It 's no different than the integrated Netflix service on Microsoft 's end , and it would turn the system into the most serious , fantastic video box around ( important , since PS3 has the Blu-ray advantage on the video front ) .
For Hulu , it would be a huge opportunity to blow up their audience and advertising revenue .
Of course , it 's entirely possible , if not probable Kim was just spouting off examples and no Hulu deal is in works .
But , if Microsoft really is looking at every good option , surely they 're looking at Hulu .
They 've already done tons of deals with Hulu parent NBC , and they 've never been afraid to pay up to get what they want .
We know it's what we want , so we hope where 's the smoke , there 's hot , streaming fire .

Yesterday , the Cleveland Indians bolstered their scouting staff by hiring Junie Melendez as an Area Scouting Supervisor .
Melendez will oversee the scouting for a region that includes Ohio , Michigan , Indiana and Kentucky .
Melendez played college baseball at the University of Toledo , but went undrafted and unsigned .
Melendez comes to an already strong scouting staff that many consider to be in the top ten in Major League Baseball .
Due to the fact that the Indians do not have enough money to sign a lot of big name free agents , most of their talent has to be grown from within .
Many of the players on their team now , and most of the team that helped Cleveland to two World Series appearances in the 1990s were originally signed either as long term minor league projects or professional baseball players who had just debuted .
General Manager Mark Shapiro takes the scouting side of his job very seriously and he takes various trips to the minor league clubs in the organization throughout the year so he can see for himself how the talent he signed is developing .
After facing many injuries last season , the Indians hope to be able to overcome those in 2009 to make another run at the division title .
Scouting has always been , and will probably always have to be a staple of the Indians ’ franchise .

This Southtown Star article has a headline , False rape reports outrank other unfounded crimes , which directly and inaccurately conflates unfounded police reports with false police reports , which in this context gets equated to fraudulent police reports .
But according to the FBI , which compiles nationwide crime statistics , forcible rapes have a higher unfounded rate than other crimes .
" Unfounded , " in police speak , means baseless or false , or " no crime was committed , " said Joe Pollini , a retired veteran New York detective who teaches police law at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City .
The FBI reported a 5.4 percent unfounded rate for forcible rapes , compared with a 1.1 percent rate for all crimes in 2006 , the most recent year for which statistics are available .
This statistical difference in cases designated as unfounded is where many people get their alleged proof that there are a higher percentage of false ( fraudulent ) police reports of rape than there for all crimes .
The problem with this alleged proof is that there is no national standard for what causes a report to be classified as unfounded .
I have n't seen any studies done which looks at the number of rape cases where the reports were proven to be false ( fraudulent ) to see what percentage of all the rape reports are proven false ( fraudulent ) reports .
To support incorrect assumptions based on the rate of unfounded rape cases many people refer to official exonerations which misses the point that almost all of those exonerations were related to perpetrator identification not proof that no crime occurred .
The proof that the unfounded statistic cannot be correlated to false ( fraudulent ) reports is actually highlighted in this article after the inference is made that they are correlated .
FBI statistics are all self - reported by local police departments .
There is no uniform code to identify which cases are truly unfounded or baseless and which are merely stuck or inactive , said Joe Kocek , a retired Tinley Park police commander who now teaches sex crime investigations to law enforcement officers . [...]
" Sometimes law enforcement officers may unfound a case because there are no witnesses , they have no evidence , " he said .
Rape victims are n't always physically wounded , their clothing is n't typically shredded or torn and their psychological state of being is n't always hysterical , Kocek said .
Most experience a kind of post - traumatic stress disorder .
" Just because everyone does n't kick or fight with every last drop of their energy does n't mean they were n't coerced , " he said .
" More often than not , there are no signs of violence . "
I will add that the lack of visible injuries does n't mean that rape victims were n't physically forced .
My boyfriend was a foot taller and much bigger than me and he used that size and weight differential as a physical weapon .
This use of the unfounded classification when there is no corroborating evidence means that the increased rate of unfounded rape cases under the current reporting system can be caused in part by the nature of the crime itself .
There is a clear difference between a fraudulent police report and having an investigator mark a genuine report of rape as " unfounded " because the crime seems unprovable .
If genuine rape reports are marked as unfounded at a higher rate than other genuine crime reports that means some investigators likely made an instant decision to unfound the case and did n't even bother to see if there was evidence to support the allegation .
This matches numerous stories I 've heard of rape victims being rebuffed with little more than a helpless shrug or being treated like malicious liars when they attempted to report .
The cases discussed in the article which the police determined through investigation and evidence to be false reports are a serious problem .
But thorough investigations which looks at all the evidence are the best way to deal with this problem .
Making negative assumptions about reports of rape and those who reported rape because of data which has no credible correlation with the rate of fraudulent rape reports is a recipe for injustice even if the crime victim wrongly labeled as a liar is not wrongfully charged with a crime .
Believing a report of rape that turns out to be false is not by itself an injustice , acting unethically or incompetently because of that belief is an injustice .
This is true whether the crime is faked or genuine .
Disbelief during a report of rape radiates itself and communicates that the investigator is untrustworthy .
So the details which could take a report out of the status of unfounded are left unsaid because of the actions of the investigator .
Yet that investigator is likely to assume that the natural reaction to his / her attitude is proof that the disbelief was justified .
Many false confessions are coerced during the investigation of someone 's brutal murder and rape victims can be coerced into recanting genuine rape reports .
Competency and ethics are what are needed not unfounded and inaccurate accusations against those who reported having been raped .
Competent investigators can both believe that a report is valid and look for the relevant evidence which can in reality support or undermine that claim .
Too often the " evidence " which is viewed as undermining a claim is evidence which says nothing about the actual validity of the case and instead fails to match the investigator 's assumptions about genuine rape reports or about genuine rapists .
For an example of fraudulent claims , on last night 's 60 Minutes Katie Couric interviewed a man , Bill Jakob who came to the small town of Gerald , Missouri where the tiny police force was overwhelmed by a huge meth problem and he fraudulently claimed to be a federal agent .
The local police chief checked out Jakob by calling a number Jakob gave him but did n't independently verify Jakob 's story .
In two months , Jakob and Gerald police arrested about 20 people and , more often than not , Jakob says he got them to confess . [...]
" I was very effective , " Jakob says .
" I think part of it was the fact that they were out of their comfort zone .
If you 're used to dealing with a three - man or four - man police department out in the middle of nowhere in Gerald , Missouri , and all of a sudden you find yourself across the desk from a federal officer , that 's intimidating . "
But Jakob was n't a fed , had never been a fed , and was n't even a certified cop . [...]
McCrary now believes Jakob actually made up evidence , like wiretaps and federal informants , something Jakob now denies .
But police say those claims bolstered their case against one suspect : Tyson Williams .
" Threw me down on the ground .
They had their assault rifles , and their pistols to my head .
They told me that if I moved , they 'd blow my brains out .
That they had a lot of evidence against me , " Williams remembers .
Williams was taken to the tiny police station .
With no jail cell , it was soon overrun with suspects , some handcuffed to a bench .
Jakob , who told 60 Minutes he did everything by the book , conducted his interrogations in the mayor 's office .
A local reporter Linda Trest of the Gasconade County Republican did a background check on Jakob and learned that he was a conman .
Not surprisingly , civil suits have been filed by some of those Jakob arrested and coerced into confessing .
Jakob has himself was arrested by the feds and rightfully so .
This is an extreme example , but the ACLU in Texas put out a press release on Oct. 27 which addresses their concerns about false testimony from confidential informants which came about because of drug arrest scandals in several Texas communities .
Yet too often news stories about fraudulent rape reports do n't compare those cases in any meaningful way to other crimes where there are fraudulent cases which falsely incriminates the innocent .
This failure often comes because in drug cases that fraudulent testimony does n't come from an alleged victim .
Like it 's better to be falsely accused of a felony when that false accusation comes from an informant , an undercover officer or someone pretending to be an officer of the law .
I think those falsely accused under those circumstances would disagree .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned Russia ’s foes on Friday against trying to destabilize a country facing broadening economic crisis , Russian news agencies reported .

Putin did not specify who might pose a threat to Russia ’s stability .
But in the past , he has often blamed Western security services of trying to destabilize the country using opposition groups and non-governmental organizations as their instruments .
“ Any attempts to weaken or destabilize Russia , harm the interests of the country will be toughly suppressed , ” they quoted ex-KGB spy Putin as telling an annual meeting of top spies and security officers ahead of their professional holiday .
Putin , who was the Russian president in 2000 - 08 , has contributed greatly to the growth of influence of Russia ’s FSB federal security service , a successor of the Soviet - era KGB .
Many ex-KGB officers became key government and regional officials during his presidency forming his power base , which largely remained intact after Putin handed over powers to his successor Dmitry Medvedev in May .
Critics say that under Putin , security services have become excessively influential and expressed fears Russia could one day become a police state .
Rights campaigners have urged Medvedev to veto a cabinet bill ordering that professional judges rather than juries run trials involving terrorism , civil unrest and several other serious crimes .
They also urged Medvedev to block government attempts to impose high treason charges on people accused of “ harming the constitutional order , ” which critics believe could lead to a political witch - hunt .
Analysts say the role of the security services is likely to grow even further as Russia plunges into an economic crisis marked by rising unemployment and financial woes that threaten the popularity of the government .
Avoiding civil unrest and maintaining political stability is viewed by the government as a top priority .
MEDVEDEV ABSENT
The Day of Security Officers is marked annually on December 20 , a day when in 1917 Bolshevik rulers created the CheKa secret police to suppress their foes .
After a string of transformations , the Cheka became the KGB .
As president , Putin always personally attended the holiday meetings of security officials .
Medvedev , a former corporate lawyer with no security background , stayed away and sent his chief of staff Sergei Naryshkin to deliver his greetings .
Medvedev , who faced the challenge of a brief war with Georgia soon after becoming president which soured Russia ’s ties with the West , said security concerns remained paramount .
“ In the past 20 years the world has changed but has not become a quieter place , ” Naryshkin said , reading out his letter , according to Interfax .
Fragments of a huge meteorite that lit up the skies across Alberta and Saskatchewan last week have been found near the border city of Lloydminster , University of Calgary scientists say .
U of C planetary scientist Dr. Alan Hildebrand and graduate student Ellen Milley announced Friday morning they located several meteorite fragments late Thursday afternoon .
They believe thousands of meteorite bits are strewn over 20 square kilometres near the Battle River .
Friday afternoon , they led a group of reporters to the site — a region called Buzzard Coulee , about 40 kilometres from Lloydminster .
There , close to a frozen pond , numerous small rocks and pebbles could be seen that the scientists said were from the meteorite .
No large chunks were spotted , however .
The fireball that streaked across western Canadian skies on Nov. 20 was witnessed by thousands .
Researchers believe it was a 10 - tonne fragment from an asteroid .
It was also captured on video by a number of people .
Reporters were told those observations , combined with the physical evidence , give scientists a treasure trove of data that could give them a better understanding of the solar system .
I still remember where I was the first time I saw Mike Tyson hit the canvas .
No , not at the hands of Buster Douglas .
I 'm referring to when my friend Mike " Buzz " Bartholomew laid out the seemingly unbeatable animated Mike Tyson of " Punch - Out ! ! " fame .
It was the summer of 1987 , in the basement of my Billings , Mont. , boyhood home .
It felt as though we were witnessing history .
It was a scene played out on Nintendo NES consoles everywhere .
Beating Tyson was a victory so satisfying that two decades later , gamers of the time still talk about taking down the champ .
" It took me two months to figure out Tyson 's knockout punch , but when I did , it was all over , " says Bartholomew , now an IT specialist .
Sure , boxing was a much more mainstream sport 20 years ago , but lots of video games came and went ( " Ring King , " anyone ? ) , so why does Punch - Out !!
live on in our collective pop culture memory ?
It starts with Kid Dynamite himself .
Round 1 : The Ballad of Kid Dynamite and Little Mac
In June 1987 , the boxing world was introduced to Little Mac , a 17 - year - old , 107 - pound pugilist from the mean streets of the Bronx .
Although he looked as clean - cut as Josh Baskin from " Big , " Little Mac was a scrappy young comer learning the ropes under the watchful eye of esteemed trainer Doc Louis .
Iron Mike was no giant , but he towered over a pint - sized Little Mac. Nintendo
And the " star uppercut " was born .
In 1987 , Tyson was at the center of his baddest - man - on - the - planet mayhem .
Dressed in black boots and black trunks , Iron Mike terrified opponents before they even got into the ring .
In March , Tyson won the WBA title in a 12 - round decision over James " Bonecrusher " Smith with an assist from his reputation for brutality .
" I went to Vegas early , and there was a billboard for the fight in which Tyson towered over me even though I'm 5 inches taller than he is I let the hype get into my head a little bit , " Smith said .
" If I jumped on Mike , I would 've knocked him out . "
That August , Tyson became the youngest undisputed heavyweight champion , beating Tony Tucker in a unanimous decision , running his record to 31 - 0 .
Punch - Out !!
was timed perfectly to satisfy both a built - in audience of gamers familiar with the arcade version and awe - struck fight fans the world over .
" We were all poor in Brownsville [ in Brooklyn ] , so not everyone could afford a Nintendo , but if you could , that meant a house full of kids coming over to play Punch - Out ! ! , " said heavyweight Shannon Briggs , who grew up in the same neck of the woods as Tyson .
Round 2 : Body Blows , Bull Rushes , Tornado Punches and the Don Flamenco Dance
The Punch - Out !! series was the brainchild of Nintendo developer Genyo Takeda .
Instead of using the see - through fighters of the arcade version , they decided to make Little Mac , well , little .
It gave players the sense that they were the underdog as each fighter got bigger , stronger , meaner and weirder .
" The holy grail of a video game is easy to play , hard to master , " said Jeremy Pope , whose Cashmere Productions creates games like Ninjatown for Nintendo 's portable system , the DS .
" Punch - Out !!
nailed it by utilizing a set of mechanics that never changed , having a set of characters with cool backstories and making the gameplay challenging .
In grade school , I set up a camcorder and videotaped myself beating Tyson so I could prove it to my buddies . "
Essentially , Little Mac knew how to bob , weave , duck , jab , move left and right , and throw an uppercut .
Anyone could pick up the skills without the 13 - year - old - hopped - up - on - Jolt prowess that would become necessary after the NES died out .
Little Mac was the same guy from Glass Joe to Kid Dynamite , which made it egalitarian .
However , it took a lot of patience , concentration , persistence and fancy opposable - thumb - work to advance through the ranks , so it was elitist .
" Punch - Out !! has that old - school style of game play , which is all about memorizing the patterns and the crazy punches , " said Stephen Totilo , who covers the video game world on MTV's Multiplayer blog .
" I remember being out on the playground comparing notes on how to beat King Hippo . "
( In case you forgot : Drill the big fella in the noggin , then pound away at his ample gut when his drawers fall down . )
The Punch - Out !!
fighters were original in their day , as sports games had never really used narrative techniques to bring the characters to life .
Knowing that Doc Louis was a former 1950s champion espousing nuggets of wisdom like " Dancin ' like a fly , bite like a mosquito " gave the game unique layers , no matter how much he resembled the dad on Family Matters .
Even simple wrinkles such as having Mario referee , or the Louis and Little Mac training montage past the Statue of Liberty , were cool in - the - know touches that livened up to the Punch - Out !!
universe , ensuring the game never got bogged down with static figures in a ring .
Let 's be honest , though , part of the nostalgic appeal of Punch - Out !!
is that it skirts a politically correct line that would be much tougher to cross today .
It 's not the video game equivalent of " Amos ' n ' Andy , " but Little Mac 's pugilist opponents do n't exactly scream " cultural sensitivity , " either .
Round 3 : Tyson Gets Put Away
Mike Tyson's Punch - Out !!
was a huge hit right out of the box , selling 2 million units at $ 39 a pop , but by the end of 1989 , it was already a collector 's item .
Mike Tyson 's world came crashing down at the hands of 42 - 1 underdog Buster Douglas in 1990 .
Reuters / Corbis
Thanks to Tyson 's legal woes and increasingly troublesome behavior , Nintendo did n't renew his contract , allegedly pulling all the remaining games off the shelves .
The company 's timing was , once again , impeccable .
Tyson 's invincibility crashed down on the Tokyo canvas in February 1990 , when a 42 - 1 underdog named Buster Douglas ended Tyson 's unbeaten streak by knocking him out in the 10th round .
Later that year , Nintendo released another Punch - Out !!
game with a champion named " Mr. Dream . "
Although the new champion was just Tyson with Jack Dempsey 's skin color , the game did n't have the same impact .
The NES was n't long for the console world , and , suffice it to say , few modern gamers , especially the so - called " Nintendo Dads , " reminisce about taking down Mr. Dream .
The fast and hard fall of Tyson has given Punch - Out !!
a unique spot in gaming history .
Unlike , say , the Madden franchise , there 's only one version .
And there will be only one .
" A Wii version of Punch - Out !! is going to happen , and I am certain Mike Tyson will play no part in it , " said Kevin Cassidy , the man behind GoNintendo.com .
Cassidy is correct .
Nintendo announced a 2009 Wii version of Punch - Out !! , date to be determined , and Iron Mike is nowhere to be found .
The irony is that the real - life Mike Tyson became a bigger cartoon than the video game version .
It 's sad but true that the animated 1987 Tyson is a lot more fun than the washed - up fighter of today with drug , alcohol and money problems .
Punch - Out !!
captured a moment in time , and if there 's ever a Hall of Fame for sports video games , it 's a first - ballot lock .
" I'm in the new Don King 's " Prizefighter , " and as I was watching my son play , I was thinking about how Tyson 's game was the innovator , " Briggs says .
" Today , we may be ahead in graphics , but the feeling that you got playing Punch - Out !! was totally unreal .
It 's amazing . "
In the video game world , Kid Dynamite will always be the undisputed champion .
" I was 16 and had n't sealed the deal with a woman yet , " Bartholomew says .
" I 'm going to say , up to that point , it was the biggest moment of my life . "
Put him away , Buzz .
Put him away .

The ruling BJP has won in 52 seats and was ahead in 26 .
The BSP has won four seats and was leading in one while independents have bagged 11 and were ahead in four .

I touch wood everytime I say or write that it now looks as nearly certain as it can be that Obama will be the next President of the United States .
But , of course , Obama is correct that all the polling in the world is meaningless if people decide that they can stay home on Election Day because Obama is going to win anyway .
So get out there .
And while you 're at it , make sure you know your rights and be on the look out for vote supression tricks .
The Obama campaign has a new video on the GOP 's voter supression campaign - because the lower the vote the better it is for Republicans .
They thrive in a climate of disenfranchisement .
Despite all their accusations , even the McCain campaign admit they can't make the voter fraud claim stick :
For weeks , Republican leaders have warned that widely reported problems with fake voter registrations could result in a flood of phony votes in pivotal states .
But Ronald Michaelson , a veteran election administrator and member of the McCain - Palin Honest and Open Election Committee , said in an interview that he could not name a single instance in which this had occurred .
“ Do we have a documented instance of voting fraud that resulted from a phony registration form ?
No , I ca n’t cite one , chapter and verse , ” he said .
Which makes their accusations a form of fraud in its own right , does n't it ?
One that 's been falsely used to fuel " Republicans ’ invocation of legal power to scrutinize voters , demands for U.S. Justice Department intervention and court orders , and criminal investigations . "
But make no mistake - if the Republican 's can't steal the election through voter suppression and voting irregularities they 'll use that failure as an excuse to accuse Democrats of stealing it .
The McCain campaign and Republicans have already trotted out dozens of excuses but there 's only one reason McCain will lose - Obama is the better man for the job .

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday night that it had missed repeated opportunities to discover what may be the largest financial fraud in history , a Ponzi scheme whose losses could run as high as $ 50 billion .
The commission said it received credible allegations about the scheme at least nine years ago and will immediately open an internal investigation to examine why it had failed to pursue them aggressively .
The S.E.C. issued the statement hours after Bernard L. Madoff , the 70 - year - old Wall Street executive accused of operating the scheme , discussed the fraud with federal authorities at a meeting in New York on Tuesday , according to people briefed on the meeting .
“ Our initial findings have been deeply troubling , ” Christopher Cox , the S.E.C. chairman , said in his statement .
The commission received “ credible and specific allegations regarding Mr. Madoff ’s financial wrongdoing , ” but did not respond aggressively , he said .
With both Ford and General Motors coming treacherously close to severe cash shortage , Congress will convene next week to consider emergency aid for the troubled sector .
Many economists are against the idea , saying an auto maker bailout would open the door to a taxpayer rescue of virtually any major company with cash problems .
" Where do you stop ? " says Bill Isaac , former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and now managing director at the LECG global consulting firm in Vienna , Va . " Circuit City 's going down .
Do we help them ?
What do you do if Starbucks gets in trouble ?
Do you help them ? "
For Investors :
In recent days the government also has stepped in to to assist credit - card company American Express and ramped up its aid to insurer American International Group .
That has raised the issue of why the government is willing to provide help to Wall Street financial firms but not assembly - line workers in Michigan .
There are , in fact , increasing calls for a second economic stimulus package to help consumers and small businesses as well as more help for distressed homeowners .
" At some point you have to say this does n't make any sense anymore , " Isaac says .
" I do n't know whether we draw that line after General Motors and Ford or before General Motors and Ford .
But at some point we have to draw the line . "
WASHINGTON —
The historic election of 2008 re-confirmed one truism about American democracy : Money wins elections .
From the top of the ticket , where Barack Obama declined public financing for the first time since the system ’s creation and went on to amass a nearly two - to - one monetary advantage over John McCain , to congressional races throughout the nation , the candidate with the most money going into Election Day emerged victorious in nearly every contest .
In 93 percent of House of Representatives races and 94 percent of Senate races that had been decided by mid-day Nov. 5 , the candidate who spent the most money ended up winning , according to a post-election analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
The findings are based on candidates ’ spending through Oct. 15 , as reported to the Federal Election Commission .
Continuing a trend seen election cycle after election cycle , the biggest spender was victorious in 397 of 426 decided House races and 30 of 32 settled Senate races .
On Election Day 2006 , top spenders won 94 percent of House races and 73 percent of Senate races .
In 2004 , 98 percent of House seats went to the biggest spender , as did 88 percent of Senate seats .
“ The 2008 election will go down in U.S. history as an election of firsts , but this was far from the first time that money was overwhelmingly victorious on Election Day , ” Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , said .
“ The best - funded candidates won nine out of 10 contests , and all but a few members of Congress will be returning to Washington . ”
Overall , 95 percent of House incumbents and 93 percent of senators won re-election on Tuesday .
( This includes incumbents who lost their primaries but does not account for several other races featuring incumbents , such as the Minnesota Senate race , where a recount is pending in the contest between incumbent Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken . )
In the prior 10 years and five election cycles , an average of 97 percent of House members and 86 percent of senators won re-election .
Average Pricetag for House Seat Exceeds $ 1 Million
The average cost of winning a House race in 2008 was nearly $ 1.1 million , based on pre-election finance reports , and almost $ 6.5 million for a Senate seat .
Marcia Fudge , a Democrat running in Ohio ’s 11th District to succeed the late Stephanie Tubbs Jones , spent the least to win a House seat–just over $ 46,000 at last report .
For the Senate , Wyoming Republican John Barrasso was the bargain - buyer , spending $ 1.4 million on his re-election .
Funds received and spent in the final days and hours of the 2008 campaign will not be reported to the FEC until Dec. 4 , but as of Oct. 15 , all congressional candidates who ran this cycle had spent almost $ 1.4 billion in the last two years .
The Center has estimated the total cost of the 2008 elections for Congress and the White House at $ 5.3 billion , including candidates , national political parties and outside issue advocacy groups .
That would make ’08 the most expensive U.S. election ever .
“ The politicians who were just elected potentially owe their campaign contributors billions of dollars for helping them win , ” Krumholz said .
“ When policy - making resumes in Washington , citizens , activists and the media should vigilantly ‘ follow the money ’ to ensure that these representatives always remember that voters , not contributors , elected them . ”
The national party committees reported spending more than $ 865 million – $ 440 million by Republicans through Oct. 15 and $ 424 million by Democrats .
Issue advocacy groups–commonly called 527 committees–spent nearly $ 200 million to influence federal elections and issues , with liberal interests accounting for about 60 percent of that .
1 in 4 House Seats Were n’t Competitive
Despite the record expense to elect Congress , a quarter of House races –112 in all –involved a candidate with zero financial opposition , and two senators were similarly unchallenged .
“ The cost of winning a seat in Congress–more than $ 1 million in the House and millions more in the Senate–is prohibitive for most people .
Many politicians get elected and re-elected to Congress simply because no one can afford to take them on , ” Krumholz said .
The most expensive Senate race in the country , as measured by all candidates ’ spending before Election Day , was the Coleman - Franken race in Minnesota , where the candidates alone spent more than $ 35.4 million .
The costliest House race , based on pre-election spending , was California ’s 4th District , where the candidates spent more than $ 10.6 million .
As of mid-day Wednesday , Republican Tom McClintock , the bigger spender in the race to succeed Rep. John Doolittle , had a slight lead over Democrat Charles Brown .
While the overwhelming majority of yesterday ’s races featured incumbents running for re-election , money was also decisive when newcomers squared off .
The top spender in House open - seat contests won 84 percent of the time .
In the Senate , all of the biggest spenders came out on top .
In open races two years ago , top spenders won 94 percent of all House races and half of all Senate races .
Self - Funders Mostly Lose , Again
Following a long tradition , Tuesday ’s elections did not go well for self - financed candidates .
Forty - nine congressional candidates spent more than $ 500,000 of their own money in 2008 .
Only 24 of them even made it to the general election , and just six House candidates and one Senate candidate won , although four House races had not been decided by Wednesday .
The biggest spender of personal funds in this election cycle appears to have been Sandy Treadwell in New York ’s 20th House District , a Republican who invested at least $ 5.9 million of his own money to compete for a job paying $ 169,000 annually .
Treadwell lost to incumbent Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand , who spent more than $ 3.6 million–but only $ 250 of it from her own pocket .

Some resourceful folks at the #android IRC channel and RyeBrye , after realizing that the G1's Synaptic touch screen might be able to handle multiple inputs , say they managed to re-enable some commented - out code in the phone 's touchscreen driver and log some multitouch gestures .
The lack of multitouch in the first Android phone was a minor disappointment , albeit an understandable one — encroaching on Apple 's software patent territory probably was n't on the top of Google 's to - do list .
But this would n't be the first time HTC has released a phone with hidden multitouch , and it is without a doubt the most intriguing .
The revelation that the Diamond has latent multitouch ( not to be confused with the " Covert Multitouch " , a notorious and questionably legal pickup move pioneered by our own Adrian Covert ) on its bezel was more interesting that it was exciting — the likelyhood that anyone would develop an app to utilize it was pretty low .
With Android , we can at least hope that the flourishing dev community and open software will be enough to encourage a simple patch and some app love for this capability .

Global measles deaths drop by 74 %
Eastern Mediterranean region achieves measles goal three years early
4 December 2008 | ATLANTA / GENEVA /NEW
YORK / WASHINGTON –- Measles deaths worldwide fell by 74 % between 2000 and 2007 , from an estimated 750 000 to 197 000 .
In addition , the Eastern Mediterranean region * , which includes countries such as Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia , and Sudan , has cut measles deaths by a remarkable 90 % during the same period .
By reducing measles deaths from 96 000 to 10 000 , the region has achieved the United Nations goal to reduce measles deaths by 90 % by 2010 , three years early .
The progress was announced today by the founding partners of the Measles Initiative : the American Red Cross , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the United Nations Foundation ( UN Foundation ) , UNICEF and WHO .
The data will be published in the 5 December edition of WHO ’s Weekly epidemiological record and CDC ’s Morbidity and mortality weekly report .
" This achievement is a tribute to the hard work and commitment of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region to combat measles " said Dr Margaret Chan , WHO Director - General .
" With only two years until the 2010 target date , I urge all countries affected by measles to intensify their efforts to immunize all children against the disease . "
The significant decline in measles deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean region was the result of intensified vaccination campaigns including several countries with hard - to - reach areas .
In 2007 , more than twice the number of children were immunized in the region through such campaigns as compared to 2006 .
Role of health workers and volunteers
" There are thousands of health workers and volunteers from our Red Cross and Red Crescent family who deserve much of the credit for this success .
They give their time to literally go door - to - door informing , educating and motivating mothers and caregivers about the critical need to vaccinate their children , " said Bonnie McElveen - Hunter , Chairman of the Board of the American Red Cross .
" This mobilization helps us to consistently reach more than 90 % of the vulnerable population and save countless lives . "
The African region was the largest contributor to the global decline in measles deaths , accounting for about 63 % of the reduction in deaths worldwide over the eight - year period .
In 2007 , measles outbreaks occurred in a number of African countries due to gaps in immunization coverage , reinforcing the need to continue immunization support .
" It ’s absolutely wonderful that so many children are off to a healthy start in life thanks to the progress we ’ve made in combating measles through immunization , " said Dr Julie Gerberding , CDC Director .
" Other children ’s lives are still at risk , however , so it ’s time we refocus our attention on sustaining our immunization efforts in countries where rates are low . "
The progress in South - East Asia has been limited — with just a 42 % decline in measles deaths .
This is due to the delayed implementation of large - scale vaccination campaigns in India , which currently accounts for two thirds of global measles deaths .
Political commitment in India is essential if the 2010 global goal is to be achieved .
" The progress that has been made shows what can be achieved through measles vaccination campaigns , but much more needs to be done , " said Ann M. Veneman , Executive Director of UNICEF .
" It is a tragedy that measles still kills more than 500 children a day when there is a safe , effective and inexpensive vaccine to prevent the disease . "
The world 's success in reaching the 2010 measles goal depends on ensuring that all children receive two doses of measles vaccine including one dose by their first birthday , strengthening disease surveillance systems , and providing effective treatment for measles .
" Progress also depends on addressing the considerable funding gap , " said Kathy Calvin , Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for the UN Foundation .
" The shortfall stands at US $ 176 million for 2009 - 2010 , of which US$ 35 million is urgently needed for 2009 .
With continued funding and increasing ownership and commitment of countries , we can sustain our progress and achieve our goal by 2010 .
We ask our supporters to stay with us and strongly encourage new supporters to join us in our effort to save lives . "
The Measles Initiative
The Measles Initiative is a partnership committed to reducing measles deaths globally .
Launched in 2001 , the initiative — led by the American Red Cross , the United Nations Foundation , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , UNICEF and WHO — provides technical and financial support to governments and communities on vaccination campaigns and disease surveillance worldwide .
The initiative has supported the vaccination of 600 million children in more than 60 countries helping reduce measles deaths by 74 % globally and 89 % in Africa ( compared to 2000 ) .
Other key partners in the fight against measles include Becton , Dickinson and Company , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , the Canadian International Development Agency , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , the GAVI Alliance , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , the Izumi Foundation , the Kessler Family Foundation , Merck Co. , the Vodafone Foundation , and countries and governments affected by measles .
* The countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region are : Afghanistan , Bahrain , Djibouti , Egypt , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Iraq , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , Morocco , Oman , Pakistan , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Somalia , the Sudan , the Syrian Arab Republic , Tunisia , the United Arab Emirates and Yemen .

Salt Lake Tribune readers who opened their newspapers today got a message straight from the gay community .
Truth Wins Out , responding to ad that ran Friday in the New York Times headlined , “ No Mob Violence ” that accused the LGBT protesters of attacking religious communities unfairly , ran its own full page ad in the city most closely associated with the Mormon Church .
The ad , titled “ Lies in the Name of the Lord ” , includes defamatory remarks made by Christian leaders James Dobson , Chuck Colson and Rick Cizik .
Most of the remarks are made against Mormons and the ad concludes saying , “ It appears the only thing these men have in common with the Mormon Church is an uncommon zeal for promoting anti-gay legislation . ”

This work was carried out under the auspices of the GeoBasis programme and part of the Zackenberg Ecological Research Operations funded by the Danish Ministry of the Environment and the ISICaB project funded by the Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland ( KVUG ) .
ASIAQ–Greenland Survey provided climate data .
The work was also supported by the Swedish Research Councils VR and FORMAS .

We are grateful for comments on earlier versions of this manuscript from A. Lindroth and B. Christensen .
Author Contributions T.R.C. , M.P.T. , M.M. , C.S. and L.S. designed the field research ; M.M. designed , constructed and set up the automatic measurement system in Zackenberg ; C.S. operated the system and performed manual measurements ; M.M. performed data analysis ; E.D. and S.H. provided atmospheric CH 4 data and designed and ran the atmospheric transport model experiments ; T.R.C. , M.M. , S.H. and E.D. drafted the manuscript .
In today 's fast - paced world of cell phones , Sega Nomads , and turn signals , we do n't have time for anything .
That 's why we have acronyms .
Just try to read until the end of this : International Business Machines Corporation .
Congratulations if you 're still awake – the rest of us non-MENSA types will keep referring to it as IBM .
At Chris N.'s employer , they needed the ability to look up acronyms ' meanings , so one of Chris 's predecessors got cracking on a solution .
Not one to buy into that whole normalization thing , he created a table like the following :
ROWID ABBR_CDE ABBR_TXT 867 IBM INTERNATIONAL
868 IBM BUSINESS 869 IBM MACHINES 870 IBM CORPORATION
But then he came up against a wall .
What about acronyms that can mean several things ?
Take " LA . "
Is it Los Angeles , Louisiana , or Louis Armstrong ?
Not to fear , the addition of an ABBR_IDX column made things all better .
ROWID ABBR_CDE ABBR_TXT ABBR_IDX 1121 LA LOS 1 1122 LA ANGELES 1 1123 LA XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 2 1124 LA LOUISIANA 3
You might be asking yourself " does LA really represent thirty Xs in their system ? "
The answer is short answer is " no ; " the long answer is " no , and I can't believe you counted all of the Xs . "
For whatever reason , that sequence was chosen as a delimiter .
protected final String ACRONYM_PHRASE_DELIMITER
= " XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX " ;
Of course , that 's the only reference to ACRONYM_PHRASE_DELIMITER in the entire codebase .
Instead , the convenience of the following method is used :
private static boolean isNotAllXs ( String s ) { StringBuffer test = new StringBuffer ( s.trim( ) ) ; boolean retVal = false ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < test.length ( ) ; i++ ) { if ( test.charAt( i ) != ' X ' ) { retVal = true ; } } return retVal ; }
Now that the system could handle multiple defnitions per acronym , Chris 's predecessor ( or maybe someone else ) went back through and updated a bunch of the old acronyms .
For instance , " IBM " could now mean :
ROWID ABBR_CDE ABBR_TXT ABBR_IDX 1181 IBM INTERNATIONAL 3 1182 IBM MACHINES 3 1183 IBM BUSINESS 3
Yes , that 's how it was entered .
And here 's another example :
ROWID ABBR_CDE ABBR_TXT ABBR_IDX 7712 WCAB WORK 1 7713 WCAB COMPENSATION 1 7714 WCAB APPEAL 1 7715 WCAB BOARD 1 7716 WCAB XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 2 7717 WCAB WORK 3 7718 WCAB COMPENSATION 3 7719 WCAB APPEALS 3 7720 WCAB BOARD 3 7721 WCAB XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 4 7722 WCAB WORKERS ' 5 7723 WCAB COMPENSATION 5 7724 WCAB APPEAL 5 7725 WCAB BOARD 5 7726 WCAB XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 6 7727 WCAB WORKERS ' 7 7728 WCAB COMPENSATION 7 7729 WCAB APPEALS 7 7730 WCAB BOARD 7 7731 WCAB XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 8 7732 WCAB WORKMEN'S 9 7733 WCAB COMPENSATION 9 7734 WCAB APPEAL 9 7735 WCAB BOARD 9 7736 WCAB XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 10 7737 WCAB WORKMEN'S 11 7738 WCAB COMPENSATION 11 7739 WCAB APPEALS 11 7740 WCAB BOARD 11
Chris wrote a handy data access object that communicates with the table and made a friendly hashmap for people to use . , so things are at least a little better than they used to be ( as this system has been in use for years now ) .
Still , just one acronym comes to mind , but in the spirit of solidarity , here it is in table form :
ROWID ABBR_CDE ABBR_TXT ABBR_IDX 8411 WTF WHAT 1 8412 WTF THE 1 8414 WTF XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

I do n’t think I ’ve ever been more glad to see Monday in my life .
I loved Christmas ’round these parts and had a wonderful time , but there ’s something about the pace of the holidays that makes me want to take a four - month nap when it ’s all over .
And the food — it ’s always so abundant and rich and fattening … and yummy .
And often complicated , as my prime rib from Saturday night can attest .
Note to self : make sure the inner core of your rib loin is completely thawed before you put it in the oven .
Purple beef is not appealing , unless your guests are wolves .
Make stir fry tonight !
It ’s easy , versatile , quick , and has nothing to do with typical holiday fare .
You can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand — that ’s exactly what I did last night — and tweak the flavors to suit your fancy .
I love following Christmas week with Asian food .
Some people go on a cabbage diet ; others do a total body cleanse .
I eat stir fry .
Now ’s the perfect time for me to tell you that I totally botched the “ Cast of Characters ” photo and wo n’t even show it to you because it ’ll just confuse things .
Let ’s just say that when I was assembling the list of ingredients for the photo , my house was not a quiet , calm , peaceful , mellow place .
Not that it ever is .
But here are the ingredients I used :
3 chicken breasts , fat trimmed
1 medium onion
2 cloves fresh garlic
A small chunk of fresh ginger — more if you love ginger , which I do
1 red bell pepper
10 white mushrooms
1 small jar of baby corn
Peanut Oil
Soy Sauce
Sugar
Chicken Broth
Rice Vinegar
Sesame Oil ( optional )
Arrowroot ( see this PW recipe for an explanation of Arrowroot )
Cooked Rice
First , let ’s get some rice going :
Start with 2 cups of long grain rice .
Rinse the rice well under cold water for about a minute , then place into a medium saucepan .
Pour 3 cups cold water over the rice .
Bring to a boil , then reduce the heat to simmer .
Simmer uncovered for 10 to 12 minutes .
Most of the liquid will be absorbed .
Now just turn off the heat , cover the pot , and allow it to stand for at least ten minutes … or until your stir fry is done .
Next chop up an onion into large chunks .
This is not the time to follow my instructions for a fine onion dice !
After that , smash two cloves of garlic and mince it really finely .
I realize my knife looks blue … but it is n’t .
I do not own a blue knife .
What ’s happening is that I ’ve been cooking more after dark , and am not an expert with my flash .
So we might see some blue knives , some purple chicken , and some green red peppers …or worse .
Please bear with me and continue to love me until Daylight Savings Time begins .
Thank you for your cooperation .
This is a recording .
Next , it ’s time to mince some fresh ginger : I ’m in a hurry , so I just slice off the hard skin …
Then I cut the ginger into thin matchsticks , and slice in the other direction to mince it .
I use about three parts ginger to one part garlic , but if you ’re averse to ginger you can cut back the quantity .
Cut up a red bell pepper into large chunks .
Now , slice up the mushrooms into thick slices .
And if you want to be exactly like me , do NOT remember to take a photo while you ’re slicing the mushrooms .
Slice up the baby corn .
I do n’t know who invented baby corn , but I think they should win an award for ingenuity .
Or something .
So now you have your veggies ready to go .
And it ’s important to have EVERYTHING ready to go before you start the stir fry , because things need to move very quickly .
We ’ll cover that more later .
Now , on a separate cutting board and with a separate knife …
Cut the chicken into small chunks .
Now , just drizzle a little soy sauce on the chicken to start things off with a little flavor .
I also add a couple of drizzles of sesame oil , because I love sesame oil .
Give the meat a little toss with your fingers .
And yes , those are my fingers .
Those are not the hooky claws of a demon , despite how they appear .
Rosemary ’s Baby , anyone ?
Next , we need to prepare two little concoctions :
Add 1/2 cup of soy sauce to a small dish .
Stir in 3 tablespoons ( yes , 3 tablespoons ) sugar to the soy sauce and stir together .
It ’ll seem a little syrupy .
But syrupy is good .
In one little dish , combine 1/ 4 cup chicken broth with 2 rounded teaspoons arrowroot .
Stir it together .
This will act as a thickener at the end , and will give the stir fry a nice consistency .
** Also have an additional 1/ 4 cup chicken broth ready to go .
You ’ll be glad you had all of this at the ready .
Now , we ’re ready to stir fry !
But first , let me explain a few things to you .
** The key to stir frying is to begin with an incredibly hot skillet or wok , which means you ’ll either need to open windows or have a good ventilation on your stove .
** Stir fry needs to happen really quickly with a very hot pan , which will result in the meat and vegetables having a nice sear / color / flavor to them .
** The vegetables should be cooked but not soggy — you want them all to be somewhat firm and “ fresh ” .
** Cook vegetables in order of how much time they need to cook — add the harder / thicker veggies first , working your way down to the more flimsy ones .
** Have your plates and utensils ready to go so you can serve it up immediately .
** My name is Herman .
Heat your skillet or wok over high heat .
When it ’s hot , drizzle in some peanut oil .
Peanut oil has a high smoking point , which makes it perfect for stir fry .
Swirl the oil around in the pan , then add the chicken in a single layer .
Wait several seconds before you stir it around so it ’ll get nice and seared .
Now stir it around a bit .
You can see how hot the pan is , because there are already brown spots on the bottom .
That ’s a very good thing .
The meat should cook within two to three minutes .
When it ’s cooked , remove it to a separate bowl and set aside .
Keep the pan over high heat and drizzle in a little more peanut oil .
Begin by throwing in the onions .
Do n’t be afraid of the junk in the bottom of the pan .
Stir the onions around for approximately a minute .
They ’ll get brown in no time flat .
Throw in the red peppers and stir them around for about thirty seconds , then throw in the garlic and ginger .
Are you starting to get the idea that there ’s really no method to this madness ?
I just throw .
And hope it turns out okay .
The mushrooms go next , and yes …the bottom of my pan is a mess .
This would n’t happen if I had a wok , but I just ca n’t be bothered with buying any more kitchen equipment .
Plus , I like the brown stuff .
Next comes the baby corn , which requires basically no cooking .
Now , with the heat still on high , pour in 1/4 cup chicken broth .
Next , pour in the soy sauce / sugar mixture …
And just for kicks , pour in about a teaspoon rice vinegar .
And one last drizzle of sesame oil .
Now add in the chicken …
… And give it a good stir .
Finally , dump in the chicken broth / arrowroot mixture …
As you stir , the arrowroot will almost instantly thicken the stir fry and give it a lovely gloss .
Finally , at the VERY end — literally seconds before serving — throw in some fresh cilantro .
You do n’t want to do this early because the cilantro will wilt very quickly .
To serve , heap up some cooked rice — which should be just perfect by now — in a bowl .
Spoon a nice helping of stir fry over the top , making sure to get some yummy juice on the rice .
Top it all off with some more cilantro .
** If you hate cilantro , you can use fresh basil .
And serve it with chopsticks , unless you have four children , which makes it impossible to keep chopsticks in the house .
In that case , a fork works well .
And one more thing :
Have a fabulous Monday After Christmas !
Love ,

A Haskell monad for infinite search in finite time
Martin Escardo
, ,
I show how monads in Haskell can be used to structure infinite search algorithms , and indeed get them for free .
This is a follow - up to my blog post Seemingly impossible functional programs .
In the two papers Infinite sets that admit fast exhaustive search ( LICS07 ) and Exhaustible sets in higher - type computation ( LMCS08 ) , I discussed what kinds of infinite sets admit exhaustive search in finite time , and how to systematically build such sets .
Here I build them using monads , which makes the algorithms more transparent ( and economic ) .
An abstract data type for searchable sets
I want to define a Haskell type constructor S such that , for any type a , the elements of type S a are the searchable subsets of a .
Thus , S is like the powerset constructor in set theory , except that not all subsets are allowed here .
Like the powerset construction , S will be a monad .
Before implementing S concretely , I list the operations I would like to be able to perform with searchable sets :
search :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Maybe a image :: ( a -> b ) -> S a ->
S b singleton :: a ->
S a union :: S a -> S a ->
S a bigUnion :: S( S a ) ->
S a
I adopt the notational convention , borrowed from the list data type , that if x is used to denote an element of type a then the plural xs is used to denote a searchable set of elements of a .
So , notationally speaking , if x :: a then xs :: S a .
Given a set xs :: S a and a predicate p :: a ->
Bool , we require that the expression search xs p either produces Just an example of some x :: a in the set xs :: S a with p x = True , if such an element exists , or else Nothing .
For a function f :: a -> b and a set xs :: S a , the expression image f xs denotes the f - image of the set xs in the sense of set theory , that is , the set ys :: S b such that y $ \in$ ys iff f( x ) =y for some x $ \in $ xs .
The other operations construct singletons , binary unions , and unions of sets of sets , also in the usual sense of set theory .
The monad
It is defined from the abstract data type as
instance Monad S where return = singleton xs >>= f = bigUnion ( image f xs )
Notice that xs :: S a and f :: a ->
S b , and hence image f xs :: S S b .
Consequences of having a monad
Finite products of searchable sets are searchable :
times :: S a -> S b -> S( a , b ) xs `times` ys = do x <- xs y <- ys return ( x , y )
That is , the elements of the set xs `times` ys are the pairs ( x , y ) with x $ \in $ xs and y $ \in$ ys .
This turns out to be the same algorithm given in the above two papers , although the definition given there looks very different as it does n’t use monads .
Using lazy lists , the binary product can be iterated to finite and infinite products as follows :
product :: [ S a ] -> S[ a ] product [ ] = return [ ] product ( xs:yss ) = do x <- xs ys <- product yss return ( x:ys )
Notice that
xs :: S a is a set , x :: a is an element of xs , yss :: [ S a ] is a list of sets , product yss :: S[a ] is a set of lists , ys :: [ a ] is a list .
Again , this turns out to be the same infinite product algorithm given in the above papers , more precisely the one given in [ LICS07 ] , page 9 , or [ LMCS08 ] , Section 8.1 .
I am working on a paper addressed to the Haskell and functional programming communities that will spell out this and other claims and details .
Haskell ’s sequence
However , there is no need to define product , because it is already defined in the Haskell ’98 Standard Prelude under the name sequence ( using foldr and the monad operations rather than recursion and do - notation , but this makes no difference ) , and moreover for any monad , not just S .
Example
The Cantor space of infinite sequences of binary digits , discussed in the previous blog post , can be constructed as follows :
bit :: S
Int bit = singleton 0 `union` singleton 1 cantor :: S [ Int ] cantor = sequence ( repeat bit )
This amounts to
cantor = bit $ \times $ bit $ \times $ bit $ \times \dots $
Quantifiers
Notice that we can existentially and universally quantify over searchable sets in an algorithmic fashion , even when they are infinite , as is the case for the Cantor space :
forsome , forevery :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Bool forsome xs p = case search xs p of Nothing -> False Just _ ->
True forevery xs p = not ( forsome xs ( \x -> not ( p x ) )
Here forsome xs and forevery xs quantify over the set xs :
forsome xs p =
True iff p x =
True for some x $ \in $ xs , forevery xs p =
True iff p x =
True for every x $ \in $ xs .
( The function forsome is in fact a monad morphism from S into the continuation monad . )
Contrived examples that nevertheless make a point
Consider the program
f :: Int ->
Int -> Int ->
Int f n2 n1 n0 = 4 * n2 + 2 * n1 + n0 p :: Int ->
Bool p k = forevery cantor ( \xs -> forsome cantor ( \ys -> f ( xs !! 10 ) ( xs !! 100 ) ( xs !! 1000 ) == k - f ( ys !! 2000 ) ( ys !! 200 ) ( ys !! 20 ) ) )
Then the expressions p 6 , p 7 and p 8 evaluate to False , True and False respectively , together in a fraction of a second using the Glasgow Haskell Interpreter ghci , using our implementation of the abstract data type S given below .
As another example , consider
q = forevery cantor ( \us -> forsome cantor ( \vs -> forevery cantor ( \xs -> forsome cantor ( \ys -> us !!
333 + xs !!
17000 == vs !!
3000 * ys !! 1000 ) ) ) )
Then q evaluates to True in less than a second .
These examples are certainly contrived , but they do illustrate that something non-trivial is going on from an algorithmic point of view , as the quantification algorithms have no access to the source code of the predicates they apply to .
I ’ll discuss more meaningful examples another time .
( I can use the quantifiers to find bugs in programs for exact real number computation using infinite lazy lists of digits .
An application by Alex Simpson to integration was mentioned in the previous post . )
Representation of searchable sets
How should we represent infinite searchable sets to get an implementation of our abstract data type ?
Obstacles
An infinite searchable set can be uncountable , like the Cantor space , and hence we cannot implement it using a lazy list of its elements .
Moreover , this would n’t help regarding exhaustive search in finite time .
It can be argued that the computable elements of the Cantor space form a countable set .
However , they are not computably countable ( or r.e. ) , with the very same proof given by Cantor in the non-computable case , by diagonalization .
( Exercise : write a Haskell program that given any infinite lazy list of elements of the Cantor space , produces an element that is not in the list .
This amounts to an implementation of Cantor ’s proof of the non-denumerability of the Cantor space . )
Almost a solution
The crucial operation we can perform with a searchable set is to search it .
Hence it is natural to represent a searchable set by a search function .
The following is what this line of reasoning tempted me to do at the beginning of this work :
newtype S a = S {search :: ( a -> Bool ) ->
Maybe a}
or , equivalently ,
newtype S a = S ( ( a -> Bool ) -> Maybe a ) search :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Maybe a search ( S searcher ) = searcher
This has the advantage that it accounts for the empty set .
However , this breaks the theorem that countable products of searchable sets are searchable , precisely because the empty set is present .
In fact , if one of the factors is empty , then the product is empty .
But an empty set may be present arbitrarily far away in the lazy list of sets , and the search algorithm can only output the first element of the lazy list when it knows that the product is non-empty .
Hence it can never output it , because it can never determine non-emptiness of the product .
In practice , we get an infinite loop when we run the product algorithm sequence if we work with the above implementation of S .
However , with the exception of countable products , everything we do here works with the above implementation .
But infinite products is what is needed to get infinite searchable sets .
The solution
Hence we do as we did in the above two papers instead :
newtype S a = S {find :: ( a -> Bool ) -> a}
or , equivalently ,
newtype S a = S ( ( a -> Bool ) -> a ) find :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) -> a find ( S finder ) = finder
This forces the sets to be non-empty , but has a defect : it also forces the find operator to tell lies when there is no correct element it can choose .
We impose a requirement to overcome this : although lies are allowed , one always must have that find xs p chooses an element in the set xs , and if there is an element x $ \in $ xs with p( x ) =True , then the answer must be honest .
Given this requirement , we can easily check whether find is lying , and this is what I do in the implementation of search :
search :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Maybe a search xs p = let x = find xs p in if p x then Just x else Nothing
With this representation of searchable sets , we have a shortcut for the implementation of the existential quantifier
forsome :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Bool forsome xs p = p( find xs p )
Also notice that the above implementation of search is equivalent to
search xs p = if forsome xs p then Just ( find xs p ) else Nothing
Implementation of the abstract data type
Given the above representation of searchable sets , we have already implemented the first of the operations that define our abstract data type :
search :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Maybe a image :: ( a -> b ) -> S a ->
S b singleton :: a ->
S a union :: S a -> S a ->
S a bigUnion :: S( S a ) ->
S a
The others can be implemented as follows :
image :: ( a -> b ) -> S a ->
S b image f xs = S ( \q -> f( find xs ( \x -> q( f x ) ) ) )
That is , given a predicate q :: b ->
Bool , to find y $ \in$ f( xs ) such that q(y ) holds , first find x $ \in $ xs such that q(f x ) holds , and then apply f to this x .
singleton :: a ->
S a singleton x = S ( \p -> x )
Given the requirement of the previous section , we can only answer x , and this is what we do .
To implement binary unions , I first implement doubletons , and then reduce to arbitrary unions :
doubleton :: a -> a ->
S a doubleton x y = S ( \p -> if p x then x else y ) union :: S a -> S a ->
S a xs `union` ys = bigUnion ( doubleton xs ys )
Arbitrary unions are a bit trickier :
bigUnion :: S( S a ) ->
S a bigUnion xss = S ( \p -> find ( find xss ( \xs -> forsome xs p ) ) p )
By definition of union , as in set theory , x $ \in \bigcup $ xss $ \iff \exists $ xs $ \in $ xss such that x $ \in $ xs .
What our definition says is that , in order to find x $ \in \bigcup $ xss such that p(x ) holds , we first find xs $ \in $ xss such that p(x ) holds for some x $ \in $ xs , and then find a specific x $ \in $ xs such that p( x ) holds .
That ’s it , we are done
It remains to make a few remarks .
After them you ’ll find the complete Haskell program , which is embarrassingly short in comparison with the size of this post .
Algorithms for free
There is a Haskell program called Djinn that , given a Haskell type , automatically gives you a recursion - free Haskell program of that type , provided there is some , and lets you know if there is n’t any .
All the programs discussed here are correctly guessed by Djinn , just from knowledge of their types , except the binary and infinite product algorithms .
For the binary product , Djinn gives four guesses .
Only two of them are product algorithms , and one of them is equivalent to the one we have defined ( the other is the symmetric version ) .
The infinite product is hopeless , because it crucially relies on recursion .
But singleton , image and big union are correctly guessed , with a unique guess each .
Moreover , Djinn can directly guess the monad structure , in the sense of Haskell , without the detour via singleton , image and big union , which amount to the definition of monad in the sense of category theory .
Thus , all we have to do in principle is to define the type constructor S of the monad : once we have done that , Djinn can tell us what the monad operations are , and the Haskell prelude gives us the infinite product algorithm sequence .
But this is not what happened historically .
And of course , once we do have the product algorithm , we have to show that it does accomplish what we claim .
The proof is tricky , and is developed in the above two papers , where the first gives a sketch and the second gives complete details .
The monad laws
The monad laws are rather laborious to prove .
Hence I wrote a Haskell program that wrote the proof for me , as follows .
The laws are a set of equations .
To prove each one , I calculate the normal form of each side of the equation , and check that they are the same except perhaps for the name of the bound variables .
The output of the Haskell program is five pages of chains of equations that one can routinely check if one wants to .
Presumably I could have done this using a proof assistant , but I found it quicker to write a proof generator for this specific theorem than to familiarize myself with proof assistants ( shame on me ) .
There are two interesting aspects of the monad S that become apparent when we develop this proof : ( 1 ) Not all elements of S a are search functions , but nevertheless the monad laws hold even when the “ junk ” elements of S a are taken into account .
( 2 ) The type of booleans in the definition of S can be replaced by any type whatsoever and the monad laws still hold .
This second point brings me to my final comment .
Bar recursion
Before I made the connection with monads earlier this year , Paulo Oliva discovered that the product algorithm given in [ LICS07 ] is a manifestation of bar recursion , provided we replace the booleans by the integers .
See his papers at his web page to get an idea of what bar recursion is and what its applications are .
Now , putting this together with the above findings , it follows that the Haskell prelude function sequence turns out to be a form of bar recursion ( technically known as modified bar recursion ) .
Paulo and I have been working together trying to clarify all these connections from a theoretical point of view , and we are writing a paper with these and other findings , this time addressed to the theoretical computer science and logic communities .
The complete program
I summarize and rearrange the code discussed above , without the contrived examples :
newtype S a = S {find :: ( a -> Bool ) -> a} search :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Maybe a search xs p = let x = find xs p in if p x then Just x else Nothing forsome , forevery :: S a -> ( a -> Bool ) ->
Bool forsome xs p = p( find xs p ) forevery xs p = not ( forsome xs ( \x -> not ( p x ) ) ) singleton :: a ->
S a singleton x = S ( \p -> x ) doubleton :: a -> a ->
S a doubleton x y = S ( \p -> if p x then x else y ) image :: ( a -> b ) -> S a ->
S b image f xs = S ( \q -> f( find xs ( \x -> q( f x ) ) ) ) bigUnion :: S( S a ) ->
S a bigUnion xss = S ( \p -> find ( find xss ( \xs -> forsome xs p ) ) p ) union :: S a -> S a ->
S a xs `union` ys = bigUnion ( doubleton xs ys ) instance Monad S where return = singleton xs >>= f = bigUnion ( image f xs ) times :: S a -> S b -> S( a , b ) xs `times` ys = do x <- xs y <- ys return ( x , y ) bit :: S
Int bit = doubleton 0 1 cantor :: S [ Int ] cantor = sequence ( repeat bit )
The making of this work
Here is how I came up with the idea of using monads for this purpose .
It emerged from the above two papers , and from the ealier Barbados notes , that searchable sets are compact in the sense of topology .
And I was familiar , from denotational semantics , domain theory and topology , with a number of monads of compact sets , notably the Smyth powerdomain monad and the Vietoris hyperspace modad .
So although this took some time to mature and be realized , it was inevitable .
The Rawnsley family spent their most recent summer holiday travelling in the United States .
It was terrifically good value , which is one of the reasons August already seems like such a very long time ago .
Those were the happy days , the pre-crash days when a pound bought two dollars .
One of the highlights was the trip we took along the Blue Ridge Parkway , a fabulous road through the stunning scenery of the Appalachian mountains .
Plunging ravines , glorious meadows , breathtaking mountaintops and wonderful waterfalls are all to be enjoyed .
Running for 469 miles from Rockfish Gap in Virginia to Cherokee in North Carolina , it is the sort of drive about which songs are written .
Work on the scenic highway began in 1935 as part of the public works programme of Franklin D Roosevelt 's New Deal .
It did what it was designed to do , which was to generate jobs and draw visitors to one of the regions of the United States most devastated by the Great Depression .
Here 's the double beauty of it .
This was a project to alleviate the economic distress of its own time which also bequeathed an achievement of enduring value to future generations .
Some 20 million people visit the national park every year .
The Blue Ridge Parkway is testimony to how crises can be turned into legacies by leaders with the requisite willpower , ingenuity and intelligence .
As the D - word again stalks the world , the current crisis will separate Prime Ministers and Presidents into two kinds of leaders .
The unlucky countries will be those led by politicians who think only of how they might scrabble through the next six months .
The lucky ones will be those with leaders who turn the emergency of the moment into an opportunity to equip their countries for the future .
When Gordon Brown and his fellow EU leaders met on Friday , they tried to make their agreement to a stimulus plan sound a lot bolder and more decisive than it really is .
They wrote a cheque for € 200 bn but left it unsigned .
It is entirely up to individual states whether they actually fund the plan .
That is a bit deflating of the Prime Minister 's boast that the world is following his example .
In a Freudian moment at the dispatch box last week , he even claimed to have saved the planet .
Yet GB is not the role model for Barack Obama .
The next American President prefers the example of FDR .
The President - elect has just committed himself to a vast programme of public works as the centrepiece of his response to America 's economic anguish .
By contrast , Gordon Brown 's answer to the recession has been focused on trying to prop up banks and prod consumers to keep shopping .
The risk of that approach was highlighted by the German Finance Minister , Peer Steinbrück , with his undiplomatic scorn that ' crass Keynesianism ' may not do much to alleviate the recession but is guaranteed to leave Britain saddled with a national debt that ' will take a whole generation to pay off ' .
His words have been gleefully seized on by David Cameron and George Osborne .
Yet Herr Steinbrück 's intervention also drew attention to their own failings .
The most brutally succinct criticism of Mr Brown 's approach to the crisis has come not from the leaders of Britain 's Conservatives , but from a German social democrat .
He is wrong to suggest that nothing can be done to stimulate distressed economies .
He 's right when he points to the potential perils of throwing huge sums at consumers and failing companies with little guarantee that maxing out the nation 's credit card will work .
The more I think about it , the more sure I become that there have to be smarter ways of using billions of pounds than encouraging people to go shopping for more foreign imports .
If the government is going to spend like there is no tomorrow , better to use the money building things that might be useful when tomorrow comes .
Better to invest in Britain .
That way , when we do eventually emerge the other side of recession , we will be in a fitter place to exploit a resumption of growth .
The case is even more compelling because this is a country crying out for serious investment to improve its creaking infrastructure .
There are plenty of needs to be met .
Let me suggest three projects that would provide much better value for money than squittering away any more billions on electronic toys from the Far East .
The first and most screamingly obvious candidate for investment is Britain 's outdated railways .
We are now in that dreadful season when a centimetre of snow is capable of paralysing our antediluvian rail network .
It is as bewildering as it is shocking that our railways are so bad .
Britain invented the train .
We live in a compact , temperate and relatively flat country with no mountain ranges like the Alps or the Rockies to negotiate .
Nature gifted us geography ideally suited for a fast , efficient and green rail network .
We blew it .
When one of his cabinet urged Tony Blair to take railways more seriously , the then Prime Minister fatalistically responded : ' There 's no point .
There 's nothing that can be done . '
That attitude , shared by British politicians of every stripe for many decades , has left us with the most embarrassing railways in western Europe .
France , Germany , Spain and Italy all have high - speed rail networks .
The only high - speed link in Britain are the tracks that take you out of the country and through the Chunnel .
We belatedly invested in that only because the French shamed us into it .
The government is humming and hawing about whether to commit to building a high - speed rail link connecting Heathrow , London , Birmingham , Manchester and Glasgow .
If it makes the decision in the way that has been historically typical of British governments , it will spend half as much money as is required to do the job properly and it will take twice as long as it should .
For around the same sum that the Treasury is throwing at consumers to spend on plasma screens made in China , Britain can have a high - speed rail link connecting its industrial spine .
For more immediate results , and for a pretty modest net cost , work could be begun quite quickly on the modernisation of the inter -city network .
Smelly and expensive diesel trains still ply the Midland mainline and the Great Western mainline .
For a fraction of the money which has been spent on a VAT cut of uncertain effect , those lines could be electrified .
A programme to modernise the railways will generate work for key industries such as construction , steel and engineering .
It is a big job creator .
It will have an excellent multiplier effect feeding the stimulus through to other industries .
It will help move Britain away from its addiction to the car .
It will lift the long - term growth potential of the economy .
It is a no -brainer .
Modernising our antiquated railways is a catch - up project to haul Britain 's transport system into the early 21st century .
We will also need get - ahead projects which will equip the country for the rest of the century .
My next candidate for investment is the creation of a national fibre optic network capable of connecting everyone to super - fast broadband .
More and more economic , social and political activity is happening on the internet , but the digital plumbing is struggling to cope with the volumes of data .
If you want to download a film , for most people that means leaving the computer running all night .
This is because nearly all households and many businesses are still connected to the net by old - fashioned copper wiring .
There 's a big , essential and urgent job of work to do replacing the outdated wiring with fibre optics .
This is another project which is too large for the private sector to take on by itself , especially during a recession .
A fibre optic network would allow every firm and household to enjoy and exploit the potential of the broadband speeds currently available only in swanky offices .
This is the sort of project that intelligent government would invest in .
My third candidate is green energy .
We know this recession will end one day .
The oil price is not going to be low for ever .
To prepare for the day when it soars again , to make good on commitments to reduce carbon emissions and to be free of dependency on the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia , we have to get much more ambitious about renewable energy .
For a blowy country surrounded by sea , Britain has been pathetic at harnessing the energy of wind and wave .
One pressing need is to start laying power lines which will allow the energy from wind and wave turbines in the North Sea to be plugged into the national grid .
That will cost a fraction of the billions which have been committed to the feckless banks .
Ministers should commit to that essential investment for a greener energy future .
A modernised rail system , a national fibre optic network and a renewable energy grid : all have the triple merit of generating business in Britain , creating jobs in Britain and enhancing Britain 's competitiveness .
They are not make - work schemes of the sort that can give infrastructure projects a bad name when money is spent building bridges to nowhere .
All these projects meet a national need and will leave a profitable legacy .
Our politicians need to be thinking not just about how to get through the next six months , but how to make Britain fit for the world after the slump .
If we are going to spend billions , better they are spent leaving future generations with a legacy which amounts to more than just a mountain of debt .
Cleverly done , big can be beautiful .
If you remain to be convinced , let me recommend a drive down the Blue Ridge Parkway .
Browser maker Opera has published the early results of an ongoing study that aims to provide insight into the structure of Internet content .
To conduct this research project , Opera created the Metadata Analysis and Mining Application ( MAMA ) , a tool that crawls the web and indexes the markup and scripting data from approximately 3.5 million pages .
Statistical analysis of the data collected by MAMA has provided Opera 's engineers with a unique understanding of emerging trends in web development and the way that standards - based web technologies are used on the Internet .
Opera plans to take the project to the next level by building a search engine on top of the indexed data so that web designers , browser implementers , and standards experts can easily obtain information about real - world usage of web technologies .
The preliminary data published today by Opera provides some intriguing statistics about the use of specific HTML elements .
Among the pages analyzed by MAMA , the most popular HTML tags were HEAD , TITLE , HTML , BODY , A , META , IMG , AND TABLE .
The list of least popular tags includes VAR , DEL , AND BDO .
Opera also studied the prevalence of rich web content technologies and scripting mechanisms that are typically associated with Ajax .
The study found that Adobe Flash is used on roughly 35 percent of all web sites .
Flash is most popular in China , where it was found on 67 percent of the web sites analyzed by MAMA , and it was least popular in Denmark , where it is used on 25 percent of web sites .
The XMLHttpRequest scripting mechanism , one of the cornerstones of Ajax , is used on roughly 3.2 percent of the indexed web sites .
It is most popular in Norway , where it was found on 10 percent of pages .
The study found that cascading stylesheets ( CSS ) are very widely used , and appear inline or referenced on 80 percent of the sites indexed by MAMA .
The most popular CSS properties relate to color and fonts .
JavaScript is also extremely common and is found on 75 percent of indexed web sites .
Standards compliant ?
Opera also ran the pages indexed by MAMA through the W3 C 's validation tools to see how many conform with standards .
The results show that only 4.13 percent are valid .
A more startling conclusion that Opera derived from its MAMA data is that only 50 percent of sites that display a badge touting validation are actually valid .
This could indicate that many sites which are initially designed with valid HTML later cease to be valid as changes are made and new content is added .
Opera analyzed page meta tags to see if there were any correlations between editing tools and validation rates .
Surprisingly , Apple 's iWeb delivered the highest volume of valid pages — the study shows that 81 percent of pages created with iWeb were valid .
By comparison , only 3.4 percent of pages created with Adobe Dreamweaver were valid .
The initial results of Opera 's study are fascinating , but its true value has n't yet been fully unlocked .
Opera 's efforts to build a search engine on top of MAMA will open the door for some really exciting analysis and will enable third parties to use and repurpose the data for their own studies and projects .
" The Web is fragmented , complex and always evolving .
MAMA 's vast database provides us with detailed information about how Web technologies are used , " said Opera vice president of quality assurance , Snorre M. Grimsby , in a statement .
" This is key in our efforts to test and ensure high - quality compatibility , stability , and performance of our products , and we want to share it with our peers , so they can benefit from it , too . "
Indeed , this project is a laudable gift to the web development community and web standards bodies .
Its usefulness will continue to grow as Opera extends its scope and adds more functionality to accommodate broader research .

The public has been failed by the media that government raids against farmers are not being covered and especially that the connection between the vested corporate interests in eliminating these farmers is not looked into .
Independent farmers who refuse to use corporations as middlemen are the only ones being attacked .
The article below was published first in Counterpunch in April of 2008 .
It was reporting on the second raid against a Pennsylvania dairy farmer .
Since then , the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has raided this same man for a third time .
The second two raids have been led by a man who previously worked for Hersheys and Dean Foods , giant corporations with a vested interest in dairy farmers receiving little for their milk and in stopping the growing public move to NON - corporate , local , independent , straight to consumer sale of milk .
And what was the dairy farmer selling ?
Unprocessed , plain milk , which the USDA is working state to state to make illegal , using " food safety ' as the argument and treating real milk as though it were a major threat to US public health .
Yet the reality is that raw milk greatly supports local farming and sustainable agriculture and is produced in ways consistent with reducing global warming and its growing popularity stems from people learning that it is especially healthy .
It contains real vitamin D which is critical to health
click here
but which the industry removes and substitutes with a synthetic that does n't work .

Raw milk is also rich in bacteria that Yale University has shown to be protective against type 1 diabetes .
click here
These bacteria are absent in corporate milk because they are killed through pasteurization .
( In certain cases some bacteria are retained or extracted and then sold separately as a " special " aid to digestion under the corporately invented name " L - casei immunitas . " )

HARARE , Dec 6 ( Reuters ) - Zimbabwe ’s central bank sacked executives at four banks accused of illegal foreign currency trading , state media reported on Saturday , as international criticism of President Robert Mugabe ’s government increased .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown added his voice to condemnation of Mugabe , saying the world should tell the 84 - year - old ruler “ enough is enough ” .
He urged coordinated international action to help Zimbabwe overcome food shortages and a cholera epidemic .
The southern African nation , isolated by Western countries under Mugabe ’s authoritarian rule , is on the verge of collapse .
Food stocks are running out , official inflation is at 231 million percent and a cholera outbreak has killed 575 people and sickened almost 13,000 .
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has been unable to print money fast enough to keep up with soaring prices , which double every 24 hours , and has tried to stamp out a thriving black market for U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies .
This week it dismissed the chief executives and senior managers at four banks , state media reported , saying they diverted large sums of Zimbabwean dollars to the black market before the notes were introduced .
“ This is criminal because the money was not yet legal tender when it was released , ” central bank Governor Gideon Gono was quoted as saying in the Herald newspaper , adding the executives faced prosecution .
Refering to past media reports that suggested the central bank itself had in the past purchased foreign currency from the black market , Gono said : “ We are sick and tired of being labelled crooks . ”
CLASHES
Zimbabweans have grown increasingly angry over the government ’s failure to tackle the crisis .
Many are forced to line up outside banks for hours to try to get scarce banknotes , often coming away with barely enough to buy a loaf of bread .
Tensions flared in the capital Harare last week when mobs and police clashed with groups of unarmed soldiers who had seized cash from foreign currency traders and shops .
Trade union activists also took to the streets to protest against the crisis .
The central bank said it would soon introduce a Z$ 200 million note ( worth $ 20 on the black market ) after launching Z$ 10 million , Z$ 50 million and Z$ 100 million notes on Thursday .
The economic meltdown has led to the crumbling of basic services , including health care and water treatment facilities .
Cholera has spread to neighbouring South Africa , Mozambique , Zambia and Botswana and forced Mugabe ’s government to declare a national emergency and appeal for international assistance .
Western nations as well as Zimbabwe ’s neighbours in Africa have pledged humanitarian assistance , while sharpening their criticism of Mugabe ’s government and his failure to establish a unity government with the opposition MDC .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Friday it was time for Mugabe to step down , echoing a call on Thursday by Nobel laureate and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
In a further sign of growing international pressure , the European Union is considering applying more sanctions against Zimbabwe next week unless progress is made in ending a political deadlock over how to implement the Sept. 15 power - sharing deal .
Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai have deadlocked over the control of ministries in the unity government .
Negotiators from Mugabe ’s ZANU - PF party and the MDC are scheduled to meet again with South African mediators in two weeks .

Tuesday ’s presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden brought the first mass protest to Cleveland since the May 30 demonstration that led to rioting , property damage and more than 100 arrests throughout downtown .

AMSTERDAM – Dutch group Philips has developed an " intelligent pill " that contains a microprocessor , battery , wireless radio , pump and a drug reservoir to release medication in a specific area in the body .
Philips , one of the world 's biggest hospital equipment makers , said Tuesday that the " iPill " capsule , measures acidity with a sensor to determine its location in the gut , and can then release drugs where they are needed .
Delivering drugs to treat digestive tract disorders such as Crohn 's disease directly to the location of the disease means doses can be lower , reducing side effects , Philips said .
While capsules containing miniature cameras are already used as diagnostic tools , those lack the ability to deliver drugs , Philips said .
The " iPill " can also measure the local temperature and report it wirelessly to an external receiver .
The company plans to present the " iPill " at the annual meeting of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists ( AAPS ) in Atlanta this month .
The iPill is a prototype but suitable for serial manufacturing , Philips said .

Dorodango ( Happy Mud balls in Japanese ) are perfect spheres of crude soil ( yes , ball of mud ! ) made by hand following an antique Japanese method that require
both patience and concentration .
One can feel serenity , surprise and a great joy in the fact to make from his bare hands
such desirable & pure object from ordinary mud .
To make Dorodango help you to enter a meditative state that give a material result ,
for each instant of distraction your Dorodango will likely show a defect ,
so the end result will clearly show you your progress ( or your lack of attention ) .
You will anyway be pleasantly surprised at your progress
when you make your second , then third Dorodango .
Making Dorodango was originaly an ancient Japanese kid form of play ,
that was mostly forgoten until a few years back when professor Fumio Kayo
made it popular again in Japan and worldwide .
The Dorodango making process has been recently raffined by some artist
and has become the art to make Hikaru Dorodango ( Shiny Dorodango ! )
or some time Dorodango with a paterned surface .
Since i noticed there is no internet pages explaining how to make Dorodango step by step
with images , i made this page on this subject and hope it will help more people to discover
this wonderfull quiet and ecologic occupation .
But first thing first , i want to make one thing clear :
To make Dorodango , you dont need to buy anything at all !
The earth you will collect in your garden or on the nearby dig will do just fine .
Please ignore some websites that advice you to go and buy clay and sand
and even suggest to varnish your Dorodango ( HORROR !)
Such websites have likely been writen by the owner of some art shop in need of more customers or by some " compulsive buyers " from whom what is free simply cant be good .
How to make Dorodango .
Take some earth , dry it and filter it ( the more thin the earth you obtain , the nicer the Dorodango you will obtain ) , you can use an ordinary kitchen strainer as a filter , it work fine Any earth will do fine , you dont need pure pottery clay to make Dorodango !
Addwater to obtain a firm paste , if you add too much water you will not be abble to make balls with the paste , if you dont add enought water your balls will have no cohesion
and will crack very fast .
Be carefull not to fall head first in the bowl please .
Take a good handfull of mud and make a ball between your hands , you have to squeeze it for the first 2 or 3 minutes to make it as compact as possible , do not knead it or it will crack
Make the ball as perfect as possible by gently rolling it between your hands , the idea is at this step to extract humidity from the ball , for example by regularly dry your palms .
Once you have made a perfect sphere , it is possible to accelerate the drying process by gently rolling it in a dry clothe .
Some people prefer to place the ball in a plastic bag , then to place the bag in the fridge to make the water condensate on the bag ... well , i dont like this method ,
but you can try it and see how you like it .
You have to CONCENTRATE on the ball , it is very fragile at this step .
Once the surface is dry enought ( it take TIME , one full hour minimum ) , you have to leave the Dorodango to rest for some time , minimum one hour , but i suggest one full night .
Place your Dorodango in a plastic bag , at room temperature , on top of a piece of cloth
or on some dry earth , to avoid to flatten its bottom .
Next step is to pour some dry filtered earth on the surface of the Dorodango so that little
by little a shell will form around the original core because some earth particules
will adhere due to the surface moistness .
BEWARE : If you start this step too early you will see your Dorodango crack ...
and earn the privilege to start again from scratch .
At this step the surface of your Dorodango is mostly dry , but core remain made of liquid mud .
!!! BE CAREFULL !!!
When you start this step the shell will first form fast , then the dryer your Dorodango ,
the slower the process become .
Pass the Dorodango from one hand to the other , pouring slowly dry filtered earth on it .
Carry on and be carefull at what you do , or you will see some crack appearing ...
If you start to make the shell too early , it happen that the core will dry and shrink a bit ,
causing later the shell to break , in such case 3 options : - Start again from the beginning .
- Remove the shell and start to make a new one from the same core .
- Hara - Kiri with your kitchen strainer ( painfull ) .
After a few hours the shell is ready and no more earth adhere , it is the time for the next step .
This step consist to polish the surface of the Dorodango
with some VERY THINLY FILTERED dry earth .
The idea isnt to polish by removing anything , but to add some earth by having some micro-particule in the interstices of the surface to make it smoother
After a ( long ) moment , the surface is smooth and you can then carry on with a piece of clothe ( use THIN clothe or you will ruin your Dorodango if you use something to rought ! ) , do not polish your Dorodango too much with the cloth , because you will then take the risk
to remove too much of the shell surface and see it crack ...
The result of too much polishing ...
On this picture you can clearly see how thick the shell is on a Dorodango .
Now this Dorodango has a surface almost comparable with a snooker ball ,
and its made only from ordinary garden earth , water and lots of patience
On those 3 Dorodango , only one survived until the end ...
Others ended in the Dorodango graveyard , before to end their short carrer back in the garden .
After a few days of work ... VOILA , this Hikaru Dorodango look like a sphere of hematite !
Another Hikaru Dorodango made from another type of earth .
This one is bigger , but clearly not as nice as the two others , its surface show a lot of imperfections & scratch .
Remember : once finished a Dorodango is still very fragile !
Our 3 first Dorodango .
Nicely finished Dorodango , 100 % made from ordinary garden earth .
This one is not a real Dorodango , i just made a ball of clay ,
then dried it and baked it in my woodstove before to polish it ...

It took seven years to write Eunoia Eunoia is the shortest word in English containing all five vowels - and it means " beautiful thinking " .
It is also the title of Canadian poet Christian Bok 's book of fiction in which each chapter uses only one vowel .
Mr Bok believes his book proves that each vowel has its own personality , and demonstrates the flexibility of the English language .
Below are extracts from each chapter .
from CHAPTER A - FOR HANS ARP Hassan Abd al - Hassad , an Agha Khan , basks at an ashram - a Taj Mahal that has grand parks and grass lawns , all as vast as parklands at Alhambra and Valhalla .
Hassan can , at a handclap , call a vassal at hand and ask that all staff plan a bacchanal - a gala ball that has what pagan charm small galas lack .
Hassan claps , and ( tah - dah ) an Arab lass at a swank spa can draw a man 's bath and wash a man 's back , as Arab lads fawn and hang , athwart an altar , amaranth garlands as fragrant as attar - a balm that calms all angst .
A dwarf can flap a palm branch that fans a fat maharajah .
A naphtha lamp can cast a calm warmth .
from CHAPTER E - FOR RENE CREVEL Westerners revere the Greek legends .
Versemen retell the represented events , the resplendent scenes , where , hellbent , the Greek freemen seek revenge whenever Helen , the new - wed empress , weeps .
Restless , she deserts her fleece bed where , detested , her wedded regent sleeps .
When she remembers Greece , her seceded demesne , she feels wretched , left here , bereft , her needs never met .
She needs rest ; nevertheless , her demented fevers render her sleepless ( her sleeplessness enfeebles her ) .
She needs help ; nevertheless her stressed nerves render her cheerless ( her cheerlessness enfetters her ) .
from CHAPTER I - FOR DICK HIGGINS
Hiking in British districts , I picnic in virgin firths , grinning in mirth with misfit whims , smiling if I find birch twigs , smirking if I find mint sprigs .

Rapper Trick
Trick has launched an outspoken attack on homosexuals , saying that he did n't want any of them to buy his new album The Villain .
Speaking to All Hip Hop , Eminem 's buddy said , “ I ’m gonna go on the record right now with this .
Homosexuals are probably not gonna like this album .
I do n’t want your faggot money any goddamn way .
I do n’t like [ homosexuality ] .
Carry that shit somewhere else . ”
Talking about the homophobic lyrics on his record , Mr Trick said , “ It ’s just that every time that you turn on the TV , that sissy shit is on .
And they act like it 's fucking okay .
The world is changing for the worst [ sic ] when shit like that happens .
And I address that issue .
I address it hard as hell . ”
Has Mr Trick
Trick not realised that , in gay parlance , to " turn a trick " refers to young , fresh faced fellow who finds himself down on his luck offering himself to another , perhaps older gentleman in exchange for some grubby notes ?
The Quietus wonders , therefore , what a " trick trick " might be .
Winning on the horses and purchasing two young gentlemen , perhaps ?
One in front , one behind ?
Paying your young conquest to arrive at the house in a skeleton outfit , and cracking off a " treat " at his costumed form through the letterbox ?
Does he mean to have us even if it be burglary ?
Perhaps Trick
Trick could let us know at the usual address .

Forget what 's number one at the box office this week .
The most exciting new film features the intricate workings of the body , filmed by scientists using ground - breaking technology .
For the first time in Australia , scientists at Sydney 's Centenary Institute have filmed an immune cell becoming infected by a parasite and followed the infection as it begins to spread throughout the body .
Professor Wolfgang Weninger , head of the Immune Imaging program at the Centenary Institute , says the discovery ( published in PLoS Pathogens ) was made possible using high powered multi-photon microscopy which allows real cells to be viewed in real time .
" Using multi-photon microscopy , we studied dendritic cells in the skin .
Under normal conditions we found the cells in the epidermis ( top layer ) were static , whereas in the dermis ( second layer ) they were very active , moving around as though seeking out pathogens , " explains Professor Weninger .
" Once we established this , it was fascinating to introduce the Leishmania infection and watch as the parasite was picked up by the cells and the process by which it began to spread throughout the body . "
Leishmaniasis affects up to 12 million people in parts of Africa , the Middle East and South America .
The disease causes skin sores and can affect internal organs such as the spleen , liver and bone marrow .
If left untreated , it can be fatal .
The ability to visually follow a pathogen on its journey through the immune cells provides critical insight for future vaccine design and has potential to improve current vaccinations .
" We now have a general idea of how pathogens are recognised by the immune system and which cells are involved , " Professor Weninger says .
" This means we can look at identifying the molecules responsible for the uptake of Leishmania infection and these molecules could become vaccine targets .
Additionally , we can investigate the immune responses of other infections which could lead to better vaccines . "
" On the other side of the story , scientists can now visualise the pathway of current vaccines in the immune system , providing greater understanding and the potential for refining current interventions against disease . "
Centenary Institute Executive Director , Professor Mathew Vadas , says the multi-photon microscope used to film this immune process is the Hubble telescope of medical research .
" The Hubble allowed the universe to be seen with absolute clarity , which was n't before possible from earth , " he explains .
" This is exactly the same as multi-photon microscopy – it provides a unique and innovative view of cells , unveiling a whole new understanding of how immune processes work . "

The united states Of America is a corporation owned by foreign interests Seteembar 21 , 2008
Posted by spiritualphilantropy in Analysis
Below are two articles covering the fact that , since the Act of 1871 which established the District of Columbia , we have been living under the UNITED STATES CORPORATION which is owned by certain international bankers and aristocracy of Europe and Britain .
In 1871 the Congress changed the name of the original Constitution by changing ONE WORD — and that was very significant as you will read .
Some people do not understand that ONE WORD or TWO WORDS difference in any “ legal ” document DO make the critical difference .
But , Congress has known , and does know , this .
I ’m told this corporation , established in 1871 , will be cancelled by NESARA and NESARA will also restore the ORIGINAL Constitution which assists in restoring our Constitutional Rights and the Bill of Rights and our rights as described in the Declaration of Independence .
1871 , February 21 : Congress Passes an Act to Provide a Government for the District of Columbia , also known as the Act of 1871 *
With no constitutional authority to do so , Congress creates a separate form of government for the District of Columbia , a ten mile square parcel of land ( see , Acts of the Forty - first Congress , ” Section 34 , Session III , chapters 61 and 62 ) .
The act — passed when the country was weakened and financially depleted in the aftermath of the Civil War — was a strategic move by foreign interests ( international bankers ) who were intent upon gaining a stranglehold on the coffers and neck of America .
Congress cut a deal with the international bankers ( specifically Rothschilds of London ) to incur a DEBT to said bankers .
Because the bankers were not about to lend money to a floundering nation without serious stipulations , they devised a way to get their foot in the door of the United States .
The Act of 1871 formed a corporation called THE UNITED STATES .
The corporation , OWNED by foreign interests , moved in and shoved the original Constitution into a dustbin .
With the Act of 1871 , the organic Constitution was defaced — in effect vandalized and sabotage — when the title was capitalized and the word “ for ” was changed to “ of ” in the title .
* Info from yet unpublished book , “ Pentimento : Freedom Revisited . ”
As you will see when reading , just as much of my knowledge of the Trading with the Enemy Act came from Gene Schroder , et al . this , too , came from elsewhere — from Lisa Guilian of Babel Magazine , whom I first “ met ” by way of an article by Patrick Bellringer .
So , we cooperate as we study and learn the truth .
C. E .
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is the constitution of the incorporated UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .
It operates in an economic capacity and has been used to fool the People into thinking it governs the Republic .
It does is not !
Capitalization is NOT insignificant when one is referring to a legal document .
This seemingly “ minor ” alteration has had a major impact on every subsequent generation of Americans .
What Congress did by passing the Act of 1871 was create an entirely new document , a constitution for the government of the District of Columbia , an INCORPORATED government .
This newly altered Constitution was not intended to benefit the Republic .
It benefits only the corporation of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and operates entirely outside the original ( organic ) Constitution .
Instead of having absolute and unalienable rights guaranteed under the organic Constitution , we the people now have “ relative ” rights or privileges .
One example is the Sovereign ’s right to travel , which has now been transformed ( under corporate government policy ) into a “ privilege ” that requires citizens to be licensed .
By passing the Act of 1871 , Congress committed TREASON against the People who were Sovereign under the grants and decrees of the Declaration of Independence and the organic Constitution .
[ Information courtesy of Lisa Guliani , http://www.babelmagazine.com.
The Act of 1871 became the FOUNDATION of all the treason since committed by government officials . ]
The UNITED STATES Is n’t a Country – It ’s a Corporation !
In preparation for stealing America , the puppets of Britain ’s banking cabal had already created a second government , a Shadow Government designed to manage what the common herd believed was a democracy , but what really was an incorporated UNITED STATES .
Together this chimera , this two - headed monster , disallowed the common herd all rights of sui juris .
[ sovereignty ]
Congress , with no authority to do so , created a separate form of government for the District of Columbia , a ten - mile square parcel of land .
WHY and HOW did they do so ?
First , Lisa Guliani of Babel Magazine , reminds us that the Civil War was , in fact , “ little more than a calculated front
with fancy footwork by backroom players . ”
Then she adds :
“ It was also a strategic maneuver by British and European interests ( international bankers ) intent on gaining a stranglehold on the coffers of America .
And , because Congress knew our country was in dire financial straits , certain members of Congress cut a deal with the international bankers ( in those days , the Rothschilds of London were dipping their fingers into everyone ’s pie ) .
. . . .
There you have the WHY , why members of Congress permitted the international bankers to gain further control of America .
. . . . .
“ Then , by passing the Act of 1871 , Congress formed a corporation known as THE UNITED STATES .
This corporation , owned by foreign interests , shoved the organic version of the Constitution aside by changing the word ‘ for ’ to ‘ of ’ in the title .
Let me explain : the original Constitution drafted by the Founding Fathers read : ‘ The Constitution for the united states of America . ’ [ note that neither the words ‘ united ’ nor ‘ states ’ began with capital letters ]
But the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ’ is a corporate constitution , which is absolutely NOT the same document you think it is .
First of all , it ended all our rights of sovereignty [ sui juris ] .
So you now have the HOW , how the international bankers got their hands on THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . ”
To fully understand how our rights of sovereignty were ended , you must know the full meaning of sovereign :
SOVEREIGN
“ Chief or highest , supreme power , superior in position to all others ; independent of and unlimited by others ; possessing or entitled to ; original and independent authority or jurisdiction . ”
– Webster–
In short , our government , which was created by and for us as sovereigns — free citizens deemed to have the highest authority in the land — was stolen from us , along with our rights .
Keep in mind that , according to the original Constitution , only We the People are sovereign .
Government is not
sovereign .
The Declaration of Independence says , “ government is subject to the consent of the governed . ”
That ’s us — the sovereigns .
When did you last feet like a sovereign ?
As Lisa Guliani explained :
“ It does n’t take a rocket scientist or a constitutional historian to figure out that the U.S. Government has NOT been subject to the consent of the governed since long before you or I were born .
Rather , the governed are subject to the whim and greed of the corporation , which has stretched its tentacles beyond the ten - mile - square parcel of land known as the District of Columbia .
In fact , it has invaded every state of the Republic .
Mind you , the corporation has NO jurisdiction beyond the District of Columbia .
You just think it does .
“ You see , you are ‘ presumed ’ to know the law , which is very weird since We the People are taught NOTHING about the law in school .
We memorize obscure facts and phrases here and there , like the Preamble , which says , ‘ We the People .
establish this Constitution for the United States of America . ’
But our teachers only gloss over the Bill of Rights .
Our schools ( controlled by the corporate government ) do n’t delve into the Constitution at depth .
After all , the corporation was established to indoctrinate and ‘ dumb - down ’ the masses , not to teach anything of value or importance .
“ Certainly , no one mentioned that America was sold - out to foreign interests , that we were beneficiaries of the debt incurred by Congress , or that we were in debt to the international bankers .
Yet , for generations , Americans have had the bulk of their earnings confiscated to pay a massive debt that they did not incur .
There ’s an endless stream of things the People are n’t told .
And , now that you are being told , how do you feel about being made the recipient of a debt without your knowledge or consent ?
“ After passage of the Act of 1871 , Congress set a series of subtle and overt deceptions into motion , deceptions in the form of decisions that were meant to sell us down the river .
“ Over time , the Republic took it on the chin until it was knocked down and counted out by a technical KO [ knock out ] .
With the surrender of the people ’s gold in 1933 , the ‘ common herd ’ was handed over to illegitimate law .
( I ’ll bet you were n’t taught THAT in school . )
“ Our corporate form of governance is based on Roman Civil Law and Admiralty , or Maritime , Law , which is also known as the ‘ Divine Right of Kings ’ and the ‘ Law of the Seas ’ — another fact of American history not taught in our schools .
Actually , Roman Civil Law was fully established in the colonies before our nation began , and then became managed by private international law .
In other words , the government — the government created for the District of Columbia via the Act of 1871 — operates solely under Private International Law , not Common Law , which was the foundation of our Constitutional Republic .
“ This fact has impacted all Americans in concrete ways .
For instance , although Private International Law is technically only applicable within the District of Columbia , and NOT in the other states of the Union , the arms of the Corporation of the UNITED STATES are called ‘ departments ’ – i.e. , the Justice Department , the Treasury Department .
And those departments affect everyone , no matter where ( in what state ) they live .
Guess what ?
Each department belongs to the corporation — to the UNITED STATES .
“ Refer to any UNITED STATES CODE ( USC ) .
Note the capitalization ; this is evidence of a corporation , not a Republic .
For example , In Title 28 3002 ( 15 ) ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) , it is unequivocally stated that the UNITED STATES is a corporation .
Translation : the corporation is NOT a separate and distinct entity ; it is not disconnected from the government ; it IS the government — your government .
This is extremely important !
I refer to it as the ‘ corporate EMPIRE of the UNITED STATES , ’ which operates under Roman Civil Law outside the original Constitution .
How do you like being ruled by a
corporation ?
You say you ’ll ask your Congressperson about this ?
HA !!
“ Congress is fully aware of this deception .
So it ’s time that you , too , become aware of the deception .
What this great deception means is that the members of Congress do NOT work for us , for you and me .
They work for the Corporation , for the UNITED STATES .
No wonder we ca n’t get them to do anything on our behalf , or meet or demands , or answer our questions .
“ Technically , legally , or any other way you want to look at the matter , the corporate government of the UNITED STATES has no jurisdiction or authority in ANY State of the Union ( the Republic ) beyond the District of Columbia .
Let that tidbit sink in , then ask yourself , could this deception have occurred without full knowledge and complicity of the Congress ?
Do you think it happened by accident ?
If you do , you ’re deceiving yourself .
“ There are no accidents , no coincidences .
Face the facts and confront the truth .
Remember , you are presumed to know the law .
THEY know you do n’t know the law or , for that matter , your history .
Why ?
Because no concerted effort was ever made to teach or otherwise inform you .
As a Sovereign , you are entitled to full disclosure of all facts .
As a slave , you are entitled to nothing other than what the corporation decides to ‘ give ’ you .
“ Remember also that ‘ Ignorance of the law is no excuse . ’
It ’s your responsibility and obligation to learn the law and know how it applies to you .
No wonder the corporation counted on the fact that most people are too indifferent , unconcerned , distracted , or lazy to learn what they need to know to survive within the system .
We have been conditioned to let the government do our thinking for us .
Now ’s the time to turn that around if we intend to help save our Republic and ourselves — before it ’s too late .
“ As an instrument of the international bankers , the UNITED STATES owns you from birth to death .
It also holds ownership of all your assets , of your property , even of your children .
Think long and hard about all the bills taxes , fines , and licenses you have paid for or purchased .
Yes , they had you by the pockets .
If you do n’t believe it , read the 14th Amendment .
See how ‘ free ’ you really are .
Ignorance of the facts led to your silence .
Silence is construed as consent ; consent to be beneficiaries of a debt you did not incur .
As a Sovereign People we have been deceived for hundreds of years ; we think we are free , but in truth we are servants of the corporation .
“ Congress committed treason against the People in 1871 .
Honest men could have corrected the fraud and treason .
But apparently there were n’t enough honest men to counteract the lust for money and power .
We lost more freedom than we will ever know , thanks to corporate infiltration of our so - called ‘ government . ’
“ Do you think that any soldier who died in any of our many wars would have fought if he or she had known the truth ?
Do you think one person would have laid down his / her life for a corporation ?
How long will we remain silent ?
How long will we perpetuate the MYTH that we are free ?
When will we stand together as One Sovereign People ?
When will we take back what has been as stolen from the us ?
“ If the People of America had known to what extent their trust was betrayed , how long would it have taken for a real revolution to occur ?
What we now need is a Revolution in THOUGHT .
We need to change our thinking , then we can change our world .
Our children deserve their rightful legacy — the liberty our ancestors fought to preserve , the legacy of a Sovereign and Fully Free People . ”
[ Posted 8/27/02 , http://www.babalmagazine.com/%5D
From a speech in Congress in The Bankruptcy of The United States United States Congressional Record , March 17 , 1993 Vol. 33 , page H - 1303 .
Speaker - Rep. James Traficant , Jr. ( Ohio ) addressing the House :
“ Prior to 1913 , most Americans owned clear , allodial title to property , free and clear of any liens or mortgages until the Federal Reserve Act ( 1913 ) “ Hypothecated ” all property within the federal United States to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve – in which the Trustees ( stockholders ) held legal title .
The U.S. citizen ( tenant , franchisee ) was registered as a “ beneficiary ” of the trust via his / her birth certificate .
In 1933 , the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties , assets and labor of their “ subjects , ” the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen , to the Federal Reserve System .
In return , the Federal Reserve System agreed to extend THE FEDERAL United States CORPORATION [ emphasis added ] all the credit “ money substitute ” it needed .
Like any other debtor , the federal United States government had to assign collateral and security to their creditors as a condition of the loan .
Since the federal United States did n’t have any assets , they assigned the private property of their “ economic slaves ” , the U.S. citizens as collateral against the unpayable federal debt .
They also pledged the unincorporated federal territories , national parks forests , birth certificates , and nonprofit organizations , as collateral against the federal debt .
All has already been transferred as payment to the international bankers .
Unwittingly , America has returned to its pre-American Revolution , feudal roots whereby all land is held by a sovereign and the common people had no rights to hold allodial title to property .
Once again ,
We the People are the tenants and sharecroppers renting our own property from a Sovereign in the guise of the Federal Reserve Bank .
We the people have exchanged one master for another . . ”
All guys want their girlfriends / mistresses / wives / whatever to think that they ’re a dynamo in bed .
After all , a guy ’s sexual prowess is directly connected to their masculinity and a man who ca n’t satisfy is a man in trouble .
So , if you ’re wondering how to really satisfy your woman , here are 10 things , from a woman ’s point of view , that you should NEVER do in bed :
1 . The “ Wham , bam , thank you m’am ” approach :
Too many guys see sex as purely something to satisfy their horny cravings .
Here ’s your poor woman in her cute little nightie , looking forward to a night of passion , and all she gets is the main event without any sort of opening act .
It might satisfy you , but it certainly wo n’t give her any satisfaction .
This directly leads to …
2 . Not enough foreplay : Women really hate it when , just a minute or two into oral sex , a guy pulls away and goes right for intercourse .
Really , that ’s just not cool at all – give a woman time to properly cum !
3 . No communication :
As a guy , you might think that sex should just be about the physical act , but women see it as so much more than that .
That ’s right , before you start in on foreplay , talk for a little while .
Tell her what you ’d like to do to her , and ( this one ’s the clincher ) ask her what she wants .
4 . The wrong kind of communication : Some guys talk right before sex , but they talk way too much , and about the wrong things .
Okay , so maybe your coworker ’s a real jerk , but talking about it really is n’t going to do much for the mood .
5 . Ignoring pivotal g- spots :
Men too often ignore the overall female anatomy , preferring instead to go right for her pubic area or her breasts .
Yes , these two places are stimulating , but what about the neck , torso , and thighs ?
Mix it up a little bit , otherwise things can get boring quickly .
6 . Thrusting too quickly :
It might help you , but it certainly does n’t help her .
Women like to be treated gently , not like they ’re being pounded by a very large ( well , at least you ’d like to think so ) woodpecker .
Just go at a moderate pace , not being too rough , but making each thrust really count at the same time .
7 . Not warning her when you ’re about to cum : Obviously , women cum more emotionally than physically .
Yeah , it can get a little slippery down there when a woman ’s been satisfied , but guys are the ones that make a real mess .
Tell her just before you ’re going to cum – especially if she ’s giving you fellatio .
After all , semen is n’t always something a woman wants to swallow , and you certainly do n’t want her choking .
8. Trying Anal Sex Without Her Permission : Really , unless she ’s told you before , she ’s probably not into anal sex .
Some guys like to try it out , but honestly , it ’s something that can be very painful for a woman .
So , if that ’s something that you want to try , do n’t just go ahead and pretend like you were confused and in the wrong hole – ask her first !
9 . Not being creative : Guys get an A for effort if they try something and it does n’t work out , but guys who do n’t try anything new just end up plain old boring .
C’mon now , the missionary position is so 18th Century .
10 . Getting too creative :
Yes , there is a happy medium in the sexual creativity department .
Women like trying new things , but when those new things involve being contorted into award positions , then that ’s not a good thing .
Just be careful if you break the table you do n’t fix it in the nude .
In the end a woman ’s body language will tell you what she likes and does n’t like .
So , pay attention , and you ’ll be on your way to doing everything ( namely her ) right .
He was in Philadelphia on Monday for a “ debate ” with former Senator Max Cleland , the Georgia Democrat who lost an arm and two legs in Vietnam .
Mr. Cleland lost his 2002 re-election bid after his Republican opponent , Saxby Chambliss , questioned his commitment to domestic security , running an advertisement featuring likenesses of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
Many Democrats remain bitter over that defeat , for which Mr. Cleland still largely blames Mr. Rove .
“ It ’s a source of income for me , ” Mr. Cleland said of the Monday joint appearance , sponsored by an insurance trade group , for which he said he was paid $ 15,000 .
( Mr. Rove ’s speeches reportedly bring $ 40,000 . )
Going up against Mr. Rove , Mr. Cleland said , “ is like going up against the devil himself . ”
It can pay to be the devil himself , or at least thought of that way .
“ There is an incredible amount of interest in what Karl Rove has to say , ” said Howard Wolfson , an adviser to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign , who appears with Mr. Rove on Fox News .
Mr. Wolfson said he was amazed by how often Democrats asked him what Mr. Rove was like off the air .
“ When I say he ’s nice , people look at me like I ’m nuts , ” he said .
Mr. Rove declined an interview for this article , but engaged somewhat by e-mail .
He said little on the record , ignored some questions and was dismissive of others .
“ Look , ” he wrote , “ I do n’t mean to be rude but I have so much on my plate that my brain explodes when you ask questions like how much of my time I spend on each of my activities or how did I apply skills to my new chapter , et cetera .
I can answer simple questions of fact but I am stretched through the election . ”
But it clearly delights him , for instance , that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts went on about “ the smears of Karl Rove ” during his speech at the Democratic National Convention in August .
Mr. Rove helpfully pasted a passage from Mr. Kerry ’s speech on Rove.com , under the headline “ The Losers Have Spoken . ”
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Few observers have ever seen anything like the economic data that will be released in the coming week , with the consumer price index and housing starts each expected to breach records dating back to the late 1940s .
With the global economy descending into a nasty recession , the October data could send a chill down the spine of policymakers , who are pulling out all the tricks in their tool kit to prevent a wider meltdown .
As everyone knows , this downturn began in the housing sector , with a global credit bubble inflating U.S. home prices , and homebuilders responding with a frenzy of construction .
Now that the bubble has collapsed , everyone is looking to housing for any sign that the worst may be over .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said last week that " market turmoil will not abate until the biggest part of the housing correction is behind us . "
It 's not behind us yet .
In October , credit markets essentially stopped working , which constrained potential home buyers ' ability to find a mortgage .
For home builders , it was the latest in a thousand cuts that have destroyed confidence about their industry .
Housing
After housing starts tumbled to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 817,000 in September , the second - lowest level on record , economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect starts to fall to 776,000 in October , a post - war low that would knock out a record set in January 1991 .
The data are slated to be released Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time .
See Economic Calendar .
" It 's natural to wonder how much more room they still have to go , " wrote Meny Grauman , an economist for CIBC World Markets .
" History and the natural rate of household formation would suggest that we are near the bottom of a two - year slide , but the outstanding stock of new homes and the overall health of the economy point to even further declines ahead . "
The vacancy rate for homes typically occupied by their owner was at 2.8 % in the third quarter , near the all - time record and almost twice as high as during normal times .
" Household formation has slowed noticeably as people losing their jobs or homes to foreclosures move in with relatives , " wrote Brian Bethune and Nigel Gault , U.S. economists for IHS Global Insight .
It 's " one more obstacle that will prolong the downturn in housing starts . "
" We expect builders to continue to cut construction through the middle of next year , " wrote economists for Barclays Capital .
On Tuesday , the National Association of Home Builders is also scheduled to release its monthly survey of builder sentiment .
The MarketWatch survey expects the index to remain at a record - low 14 in November , indicating that only about one in seven builders is optimistic about the market over the next six months .
Inflation vs. deflation
As the economic slump has spread around the globe , commodity prices have plummeted .
The Federal Reserve no longer considers inflation to be much of a worry , and no wonder :
The consumer price index is expected to fall 0.9 % in October , the biggest one - month decline since the government began tracking the CPI in 1947 .
The CPI figures are due out Wednesday .
Retail gasoline prices fell a record 17 % in October as the global price for crude oil collapsed .
Prices have continued to fall in November , signaling another big drop in the CPI .
After peaking at 5.5 % in July , the year - over - year increase in the CPI will likely dip below 4 % in October and go below 2 % by the middle of next year , said CIBC 's Grauman .
Core inflation -- which excludes food and energy prices -- is expected to rise 0.1 % in October .
On a year - over - year basis , the core CPI should moderate from 2.4 % to 1.3 % by the end of next year , said economists for UBS .
Output
Industrial production should show a modest rebound in October , recovering from the impact of hurricanes in September .
The survey tips output rising 0.5 % in October after plunging 2.8 % in September .
The data are to be released on Monday .
Refining and chemical output should bounce back , " but the rest of manufacturing remains in a headlong retreat , " wrote Gault and Bethune .
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management and the regional surveys suggest output is falling rapidly .
" The outlook for industrial production is worrisome as slower export activity due to a stronger U.S. dollar and slower global growth may limit improvement in the second half of 2008 and early 2009 , " wrote economists for Wachovia .

The New York Times is reporting about an " apparent evolution " in president - elect Barack Obama ’s thinking on Iraq , citing his recent statements about his plan to keep a " residual force " in the country and his pledge to " listen to the recommendations of my commanders " as Obama prepares to assume actual command of US forces .
" At the Pentagon and the military headquarters in Iraq , the response to the statements this week from Mr. Obama and his national security team has been akin to the senior officer corps ’ letting out its collective breath , " the Times reported .
" [ T ] the words sounded to them like the new president would take a measured approach on the question of troop levels . "
The reality is there is no " evolution . "
Anyone who took the time to cut past Barack Obama ’s campaign rhetoric of " change " and bringing an " end " to the Iraq war realized early on that the now - president - elect had a plan that boiled down to a down - sizing and rebranding of the occupation .
While he emphasized his pledge to withdraw US " combat forces " from Iraq in 16 months ( which may or may not happen ) , he has always said that he intends to keep " residual forces " in place for the foreseeable future .
It ’s an interesting choice of terms .
" Residual " is defined as " the quantity left over at the end of a process . "
This means that the forces Obama plans to leave in Iraq will remain after he has completed his " withdrawal " plan .
No matter how Obama chooses to label the forces he keeps in Iraq , the fact is , they will be occupation forces .
Announcing his national security team this week , Obama reasserted his position .
" I said that I would remove our combat troops from Iraq in 16 months , with the understanding that it might be necessary  likely to be necessary  to maintain a residual force to provide potential training , logistical support , to protect our civilians in Iraq . "
While some have portrayed this as Obama going back on his campaign pledge , it is not .
What is new is that some people seem to just now be waking up to the fact that Obama never had a comprehensive plan to fully end the occupation .
Most recently , from the New York Times :
" On the campaign trail , Senator Barack Obama offered a pledge that electrified and motivated his liberal base , vowing to ‘ end the war ’ in Iraq , " wrote reporter Thom Shanker on Thursday .
" But as he moves closer to the White House , President - elect Obama is making clearer than ever that tens of thousands of American troops will be left behind in Iraq , even if he can make good on his campaign promise to pull all combat forces out within 16 months . "
For many months it ’s been abundantly clear that Obama ’s Iraq plan is at odds with his campaign rhetoric .
Yet , Shanker writes , " to date , there has been no significant criticism from the antiwar left of the Democratic Party of the prospect that Mr. Obama will keep tens of thousands of troops in Iraq for at least several years to come . "
The Times is actually right about this , in a literal sense .
There has seldom , if ever , been a public peep about Obama ’s residual force plans for Iraq from members of his own party , including from those who describe themselves as " antiwar . "
But , for those who have scrutinized Obama ’s plans and the statements of his advisors from the beginning , this is old news .
Obama never defined " ending the war " as removing all US forces from Iraq .
Besides the counsel of his closest advisors  many of whom are pro-war hawks 
Obama ’s Iraq plan is based on two primary sources : the recommendations of the Baker - Hamilton " Iraq Study Group " and the 2007 Iraq supplemental spending bill , which , at the time was portrayed as the Democrats ’ withdrawal plan .
Both envisioned a sustained presence of US forces for an undefined period following a " withdrawal . "
In supporting the 2007 supplemental , Obama said it would put the US " one signature away from ending the Iraq War . "
The bill would have redeployed US forces from Iraq within 180 days .
But that legislation , vetoed by President Bush , would also have provided for 20,000 to 60,000 troops to remain in Iraq as " trainers , " " counter - terrorist forces , " or for " protection for embassy / diplomats , " according to an analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies .
The bill contained no language about how many " private contractors " could remain in Iraq .
This helped shed light on what Obama actually meant by " ending the Iraq War . "
Other glaring clues to the actual nature of Obama ’s Iraq plan to anyone paying attention could be found in the public comments of his advisors , particularly on the size of the force Obama may leave in Iraq after his withdrawal is complete .
Obama has refused to talk numbers , saying in October , " I have tried not to put a number on it . "
That has been the position of many of his loyal aides .
" We have not put a number on that .
It depends on the circumstances on the ground , " said Susan Rice , Obama ’s nominee for UN ambassador , during the campaign .
" It would be worse than folly , it would be dangerous , to put a hard number on the residual forces . "
But , Richard Danzig , President Clinton ’s former Navy Secretary who may soon follow Robert Gates as Obama ’s Defense Secretary , said during the campaign that the " residual force " could number as many as 55,000 troops .
That does n’t include Blackwater and other mercenaries and private forces , which the Obama camp has declared the president - elect " ca n’t rule out [ and ] wo n’t rule out " using .
At present there are more " contractors " in Iraq than soldiers , which is all the more ominous when considering Obama ’s Iraq plan .
In April , it was revealed that the coordinator of Obama ’s Iraq working group , Colin Kahl , had authored a paper , titled " Stay on Success : A Policy of Conditional Engagement , " which recommended , " the US should aim to transition to a sustainable over - watch posture ( of perhaps 60,000 - 80,000 forces ) by the end of 2010 ( although the specific timelines should be the byproduct of negotiations and conditions on the ground ) . "
Kahl tried to distance the views expressed in the paper from Obama ’s official campaign position , but they were and are consistent .
In March , Obama advisor Samantha Power let the cat out of the bag for some people when she described her candidate ’s 16 - month timetable for withdrawing US " combat " forces as a " best case scenario . "
Power said , " He will , of course , not rely on some plan that he ’s crafted as a presidential candidate or a US Senator . "
( After that remark and referring to Sen. Hillary Clinton as a " monster , " Power resigned from the campaign .
Now that Obama is president - elect , Power ’s name has once again resurfaced as a member of his transitional team . )
The New York Times also raised the prospect that Obama could play semantics when defining his 16 - month withdrawal plan , observing , " Pentagon planners say that it is possible that Mr. Obama ’s goal could be accomplished at least in part by relabeling some units , so that those currently counted as combat troops could be ‘ re - missioned , ’ their efforts redefined as training and support for the Iraqis . "
Compare all of the above with a statement Obama made in July : " I intend to end this war .
My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in , and I will give them a new mission , and that is to end this war  responsibly , deliberately , but decisively . "
Some may now accuse Obama of flip - flopping .
The reality is that we need to understand what the words " end " " war " " residual " and " decisively " mean when we hear Obama say them .

Too close to call : MO , NC Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has been elected the next President of the United States , capping a historic campaign that makes him the first African American president in history .
Obama was the first Democrat since 1976 to win more than 50 percent of the popular vote , netting at least 62,748,399 to Sen.
John McCain's 55,596,984 .

Obama was greeted by an extended , raucous ovation from tens of thousands of his supporters before his victory speech Tuesday night .
" Americans have sent a message to the world , " Obama said , " That we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states , we are and always have been the United States of America .
... Change has come to America . "
The victory marked a stunning transformation in a country where just over a half - century ago racial segregation was the law of the land in many states .
Rep. John Lewis ( D - GA ) , who was a leader during the civil rights movement , seemed close to tears as he discussed the implications of Obama 's victory .
" We are a different people -- we are a better people , " Lewis said on MSNBC .
" We are prepared to lay down our dark past and look toward a bright future . "
At 11 p.m. Tuesday night , all the major news networks projected an Obama victory based on an impressive string of upsets in traditionally red states while the Democratic candidate held on to solidly blue states .
Tens of thousands of Obama supporters were gathered in Chicago , where Obama was expected to speak around midnight .
As news of Obama 's route emerged Tuesday evening , supporters exploded in celebration all over the country .
Video of the Obama supporters is available here .
About 20 minutes later , Sen . John McCain , the Republican nominee , conceded the race and pledged to do whatever he could to help Obama lead the country .
The Democratic presidential candidate won a landslide victory , including at least a half - dozen states President Bush carried four years ago .
Obama won Ohio , Florida , Virginia , New Mexico , Colorado , Iowa and Nevada as of 11:30 p.m.
Remaining states that were too close to call had all been red states in 2004 .
Network pundits were all - but calling the election for Obama before 9:30 p.m. Tuesday -- a stark contrast to the nail - biters of 2000 and 2004 , where the winner was n't known until the morning or month after Election Day .
All Obama needs to do is win California , Washington and his home state of Hawaii and he will exceed the 270 electoral votes necessary to win .
All three of those states have been considered solidly in Obama 's column essentially since the election began .
New Mexico -- another formerly red state -- also was projected to go for Obama .
In Pennslyvania , the state that gave John McCain perhaps his only chance to win , Obama was quickly declared the projected winner .
The win in the Keystone State delivers a massive blow to McCain 's campaign , which had spent significant time in the state over the last two weeks .
" The McCain campaign strategy for victory has crashed , " MSNBC 's Chris Matthes said as soon as the network made its projection .
The Republican candidate 's strategy had largely been predicated on his chances to take Pennsylvania from Obama .
His failure to do so leaves him an extremely narrow path to victory .
CNN , Fox News and ABC also projected an Obama win in Pennsylvania , once votes began coming in .
Obama also won New Hampshire , further upsetting McCain 's hopes of an upset .
Networks projected solidly blue Vermont , Connecticut , New Jersey , Maryland , Delaware , and Massachusetts would remain in Obama 's column while Alabama , Georgia , Kentucky , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee and West Virginia would continue to back the Republican candidate .
Among the most interesting picture was beginning to emerge in Indiana , a state that has been among the most solidly Republican for decades .
Obama , from bordering Illinois , was holding close with McCain in early tallies and substantially outperforming John Kerry 's showing in the state four years ago .
An hour after polls there closed , no votes had yet been tallied in Democratic strongholds like Indianapolis , Bloomington or the state 's northwestern counties that border Chicago .
The following updated map was created by MSNBC :
The Birmingham City Council chose a new member Tuesday only to learn hours later that he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor marijuana charge in 2003 .
Johnathan F. Austin was selected to represent District 5 , replacing in a position formerly held by William Bell , who joined the Jefferson County Commission last month .
He was sworn in Tuesday morning and immediately took his seat .
At 29 years old , Austin is the youngest person on the nine - member city governing body .
Council President Carole Smitherman said she was surprised to learn about Austin 's history but doubted the charge rises to the level of moral turpitude , a standard for barring officials from office .
She said the council would investigate the conviction and meet soon with its lawyer .
She said the council investigated qualifications of the candidates for the office but did not do criminal background checks .
" The council acted on all the information that it had , so it 's a wake - up call for the council , " she said .
" We need to do criminal background checks on everybody who applies for anything . "
Austin acknowledged Tuesday evening that he had been arrested and pleaded guilty and said he had moved on from the incident .
" I was young and in college , " he said .
" That was almost six years ago . "
Austin said he was not asked about any arrests in his interview with the council and did n't mention it because it was a misdemeanor and occurred years ago .
" The revelation is an interesting one , but if the councilor has indicated that he 's moved on , I do n't see any reason to cast stones , " Councilman Roderick Royal said after learning of the arrest .
" In fact , I wish him well in his service . "
Court records show Austin was arrested Jan. 25 , 2003 , after a traffic stop in Tuscaloosa for speeding in Interstate 20/59 .
Tuscaloosa County Sheriff 's deputies found a pipe , about a half ounce of marijuana and a set of scales .
Austin was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia .
Austin said the arrest has no bearing on his ability to serve as a council member .
" It 's not something that I 'm proud of , but this is definitely not going to affect my performance or desire to serve the people , " he said .
" If anything , it just lets the people know that I 'm a real person , just like them , who has lived real - life experiences . "
Court records show Austin pleaded guilty to second - degree possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia .
He was placed on two years probation and received a 90 - day suspended sentence after he agreed to attend court - ordered drug and alcohol treatment classes .
" I 'm not dishonest .
I do n't steal .
I do n't lie and I do n't cheat , " he said Tuesday .
" I do n't have any issue with drugs .
I 've smoked marijuana before .
I 've smoked pot and that 's it . "
The council voted 5 - 2 - 1 Tuesday to seat Austin , who was elected president of the Central City Neighborhood Association and Northside Community last month .
" Thanks for giving me this opportunity .
I wo n't let you down , " Austin said before taking his place on the dais .
" Yes , I am young .
I have a lot of energy and a lot of ideas , " he said .
Council members Smitherman , Carol Duncan , Valerie Abbott and Maxine Parker voted to appoint Austin to the council , while Miriam Witherspoon and Steven Hoyt voted no .
Royal abstained .
Neighborhood leader and friend Jackson Helms Smith , president - elect of the Central City Neighborhood Association , stood behind the new councilman .
" He 's one of the most personable people you 'd meet , " Smith said .
" He works very hard , he 's very bright and a forward thinker . "
Before the council voted , it went into closed - door session .
" There were issues that some council members had with candidates that had to do with good name and character and we thought it was it was best to discuss these issues among ourselves , " Smitherman said .
Others in the meeting , however , said council members went into the session to agree on one candidate to bring back for a vote .
Austin was the only name voted on after the closed - door meeting .
Other applicants for the council seat were : Citizens Advisory Board President Emanuel Ford ; former city Councilman Elias Hendricks ; Cleophas Guice Jr. ; businessman T.C. Cannon ; activist Kamau Afrika ; Druid Hills Neighborhood President Charlie Williams ; Fountain Heights Neighborhood President Doris Powell ; Albert Foster and Mario D. Hicks .
A poll of neighborhood officers ranked Williams the top choice , followed by Hendricks .
Ford and Austin tied for third .
News staff writer Val Walton contributed to this report .
" A few days after the argument , we received a tip - off , anonymously , that she was missing , " Israel Police superintendent Shlomi Sagi told the Herald .
" Immediately , we were afraid because of the family history , " he said .
Last week , Sagi said , police picked up Dalia 's brother , Mahmoud Abu Ghanem , in Rahat , a city near Gaza in Israel 's south .
" He told us he was looking for work there .
His sister is missing and he goes away to look for work ?
We arrested him . "
Although a body has still not been found , in a court appearance on Monday police formally charged Mahmoud with his sister 's murder .
He was remanded in custody .
A look into the bloody history of the Abu Ghanem family and it seems like escape was never an option for Dalia .
In 2000 , her mother Naifa was the victim of an honour killing , and in 2006 her sister Shirihan bled to death after her throat was slashed .
Dalia also watched as six of her cousins were gunned down , strangled and stabbed for " crimes " as trivial as talking to another man on the telephone .
Further unhappiness was forced upon Dalia when , at the age of 14 , shortly after her sister 's murder , she was forced by her father to marry a man she barely knew , against her will .
Three months ago she gave birth to a daughter , but motherhood was an experience she had to endure alone as her husband is serving a prison sentence .
At various times during her marriage , Dalia had sought refuge in shelters for battered women , after she had endured beatings and several murder threats .
" But she chose to go back to her family 's neighbourhood , as other local women did and were then attacked , " a police prosecutor told the Ramla Magistrates Court on Monday .
As recently as March this year , 40 - year - old Sara Abu Ghanem sustained light injuries to her head and neck when several unidentified men opened fire at her on her way to work .
Sara had recently divorced her Palestinian husband and wished to make official her relationship with a local Jewish man , a fact that had outraged the family .
So - called honour killings number about 10 a year among Israel 's 1.5 million - strong , mostly Muslim Arab population .
" Dalia was a quiet girl , who rarely spoke to me , " says Omar al - Omar , a senior organiser at the Juarish Community Centre who knew Dalia well and had taught her gymnastics and folk dancing .
" This is a family ruled by fear and you can see it in the faces of the Abu Ghanem women .
They grow up with this huge weight on their shoulders , " al - Omar says .
Al - Omar says economic hardship and lack of education are likely reasons why the Abu Ghanem clan , which numbers about 2000 people in Juarish , has bred such a culture of violence .
" There are a lot of social problems in this family .
They pull the girls out of school at age 12 and force them to get married , stop them getting educated , stop them getting out .
It 's a cycle that goes around and around .
It 's an epidemic here . "
On the streets of Juarish , several people approached by the Herald walked away when approached to talk about Dalia 's disappearance .
" When she first disappeared , the kids who come here to the community centre never talked about it with words , they talked about it with pictures that they drew for each other in school .
Everyone knows right away that she is killed , " al - Omar says .
" It shows how deeply this affected the culture here , where the ' honour killing ' is an epidemic , but where no one can talk openly about . "
This culture of silence is something that Israeli police have struggled to break as they tried to solve the murders , most of which remain unsolved .
But in January 2006 , things started to change after 18 - year - old Hamda Abu Ghanem was shot nine times while she lay in her bed .
Instead of maintaining the usual wall of silence , the Abu Ghanem women opened up , with police gathering testimony from 20 female witnesses .
Hamda had refused to marry a man she had been promised to , it was revealed .
She also talked too much on the telephone and had once been spotted talking to a male cousin .
Convictions were eventually secured against several relatives , including her brothers Rashad and Kalil Abu Ghanem .
Convictions against another four Abu Ghanem brothers were also secured over the murder of their 19 - year - old sister Reem , who was strangled to death in March 2006 .
One of the brothers , Suleiman Abu Ghanem , a respected physician at a local hospital , had conspired in the murder by supplying sleeping tablets to his brothers and instructing them on how to sedate her .
Once asleep , Reem was wrapped in a blanket , placed in the boot of a car and driven to a local field .
She awoke and pleaded for her life with her brothers .
They tried to convince her that she had disgraced the family 's honour because she had refused to marry the man she had been promised to and had instead ran away from home to be with another man she had fallen in love with .
They then suffocated her and dumped her body in a nearby well .
" These convictions show that things are changing slowly , " Sagi said .
" We hope we can continue to get people to talk , especially in this latest case . "
Meanwhile , says al - Omar , whose work on the ground in Juarish provides a crucial link to the world outside the Abu Ghanem clan , there are small signs of change .
" In my folk dancing class now , I have nine Abu Ghanem women .
Ten years ago this would never have happened .
It means they are getting bolder .
I am hoping it will continue . "
Britain has become a worse credit risk than McDonald 's and a host of other large companies , figures produced for The Independent reveal .
The collapse in Britain 's credit rating has taken place over the past two and a half months , since the Government underwrote the banking system and decided to spend its way out of recession .
Investing in UK government debt is now almost twice as risky as buying McDonald 's corporate bonds , according to the market in credit default swaps ( CDS ) , which provides insurance for the buyers of such debt .
The government debt of large economies such as the UK would normally be considered far more secure than corporate bonds .
However , on 29 September , the cost of buying insurance against default on UK five - year government debt became more expensive than the equivalent cover for the US burger chain and has since overtaken Kellogg 's and Coca - Cola , according to data from Bloomberg .

The cost of insuring British debt soared on that day , as the Government nationalised Bradford & Bingley , increasing fears that the state would have to bail out the banking system .
The cost of insuring for a year against default on £ 10 m of five - year UK debt has jumped from less than £ 30,000 to £ 120,000 , compared with the current price of £ 77,000 to protect against a similar McDonald 's default .
The cost of insuring against default on the Government 's bonds spiked again in mid-October after the Government announced its unprecedented bailout of the banking system , which has already seen Royal Bank of Scotland become part - nationalised .
The extraordinary movements in the CDS market also reflect market concerns about the highly leveraged British economy , which is sliding into a recession that the International Monetary Fund has predicted may be worse than the slowdown in the US .
The CDS market has proved controversial as the financial crisis has unfolded because it has raised alarm bells about the financial strength of companies , but at the same time it is opaque and illiquid and has become a means for speculators to bet against companies .
Investors also use CDS to hedge against other risks such as share prices , meaning prices can reflect other factors than the underlying risk of the debt insured .
But analysts said the dramatic change in the risk rating of the UK 's debt still represents a major swing in investor sentiment towards the British economy .
The cost of insuring against German default on equivalent terms is below the UK at £ 51,000 , with France costing £ 61,000 .
Britain is deemed to be safer than Italy , at £ 191,000 , and Russia , whose CDSs cost £ 784,000 .
Sean Corrigan , the chief investment strategist at Diapason Commodities Management in Switzerland , said : " For the UK to have this default rating is in some ways ludicrous but the market is using these instruments to express a view about the relative standing of certain countries .
This has taken off as the domestic financial situation has got worse and the steps taken by the fiscal and monetary authorities have become more irresponsible . "
The Bank of England has made an about - turn since September by slashing interest rates three times to 2 per cent , the lowest since 1951 , with markets speculating that rates could hit zero as the authorities try to support the economy and ward off deflation .
Last month the Chancellor announced that the Government would bring forward spending and cut short - term taxes in a bid to prevent a long , deep recession .
The cash market for debt paints a different picture , with the UK deemed a safer bet than McDonald 's and other companies .
Analysts said that should in theory attract investors to " arbitrage " the difference between the two markets by betting on the UK in the CDS market .
" It looks daft , it is daft , but that is where the buyers and sellers are and the way business is getting done in the CDS market , " one analyst said .
Ascaron has adopted a unique DRM system for the PC version of Sacred 2 : Fallen Angel .
This allows the action - RPG to be installed as many times and on as many computers as you wish , but turns all of the unauthorised installations into timed demos lasting 24 hours .
During that period , all content within Sacred 2 will be on offer , as will the full suite of LAN multiplayer options .
Then eventually , when the free - time comes to an end , players will be asked if they want to buy the full version .
" We feel that consumers should have a right to choose , and this innovative system offers the perfect purchasing option for gamers , " said Heiko tom Felde , boss of developer Ascaron , in a statement .
" It 's a great system for family and friends , allowing everyone the opportunity to try out the game and play together , then making a purchase decision . "
Sacred 2 : Fallen Angel was released last Friday on PC , with PS3 and Xbox 360 versions expected early next year .

Jay Leno Not Retiring , Will Host NBC Prime Time Talk Show
Savvy NBC chief executiveis gambling that he can ' have his cake and eat it too ' .
Fearing that The Tonight Show hostwould sign on with ABC , Fox or Sony television studios after abdicating toin May 2009 , they created a new time slot for their cash cow .
Leno , who likely never intended to retire , will continue to broadcast from his long time Burbank studio location and will appear five night a week at 10:00 p.m. ET against CSI Miami , CSI : New York and Law & Order SVU , signing on for 46 shows per year .
He will do much of what he does now and will keep his monologue , do the headlines and his Jay Walking segment .
Conan O'Brien , who has been patiently waiting in the wings , will take over The Tonight Show in a different studio on the NBC Universal lot in May .
Will NBC 's little move essentially cut off his legs before he gets started ?
He 'll have a few months to establish himself before Leno flies out of the chute in the fall .
Work horse Leno , who does n't like much idle time , will have a three month hiatus to develop his new gig or cool his heels before picking up right where he left off .
The official NBC announcement is expected today .
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , will today announce a series of measures to tackle knife crime , following a spate of stabbings described as " shocking and tragic " by Gordon Brown .
The plan was finalised after the Prime Minister met the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , at Chequers yesterday to discuss the crisis .
Ms Smith has written to police chief constables to highlight their powers under the Violent Crime Reduction
Act to crack down on licensed premises that could be at the centre of unruly and criminal behaviour .
The police are to force pubs and clubs associated with knives or guns to search people on entry , under threat of losing their licences .
Trading standards officers are being told to step up test purchasing to stop sales of knives to under - 18s .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
People convicted of carrying a knife will be made to visit A&E departments to see the impact of stab wounds , and to meet families of victims , as well as those imprisoned for knife crime .
Youth forums will be extended to encourage young people to stay away from knives .
The new measures will focus on knife hotspots in London , the West Midlands , Manchester , Merseyside , Lancashire and Essex .
Ms Smith said : " I am absolutely shocked at the tragic and senseless loss of life we have seen recently .
I want to reassure everyone that the Government is taking the issue of knife crime very seriously . "
She added : " We must tackle this violence head - on .
That is why I am today outlining further tough measures , coupled with early intervention and support for parents . "
The Home Secretary has pledged to " increase the visibility of sentencing " for knife - related crime , in an attempt to reassure the public that the courts are coming down hard on offenders .
But she rejected calls from David Cameron to have all knife offenders sent to jail , saying : " It is simplistic and wrong to pretend that prison is an easy answer . "
The latest attempt to gain control of a crime that has provoked concern throughout the nation comes as the death toll from stabbings continues to rise , with the deaths of four people in a single day last week .
Figures from the British Crime Survey have revealed specific instances of knife crime for the first time .
Although maintaining that " recorded crime statistics show that knife crime is broadly stable " , a Home Office spokesman admitted last night : " We have always recognised that figures do not tell the whole story . "
The shadow Home Secretary , Dominic Grieve , called the Government 's approach " staggeringly complacent " , saying : " As a result , violent crime has doubled , inflicting misery on too many victims .
All we have had is constant legislation . "
Meze is an abbreviation for Mezedes and in Cyprus it is oftentimes , different to typical appetizers , a meal in its own .
You have just to decide between vegetable , meat or fish meze .
Meze , what means ' little delicacies ' , can consist out of up to 30 different small plates with dips , vegetables and a wide range of fish or meat .
It is served in groups of 4 or 5 plates at a time and usually 5 to 10 different groups arrive at the table .
Although in different tavernas , different dishes are served , there is a kind of pattern in it .
Olives , taramosalata , hummus and yoghurt are followed by vegetables like eggplants or zucchini .
Afterwards small meat or fish dishes are served before whole fish or grills arrive at the table .
As the pattern remains the same , the dishes served depend on the speciality of the taverna as well as the season .

I did a terrifying , devastating , and perhaps foolish thing today .
I permanently deleted my entire music collection .
You probably do n’t understand what this means .
Let me explain .
Remember my post about how my lust for music was taking over my life ?
I was constantly consuming music , illegally and to the loss of about 50 hours a week , so I decided to stop consuming music altogether .
That lasted two days .
Then I started consuming music faster than ever before .
I recently downloaded , cataloged , and previewed more than 60 albums in a single day .
I love music so much , and have such easy access to it that I could n’t stop .
My addiction is unhealthy and wasteful , and is keeping me from being the man God is calling me to be .
And like a drug , it makes me feel very good but is keeping me from being truly , deeply filled with joy .
So I deleted it all .
Over 5,000 albums , most obscure and difficult to find .
Truly , my life ’s work .
The product of thousands of hours of passionate hunting , reading , discussing , trading , and writing .
Mostly stolen albums , hundreds of free and legitimate albums , and hundreds of albums I paid for properly .
All gone .
Forever .
I knew I could n’t take the time to sort out the ones that were free or rightly purchased ; that would still leave me with a very large collection and a wide open door for the temptation to build again on that collection .
No , in order to free myself , I had to totally devastate myself .
I knew this was an area of my life I had not surrendered to God .
Now I seek the simple path of daily brokenness before God .
Did I make the right choice ?
I do n’t know .
I begged God to tell me what to do , but I could n’t hear him .
So I did the thing that seemed most pure , most beautiful .
My decision may have been stupid , but I hope God considers that I did it with good intentions .
How do I feel ?
Awful .
I weep now as I type this , because I just threw away thousands of hours of intense pleasure .
Nothing stirs my emotions like good music , and I had a limitless supply of it just a few minutes ago .
Now it is all gone , and it seems a cold world that awaits me without it .
Imagine the thing you love the most , the thing that keeps you going through the week , the thing that comforts you when you hurt , the thing that excites you to no end .
Then imagine it suddenly and completely gone .
I do n’t recall ever asking my readers for prayer before , but I ask it now .
Please pray that I will remain faithful and not steal music ever again , that I will keep music surrendered to God , that I will fill the gaping hole left behind with the presence of God , and that I will continue to surrender other parts of my being to Christ ’s lordship .
Breathe , Luke .
Just breathe .
It ’s gonna be okay .
A few years ago , researchers at Harvard University and UC Berkeley published a rather interesting study about phishing .
After running a usability study to see how well people can detect phishing attempts , they found that :
23 % of the study 's participants did not look at the address bar , status bar , or the security indicators
68 % proceeded without hesitation when presented with popup warnings about fraudulent certificates
90 % were fooled by good phishing websites .
Neither education , age , sex , previous experience , nor hours of computer use showed a statistically significant correlation with vulnerability to phishing .
To make matters worse , the study 's participants were actually trying not to get tricked .
" Our study primed participants to look for spoofs , " the researches explain , " thus , these participants are likely better than ' real - world ' ( un - primed ) users at detecting fraudulent web sites . "
Clearly , phishing is a very serious problem and anyone , anywhere could be vulnerable .
Jeff Anderson , the CIO of Auburn University at Montgomery , knew this , and sent out an email warning all students and faculty to be on the lookout for phishing activity .
From : Jeff W. Anderson , Ph.D .
To : Everyone
Priority : High
Subject : Email Phishing Warning
We have noticed an increase in phishing attempts , similar to the message below .
AUM will never request that you provide you user name and password in an e-mail .
You should not provide any private information , including passwords , through e-mail .
Here is an example of a recent phishing attempt :
-------------------------------------------
Subject : ATTENTION : EDU WEBMAIL SUBSCRIBER : ATTENTION : EDU WEBMAIL SUBSCRIBER :
This mail is to inform all our {EDU WEBMAIL} users that we will be upgrading our site in a couple of days from now .
So you as a Subscriber of our site you are required to send us your Email account details so as to enable us know if you are still making use of your mail box .
Further informed that we will be deleting all mail account that is not functioning so as to create more space for new user .
so you are to send us your mail account details which are as follows : * User name : * Password : Failure to do this will immediately render your email address deactivated from our database .
Your response should be send to the following e-mail address .
( end of phishing example ) -------------------------------------------
Other phishing attempts include messages that appear to have been sent from financial institutions or companies such as Microsoft .
Your financial institution will never ask you to provide your account information through e-mail , and Microsoft does not send out updates through e-mail .
When you receive these types of messages , you should delete them and not respond .
It is also a good practice to avoid clicking on any links in suspicious e-mail messages .
If you feel you have been a victim of a phishing scheme regarding your AUM account , please contact the ITS Help Desk at 244-3500 or helpdesk@aum.edu
Thank you , Jeff W. Anderson , Ph.D.

Obviously , a single email wo n't prevent all phishing scams -- especially the advanced variety that links convincing websites -- but it should at least remind people to never , ever email their password .
Right ?
Not so much .
A few days later , Jeff was forced to send an update to his previous email .
From : Jeff W. Anderson , Ph.D .
To : Everyone
Priority : High
Subject : Phishing Update
I would like to stress , again , that you should NEVER send your user name and password to ANYONE through email .
If you receive a request for this information , it is most likely an attempt to use your account for fraudulent purposes .
In my previous alert , I included the text of a phishing email as an example .
Some students misunderstood that I was asking for user name and password , and replied with that information .
Please be aware that you should n’t provide this information to anyone .
If you do receive an email requesting your credentials , please call the help desk at 244-3500 , or forward the email to helpdesk@aum.edu .
Do not reply to the message , even if it states that you account will be disabled .
I apologize for the confusion .
Thank you , Jeff W. Anderson , Ph.D .

Thanks to AUM student Justin for passing this along
CFI Forum Rules ×
The CFI Forum is operated by the Center for Inquiry , a nonprofit educational and advocacy organization .
The Forum supports the interests of CFI by creating an online community of supporters and interested inquirers into CFI ’s areas of concern , which can be generally described as advancing the enlightenment project , fostering an evidence - based , scientific outlook and humanist values .
CFI FORUM RULES
( Preamble )
There are rules to participating on this Forum , and there are volunteer and / or CFI - employed Moderators and Administrators whose task it is to enforce these rules , aid in conversation , and otherwise support Forum functioning , as they see fit .
Moderators have the sole authority to make such decisions .
Their decisions regarding Forum policy are not open for a vote among Forum members , nor open to protracted debate .
Those looking for unmoderated discussions should look to unmoderated forums on Usenet and the Web .
In the opinion of CFI and its Forum Moderators , however , the most congenial and fruitful places for internet discussion and inquiry , especially concerning the topics CFI focuses on , are those which are capably moderated .
(1) Moderators ’/ Administrators ’ Roles : Moderators ( which includes Administrators in the following ) of the CFI Forum have the responsibility to enforce the Forum rules listed here .
They are also empowered to act so as to improve the general well being of the Forum and its community .
Therefore , be aware that Moderators are allowed to take all necessary and appropriate actions , up to and including the editing or deleting of problem posts and the banning of problem members .
Moderators answer for their official actions to their fellow Moderators and to staff at CFI .
Generally speaking , Moderators will try to provide fair warning about behavior that might require their action , either on the Forum or through email or private message .
At all times , failure to respond to and heed warnings from Moderators is grounds for banning from the Forum .
Moderators will use blue lettering to distinguish official posts ( warnings , etc. ) they make on the Forum from posts which are made in their unofficial capacity as fellow members .
Note that Moderators may not be aware of all activity occurring on the Forum .
If there is something you feel needs Moderator attention , please send a concise Private Message or email including a description of the issue and the URL of the associated post or thread .
Moderator decisions on any topic may be delayed , perhaps by several days .
(2) Members ’ Roles :
The CFI Forum is open to anyone willing to abide by the Forum Rules .
We welcome reasoned discussion , debate and disagreement , so long as it is in an objective spirit of inquiry and does not become disruptive as described below in the sections on problem threads , posts and members .
(3) Problem threads and posts are subject to editing , deletion , closure , or being locked for further discussion .
The decision to leave any thread open and available is at the discretion of Moderators , in their capacity as responsible stewards of Forum functioning .
Members re-starting conversations in closed or locked threads are subject to warning and / or termination , for being “ problem members ” .
Some examples of problem threads and posts follow in ( a ) -( h ) :
( a) Spam is not allowed on the CFI Forum and will be deleted immediately .
New members should avoid posting promotional links , as they will likely be viewed as spam .
( b) Duplicate or multiple posts on the same topic are subject to deletion .
Please attempt to keep threads on topic , and attempt to keep topics in active threads rather than beginning new ones .
Moderators will merge threads with similar topics and split threads that stray .
( c) Publishing material under copyright is only allowed as per “ Fair Use ” rules .
Members should not copy entire articles under copyright to the forum , but instead quote a few sentences and provide a link .
(d) Publishing private messages , emails or other correspondence without permission from the authors is not allowed .
( e) “ Trolling ” is not allowed .
This includes posting derogatory or inflammatory messages with the intent to bait an overheated response , as well as behavior that in the Moderators ’ judgement is gratuitously argumentative , combative , or inflammatory with the apparent intent to prolong debate for its own sake rather than promote , defend , or critique a particular idea or point of view .
( f) Threads and posts are not allowed that in the opinion of Moderators are impolite , vulgar , nasty , uncivil , or otherwise disruptive to the good functioning of the either the Forum or to CFI ’s mission .
Free inquiry is only possible if we maintain civility .
Abuse of forum members will not be permitted .
In particular , abuse of Moderators for performing their responsibilities will not be permitted .
What constitutes abuse will be determined by Moderators on a case - by - case basis , however in general it amounts to any racist , sexist , homo - sexist , threatening , harassing , or other personally offensive , vulgar or derogatory comments .
Abuse would include so - called hate speech and fighting words .
Generally speaking , inflammatory , hyperbolic or overly emotive rhetoric is the sign of a troll and should be avoided on the CFI Forum .
This community exists , first and foremost , to foster inquiry .
Inquiry does not flourish in an atmosphere of heated rhetoric , mutual vilification or recrimination .
Disagreements should be kept , as much as possible , to the issues at hand and not become overly personalized .
To take but one example , pointing out a person ’s lack of scientific qualifications when discussing scientific issues is on - point , but referring to someone ’s political beliefs is not .
Since they risk degenerating into flame wars , abusive forum threads or posts are subject to immediate editing or deletion .
(g) Threads and posts that are disruptive to the flow of conversation by being off - topic , or which in the opinions of Moderators were written to drive up a post - count or otherwise not relevant to the mission of CFI and its Forum are not allowed .
They are subject to locking , editing or deletion .
(h) Threads that consist of repetitive posting of the same comments , information , or links without meaningful development or responsive discussion will be considered a form of spamming or trolling and may be locked or deleted at the Moderators ’ discretion .
(4) Problem members are subject to banning or deletion .
The decision to allow any member to post is entirely at the discretion of Forum Moderators , in their capacity as responsible stewards of Forum functioning .
What constitutes a problem member is up to Moderator discretion .
Some examples of problem members follow in ( a ) -( e ) :
( a) Members who regularly engage in problem posting .
( b) Members who regularly engage in abusive , nasty or disruptive behavior ; or who display a pattern of hostile , antagonistic and uncooperative behavior with Moderators and / or membership .
( c) Members who engage in large - scale or frequent deletion of prior posts without due cause .
Deleting prior posts disrupts the flow of threads , and makes it difficult or impossible to follow past discussions .
Members wishing to remove more than a very small number of posts , or posts more than a few days old , should discuss this with Moderators by email or Private Message before doing so .
Reasonable cases will be accommodated .
While members are allowed infrequent deletion of problem posts , large - scale deletions without good cause may lead to warning or banning , at the discretion of Forum Moderators .
(d) Members who use more than one username on the Forum .
Members are allowed a single username .
“ Sock puppets ” ( multiple usernames hiding a single person ) are not allowed and will be banned or deleted .
Members engaging in such behavior will be considered problem members and are themselves subject to warning or banning .
(e) Members who have been banned or deleted from the Forum are not allowed to re-register under different usernames .
Such re-registry may result in immediate deletion of the new account , and deletion of all associated new posts .
(5) In the opinion of CFI and for the purposes of this Forum , “ humanism ” is to be interpreted broadly .
Anyone self - identifying as a humanist should be so considered .
Discussions as to which Forum members are humanists is discouraged , and continued denigration and harassment of self - described humanist Forum members in that light is considered disruptive to CFI ’s mission and to that of CFI ’s Forum .
(6) Users may express their disagreements with the decisions or actions of Moderators , but disagreements , criticisms and the like may be discussed in the Issues & Complaints Forum ONLY .
( You must read the instructions at the top of that Forum before making complaints there ) .
Any such discussions not taking place within the I & C Forum are considered off - topic , and as such are subject to moving , locking or deletion , at the discretion of Moderators .
(7) These Forum Rules are subject to revision and updating at any time , as appropriate .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks rose on Friday on hopes that a lifeline for struggling U.S. automakers could still materialize , while investors bet the large stockpiles in cash at technology companies will help them weather the economic downturn .
In the latest in the U.S. automakers ’ attempt to secure a financial rescue , the White House said it could be willing to provide emergency funding to the struggling auto industry , the day after Congress failed to approve a deal .
Gains by the Nasdaq outpaced the other two major indexes
as investors scooped up big - cap technology shares .
Apple helped lift the Nasdaq , rising more than 3 percent .
This year , the Nasdaq is down 42 percent , underperforming the Dow ’s drop of about 35 percent .
“ The expectation is that tech will be one of the first , not the last of the sectors to rebound , ” said Michael James , senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles .
James pointed out that investors have shrugged off disappointing news from technology companies , including Texas Instruments TXN.N .
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 64.59 points , or 0.75 percent , to end at 8,629.68 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX added 6.14 points , or 0.70 percent , to 879.73 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC jumped 32.84 points , or 2.18 percent , to 1,540.72 .
The day ’s gains come as the broad market has been trying to recover from the S&P 500 ’s 11 - year intraday low hit on November 21 .
During the course of the day , the three major U.S. stock indexes rebounded from a drop of about 2 percent or more at the open .
So far this year , the broad S&P 500 is down about 40 percent .
But since the November low , the S&P has pulled itself back up almost 19 percent .
For the week , the Dow was down 0.1 percent , its second straight week of declines .
But the S&P was up 0.4 percent for the week and the Nasdaq rose 2.1 percent .
Investor confidence took another hit with the arrest of former Nasdaq Chairman Bernard Madoff , who was charged with running a $ 50 billion “ Ponzi scheme ” in what would be one of the largest fraud cases ever .
Uncertainty over the fate of automakers kept shares of GM and Ford vacillating between positive and negative territory .
Ford ended up 4.8 percent at $ 3.04 , while GM lost 4.4 percent to $ 3.94 .

GM , Ford and Chrysler employ nearly 250,000 people directly and 100,000 more jobs at parts suppliers could depend on their survival .
The industry fears the failure of one Detroit manufacturer could drag down the other two .
The Nasdaq 's major gainers included iPhone and iPod maker Apple AAPL.O , up 3.4 percent at $ 98.27 , while Intel INTC .
O gained 5.3 percent to $ 14.75 .
Among blue - chip stocks , United Technologies Corp UTX.N was the Dow 's biggest boost , a day after the diversified manufacturer gave some reassuring comments on its outlook .
United Technologies ' shares rose 3.7 percent to $ 48.82 on the New York Stock Exchange .
On the downside , Boeing Co BA.N was the Dow 's biggest drag , falling 2.7 percent to $ 39.20 a day after the large U.S. aircraft manufacturer said it was delaying its 787 Dreamliner jet for the fourth time .
Volume was low on the New York Stock Exchange , with about 1.44 billion shares changing hands , below last year ’s estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion , while on Nasdaq , about 1.91 billion shares traded , below last year ’s daily average of 2.17 billion .
Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of about 3 to 2 , while on the Nasdaq , two stocks rose for every one that fell .
Racial tension runs so deep in the Long Island community rocked by an immigrant ’s murder last weekend that it ’s even scrawled on a sign just 30 yards from the entrance to the high school .
There , the hate - filled word “ spic ” is crudely scrawled on a stop sign outside Patchogue - Medford HS , where seven teens charged in the brutal , racially charged stabbing death of an Ecuadorian immigrant are students .
Two years ago , school officials had to impose lockdowns after a series of racial brawls erupted between newly immigrated Hispanic students and their white and black classmates .
Witnesses say chief slay suspect Jeffrey Conroy was at the center of many of them .
“ Jeff was involved in a lot of those fights .
I think maybe that got him thinking like this , ” said an ex-girlfriend , who asked to remain anonymous .
“ He had plenty of black and Turkish friends , as well as some Hispanics , but he had a particular problem with illegal immigrants . ”
She said she broke things off with Conroy when she noticed he had a small swastika tattoo on his thigh .
When she confronted him about it , he said , “ It ’s what I believe in . ”
Conroy and his cohorts hatched the horrific plot to go “ beaner jumping ” – a derogatory reference to Central Americans – as they drank with others at Southaven County Park on Saturday night , a close friend , Michelle Cassidy , 16 , told The Post .
But as most went home , Conroy and his six buddies drove around until they encountered Marcello Lucero , 37 , and a friend as they walked down the street .
The teens surrounded them , and Conroy allegedly plunged a blade into Lucero ’s chest .
Cassidy insisted that Conroy had friends of all races , and she could n’t see how this was a racial slaying .
“ It just is n’t , ” the teen said outside the school yesterday .
The killing has shaken the area to the core .
“ There is a lot of racism out here , ” said 14 - year - old Jonathan Campoverde as he walked past a memorial to Lucero .
“ People are afraid of walking down the street – little kids now . ”
Recently , residents said a pack of menacing teens had been harassing Hispanics walking down Main Street in Patchogue , screaming epithets and telling them to “ get the f- – – out of here . ”
Back at the school , many said they were hoping the hostility would subside .
“ There was a lot of racial tension .
It was bad .
There were fights in the school .
There were a lot of lockdowns , but we took strong measures against it , and it improved , ” said one school - board member .
But yesterday , school officials locked the campus down once again , and Suffolk County cops were stationed around the campus .
Principal Manuel Sanzone held special assemblies with each class , appealing for unity , students said .
Meanwhile , the Secret Service opened an investigation into racist graffiti spray - painted on more than two dozen vehicles , including messages targeting President - elect Barack Obama in nearby Mastic .
At least one car had “ Kill Obama ” painted on it .
Suffolk County cops are also investigating reports by several Islip Terrace residents that Ku Klux Klan literature was left on their property Monday .

Federal investigators are looking into allegations that a longtime friend and benefactor tried to steer money to U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman , the Pioneer Press has learned .
Agents with the FBI have talked to or made efforts to talk to people in Texas familiar with the allegations , according to a source familiar with the situation .
Houston is where the first of two lawsuits was filed alleging Nasser Kazeminy , a Bloomington financier , tried to steer $ 100,000 to Coleman via his wife ’s Minneapolis employer .
The second suit , filed in Delaware , alleges Kazeminy initially tried to get money directly to the senator .
Both Coleman and Kazeminy have denied any wrongdoing , and Coleman last month said he welcomes an investigation .
Neither Coleman nor his office has been contacted by the FBI , spokesman LeRoy Coleman said Tuesday morning .
“ We have not been contacted by any law enforcement or investigative authority on this matter , ” he said .
On Tuesday evening , Coleman ’s campaign released the following statement : “ We are not aware of any investigation that is under way , nor have we been contacted by any agency with respect to this matter .
As we have said repeatedly , we welcome any investigation of these lawsuits by the appropriate authorities to get to the bottom of these baseless , sleazy and politically inspired allegations . ”
The campaign provided no evidence for the claim that the allegations are “ politically inspired . ”
Kazeminy has declined repeated requests for interviews and has not commented since releasing a one - page statement Nov. 8 flatly denying “ false and baseless claims . ”
When asked Tuesday evening whether Kazeminy had been contacted by investigators , spokeswoman Amy Rotenberg said : “ We have no information along those lines .
What you ’re telling me is news to me . ”
The breadth of the FBI probe is unclear .
Several individuals involved in the lawsuits and their attorneys either declined to comment or could n’t be reached for comment .
FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap , a spokeswoman with the agency ’s Houston office , said , “ We do not confirm or deny the existence of any investigations . ”
The FBI has jurisdiction over some cases of fraud , such as those alleged in the lawsuits .
The lawsuits , filed in the week prior to the Nov. 4 election , surround a Houston - based oil - drilling maintenance company known as Deep Marine , which is controlled by Kazeminy .
They allege a host of improprieties , including that Kazeminy tried improperly to send Deep Marine money Coleman ’s way for no legitimate reason .
One suit was filed by the company ’s founder and former CEO , Paul McKim , in a sworn affidavit .
McKim , a Republican , has repeatedly denied his claim is politically motivated , and the Coleman campaign has provided no evidence to the contrary .
The second lawsuit , by Deep Marine investors , names McKim as a defendant but makes essentially the same allegations , citing a “ confidential informant . ”
They allege Kazeminy forged a sham contract with the Hays Cos. , a Minneapolis insurer that contracts with Coleman ’s wife , Laurie Coleman .
Laurie Coleman is a licensed insurance broker in Minnesota .
Hays has confirmed that she worked for them and that they contracted with Deep Marine .
Hays has denied any wrongdoing , calling the Deep Marine contract legitimate , but has declined to provide details .
Hays has said Laurie Coleman did n’t work on the Deep Marine contract .
An attorney for Hays could n’t be reached Tuesday evening .
Neither lawsuit alleges the money actually made it to Coleman or that the Colemans knew about the alleged plan .
The suits allege McKim and another company officer were told by Kazeminy that the money was for Coleman .
According to the suits , three installments of $ 25,000 each were paid to Hays , and McKim stopped a fourth .
Coleman has declined to release any information surrounding his wife ’s work for Hays outside of what is required by Senate disclosure rules , which does n’t include her income .
Kazeminy ’s ties to Coleman date back at least to Coleman ’s days as mayor of St. Paul .
In Senate disclosure forms , Coleman has reported receiving the following gifts of more than $ 305 from Kazeminy : a private plane trip with Coleman ’s daughter valued at $ 3,960 on Feb. 21 , 2005 , and a private plane trip with his wife valued at $ 2,870 on May 27 , 2004 .
Such gifts were legal because they were properly reported .
The race between Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken remains undecided , while the state awaits results of a hand recount in the extremely narrow November vote .

Back in March , right before I started the first food storage class , I wrote this post , analyzing the problems likely to face us if we suddenly needed to start growing our own food .
I argued that if we faced a Depression or major disruption of the food supply , we ’d find it very difficult to ramp up seed production rapidly for home gardeners .
I wrote :
The home garden trade is a small subset of the seed trade , and the serious home gardening / small farming trade a vastly smaller subset even of that .
The majority of home gardeners start comparatively few seeds – they purchase pre-started flats of vegetables instead of seeds .
I ’m consistently amazed to see things that are grown from seed incredibly easily – lettuce , for example , in flats , and being bought like wildfire .
So the majority of home gardeners have little experience planting seeds at all – carrots , perhaps and peas , and that ’s probably about it .
Although slightly off my main topic , this is something worth noting – even most experienced gardeners may have almost no experience growing food from seeds .
Of gardeners who do start seeds , the vast majority – more than 90 % of them – do not order from seed catalogs and companies that specialize in home garden seeds , they get their seeds from seed racks in garden centers , supermarkets , Walmarts and other places .
And the majority of seed companies that sell through these seed racks are not deeply invested in producing high quality seed .
According to Steve Solomon , founder of Territorial Seeds and author of _Gardening When It Counts_ the vast majority of seed sales involve simply the purchase of bulk seed , often from foreign distributors , and repackaging of that seed without variety trials , often without germination tests , and with little consideration of what is adapted to particular regions .
In many cases , the cheapest varieties of bulk seeds will have off - types , because hybridization often requires labor - intensive hand pollinating in the field , and high cost is n’t what such companies are after .
Solomon also notes that many companies use extremely poor quality seed , even sweepings from the seed floor , in cheap packets to be sold in commercial garden centers .
Those 10 cent packages of seed you see in various places may not actually even have 10 cents worth of seed in them .
Only about 10 % of the home garden seed trade is focused on high quality vegetable seed production , mostly by mail order .
These are the seed catalogs whose seed will have the germination percentages they claim .
These are the people who will replace your packet that does have poor germination , and who will ensure vigorous seed with varities tested for your region – but it is important to remember that they do serve a tiny percentage of the total seed sales in the US , and they are not necessarily prepared to serve a vast increase in need .
In an agricultural transition period , when people start running short of food , what they will want are seeds that are viable ( that is , they are not too old and have been stored well , and thus , will grow ) , vigorous ( that is , they grow well and do n’t produce weak plants vulnerable to disease and pests ) , high yielding ( that is , they produce a lot of whatever crop we are seeking ) , are adapted to their climate and to small scale food production ( that is , they were n’t selected for commercial production , or primarily for shipping ability and they grow well where we ’re growing food ) , available in fairly large quantities ( most home gardeners buy a packet or two of each thing , but if you are feeding yourself from your garden , or making succession crops , or selling at market , you ’ll find you need much more seed ) , and reasonably priced ( that is , you can afford to buy it , or you can save seed and only buy it once ) .
Most of the home garden seed trade may produce seed that has some of these qualities , maybe even all of them .
But only a small percentage is focused on ensuring that all these requirements are met .
Assuming that , for example , we were to see food shortages in 2009 , and a widespread agricultural transition beginning in 2010 , how long would it take to ramp up an adequate seed supply that would serve small scale market gardeners and home food producers , and meet the above requirements ?
Well , first of all , we could expect to see serious shortages in 2010 .
That year , seed suppliers would be unable to meet demand – they have been expecting less than 5 % of the American population to plant any kind of garden , most of them flower gardens , and they simply do n’t have enough spare production capacity to meet present needs .
This is particularly likely if the biofuels boom is continuing , and there is no leeway in the demand for seed among commercial farmers that might be sold to home gardeners .
Imagining that 10 - 20 % of the population begins to garden in 2010 and existing home gardeners expand their production , we can expect seed prices to skyrocket , availability to fall , and many people to have to rely on seed packets that do n’t meet the above requirements – that is , seed packets that have been kept in heated supermarkets and thus have reduced viability , or those routinely placed outside where they get wet and are exposed to repeated freezing and thawing , or were of low quality to begin with .
So not only will the seed trade come up short , but some of what will be sold will be seed that was never of a quality likely to feed those who depend on them .
Yesterday afternoon , my Fedco Seed Catalog arrived – always my personal favorite .
And on page 6 , what should I see but this , in founder CR Lawn ’s description of their situation :
And now seed prices .
I ’ve ben 30 years in this business and these are the highest increases to us I ’ve ever seen .
The ethanol boom diverting land to corn production has ahd a tremendous impocat on farm commodity prices , including vegetable seeds .
Wholesale prices for pea and bean seed are up 30 - 50 % , for corn and squash , 20 % or more .
Even so , wholesalers could not find growers for all crops so several varieties are missing from our catalog .
Horrible growing weather this summer has exacerbated the shortage .
This follows on their best year ever , one in which demand for seed outgrew supply not only for Fedco , but for other seed companies – Pinetree Seeds , Johnny ’s Selected Seeds , Baker Creek Heirlooms and Territorial Seeds all reported dramatic increases in demand , and ran out of some varieties early .
A farmer I know who raises seed as her main crop reported that she was fielding calls from companies she ’s never dealt with before , trying to find stock .
I placed a late order to Fedco , only to find that nearly a quarter of my selections were already sold out .
It was inevitable that demand for land for ethanol should affect the seed trade – and because seeds are a lagging indicator – in the case of many biennial crops , one has to begin planning two year ahead – seed supplies are likely to remain affected for several years .
Moreover , the cost of inputs , including fertilizers remains high , and likely to affect seed production .
Farmers are among those most in danger of going out of business as credit lines get cut , and that includes seed growers .
Meanwhile economists are estimating month after month of a million US job losses .
My guess is that some of those millions of people are going to try and compensate for their lost income by growing some food .
We are likely to see more people trying to get ahold of seed – and already high prices , which will probably push some people out of the market .
My concern is that this is just one more sign of what I fear most in the Depression – the inability of food producers ( including seed growers ) to effectively connect with people who need food .
This was the crisis of the Depression – those who had food could n’t afford to get it directly to those who needed it , and both were impoverished by the failure of that connection .
Given that we rely heavily on industrial middlemen in giant Agribusiness corporations , this seems even more likely .
What can and should you do ?
Well , on a purely practical level , order early , and make space in your budget for higher seed costs if you can .
A lot of us put our seed catalogs aside until after the holidays – I wo n’t be doing that this year .
And consider donating extras to your local community garden – there will be more people who ca n’t afford seeds this year .
And make this the year you really commit to seriously learning how to save garden seeds – I know it seem strange to most middle class Americans , but the world is full of people who ca n’t afford to buy seeds every year , and we may be joining them .
Moreover , seed savers have seed to share with their neighbors , and are a link in our community food security .
Join www.seedsavers.org, and commit to taking responsibility for one variety that may be lost – an economic crisis means that some of the people who have been doing this work may need to do other work , so we need to pick up the slack .
Store your seed carefully , so that you make the best possible use of it .
Learn to start plants from seed – people on a budget can’t afford to waste money on transplants they can easily grow themselves .
Support small seed companies like the ones mentioned above , particularly those that emphasize open - pollinated seeds , and do extensive variety trials and testing – we ’re going to need them .
Do not allow them to be victims of the credit crisis .
If you farm , Fedco and likely others are seeking growers for seed varieties – this could be a win - win situation for people struggling to make money as farmers in this economy .
Most of all , pay attention to the little seed .
Like many other tiny things , it is far more important than most people realize .
The night before last , Barack Obama was elected to be the 44th President of the United States .
At 47 years of age , Obama will be the first president born in the same decade as Star Trek , so is he our first Trekkie President ?
There certainly are indications that he is .
TrekMovie takes a look at the case and at other Trek / Presidential connections from the past .
Obama : Trekkie President
The clearest evidence of Obama ’s Trekkie - cred comes from a speech in Wyoming he gave in March of this year when he spoke about NASA ( which became the subject of a TrekMovie editorial written by former Trek science advisor Andre Bormanis ) .
At the speech Obama stated :
I grew up on Star Trek .
I believe in the final frontier
There is also this passage from an recent Newsweek article on the ‘ Secrets of the 2008 Campaign .
The article recounts Obama speaking to his wife about an outfit she was wearing and making a Trek ref .
From the article :
" That ’s an interesting belt buckle , " he said to Michelle , mischievously .
She feigned offense and said , " I am interesting , next to you .
Surprise , surprise , a blue suit , a white shirt and a tie . "
Obama grinned and bent down until he was almost at eye level with her waist .
He jabbed a playful finger toward her belt buckle , and let loose his inner nerd .
" The lithium crystals !
Beam me up , Scotty ! "
Obama squeaked , laughing at his own lame joke as Michelle rolled her eyes .
And if that is not enough , then we have the word of Mr. Spock himself , Leonard Nimoy .
In an appearance on NPR ’s Wait Wait Do n’t Tell Me in September , Nimoy ( a long - time Obama supporter ) recounted the following story :
About a year and a half a go I was at a political event and one of our current campaigners for the office of President of the United States saw me , approached , and he gave me the Vulcan signal … it was not John McCain
Obama also mentioned
Trek when he appeared on a comedy tribute video as part of Bill Gates final CES Keynote as CEO of Microsoft .
The joke was that Bill Gates was calling up politicians now that he had time on his hands , for Obama ’s part he says " Bill ? Bill Shatner ?
From Star Trek ? " ( goto 5:50 in the video below )
In addition to Mr. Nimoy , many of the new Star Trek team are active supporters President - elect Obama .
JJ Abrams hosted and attended many Obama events and both Zachary Quinto ( the new Spock ) and Chris Pine ( the new Kirk ) actively campaigned for Obama over the last year .
In fact , Quinto sees a parallel with Obama ’s message and Trek ’s optimistic message , the actor was quoted in the recent Entertainment Weekly cover story :
This is a franchise that offers hope for unity — and so does Barack Obama … When this movie comes out , and Obama is president , hopefully there will be some parallels
Obama gives the Vulcan salute ( with some help from Photoshop )
There is one other Trek / Obama connection worth making and that is he may have the Borg to thank for his rise to power …really .
As TMZ explains , Obama glided to an easy election to the US Senate in 2004 after a scandal involving Jeri Ryan ( Voyager ’s 7of9 ) and her former husband Jack Ryan forced him out of the race .
Other Presidential Treks
While various Star Trek episodes and movies have mentioned U.S. Presidents ( the Enterprise episode " Storm Front II " featured nearly every modern President , Star Trek VI revealed the Vulcans have a proverb about Nixon , and John Kennedy ’s words are in the teaser trailer for 2009 ’s feature film ) , Star Trek and the U.S. Presidency have many interesting non fiction connections .
President Gerald Ford ( President 1974 - 1977 )
When NASA rolled out their first space shuttle " Enterprise " on September 17 , 1976 , the creator and crew of the fictional starship USS Enterprise was there .
President Ford had been persuaded by 200,000 letters from Americans ( in a campaign organized by famous Trekkie Bjo Trimble ) to change the name of the shuttle from " Constitution " to " Enterprise " to honor the influence of the television show on science .
Gene Roddenberry and his TOS crew with the USS Enterprise shuttle
President Ronald Reagan ( President 1981 - 1989 )
According to his own diary , during the weekend of June 23 - 24 , 1984 , President Reagan watched Star Trek III at the White House with friends and family .
He wrote " After dinner we ran " Star Trek III . "
It was n’t too good " .
In 1991 , then Former President Reagan visited the Star Trek : The Next Generation set during the filming of the episode " Redemption . "
When asked about Klingons , Reagan said " I like them .
They remind me of Congress . "

Almost Presidents Gore and Powell .
According to college roommate Tommy Lee Jones , speaking at the 2000 Democratic National Convention , former Vice President and former Presidential nominee Al Gore is a Star Trek fan .
According to Larry Nemecek ’s Star Trek The Next Generation Companion , General Colin Powell ( Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staffs , and later the Secretary of State and once considered a possible Presidential nominee ) also visited the TNG sets during its third season , and was there when Gene Roddenberry gave his military bars to actor Wil Wheaton .
More on Trek and Presidents :
Two environmental activists were detained by the Tennessee Valley Authority police for photographing the site of last weeks ash spill .
While it does not appear that they will be charged with crimes , they were unable to document the ash spill ’s effects on the area and its water supply .
[ social_buttons ]
The men , who are from the Knoxville based United Mountain Defense , say that TVA has yet to release the water toxicity results .
They say they have the right to take their own measurements and photographs unless TVA shows their results .
“ This is an issue of national importance , ” said David Cooper .
“ People need to know if the water is safe or not . ”
The environmental disaster , which covered 400 acres in ash , has demonstrated the fragility of supposed ecological safeguards .
It begs the question of whether or not we can trust the same people who created the problem to give us accurate information about the disaster ’s clean up and aftermath .
The activists said that they will take their water samples and run the required tests .
While the men were let go and forced to leave the premises after an hour of detainment , in some ways our collective rights were infringed upon .
If we can not simply gather data without being harassed by police , then what actions can we freely and safely take ?

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
If you have used your credit card thus far only for financial transactions , you ’ve barely scratched the functional surface of the little devil .
Of course , your credit card is first and foremost a payment instrument , designed to make purchases and withdraw cash from ATMs .
Few of us will ever ask more of it .
But in a pinch , when other , more suitable tools are nowhere to be found , this 3-3/8ths - by - 2-1/8ths - inch wafer of rigid yet flexible PVC laminate can prove a pretty handy substitute .
Credit cards have a number of physical characteristics that make them unusually well suited to a handful of alternative tasks : they are lightweight , thin , compact , waterproof , machine “ true ” and impervious to heat and cold .
Physically , they perform well in the midrange where hard materials such as metal and stone are too hard and soft materials such as wood and cardboard are too soft for the given job .
You may never have occasion to put your credit card to any of these 10 creative uses , but is n’t it nice to know it will serve you admirably in a pinch ?
Ice scraper
I am absolutely convinced that ice scrapers disappear into the same parallel universe that swallows dryer socks .
Fortunately , any credit card in your wallet , though lacking a handle to keep your fingers from freezing , can prove a handy substitute scraper .
As a scraper , it features a choice of dual firm ( wide ) or flexible ( narrow ) blades that wo n’t scratch your windshield , and embossed numerals for a firmer grip .
This improvised friend has proven so useful that it spawned a whole industry of wallet - sized scrapers , now with serrated edges ( are you listening , Visa ? ) .
This may not be the fastest way to get the job done , but it sure beats driving with your head out the window .

Italian cheese grater
Although we must blame a certain amount of Chianti for this inspiration , it turns out that in a fix — say , an Italian dinner party to which a cheese grater was not invited — the embossed numerals and lettering on a credit card serve as the perfect tool to render wedges of hard cheeses like Romano and parmesan into fine if somewhat funky cheese dust .
I know ; I could n’t believe it either .
Try it — but be sure to wash the card first !
Paint masking
Paint masking tools have the uncanny ability to always come in the wrong size , usually much too long and / or awkwardly designed to do what you need them to do .
Even pros have been known to resort to the handy credit card in tight spaces and close quarters for a nice clean trim line without need of a chiropractic adjustment .
Unlock doors
Firm yet flexible , credit cards seem particularly well designed to ease open doorknob wedge bolts and spring lever latches on sliding doors .
They ’re also a handy way to determine if a deadbolt is in place , which will usually scotch any progress you might make on the knob or latch .
Bookmark
Granted , true bookmark emergencies are pretty rare .
But let ’s say for argument ’s sake you ’re poolside at a clothing - optional resort without a bar napkin in sight .
Voila !
Your credit card will hold your place nicely without drawing undue attention to itself .
Straightedge
What ’s with rulers , huh ?
These foot - long sticks are so ungainly they usually wind up in dust - bunny land behind the filing cabinet or printer stand .
In a pinch , grab your credit card instead to create a nice straight , albeit short , line .
Grout / caulking tool
Do-it - yourselfers will attest to the versatility of a credit card for tight - space maneuvers in kitchen and bath tile projects .
Not only is the credit card form factor nearly the perfect tool for extracting old grout in between thinly spaced tiles , its rounded edge also provides a smooth , uniform convex finish to new caulking around sinks , tubs and shower enclosures .
Cake knife
Let ’s return to that hypothetical ( I swear ) Italian dinner party , shall we ?
Having completed the dinner course , our utensil - challenged hosts suddenly find themselves without a proper cake knife to cut and serve the hypothetical Mardi Gras King Cake with its lucky little plastic baby baked inside .
This is a job for a well - scrubbed AmEx Gold Card , although one best accomplished in the privacy of the kitchen .
Guitar pick
If you ’re a guitar player , chances are you ’ve found two emergency substitutes for a flat pick over the years : a credit card and a matchbook .
The advantage to the former is , you ’re unlikely to set your ax on fire while recreating a Foo Fighters set .
Finger splint
No , this idea did not spring from a recent viewing of “ Saw V. ” Finger in a jam ?
Immobilize it with your Discover card .
Not only is a credit card the proper length to protect most adult flanges , it ’s wide enough to include an adjacent finger or two to further immobilize and protect the damaged digit .
Plus , once you reach medical attention , you ’ll already have your credit card handy !

Defending those sales has become more difficult as Sun ’s customers on Wall Street curtailed their technology spending because of the financial turmoil .
Sun is more dependent on Wall Street business than rivals like I.B.M. , Hewlett - Packard and Dell .
“ We were certainly the first to enter this , ” Mr. Schwartz said , “ and I would like to believe we will be the first to exit it . ”
Late last month , Sun reported a first - quarter loss of $ 1.68 billion and a 7 percent year - over - year drop in revenue to $ 2.99 billion .
At the time , Sun cautioned that it would probably reorganize to bring costs in line .
While Sun has talked of a “ new reality , ” its investors have been reacting to the company ’s larger issues for some time .
Sun ’s shares have lost more than 80 percent of their value in the last year , reducing the company ’s market value to $ 3 billion .
In its last fiscal year , Sun posted revenue of $ 13.8 billion and has $ 2 billion in cash .
Southeastern Asset Management , an investment firm based in Memphis , has increased its stake in Sun to more than 20 percent in the last year .
Recently , it disclosed an intention to talk with Sun ’s management and possibly other companies about the ways to make the most of Sun ’s assets , which include a vast software intellectual property portfolio .
In addition , Relational Investors , founded by the activist investor Ralph V. Whitworth , has purchased close to 15 million shares of Sun since the end of June , giving it close to a 3 percent stake in the company .
Mr. Schwartz maintained that these large Sun investors agree with the company ’s strategy .
“ I just met with Ralph , ” Mr. Schwartz said .
“ We ’re all focused on the same thing . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- A
House committee trying to uncover the roots of the credit crisis on Tuesday grilled several former CEOs of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Members of the House Oversight Committee called into question documents from both firms that suggested executives took the companies down the risky and potentially disastrous road of buying huge amounts of subprime and other risky home loans .
" The companies made irresponsible investments that are now costing federal taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars , " said Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , committee chairman .
" Their own risk managers raised warning after warning about the dangers of investing heavily in the subprime and alternative mortgage market .
But these warnings were ignored . "
The panel heard from former Fannie chief executives Daniel Mudd and Franklin Raines ; former Freddie Mac CEOs Richard Syron and Leland Brendsel ; a former Fannie Mae chief credit officer .
Fannie and Freddie , publicly traded but federally backed companies , control or guarantee about $ 5 trillion in mortgage loans .
They purchase large amounts of home loans , bundle them together and divide them into securities that can be sold to investors .
The companies , which were taken under federal control in September , have drawn criticism for taking on too much risk , exacerbating the credit crisis when the housing market declined .
" Fannie and Freddie had a role or a primary role in this crisis , " said Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif .
" They gave people home ownership without telling them their personal dream could become their personal nightmare . "
Lawmakers repeatedly referred to a 2005 Fannie Mae memo outlining future corporate strategy .
The document acknowledged that more private investors were investing in risky loans , and it spelled out the potential consequences of taking on that risk .
" The risk in the environment has accelerated dramatically , " the document stated .
The document laid out Fannie 's options .
If it stayed the course , the company would " maintain our strong credit discipline . "
But if it met the market , the company would " accept higher risk and higher volatility of earnings " and could face " higher credit losses " and " increased exposure to unknown risks . "
Waxman said the document shows that Fannie executives made unwise decisions .
But he also put blame on lenders , who he said started the fire .
" The CEOs of Fannie and Freddie made reckless bets that led to the downfall of their companies , " Waxman said .
" But it is a myth to say they were the originators of the subprime crisis .
Fundamentally , they were following the market , not leading it . "
GSEs only performing their function
Some of the CEOs at the hearing argued that their actions may have added fuel to the fire , but they were n't the originators of the risky loan market .
Syron , CEO of Freddie Mac from 2003 until September 2008 , said Fannie and Freddie had to enter the non-traditional part of the market as the private lending sector shifted toward those kinds of mortgages .
" It is not at all surprising that these two firms would get hit hard by the biggest housing collapse in 75 years , " said Syron .
" If you are going to take the mission of promoting low - income lending seriously , then you are , by definition , going to take on a somewhat greater level of risk . "
Raines , the chief executive of Fannie Mae from 1999 to 2004 , said the roots of the credit crisis were in place long before the government sponsored enterprises , or GSEs , began buying up risky loans .
" Fannie Mae did not cause the current crisis , " said Raines .
" If anything , Fannie Mae played catch - up to the banks and investment banks who drove the securitization of the most toxic subprime mortgages . "
Raines said that while Fannie and Freddie hold some responsibility for not appropriately managing their own credit risk , regulators must share in the blame .
He argued that government officials -- he named the Federal Reserve , Federal Trade Commission , Department of Housing and Urban Development , among others -- were asleep at the switch .
The regulators , he said , failed to use their authority to put a stop to extremely dangerous lending practices .
" While regulations did not force financial institutions to make bad loans , the absence of consumer protection regulation allowed many bad loans to be made to the detriment of consumers , " he said .
Critical role in market
Fannie and Freddie serve a crucial role in keeping the housing market liquid , giving banks and lenders the ability to sell the loans they make in order to have the funds to make additional loans to consumers .
But the companies , trying to meet the competing interests of the greater market and their shareholders , began to buy up risky subprime and Alt - A loans , which were generally made without income verification .
When the housing bubble burst last year , the firms began rapidly losing money and eventually became unsustainable without government intervention .
As a result , the Treasury Department took over control of Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) on Sept. 7 , placing the firms in a conservatorship after it concluded the firms were facing rising losses from mortgage - backed securities .
The CEOs said they had differing views of what role Fannie and Freddie should serve in the home loan finance market going forward .
Daniel Mudd , chief executive of Fannie Mae from 2005 to 2008 suggested the companies be taken fully private or fully public .
" I would advocate moving GSEs out of No Man 's Land , " said Mudd .
" Events have shown how difficult it is to balance financial , capital , market , housing , shareholder , bondholder , homeowner , private , and public interests in a crisis of these proportions . "
Syron , however , said Fannie and Freddie should maintain their traditional status , but he advocated for reforms to allow the companies to remain solvent when the government ends its conservatorship .
" If you want to have long - term fixed rate mortgages , you need to have some mechanism like GSEs , " said Syron .
" But it is worth doing very thorough examination of the enterprises , examining their benefit to the market . "
Leland Brendsel , Freddie Mac CEO from 1985 to 2003 , said the most important action Congress can take - more pressing than GSE reform - is minimizing home foreclosures .
Nearly 1 million homes have been lost to foreclosure since the housing crisis hit in August 2007 , and the trend continues unabated .
" We need to take action to reduce home foreclosures , " said Brendsel .
" They have a cascading effect on home prices by dumping of homes on real estate market . "
This is all about the best D&D 3.5 spells ever .
A few quick ground rules .
First , I ’m only using spells from the SRD .
In fact , I ’m using The Hypertext d20 SRD to be specific .
If it ’s not in there , you wo n’t see it here .
Also , no epic magic .
Epic magic can do anything assuming you can get your spellcraft high enough .
I ’ll be picking one spell from each spell level .
That ’s ten amazing spells total .
If your favorite is n’t on the list , do n’t sweat it , it could still very well be an awesome spell … unless it ’s evocation or has a HD cap anyway .
Then we might have to get into specifics .
Finally , I ’m not going for min-maxing on this one …
I ’m going for fun , possibilities for creative use , or the simple justification of I like using it a lot .
0th Level – Create Water
This one barely beats out Prestidigitation , another awesome spell , and certainly more versatile .
However , create water also has its uses .
For instance , free water in the desert , which is not only vital to survival , it ’s also a great business once the local oasis dries up .
It can also make difficult terrain if your DM is feeling generous and you ’re on some form of dirt ; this wo n’t work on rock unless it ’s also cold enough for the water to freeze in the time you need it to .
Finally , you can use it to pin point invisible foes if you ’re high enough level .
Just drop 10 gallons of water spread out in as thin a sheet as the rules allow on the battlefield , and watch for where the water breaks on it ’s way to the ground .
My personal favorite use when I ’m playing the game with an unsuspecting DM .
1st Level – Detect Evil
The plot destroyer .
Put this one up , start concentrating , and as soon as something suspicious happens , you know who to look for in order to get your answers .
Seriously , when there are only two evil people in town , and someone has just gone missing , it ’s not too hard to figure out who did it .
Admittedly , this only works in areas where most people are good or neutral , and you are n’t dealing with complex plots in which good people are also villains sometimes .
However , in many D&D games , this will tell you exactly who ’s behind it , and what you should do about it .
Here ’s a hint : if it ’s evil , you should kill it if you want to be hero , and team up with it if you want to take over the world .
If you go the route of taking over the world , consider using detect good in place of detect evil .
2nd Level – Mirror Image
There are no words to describe how awesome this spell is .
Well , okay , there are , it ’s just going to take some effort .
You get a bunch of illusory duplicates of yourself , all acting exactly like you , for the purpose of misdirecting enemy attacks .
You always get at least two images , on a poor roll at low levels , and can have as many as eight on a good roll and at high levels .
This translates into a miss chance of 66 % at worst and 88 % at best .
Way better than the tepid stuff greater invisibility can do for you in terms of miss chance ( though it has other uses that are quite nice ) .
Of course , every time an opponent misses you due to the spell , the miss chance lowers a bit as that image is destroyed , but even with only one image left , it ’s still just as good as full concealment at 50 % .
Not to mention , imagine how cool it looks to have five of you on the battlefield at once , even if only one is real .
3rd Level – Glibness
Like to lie ?
Then you ’ll love +30 to bluff whenever you try to convince someone you ’re telling the truth .
You ’ll also love that even if a spell compels you to tell the truth , or would reveal that you ’re lying , there ’s a chance the spell trying to expose your mischevous ways could fail to work on you .
Now , +30 to bluff will put you about on par with a low epic level rogue who maxes bluff .
Assuming you do n’t even have any training in bluff .
If you do , you ’ll find yourself convincing people of extrordinary things , and they ’ll believe everything you tell them , hook , line , and sinker .
Think of all the cons you could pull .
One thing is certain : with this much persuasive power , you ’ll be living the good life in no time flat .
4th Level – Polymorph
So many options .
So much power .
So many creative uses .
So many ways to completely abuse this spell .
Sure , you do n’t get the supernatural and magical power of whatever you turn into .
You do still get its extraordinary abilities .
You can also still squeeze through small spaces , fly , and lay the beatdown on those lesser creatures who ca n’t turn into mean , lean , wrecking machines .
Besides which , spying is a breeze as no one will ever suspect the bird eating from the bird feeder as listening in on an important conversation .
Unless they brought along a wizard or a cleric anyway .
And this is just scratching the surface .
5th Level – Control Winds
This was a tough pick , as 5th level has a lot of awesome spells , including awaken and nightmare .
However , control winds wins out simply due to its raw power .
You can cause the wind to go from calm to tornado force in six seconds flat assuming a high enough caster level .
You can control the way the wind blows in a number of ways as well .
My personal favorite is to have a calm spot where my allies and I are standing , then have it blow away from us in all directions , causing all enemies to go flying away from us .
It ’s quite fun .
Very useful when there ’s a convenient cliff or pool of lava nearby , I must say .
Also great for wrecking structures , and even known to knock powerful dragons out of the sky for easier pickings .
6th Level – Irresistable Dance
This is the ultimate lesson in humiliation .
The spell allows no save , and the hapless fool struck by it can do nothing but dance with gusto while the spell lasts .
It makes the victim unable to effectively defend himself , and also look like a fool in the process .
Quite possibly the ultimate save or lose spell .
Certainly reason enough all on its own to invest in mind blank or similar effects .
7th Level – Reverse Gravity
Exactly like you ’d expect from the name , everything falls up .
Without something to hold onto , or the ability to fly , you ’ll find yourself crashing into the ceiling or floating in the air unable to move .
And it will be hilarious to watch for those lucky enough to be unaffected .
It ’s equally fun when the spell wears off and everyone falls back to the ground , only to have the cheeky wizard cast the spell again .
8th Level – Binding
If you do n’t know what this spell does , read the entire entry .
It ’s that good .
Ever wanted to trap a creature in a jar ?
Perhaps imprison it in a gemstone or a labrynth ?
Condemn it to eternal slumber ?
This is the spell for you then .
Not only can it do these awesome things , among others , but you can even have assistants to help you make the spell more powerful so it can last longer or possibly deny the target creature a saving throw .
No save imprisonment sounds like a win-win .
Not only is this spell effective , it also has some of the best flavor of the spells in D&D .
9th Level – Astral Projection
This one barely beats out shapechange and time stop .
Travel the planes , and if you happen to die in your travels , then you get to return to your body rather than actually dying .
This allows for lots of exploration and risk taking , and a lot of fun .
When you ca n’t die , you can do lots of things you would n’t ordinarily try after all .
Just make sure your physical body is well - protected .
Perhaps if you ’re the paranoid type you should put up a wall of stone and prismatic sphere in a well - hidden location before projecting .
Either way , it ’s one of the ultimate exploration spells , and you should have no trouble finding new things to do , or surviving doing those things .
You just might have to try them a few times to be successful .
Not a problem when you can just keep going back for more though .
A new cancer treatment that `zaps ' away tumours using electrical pulses is being pioneered at Melbourne 's Alfred Hospital .
The doctors involved say they are very excited about the potential of the treatment , called `irreversible electroporation ' as a cure for early - stage cancer .
In animal tests it completely destroyed tumours within a fortnight , with little or no damage to the surrounding tissue .

The HST photo of the photoevaporating molecular clouds of M16 is the iconic go - to image , but it ’s always struck me as veering toward flash over substance .
The “ pillars of creation ” name combines with the visual cues to create the illusion that you ’re looking at something in an up - down gravitational field .
I think my favorite astronomical image is the not - quite - so - famous photo of Barnard 68 .
Here , one gets a far more immediate and accurate sense of what one is actually seeing .
A cold , black self - gravitating cloud , looming in the foreground , blotting out the stars .
It ’s easy to imagine a sped - up film which depicts the cloud boiling and writhing with its internal turbulence .
There ’s a certain undeniable menace to the dark cloud , and not without reason .
If we rewind the tape by 4.54 billion years , all the material in our own solar system would have looked not unlike Barnard 68 .
If viewed in time - lapse , the pre-solar dark cloud would have collapsed from inside out upon itself , leading to the formation of the Sun , the planets , and eventually , a vanguard of five delicately engineered probes heading tentatively out into the galaxy .
There would have indeed been cause for long - term concern …
Creepy undertones aside , Barnard 68 is a great slide to show during talks about star and planet formation .
If the Sun is a 0.2 mm grain of sand in San Francisco , Barnard 68 is half a mile across and located roughly at the distance of Los Angeles .
The dark cloud itself is the equivalent of grinding up one percent of three small grains of sand , and dispersing the resulting powder through a half - mile wide volume .
The last time I gave a talk , it occurred to me that I ’d never had enough faith in common sense to actually question whether that last analogy is appropriate , and indeed nobody in an audience has ever called me on it .
Is it really possible to grind up 3 % of a sand grain so that it creates an opaque half - mile wide cloud ?
That sounds totally nuts !
The absolute finest that one could envision grinding up a sand grain , while still retaining it in some sense as powdered “ sand ” , would be to the level of individual silica ( SiO2 ) molecules .
A 0.2 mm grain contains roughly 6×10 ^ 17 silica molecules .
There ’d thus be ~ 2×10 ^16 molecules available to disperse through the half - mile - wide volume of our model for Barnard 68 .
Scaling up to the solar mass , this would imply a Barnard 68 chock full of kilometer - wide asteroids , whereas in reality , the dust in Barnard 68 is micron - sized , roughly the consistency of cigarette smoke .
If the metals in Barnard 68 were in the form of km - wide asteroids , the cloud would indeed be transparent — fewer than one in a billion of the photons from the background stars would be absorbed on their way through the cloud .
A Texas State Representative has filed legislation to ban the possession of the herb Salvia Divinorum .
For those who have never heard of the plant , Salvia Divinorum is a psychoactive herb which can induce strong dissociative effects , and is often billed as a legal alternative to Marijuana .
Salvia divinorum has been used for centuries in Mexico for spiritual and healing purposes
To back his case , State Rep. Doc Anderson appeared on Dr Phil Tuesday to discuss the drug , saying that “ The substance is dangerous , incapacitating , and serves no medical use whatsoever … [ and ] has possible dangerous health effects and is unregulated in Texas . ”
The proposed bill would make possession of Salvia Divinorum a Class A Misdemeanor .
Anderson had previously tried to ban Salvia Divinorum in 2007 , but the legislation never made it past committee .
The internet seems to have played a role in the growing awareness and concern around Salvia Divinorum , with videos of users appearing on YouTube .
Here ’s one video I found of someone on the drug .
WARNING : it ’s quite disturbing , and not suitable for young children .
Also after the video a short history of the use of Salvia Divinorum as a drug .

Anyone who 's watched the business channels for more than an hour or two will have been well indoctrinated in the magic thinking that is the Federal Reserve mandate .
The Fed plays 'an expectations game . '
In order to maximize the impact of their manipulation , the Fed will try to ' surprise ' the markets , because if the markets ' expect ' an action , they may not react .
Often it 's market analysts explaining what the Fed could do that might or might not meet market expectations , or surprise them .
We also hear members and spokespersons for the Fed adapt this habit of speaking .
You'd think they were generals in war , analyzing enemy preparations .
But if surprises work so well in that piece of the economy , why not try them everywhere ?
UPS could surprise its customers by sometimes delivering next day , sometimes putting your package in storage for six months , or perhaps even delivering something when you 've asked for a pickup .
Burger King could sell its customers dollar burgers on Wednesday , $ 35 porterhouse steaks on Thursday , and plumbing supplies on Friday .
If other economic sectors would follow suit ( suits being available at garden supply stores 'or are they ?
Maybe your expectations are being managed again ' ? ) , then you can start to see that soon we'd have an unprecedented economic boom , since according to Fed lore , no one knowing what 's going on is a sure path to success ( as long as it's not so sure that we can't still be surprised ) .
Has the Fed itself fully explored all the possibilities for surprise ?
Maybe Chairman Bernanke could show up at press conferences in drag or funny costumes :
' Chairman Bernanke surprised the financial press today when he attended a briefing wearing an old raincoat and a Harpo Marx wig .
Attendees were further taken aback when the Chairman answered all questions by honking a clown horn .
Reporters quickly adapted , requesting that Bernanke answer questions with one honk for yes , and two honks for no .
All market participants were adjusting to the new conditions , but then Chairman Bernanke yanked away the coat and wig to reveal a Spiderman costume , stunning markets and precipitating an enormous rally ' '
While Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson may or may not be glad to see us , but always carries a bazooka , for the Fed , the talk is of how many bullets they may have left , and how they can maximize their potential for impact on the markets .
And why use bullets on the market ?
Why surprise them ( us ) at all ?
This talk is of a clear effort to take a group of actors who believe one thing , and get them to believe another .
It 's the not very disguised language ( in fact pretty much says what it is ) of confirmed serial bubble makers .
Yet when the bubbles inevitably occur , then the folks with the self - proclaimed power over expectations , with the bazookas and bullets , have an epiphany -- it 's the market 's fault .
' Sure , we had all the advantages , privileges , power and information , but we could n't have foreseen that if we threw money at people , they might try to grab it .
We need more bullets to get the benighted , frightened public to trust ( and borrow ) again so we can re-ignite the markets that we perpetually mistake for the economy . '
It should be pretty clear who provides and produces , and who makes noise and pretends .
Unsurprisingly ( the actual word that the economy as a whole prefers ) , the people who produce goods and services are the people who produce goods and services .
It is n't Wall Street or the banks , and it certainly is n't the Fed or the government .
Creation of money and credit does n't , in the long run , produce anything except a boon for the creators and early spenders , and confusion and malinvestment for the rest of us .
Attempted management of the perceptions of the beneficiaries and victims of fiat money and credit creation may sometimes keep the game cycling a little longer ' but more time spent obliviously making poor investments is a worse outcome , not a better one .
Banks and government do n't grow or manage the economy ; they do n't run it , expand it , or stabilize it .
What banks and government do to the economy is rape it .
And what would any rapist do to try and dodge consequences from his crime ?
Blame the victim , of course .
The Battle Over Political Correctness Continues
DIGG THIS
For those of you who are new to this story , and have not been following the story of my adventures at Loyola College of Maryland , I was accused of racism and sexism for explaining the male - female , and the white - black wage gaps .
Here is a bit of recapitulation of this thread :
Coverage has been provided by the major media here , here , here and here .
Electronic Media has offered the following : here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .
Here and here are two very different takes on this episode from my own school .
For my own viewpoint on this episode , see here , here , here , here , here and here .
The present chapter in this saga consists of several sections .
In the first , there are letters to the editor of the Times Picayune , the major newspaper of New Orleans , and my replies to them .
The letters are reprinted below , but may be found here ( Soublet ) , here ( Doheny ) , here ( Quant ) , here ( Baker ) and here ( Father Wildes , S.J. , president of the Loyola University New Orleans ) .
( I have previously reported on my longer correspondences with Quant and Wildes ; what appears below breaks entirely new ground . )
These five published letters to the editor of the Times Picayune were in response to James Gill ’s " Loyola economist is off - base on productivity , ” 12/1/08 , that reported on a speech I gave at Loyola College Maryland .
I asked the editor for a reply of 800 words , the usual length of an op - ed .
That was denied .
In return , I was then offered 250 words , which I duly sent off the editor of this newspaper .
This was rejected on the ground that the context of my reply was unclear .
Well , yes , it is difficult to respond to five letters in so few words .
In what follows , I reprint these letters , followed by my non-truncated , well , greatly expanded for this venue , responses .
In section II I offer an exchange with a professor from the Baltimore area who attended the lecture .
He is the only attendee , at least so far , who has written me about this issue .
Section III is devoted to my attempt to become , of all things , a theologian .
I conclude in section IV with some reflections about my experiences .
I. Block ’s unpublished letters to the editor of the Times Picayune
1a. David Soublet :
Loyola economist is off - base on productivity ; Monday , December 01 , 2008 Re : “ A tough sell in the marketplace of ideas , ” Other Opinions , Nov. 26 .
Walter Block ’s blockheaded theories about pay discrepancies are shallow and ignorant .
What ’s more disappointing and dangerous is the fact that he chairs the economics department of a Catholic university , where he has a regular forum to spread such nonsense .
The productivity of an employee , or a group of employees , is not governed by sex or race .
Quality of management influences productivity as much as any other factor .
The so - called lower IQs of women and black people help us immediately recognize injustices in the work force , like top executives of failing companies paying each other absurd amounts despite their lack of productivity .
Had Africans been less productive , under Block ’s rationale , there would have been no market incentive to steal them away to America to labor as slaves at the hands of the “ more productive ” white male .
Mr. Block should be fired , and until he is , I am ashamed of being Catholic .
My talented , intelligent black Catholic daughter will graduate from high school next May and has already been admitted to three universities .
Thanks to Block ’s warped views and his position at Loyola , we have eliminated one more school from consideration for her post - secondary education .
David M. Soublet , New Orleans
1b . Block responds to Soublet
David Soublet ( " Loyola economist is off - base on productivity " 12/1/08 ) will not send his daughter to Loyola because of my " blockheaded theories . "
I wonder at the need for name - calling .
Surely , it is not conducive to civil discourse .
Let me assure Mr. Soublet that most professors at my university do not at all subscribe to my free enterprise philosophy .
For example , most of them would not at all agree with me about the fact that " top executives of failing companies paying each other absurd amounts despite their lack of productivity . "
In my view , but not theirs , this is not due to capitalism , but rather stems from the socialist and fascist elements of our mixed economy .
Let us ask a very basic economic question :
Why are these firms able to get away with " paying each other absurd amounts " ?
This is due not to following the tenets of laissez faire ; rather , the government has removed one of the market ’s fail - safe mechanisms with its insider trading laws .
Michael Milken is the poster boy for this particular market safety device .
Paying executives far in excess of their productivity lowers stock values of such companies .
Milken used to swoop in , buy up such artificially low - priced shares , kick out bloated management , and make vast profits , thus ending the very behavior to which Mr. Soublet , quite reasonably , objects .
It can not be denied that " quality of management influences productivity . "
But this underscores even more the importance of deregulating markets , not hemming them in with a welter of regulations .
Mr. Soublet calls into question the " so - called lower IQs of women . "
And , he does so quite rightly too , in my opinion .
But he blames me for saying this .
In contrast , the record shows that I have said this about that issue : " As far as I am aware , the gap in IQ between men and women either does not exist , or , is so statistically insignificant that it can play no explanatory role . "
Mr. Soublet should be appraised of the fact that it is illegitimate to castigate me for something I did not say , indeed , something concerning which I am on record as denying .
It is only appropriate to criticize an author for what he actually wrote , not for something that someone else ( mistakenly ) attributed to him .
If Mr. Soublet ’s daughter were to attend Loyola University New Orleans , I and at least some of my colleagues would try to convince her of the merits of such a principle .
Mr. Soublet states " Had Africans been less productive , under Block ’s rationale , there would have been no market incentive to steal them away to America to labor as slaves … "
I fear he is conflating " less productive " with " zero productivity , " or perhaps " negative productivity . "
He would be quite correct in asserting that had black Africans has zero or negative productivity , " … there would have been no … incentive to steal them away to America to labor as slaves . "
But , merely , with lower productivity , this would not at all follow .
However , I disagree with Mr. Soublet most strongly when he attributes slavery to a " market incentive . "
The free market , or the free enterprise system , or laissez faire capitalism , is predicated on private property rights and voluntary trade .
Those black Africans who were enslaved had their private property rights in their own bodies abrogated .
There was nothing voluntary about their capture , kidnapping and enslavement .
Indeed , the very opposite was the case .
Stealing , kidnapping , theft , murder , rape , all of which was endured by these people , is the polar opposite of free markets .
As to me being " fired , " is this not a bit harsh ?
After all , I am not guilty of any of the charges he makes against me .
Rather , they have been falsely attributed to me .
Even if I were guilty of them , does Mr. Soublet really want to send his daughter to an institution of higher learning where there will be little or no diversity of ideas ?
Where she will be exposed , only , to one side of many contentious issues ?
I certainly would not want my own daughter ’s intellect to be stunted in such a fashion .

Clubhouse is off - limits ; Tuesday , December 02 , 2008 ; Re : “ A tough sell in the marketplace of ideas , ” Other Opinions , Nov. 26 .
I ’m no economist , but Walter Block ’s assertion that income gaps between women , African - Americans and white males exist not because of racism or sexism but because women and black people are “ less productive ” is ridiculously easy to refute .
Like other Randian / Libertarians who read Atlas Shrugged in college ( and , unlike the rest of us , failed to grow up and recognize it for the load of adolescent nonsense that it is ) Mr. Block assumes that humans will unfailingly behave with rational self - interest , and that therefore if black people and women were as productive as white males , white employers would rush to hire them .
But as any black person or female who aspires to the corner office will tell you , the “ old boys club ” is made profoundly uncomfortable by the presence of women and minorities in the executive suite .
They ’ll gladly accept a competitive disadvantage if it means they do n’t have to play golf with “ those people . ”
Our economy is currently circling the drain because powerful white men failed to conduct themselves with long - term “ rational self - interest ” and instead acted like short - sighted , heedless greed - heads .
Compared to that , refusing the possible contributions of women and minorities at the executive level is small potatoes .
John S. P. Doheny , New Orleans
2b . Block responds to Doheny
John Doheny ( " Clubhouse is off - limits " 12/2/08 ) fails to reckon with the fact that if " the u2018 old ( white ) boys club ’ is made profoundly uncomfortable by the presence of women and minorities " they will lose out in the competitive struggle of the market under free enterprise ( here , we assume no bailouts ! ) .
Those who do not indulge such prejudices will out - compete them .
One need not resort to the assumption " that humans will unfailingly behave with rational self - interest " to reach this conclusion .
All that is necessary to posit is that , other things equal , those who act to a greater degree than others to maximize profits will drive into bankruptcy others , who do not act in this fashion , or do so less intensively .
If private entrepreneurs " … accept a competitive disadvantage if it means they do n’t have to play golf with u2018 those people , ’ " they are not long for the world of business , provided , again , that the government does not bail them out .
And , as for Atlas Shrugged , this is by far the best novelization of the benefits , both moral and economic , of allowing markets to be free .
I assign this magnificent book to all my introductory courses in economics , to the great intellectual benefit of these students .
I agree that " Our economy is currently circling the drain because ( of ) powerful white men , " for the most part .
But it is people in the government , to a great degree employed by the Federal Reserve System , who are responsible .
They are not private businessmen , of whatever color or hue .

White supremacy theory proved fatal and false ; Wednesday , December 03 , 2008 ; Re : “ A tough sell in the marketplace of ideas , ” Other Opinions , Nov. 25 .
Loyola University professor Walter Block asserts that black people and women are less productive than white men because women have only “ average ” intelligence needed for motherhood but not for “ leading corporations ” ; he cites discredited research that asserts black people have lower IQs than white people .
Apparently the havoc wrought by 500 years of pseudoscientific “ proofs ” of white supremacy is not sufficiently instructive .
Millions of native peoples were slaughtered and Africans enslaved while theologians debated whether they had souls or were even human .
The racial theories of American eugenics led to forced sterilizations and Nazi racial policies that categorized certain peoples as “ life unworthy of life . ”
With great Aryan efficiency , millions were murdered .
There have always been academicians ready to provide “ scientific ” proof of white supremacy and a justification for racial and gender discrimination .
Will the next step be demanding the repeal of civil right laws to allow discrimination against those Block deems unproductive ?
This is the logic and legacy of such flawed analysis .
Ted Quant , New Orleans
3b . Block replies to Quant
Mr. Ted Quant ( " White supremacy theory proved fatal and false , " 12/3/08 ) inexplicably links my analysis of the male - female and white - black earnings gap of some 30 % to the historical slaughter and enslavement of minority groups .
If he had listened to what I had actually said at that speech , or read any of my many publications on this topic ( google me ; I have a paper trail a mile long ) he would not likely have engaged in such hysterical charges .
Mr. Quant heads up the Twomey Center at Loyola University New Orleans .
Therefore , I presume , he is a scholar .
As such , he ought to be willing to tell me the source of his citation to me , saying this , in his words : " Walter Block asserts that black people and women are less productive than white men because women have only u2018average ’ intelligence needed for motherhood but not for u2018 leading corporations . ’"
From the fact that he places in quote marks the word and phrase , respectively , " average , " and " leading corporations , " I deduce that he is indeed citing my written , spoken , or published thoughts .
But what is their context ?
In what way did I use these terms ?
Surely , mere use of these terms , " average , " and " leading corporations , " is not itself objectionable ?
There must be something more offensive of which I am guilty .
But what ?
I am still greatly in the dark on these issues , despite repeated entreaties to Mr. Quant to enlighten me .
He says that I " cite … discredited research that asserts black people have lower IQs than white people . "
I am not sure of the " discredited " part of this .
The book I mentioned , rather , is part of a fierce ongoing intellectual debate : Herrnstein , Richard J. , and Murray , Charles .
1994 .
The Bell Curve : Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , New York : The Free Press .
Does Mr. Quant ’s assertion mean that anyone who merely " cites " this book is implicated in the fact that " Millions of native peoples were slaughtered and Africans enslaved ? "
This seems to be something of an excessive reach on Mr. Quant ’s part .
Surely , mere mention of this volume does not logically imply anything of the sort .
Mr. Quant asks : " Will the next step be demanding the repeal of civil right laws to allow discrimination against those Block deems unproductive ?
This is the logic and legacy of such flawed analysis . "
No , this is not at all the " logic " of citing the Herrnstein - Murray book .
Nothing logically follows from the mere citation of this or any other book .
Further , Mr. Quant fails to distinguish between the normative realm ( civil rights laws should be repealed ) , and the positive ( the analysis and conclusions of the Bell Curve are correct . )
At least according to David Hume , no such implication is valid .
As it happens , I do favor the repeal of the so - called " Civil Rights " Act of 1964 .
I do so on grounds other than that I happened to have cited the Bell Curve in a speech .
I oppose this pernicious piece of legislation because it violates rights .
No one , black , white , male female , heterosexual , homosexual , " abled " or " differently abled , " etc. , has a right against all others that they not discriminate against them .
If they did , then the law should mandate compulsory bi-sexuality .
For heterosexual males ( females ) discriminate in their choice of a marriage partner against all men ( women ) .
Homosexual males ( females ) discriminate in their choice of a marriage partner against all women ( men ) .
It is only the bi-sexual who engages in neither of these discriminatory practices .
Now , to be sure , the " Civil Rights "
Act of 1964 does not protect rights in marriage , or personal relationships , only in commercial endeavors .
But , if we are to extrapolate from the logic of this malicious law , we cannot deny this inference .
If people have the right not to be discriminated against , then , logically , this should apply to all realms of life , the personal as well as the commercial .
Therefore , I ask , does Mr. Quant , or does he not , favor compulsory bi-sexuality ?
The laws of logic require him either to take this position , or , to renounce his support for the " Civil Rights " Act of 1964 .

Professor Walter Block may not speak for Loyola University , but he sounds worse than their spokesman in 1944 who told me upon application to the new Business School : “ We can not admit females because when they graduate they will take a job that a man needs to support a family . ”
I went next door to Tulane and graduated in 1948 .

Angela Baker ( " Sounds familiar , " 12/7/08 ) blames me for something she was told by a representative of Loyola University New Orleans in 1944 .
I was n’t on the faculty , then ; I was only three years old at the time .
That spokesman for Loyola University New Orleans was laboring under what economists call the " lump of labor " fallacy : there is only so much work in the world to be done , and if some people hog it up ( females , for example ) , then there will not be enough for others ( in this case , male heads of households ) , to access through employment .
Bosh , tosh , and nonsense .
Very much to the contrary , there is virtually an unlimited amount of labor to be done in the real world .
It is indefinitely large , only limited by man ’s desires .
As long as we want more than we have , that is , as long as there is economic scarcity , there will be employment slots in the free market .
Why , then , do we have unemployment ?
It is caused by government , not free enterprise .
The state creates joblessness through minimum wage laws , union legislation , interfering with market interest rates through its monetary czar ( the federal reserve system . )

Expression is his right ; Wednesday , December 03 , 2008
I want to be very clear that while Professor Walter Block , the Harold E. Wirth Eminent Scholar Chair in Economics , is a member of Loyola University New Orleans ’ Economics Department , he is not the chair of the department nor does he speak for the university .
However , like any American , under the First Amendment of the Constitution , Professor Block is entitled to freedom of speech and expression .
Universities are places of argument and disagreement .
They are laboratories of free expression and academic inquiry .
This is how we advance knowledge and learning .
There are many members of the university community who disagree with Professor Block .
In fact , Loyola will host a colloquium on the views expressed by Professor Block in the near future .
Loyola enjoys a robust history of serving students from all economic and ethnic backgrounds and educating them to lead extraordinary lives .
All are welcome here and all thrive here .
One professor ’s views do not a university make .

Kevin Wildes , S.J. ( " Expression is his right . "
12/3/08 ) says that " Universities are places of argument and disagreement .
They are laboratories of free expression and academic inquiry . "
I disagree .
He should have said " Great universities like Loyola University New Orleans are places of argument and disagreement .
They are laboratories of free expression and academic inquiry " Unhappily , most institutions of higher learning , nowadays , do not support diversity of opinion .
For example , Loyola College in Maryland is a case in point .
Compare the statement of its president , Fr. Linnane , S.J. , with that of Fr. Wildes , S.J. , which appears immediately above .
Fr. Linnane , S.J. says " … invited speaker Professor Walter Block , an economist from Loyola University New Orleans , delivered an address on u2018 Injustices in the Politics and Economics of Social Justice . ’
Many in attendance found some of Professor Block ’s comments … insensitive … we will not endorse or support racism , sexism or any other form of intolerance . "
He does so without mentioning any racism or sexism of which I am guilty .
Fr. Wildes , S.J. , in very sharp contrast , indeed , insists on my " right " of expression .
On 12/3/08 he promised that " Loyola will host a colloquium on the views expressed by Professor Block in the near future . "
He was evidently serious about that .
A day or two afterwards , Roger White , Associate Provost of Loyola University , contacted me to arrange for just such a colloquium .
Can anyone imagine Loyola College in Maryland making such arrangements ?
True , the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force of Loyola University New Orleans issued a Statement that could well have been written in Baltimore .
But this only underscores all the more Kevin Wildes ’ S.J. incisive comment that " There are many members of the university community who disagree with Professor Block . "
No truer words were ever said .
Nevertheless , I insist that even the members of this Task Force outshine their cultural Marxist counterparts in Baltimore .
After all , the faculty of Loyola University New Orleans is composed of many professors of the Task Force ilk who are fully cognizant of my views .
They nevertheless voted me their prestigious Dux Academicus Award .
From what I know of Loyola College in Maryland , it is inconceivable that this could have happened there .
Certainly , they have not singled out Tom DiLorenzo , easily their most prestigious professor in term of accomplishments , in any such manner .
Hey , I have an idea .
You know how professional sports teams are always trading players ?
Well , have I got a deal for you !
We trade all ten of the members of the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force of Loyola University New Orleans for just two professors from Loyola College in Maryland : Tom DiLorenzo , and Fr. Hank Hilton , S.J.
Here are the members of this Task Force I am proposing to trade away , from New Orleans to Baltimore : Ted Quant , Lydia Voigt , Wing Fok , Lisa Martin , Al Alcazar , James Hobbs , Kurt Bindewald , Artemis Preeshl , Karen Reichard , Anthony Decuir .
They may be addressed here : raphael@loyno.edu ; quant@loyno.edu ; voigt@loyno.edu ; fok@loyno.edu ; lmartin@loyno.edu ; aalcazar@loyno.edu ; hobbs@loyno.edu ; kjbindew@loyno.edu ; aspreesh@loyno.edu ; reichard@loyno.edu ; decuir@loyno.edu .
( Sometimes , humor does not come across accurately in written form ; this is particularly true when it is an economist who is trying to be funny .
So , for the record , I am not seriously making this proposal . )

Letter from reader XX ( he asked for anonymity ) to Block
I ’d like to address something you said at your Loyola Lecture and several times since then in email transcripts ( which I ’ve had the pleasure of reading on LRC ) .
Well , first let me back up and say that I attended the lecture and was one of probably only a few who were not students and not affiliated with Loyola , MD .
I read Dr. DiLorenzo ’s blog post on LRC and decided to show up .
I found your lecture informative and your arguments well conceived and well presented .
While I ’m still considering much of what you had to say that day , I am having trouble refuting your argument regarding the wage gap in any meaningful way .
So , I applaud you for that .
The attacks that you ’ve endured have been disappointing because no attacker has made an actual argument against your ideas .
I ( and many others , I ’m sure ) would benefit greatly from hearing a legitimate debate on the subject .
I am , however , slightly perturbed by your repeated reference to poetry and literature as " wussy . "
Point # 1 : I really do n’t have an argument since your characterization of literature as " wussy " is really just your opinion .
And even though I totally disagree with it , I have no issue with you having such an opinion .
I realize you made this comment mostly in jest , but I am certain if you would read some examples of great literature ( here , here , & here ) , you would refrain from calling it " wussy . "
You may not enjoy it or think it worthwhile , but I ’m certain you ’ll not consider it " wussy . "
However , I think you and the rest of us are better served if you focus 100 % on Economics .
Point # 2 : This is more important and related to your Loyola lecture .
I am somewhat of an expert regarding literature ( I have an advanced degree , I teach English at a local community college , I spend many , many hours reading and studying all sorts of fiction ) .
I ’ve always thought ( privately , of course ) that men write the best literature .
There are exceptions but by and large the most exceptional writing comes from men .
I am unconcerned with Nobel Prizes , National Book Awards , etc. , because they are awarded not necessarily to the authors of best books but to the authors who deal with politically correct topics .
Awards and such do not legitimize literature or provide a measure of a book ’s worth .
Literature , it seems to me , is just another example that proves your point regarding outliers and sociobiology .
Men tend to write the most exceptional literature .
Anyway , keep up the great work .
Many of the things I ’ve learned from mises.org and LRC regarding Economics I ’ve incorporated into my English lectures .
I certainly appreciate all the work you and your fellow scholars have done .
Best Regards , Professor XX
PS — Any plans to return to the television program , “ Our Story ” ?
IIb .
Block replies to XX
You are the only person who actually attended this talk of mine who wrote to me about it , hard as that is to believe .
As such , I would dearly love to include your letter , along with my response , in a future LRC op - ed .
May I have your permission to use your name ?
If not , I can make this anonymous .
My response .
You are right .
I was kidding when I said “ wussy . ”
It just shows that economists , or at least I , ca n’t make good jokes .
A colleague of mine warned me about this , but I did n’t follow his advice .
I , too , love literature .
( My favorite novelists are Ayn Rand and Chaim Potok . )
As you said , the problem with Nobel Prizes in Literature ( as opposed to chemistry , physics , etc. ) as an indication of world - class accomplishment is that they are given out on the basis of political correctness .
I am delighted that you came to my lecture as an open - minded critic , and , at least so far , are having “ trouble refuting ( my ) argument regarding the wage gap in any meaningful way . ”
It is too bad that many others , mainly administrators and members of the economics department of Loyola College Maryland were not as open - minded .
They did not attend this lecture ; yet , on the basis of it , they were highly critical .
Not , I may add , of the arguments I made and the evidence I put forth , but , merely , because I had the temerity to criticize shibboleths of theirs .
As to your p.s. , if they invite me back to “ Our Story , ” I ’ll return , but only reluctantly .
So far , though , they have not invited me back .
However , it will be an onerous task I will undertake for the cause of promoting liberty and economic understanding ; it will not be a joy , as are most of my interviews , speeches , media appearances .
I appeared there twice , so far .
In my first appearance , I argued that racist employers who pay black employees significantly less than their productivity levels will tend to be out - competed in the market by non racist employers who do not discriminate against black people .
In my second appearance , I argued for the legalization of drugs , giving as an important reason the fact that young black men are now murdering each other ( and also bystanders ) in fights over drug turf at horrendous rates .
My efforts on both occasions were responded to by criticisms that I was a “ racist ” for saying this .
As you know , when in Baltimore , as seemed appropriate , I used Michael Phelps as an example to demonstrate the alternative costs doctrine .
I said Phelps was probably not a world - class cellist because he had no time to practice this instrument , given all his time spent in the pool .
Well , in another radio interview , I used LeBron James to illustrate this very point .
Whereupon I was beset upon by the host of the show , and a bevy of callers , for being a racist for using LeBron James to try to clarify the doctrine of opportunity costs .
Promoting liberty and economic understanding is sometimes a hard slog .
III .
Block as theologian
The Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius are the spiritual foundation of Jesuit life .
Paragraph 22 of the Exercises is a beautiful passage that says the following ( emphasis added ) : “ That both the giver and the maker of the Spiritual Exercises may be of greater help and benefit to each other , it should be presupposed that every good Christian ought to be more eager to put a good interpretation on a neighbor ’s statement than to condemn it .
Further , if one cannot interpret it favorably , one should ask how the other means it .
If that meaning is wrong , one should correct the person with love ; and if this is not enough , one should search out every appropriate means through which , by understanding the statement in a good way , it may be saved . ”
As much as it pains me to correct Fr. Linanne , S.J. , president of Loyola College in Maryland , his economics department , and Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force of Loyola University New Orleans on theological grounds , I feel that it is my duty to do so .
None of these persons or groups who purport to understand , represent , and most important , be bound by Jesuit teachings , " ask (ed ) how the other means it , " with regard to my writings and teachings on the subjects under discussion .
None of them ever contacted me , asking for explanation or elaboration .
All of them criticized me in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 22 of the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius .
Even the secular authorities usually hold trials before public condemnation , where both sides of an issue can be heard and explored .
Not so this case .
IV .
Reflections
I was tremendously heartened by the outpouring of supportive letters I received in this trial by public opinion .
All told , I estimate their number to be above 2000 .
Unhappily , I could n’t reply personally to all of them , but I am certainly appreciative .
I was disheartened by what I regard as a stab in the back from Wing Fok , a fellow professor of mine in the Loyola University School of Business .
Prof. Medina made a public accusation against me ; yet her attempt to reconcile ( she did not apologize ) was made privately .
The statement of the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force was made publicly .
I was not allowed to address this audience .
Although I sent them this , I never heard back from James Gwartney and Rick Stroup .
Nevertheless , I have a suggestion for them regarding a revision of their text ; they should add in the following material : " Although it is possible that employer discrimination accounts for the unexplained wage gap after econometric corrections are incorporated , this is unlikely .
For considerations of profit and loss continually whittle away at any differences in wages between workers of equal productivity .
And , to blithely assume that all unexplained earnings divergences are due to discrimination amounts to sheer intellectual laziness . "
I have given this speech on male female wage differences and the glass ceiling , oh , at least half a dozen times .
I did so on a few occasions at the Mises University .
I presented these findings to my classes , over the years , when I have taught labor economics .
Once , I spoke on this topic to the economics club at Loyola University New Orleans .
The reaction I received was the same everywhere : polite interest , some requests for elaboration , some criticism , but always the proceedings were entirely civil .
It was the same at Loyola College in Maryland .
The only difference was the aftermath , with Fr. Linnane ’s S.J. message , that horrid letter signed by , supposedly , the " economics department " there , and the statement from my own colleagues at the Affirmative Action Diversity Task Force of Loyola University New Orleans .
The results of these sorts of actions boomeranged on these people .
Presumably , their goal was to reduce the coverage of politically incorrect economic analysis .
It had the exact opposite effect , as can be seen by the listings in the second paragraph , above .
What lessons have I learned from all of this ?
First , do not be outspoken on a university campus , unless you have tenure , as I do .
It is very risky to do so otherwise .
Second , I was impressed even the more with the wisdom of this saying of Murray Rothbard ’s : “ It is no crime to be ignorant of economics , which is , after all , a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a ‘ dismal science . ’
But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance . ”
Third , the importance of Mises ’ motto was even more strongly impressed upon me : " Do not give in to evil , but proceed ever more boldly against it . "

The Best of Walter E. Block
Our troops did the job they were asked to do .
They got rid of Saddam Hussein .
They conducted the search for weapons of mass destruction .
They gave the Iraqi people a chance for elections and to have a government .
It is the Iraqis who have failed to take advantage of that opportunity .
-- Hillary Clinton
It 's not change when [ McCain ] promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians ... " -- Barack Obama
[ Both quotes appear in my essay , " The Triumph of the White , Male Ruling Class . " ]
Obama and Biden will press Iraq 's leaders to take responsibility for their future and to substantially spend their oil revenues on their own reconstruction .
-- Official Barack Obama website , Issues - Iraq
We 're spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $ 79 billion surplus , $ 79 billion .
And we need that $ 10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work , to do all these wonderful things that Sen.
McCain suggested we should be doing , but has not yet explained how he would pay for .
Now , Sen. McCain and I do agree , this is the greatest nation on earth .
We are a force of good in the world .
But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority .
-- Barack Obama , Second Presidential Debate , October 7 , 2008
If you have ever wondered how a serial murderer -- a murderer who is sane and fully aware of the acts he has committed -- can remain steadfastly convinced of his own moral superiority and show not even the slightest glimmer of remorse , you should not wonder any longer .
The United States government is such a murderer .
It conducts its murders in full view of the entire world .
It even boasts of them .
Our government , and all our leading commentators , still maintain that the end justifies the means -- and that even the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocents is of no moral consequence , provided a sufficient number of people can delude themselves into believing the final result is a " success . "
We are a nation that has voluntarily renounced all its most crucial values , and all its founding principles .
We can appeal all we want to " American exceptionalism , " but any " exceptionalism " that remains ours is that of a mass murderer without a soul , and without a conscience .
We have destroyed the most basic foundation of liberty -- and the nature and meaning of our act has already , in less than a couple of weeks , almost entirely vanished from public discussion .
It is useless to appeal to any " American " sense of morality : we have none .
It does not matter how immense the pile of corpses grows : we will not surrender or even question our delusion that we are right , and that nothing we do can be profoundly , unforgivably wrong .
Remember the five - year - old Iraqi girl who was killed by the same bombs that killed al - Zarqawi .
Remember the following , and try to understand it at long last ... --
From my essay , " The Missing Moral Center : Murdering the Innocent , " October 11 , 2006
As a nation , we are resolute in our refusal to identify the true nature of our actions , and in our refusal to acknowledge the consequences of what we do .
This may well be true of most nations throughout history .
Yet there is a direct correlation between a nation 's power and influence , and its reliance on myth and other public relations ploys .
As the world 's sole superpower , the United States via its ruling class saturates its subjects at home and abroad with propaganda on a scale and with an intensity that have rarely been surpassed .
As is true of all propaganda , permissible viewpoints are confined within suffocatingly constricted boundaries of thought ; variation of any moment from the prescribed guidelines is prohibited .
...
Consider how far into fantasy we have traveled , consider the scope of our determination to banish facts from our awareness .
It should not be controversial or noteworthy in the least to observe that conquest of foreign peoples by force of arms necessarily involves bloodletting , dismemberment and mutilation , that subjugation shatters the mind and the body , not just of the subjugated , but of those who would rule in this manner .
History tells this tale repeatedly .
Indeed , when our leaders wish to condemn other nations which utilize identical practices , they will examine these evils in endless detail .
Our leaders will explain to us with enthusiastic commitment that such practices are deeply immoral and can only lead to disaster .
But suddenly , when the United States sets out to conquer entire regions of the world , all these evils are not only transformed into a force for good : the evils miraculously cease to exist .
The United States is good -- it is " the culmination of human development " -- and all its works are good .
In " respectable " conversation in " respectable " places , you may not say otherwise .
Back home they 're glorifying the war , or else , at most , tut - tutting over how " incompetently " it has been managed -- or , as Hillary Clinton likes to do , berating the Iraqis for not taking advantage of the wonderful opportunity we 've given them by invading their country , killing their families , destroying their society , robbing them blind and empowering violent sectarians to rule over them .
This is the full range of acceptable , " serious " discourse on Iraq : it 's either a noble crusade marching steadily toward victory or a noble if mismanaged crusade on behalf of a bunch of ingrates who do n't deserve our benevolence .
The condescending superiority of this perspective is unassailable and unchangeable .
( In yet another loathsome example of the identical mentality , John Kerry has also said the same thing . )
Listen up , Obama , you cheap , lying fraud : the United States government launched a criminal war of aggression against a nation that never threatened us .
It continues a bloody , murdering occupation which does nothing but worsen the agony of the Iraqi people .
We have no right to be in Iraq at all .
We never did .
The actions of the United States government have led to a genocide of world historical proportions .
Genocidal murderers and those who support and enable them -- as you do , Obama , since you vote to fund this continuing crime -- do not get to " ask " one single goddamned fucking thing of their victims .
Not. One. Single .
Goddamned .
Fucking .
Thing .
This is the Open Door world carried to impossible , entirely unrealizable and ridiculous extremes .
The door is not only open : the door and the entire structure in which it had been installed have been obliterated .
The United States must be the global hegemon so that every human being eats well , is properly educated and has a good job , until every society and culture is thriving and properly " democratic " in the form we alone will dictate , and until there is a ( healthy ) chicken in every pot .
Let ’s remember : Gates was head of the CIA during Bush I .
As such , he was involved in the invasion of Panama , the funding of a genocidal regime in Guatemala , the support of Suharto ’s brutal government in Indonesia , and the overthrow of Jean - Bertrand Aristide in Haiti .
With Bush I , he pushed the first war against Saddam Hussein , even when it seemed that Saddam was preparing to withdraw from Iraq .
And now with Bush II , he ’s been running the Iraq War , which Obama vowed to end .
And Gates has come out with modernizing our nuclear weapons arsenal — that means making new nukes — even though Obama talked about nuclear disarmament during the campaign .
Something ’s terribly wrong with this picture .
And it ’s simply this : Obama does n’t really want a change in foreign and military policy .
He said as much during the campaign when he praised Bush Sr. and said he wanted to return to the bipartisan consensus of the last forty years .
In those forty years , the United States waged war against Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia .
It helped overthrow the Allende government in Chile .
It supported Suharto ’s invasion of East Timor .
It financed and trained death squads in Central America .
And on and on .
With the Gates choice , Obama proves he ’s not about ending the U.S. empire .
He ’s about running the U.S. empire — with less bravado than Bush - Cheney , but perhaps more efficiently .
Barack Obama ’s got a big problem .
He ’s suckered himself into believing that we need a bipartisan foreign and military policy .
Barack Obama repeatedly insists that the greatest task before us , the task to which he tells us again and again he himself is fully committed and to which he asks all of us to dedicate ourselves as well , is " change . "
To change a policy of any significance requires that one first identify honestly and in detail the nature of the policy one wishes to alter .
As is true of every other national politician of prominence , Obama resolutely refuses to name the actual nature and meaning of U.S. foreign policy today and for the last several decades .
Obama 's own statements , together with his selection of individuals for major foreign policy and defense positions in his administration , make unarguably clear that he will change nothing of any importance in America 's conduct of foreign policy .
When Obama tells us he is committed to " change , " he is lying , just as he has lied on a lengthy series of issues of great importance .
As I noted in " Obama 's Whitewash " : " Truth is ; truth is to be destroyed .
...
This is how we live today : lies are the staple of our diet .
Without them , we would die , certainly in psychological terms .
" The above statements from Hillary Clinton and Obama express positions they have offered on many occasions .
I set them beside my own description of the United States ' actions to make the contrast as starkly clear as possible .
I realize all too well that many people will read that excerpt from my earlier article ( as well as most if not all of my writing ) and dismiss such views with a contemptuous shrug of dismissal : " That 's just ridiculous .
Why do you have to be soSure , we 've made mistakes , including some terrible ones .
But the worst mistakes are Bush 's fault .
America itself , especially if the nation returns to its real values , has done great good in the world .
Under the leadership of a man like Obama , she hopefully will again .
" This , too , is where we are : to state the truth , thetruth without equivocation or avoidance , is " extreme . "
After all the writing I have done over several years , I despair at ever breaking through the wall of resistance that surrounds most Americans , the wall that separates our ruling class from any meaningful realization of the destruction and death their policies have caused around the world over many horrifying , blood - drenched years .
As I wrote in " ' Regrettable Misjudgments ' : The Shocking Immorality of Our Constricted Thought " : In that same essay , after a consideration of theof the genocide the U.S. government 's actions unleashed in Iraq , I quoted Chris Floyd as follows
In the context of what the United States has done and continues to do , the statements from Clinton and Obama about the " failure " of the Iraqis to act in a manner they find " acceptable " are loathsome in the extreme .
Their views , which I emphasize again are shared by every national politician who actually wields power ( by which formulation , I exclude the very few exceptions such as Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul ) , represent the murderous triumph of " American exceptionalism " -- the doctrine that lauds the United States as uniquely " good " and Americans as " the good guys " in a manner that no other peoples can ever hope to equal , and that , with its always implicit and frequently explicit racism , condemns all other peoples on Earth to sub- or even inhuman status .
That final element , of course , makes it considerably easier to slaughter them in large numbers , even when they could never possibly threaten us .
The absolute refusal to identify the facts and their meaning sometimes drives me to employ a crudity of expression I would prefer to avoid .
But as I noted , my attempts to get through more " politely " have proven futile .
Thus , about Clinton 's and Obama 's disgusting remarks about the Iraqis ' " failures , " I wrote And still , after the genocide caused by the U.S. government 's actions , after all the death and mutilation , after the destruction of an entire country , Obama tells us : " This is the greatest nation on earth .
We are a force of good in the world .
" To understate in my own criminally irresponsible manner : this is not " change . "
This is the full , loving embrace of " American exceptionalism , " and of all the detestable consequences of that detestable doctrine .
For those who have been paying attention ( and I thank the approximately 14 of you who have ) , this is hardly news .
I discussed Obama 's adoration of and dedication to " American exceptionalism " in " Songs of Death , " which was written in May -- of 2007 .
Among others , two points from that earlier piece should be noted here .
First , I recommend that you consider the meaning and possible results of Clinton 's positive comments about the fact that the United States may " have to takemilitary action against Iran ... "
In a sense , I suppose one should thank Clinton for this moment of clarity .
It 's helpful when individuals who are already war criminals tell us of their intention to continue their murderous careers .
Those few of us who object to unjustified widescale murder may take what actions we think advisable , and the future victims of U.S. aggression may defend themselves as they deem fit and are able .
If you had thought the danger of an attack on Iran would diminish with the close of the Bush Administration , you 're ignorant , deluded and / or a fool ; I discussed that issue in detail here .
( I say that Clinton is " already " a war criminal because of Iraq , of course , and also because of her vicious support for her husband 's Balkans policy , about which more in a subsequent installment -- see " The Truth Shall Drive You Mad " for a head start . )
The second point from " Songs of Death " that deserves emphasis is Obama 's " justification " for U.S. intervention abroad , a justification so comprehensive that it permits U.S. intervention on any basis , anywhere , at any time :
See the full essay for the details , and for the meaning of the " healthy chicken " reference .
Confronted with the close to unanimous refusal to face the excessively bloody facts , it is with some relief that I find a few individuals who have not completely succumbed to the mind - numbing commandments of Obamamania .
About the retention of Robert Gates , Matthew Rothschild writes
Ah , yes : " efficiency , " which also goes by the term , " competence " -- the beloved goals of every monstrous regime in history .
But this should not come as news , either .
For several years , I have repeatedly made the point that the Democrats have no objection to endless U.S. interventions or to wars of aggression , nor are they repulsed in the smallest degree by unjustified slaughter .
The Democrats only want U.S. murders to be managed " well " and accomplished " competently . "
For empires , " neatness " is a great virtue .
Bloodstains on the plush carpets of the corridors of power are distressingly unpleasant , do n't you know .
See , as just one example , the discussion of Point One in , " Trapped in the Wrong Paradigm .
" The persistence and comprehensiveness of our mythmaking are revealed even in Rothschild 's otherwise clear - eyed analysis .
Rothschild commits two major errors , one at the very opening of his article :
So even though Rothschild goes on to argue correctly that Obama " does n’t really want a change in foreign and military policy " and that " Obama proves he ’s not about ending the U.S. empire , " his prefatory remarks largely blunt his own assessment .
You see , Obama 's " suckered himself . "
He doesn ' tbelieve it , not in his heart of hearts , not if he were fully true to his best instincts .
Which are you going to believe -- Obama 's own numerous statements and actions , his repeated declarations of the " truth " of American exceptionalism and all its bloody consequences , and his plans for interminable future American interventions , or your self - generated delusions about what Obama " really " stands for as a " thoughtful , " " reflective , " " progressive " leader ?
The undeniable truth -- or your preferred , self - flattering fantasy ?
This particular fantasy ( including its many variations ) is the favorite of many liberals and progressives , and it is their preferred method of avoiding the fact that this " progressive " leader is a war criminal , of the past , present and future .
I suppose if I had voted for him , I 'd avoid the meaning of my own actions as well .
History has repeatedly taught us that this is one of the primary routes to hell , yet most of us refuse to learn the lesson .
Rothschild 's second error , one shared by a great many people , is his contention that Obama " vowed to end " the " Iraq War . "
This is profoundly wrong in several respects .
Moreover , Obama has never " vowed " any such thing , not if you understand the meaning ofof his statements on this subject .
In short , this is another of Obama 's lies , and an especially heinous one .
But he 's already lied about so many issues , what 's one more ?
How do I know Obama has lied on this point ?
BecauseIf you 've been paying attention to all he has said and its necessary meaning , you already know this , and this conclusion is fully demonstrated by his recent appointments .
I 'll turn to Iraq and Obama 's " promises " about it in the next installment .
Obama rallies in Alaska draw 2,500
Events emphasized Alaska 's voter registration deadline
About 2,500 Alaskans participated in statewide rallies in support of the Obama - Biden ticket Saturday , despite near - freezing temperatures throughout much of the state .
The events emphasized today 's voter registration deadline .
In downtown Anchorage at the Veteran 's Memorial , more than 1,300 Alaskans signed supporter cards for Obama - Biden , with approximately 1,500 in attendance .
In addition , about 600 supporters attended a simultaneous rally in Juneau and 400 attended a rally in Fairbanks .
" This was one of the largest grassroots campaign events in Alaska 's 50 - year history , " said Kat Pustay , Alaska State Director , Obama for America .
Over 100 residents from the Mat - Su valley , which includes Wasilla and Palmer , traveled to attend at the Anchorage rally .
In addition to a formal speaking program , the rallies incorporated grassroots activities .
For example , Alaskans wrote more than 1,700 postcards to residents in Lower 48 " swing states , " expressing their support for Barack Obama 's policies on the economy , veterans ' benefits , women 's issues , and more .
" What we saw today was that Alaskans are hungry for trusted leadership that cares about the middle class , " Pustay said .
Shelly Morgan , 32 , a six - year Alaskan resident and an active volunteer at Barack Obama 's Campaign for Change Headquarters , attended the Anchorage rally .
" The McCain - Palin ticket is completely out - of - touch with the needs of residents of the Frontier State , " she said .

If you had any doubt about the depth of trouble the Screen Actors Guild is in right now , you only had to pick up Wednesday ’s LA Times op - ed page , where Melissa Gilbert , a former SAG president , basically read the riot act to the current SAG administration , calling their upcoming strike authorization vote a " foolhardy move that endangers not only the union , but our entire entertainment industry . "
While acknowledging that the deal on the table has its flaws , she asked a pertinent question , in light of the fact that unemployment in California is expected to reach 9 % next year : " How can any SAG member vote to knowingly put so many people in our industry into further jeopardy during the largest financial crisis since the Depression ? "
It ’s no secret that SAG is now a guild divided against itself , with a hugely influential group of stars having joined a growing legion of rank - and - file realists who are now firmly aligned against any kind of strike .
Living in its own dream world , the SAG leadership is still steaming full speed ahead , Titanic - style , oblivious to all the icebergs in its path , with its plan to send out strike authorization ballots January 2nd .
The guild needs a 75 % approval by those voting to forge ahead with a strike .
However , in her piece , Gilbert revealed just how serious the union ’s divisions are by introducing an explosive new phrase into the contentious debate , a phrase that must have sent chills down the spine of SAG president Alan Rosenberg .
Boldly predicting that many working guild members are not only determined to vote against a strike but “ will not honor if one is called , ” she used the phrase you only hear when a union is starting to splinter — “ financial core . ”
Known in guild parlance as fi-core , it is the way dissenting members give up their guild membership but retain their union protection while opting to work during a strike .
The fact that Gilbert even voiced the phrase tells you that Rosenberg and SAG chief negotiator Doug Allen have managed to thoroughly alienate a host of guild stalwarts with their capricious leadership .
After being rocked by a lengthy strike by the WGA earlier this year , no one in Hollywood , from the highest - salaried studio boss to the lowliest office temp , wants to suffer through another work stoppage , especially with studios already having firing hundreds of employees in recent days .
Knowing it has been painted into a corner , SAG is going with its one last option — call for a strike vote , hope to win an overwhelming mandate and then , using a strike threat as leverage , try to wrangle a few face - saving concessions from studio negotiators .
“ Studios Avert SAG Strike : Deal Sweetened With 11th Hour Compromise ” would be the way Variety would headline the pact .
There ’s only one problem with SAG ’s strategy .
It ’s increasingly unlikely that it will get a 75 % vote , much less an impressive majority .
And even if it does , the studios wo n’t play ball .
Infuriated by the guild leadership ’s refusal to accept a deal every other union took earlier this year , buffeted by all sorts of bad economic news and worried that DVD sales will continue to crater in the coming months , the studios are n’t planning to do any more negotiating .
Rightly or wrongly , the deal they put on the table is n’t getting any better .
It ’s take it or leave it time .
The doves in the studio firmament are hoping the guild will toss out its current leadership , paving the way for a more pragmatic team to take control .
The hawks simply want to crush the guild like a bug .
As Variety recently reported , 20th Century Fox has already acknowledged that it would n’t rule out switching its current TV series from SAG to AFTRA contracts , a move Warners said it could make as well .
AFTRA has said it would n’t participate in such a move , but it was another crystal clear message that the studios plan to play hardball .
Using the current economic troubles as a handy excuse , they ’d like nothing better than to rollback some of the gains the guilds have made in recent years .
Apparently oblivious to what a bad hand they have in this poker game , SAG is playing into the hard - liner ’s hands , threatening to undue many of the impressive gains the Writers Guild achieved during its strike .
The WGA did n’t just win some valuable concessions from the studios , it persuaded many industry observers that a show business guild could be a responsible player in the game , flexing its muscles , handily trouncing the studios in the PR battle and sticking up for its members without tossing them all off a cliff .
It ’s hard to fathom what the SAG leadership ’s game plan is right now .
To use a metaphor that Doug Allen , a former negotiator for the NFL players association might understand , SAG is like a football team deep in their own territory at the end of the fourth quarter , down a couple of touchdowns , without their best players on the field .
Taking a strike vote in the middle of a deep recession is like tossing a Hail Mary pass on fourth and long .
There ’s really only one way the game can end and it ’s not pretty .
Where 's Joe ?
Joe the Plumber , who has done a healthy TV round and has an agent , appears not to have made it to McCain 's rally today .
Not just a rhetorical question .
What do you think has John McCain so angry ?
It ’s like anything could send him over the edge .
Look at the video ( the McCain vids start about 30 seconds in ) .
Send me your thoughts …
Last night was doubly unusual for me .
I had time to watch TV , and there was something on a Saturday night I was willing to watch .
I tuned in to the story of the political awakening of John Adams , the 2nd President of the USA .
In their vivid and simplified documentary way the film makers captured the rising tensions in America against the bovine insensitivity of the British government .
We saw John Adams , the honest and fair minded man , defend British redcoats against false charges of murder from an angry crowd that had taunted and assaulted them .
We saw him turn down preferment from the clumsy colonial authorities , only to go on to advance radical proposals concenring the rights of man when even for him the autocratic inflexibility of the British government became too much to stand , let alone defend .
He and his fellow delegates to the Convention fashioned the philosophy and the fine words of freedom that made the intellectual backbone of the new Republic .
They shamed the gross incompetence of the British some 130 years after Parliament had had to make a stand for its rights against the Crown .
The irony of Britain moving from home of liberty to colonial oppressor could not have been missed by the English gentlemen who made the Amrican revolution .
I wondered if any Americans watching could see some of the irony now that America is viewed as the oppressor by some in countries where she uses her troops against the will of the locals .
The cause of freedom requires tolerance to the differing views of others in most circumstances .
It made me think how much today we need to fashion a new coalition for liberty in our own country .
The countless intrusions into our freedoms have often been criticised individually but when we look back over the last decade the total impact is large .
Much damage has been done in the false name of security .
More has been done by taking in vain the name of social justice , and still more in misguided ways to save the planet .
The government has found causes it thinks are higher than liberty , and has then invented ways of seeking to further them that all result in the same dead and deadly end – more state power , more state control , more taxation , more rights and privileges for the governing and more duties and obligations for the rest of us .
When I go the local shops this morning I will doubtless see several people breaking the law , as many do now most of the time .
Some will drive at 35 mph believing they do so safely in a 30 mph zone .
Some will park on the double yellow lines in the side road close to the shop , seeing no harm as they will not bock the road .
Doubtless some will fail to record cash payments for their businesses in their tax account file .
Some businesses will be trading today in ways that doubtless violate some little known or unloved regulation .
Some break laws because they cannot see the point of the laws , some break them inadvertently because there are so many to know about , and some break them because it makes their lives easier to break them .
Recent research has unearthed just how many thousands of new criminal offences this government has introduced , finding new ways to ensnare the usually law abiding .
If you invent enough complicated forms , difficult requirements and new rules for business and the general citizenry you will end up making criminals of most .
To what purpose ?
As I watched the Adams story unfold I knew I would have been with the crowd in demanding liberty in 1770s Masachusetts .
I today I am with all those of you who feel there are too many taxes , too many spy cameras , too many new rules , too many needless interventions in our daily lives .
We need to rebuild our free society .
As we emerge from the Credit Crunch the message should not be that we need more government , but we need wiser government .
We do not need more red coats with better weapons , but someone in charge who knows the temper of the people and trusts them to be freer and to make of their own decisions .
When we get a change of government we do not want managerialists who think it is just a question of running the existing system better , but freedom lovers who ask which bits of the creaking machinery of state do we need to keep running , and which can we pension off .
Men and women in Brtain are no longer born free , and live in chains .
We need to burst them , to trust people more and governments less .
It was big government working with regulated big banks that got us into our current economic mess .
It was big government running scared of terrorism that sought to protect us with guards and gates in ways which cannot work when we need to win hearts and minds .
I just wish the architects of the current autocracy had watched and understood last night ’s docusoap of freedom .
They should see that there is relevance today in Britain from those events long ago on the wintry Eastern seaboard of a great country .
Blame Bill Clinton : Ever since the former president confounded Congress — and the nation — with his semantically driven definition of sex , the nature of the act has become increasingly vague .
In 2005 , the federal government released a study that found more than 50 percent of American teenagers had engaged in oral sex ; furthermore , they considered oral sex a less - significant substitution for intercourse .
And as the generation enters adulthood , this attitude toward sex is affecting its relationships .
A recent study conducted by the University of Northern Iowa and Pennsylvania State University finds that undergraduates in relationships hold their significant others to a stricter definition of sex than they hold themselves .
Participants were asked if their own involvement in several different sexual behaviors would count as sex ; they were then asked if those same behaviors would be considered sex if their boyfriend or girlfriend were to engage in them outside of the relationship .
The results point to a definite double standard .
" Participants answering for themselves were less likely to indicate a behavior was having sex for all behaviors except penile - anal and penile - vaginal intercourse , " researchers Gary Gute , Elaine M. Eshbaugh and Jacquelyn Wiersma write in the October 2008 issue of the Journal of Sex Research .
In addition , " men were also more likely than women to indicate most behaviors were having sex . "
Why are people fudging the facts ?
Ilene Donin , a New York City therapist who was not involved in the study , says this murkiness allows women to maintain a perceived preservation of purity , one that has extended beyond the twenty - something set .
" I have been told by women in their thirties and forties that they will ' do everything but ' have intercourse , " she says .
" That , to them , is far more intimate and more of a commitment . "
Men , on the other hand , might have more hard - wired reasons for their willingness to view any indiscretion as cheating .
" Men believe that when women have sex it is not just a pleasure - seeking behavior but an emotional experience , so it is very threatening , " Donin says .
" And I believe that on some very basic level , men still see women as their property . "
All of this makes the future of relationships seem pretty dismal — which , according to The New York Times , is n't a problem , as relationships are becoming a thing of the past , anyway .
" Hooking up is a casual sexual encounter with no expectation of future emotional commitment .
Think of it as a one - night stand with someone you know , " writes Charles M. Blow in a Dec. 13 article .
" Under [ this ] new model , you hook up a few times and , if you really like the person , you might consider going on a date . "
Just do n't hook up behind your boyfriend 's back .
That 's cheating .
Maybe .

As the queen 's representative , she will have a role to play next week when Parliament returns and a three - party opposition coalition attempts to vote down Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's minority government .
The coalition announced its plans to vote down the government because of a perceived lack of economic leadership .
It would be led by Liberal leader Stephane Dion , who is stepping down May 2 after his party saw an unprecedented defeat in the October federal election .
Harper can short - circuit a non-confidence vote by suspending Parliament until Jan. 24 when a new throne speech and budget would be delivered .
Harper can also ask Jean to dissolve Parliament and call another election , although she also has the power to grant the coalition its request to assume leadership , the Star said .
The Liberals , socialist New Democratic Party and separatist Bloc Quebecois have a total of 163 parliamentary seats to the Conservatives ' 143 .

As hilarious and .gif worthy the incident was yesterday that saw an Iraqi journalist chucking his shoes at President Bush , did we really need a flash game ?
Apparently so .

The company T - Enterprise must be quick with their flash programming ( or they knew about the incident beforehand ! ) , because in less than 24 hours they managed to churn out a game ( albeit a crappy one ) where you must defend the President from shoes being thrown his way .
" If you watch the video clip , the Secret Service do n't move to protect the President until the second shoe has been thrown , " said Sadi Chishti , managing director of T - Enterprise , the Glasgow - based company behind the computer game .
" We 're hoping the agents will use this game as a training aid for future footwear attacks on world leaders . "

Rather than batting the shoes down with your arms or hands , though , the game makes you shoot the shoes , with a good chance at hitting the President .
Game Politics noted that was probably by design .
I have to be honest , the first time I played it I unloaded into the President thinking that was the objective .
WHOOPS !
You can play this " game " after the jump !

Bush 's Boot Camp ( Telegraph via Game Politics )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A missile shield test was a " smashing success , " Pentagon officials said Friday , despite the failure of the test to put to rest concerns that the interceptor might not be able to differentiate between real missiles and decoys .
Eight of the United States ' 13 missile defense tests have been deemed a success .
The ground - based interceptor missile , launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , destroyed a long - range ballistic missile launched from Kodiak , Alaska , the Defense Department 's Missile Defense Agency said .
But one key aspect of the test -- to see whether the system could tell the difference between a missile and a decoy aimed at confounding its " seek " systems -- failed because the decoy did not deploy .
Officials told CNN on Thursday that Friday 's test would be the most realistic of 13 missile shield system tests conducted to date .
Eight of the 13 tests have now been deemed a success by the Pentagon .
Watch a Pentagon spokesman explain the Friday 's problem »
This was the first test in which a crew at an alternate fire control center in Alaska remotely launched the interceptor missile from California .
The " initial indications , " according to the Defense Department , are that all components of Friday 's test performed as designed .
Critics have long complained that the tests are not realistic because they do n't involve balloons or other simple decoys that , they argue , could easily fool the interceptor .

U.S. rejects Russian call to scrap missile defense Obama rolls out national security team
In Friday 's test , however , the target was a mock warhead and was supposed to be accompanied by " countermeasures similar to what Iran or North Korea could deploy , " according to a missile defense agency official .
The intention was for the interceptor 's kill vehicle to distinguish the target from the decoys .
But the decoy that was supposed to deploy to test the system did not .
The Pentagon blamed a 40 - year - old target system .
" Countermeasures are very difficult to deploy .
We have had trouble deploying them in the past , " said Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly , director for the Missile Defense Agency .
But O'Reilly said that the interceptor did differentiate between the actual missile target and the upper stage of the missile it had detached from .
The test , which had been delayed several times , comes at a crucial time for the $ 100 billion system , as President - elect Barack Obama is about to take office .
Early in his campaign , Obama pledged to " cut investments in unproven missile defense systems . "
But he later said he would support missile defense systems if they work .
" The biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons , " Obama said in the September 26 presidential debate .
" And we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense .
And I actually believe that we need missile defense , because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons . "
Friday 's test also showed the Pentagon that multiple sensor systems were able to network together and hone in on a single object , O'Reilly said .
" All those sensors working together , at any one time the system knew which sensor was reporting what and tracking it and gave the war fighter one presentation of a target , " O'Reilly said soon after the test was finished .
" That was one tremendous accomplishment for us . "
Last month , the outgoing head of the Missile Defense Agency said that not only are U.S. missile defenses workable , they are up and running .
" Our testing has shown not only can we hit a bullet with a bullet , we can hit a spot on the bullet with a bullet .
The technology has caught up , " Lt. Gen .

PRAGUE 
In the 1980s , a Communist secret police agent infiltrated clandestine economics seminars hosted by Vaclav Klaus , a fiery future leader of the Czech Republic , who had come under suspicion for extolling free market virtues .
Rather than reporting on Marxist heresy , the agent was most struck by Mr. Klaus ’s now famous arrogance .
“ His behavior and attitudes reveal that he feels like a rejected genius , ” the agent noted in his report , which has since been made public .
“ He shows that whoever does not agree with his views is stupid and incompetent . ”
Decades later , Mr. Klaus , the 67 - year - old president of the Czech Republic  an iconoclast with a perfectly clipped mustache  continues to provoke strong reactions .
He has blamed what he calls the misguided fight against global warming for contributing to the international financial crisis , branded Al Gore an “ apostle of arrogance ” for his role in that fight , and accused the European Union of acting like a Communist state .
Now the Czech Republic is about to assume the rotating presidency of the European Union and there is palpable fear that Mr. Klaus will embarrass the world ’s biggest trading bloc and complicate its efforts to address the economic crisis and expand its powers .
His role in the Czech Republic is largely ceremonial , but he remains a powerful force here , has devotees throughout Europe and delights in basking in the spotlight .
With the death of David Foster Wallace , the author of “ Infinite Jest , ” who took his own life on Sept. 12 , the world of contemporary American fiction lost its most intellectually ambitious writer .
Like his peers Richard Powers and William T. Vollmann , Wallace wrote big , brainy novels that were encyclopedically packed with information and animated by arcane ideas .
In nonfiction essays , he tackled a daunting range of highbrow topics , including lexicography , poststructuralist literary theory and the science , ethics and epistemology of lobster pain .
He wrote a book on the history and philosophy of the mathematics of infinity .
Even his signature stylistic device — the extensive use of footnotes and endnotes — was a kind of scholarly homage .
But Wallace was also wary of ideas .
He was perpetually on guard against the ways in which abstract thinking ( especially thinking about your own thinking ) can draw you away from something more genuine and real .
To read his acutely self - conscious , dialectically fevered writing was often to witness the agony of cognition : how the twists and turns of thought can both hold out the promise of true understanding and become a danger to it .
Wallace was especially concerned that certain theoretical paradigms — the cerebral aestheticism of modernism , the clever trickery of postmodernism — too casually dispense with what he once called “ the very old traditional human verities that have to do with spirituality and emotion and community . ”
He called for a more forthright , engaged treatment of these basic truths .
Yet he himself attended to them with his own fractured , often - esoteric methods .
It was a defining tension : the very conceptual tools with which he pursued life ’s most desperate questions threatened to keep him forever at a distance from the connections he struggled to make .
Given his considerable intellectual gifts and large cult following , it may come as a surprise to learn that Wallace ’s one formal , systematic contribution to the world of ideas was never published and remains almost completely unknown .
This is his undergraduate honors thesis in philosophy — “ Richard Taylor ’s ‘ Fatalism ’ and the Semantics of Physical Modality ” — which he submitted for a degree at Amherst College in 1985 .
Its obscurity is easy enough to understand .
A highly specialized , 76 - page work of semantics and metaphysics , it is not for the philosophically faint of heart .
Brace yourself for a sample sentence : “ Let Φ ( a physical possibility structure ) be a set of distinct but intersecting paths j i –j n , each of which is a set of functions , L’s , on ordered pairs {t , w} ( {time , world situation} ) , such that for any L n , L m in some j i , L n R L m , where R is a primitive accessibility relation corresponding to physical possibility understood in terms of diachronic physical compatibility . ”
There are reasons that he ’s better known for an essay about a boat .
For all its inscrutability , though , the thesis represents an important phase in Wallace ’s development .
Once its goals and ambitions are understood , the paper casts a revealing light on the early stages of his struggle to use the powers of his formidable mind for the higher good : to protect against the seductions of the intellect , and to find solid ground for his most urgent and heartfelt convictions .

WASHINGTON ( JTA ) —
This month marks the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht , the infamous night of horror on Germany ’s Jews .
" The Night of Broken Glass " served as a prelude to the Holocaust , during which an array of Europe ’s minorities — Jews primary among them — were brutally slaughtered en masse as a result of government - led anti-Semitic , racist , xenophobic , anti-religious and anti-gay policies .
Despite the notable improvements in civil rights and race relations of the past 70 years , we find ourselves today facing the threat of personal violence motivated by those same biases .
Violent hate crimes are on the rise , reflecting an overall increase in xenophobic attitudes across Europe and North America , a revival of anti-Semitism and a continuation of prejudice against Muslims , Roma , and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) persons .
Though governments are not now the perpetrators of the violence , they are failing to do everything in their power to stop it .
Last year ’s disturbing developments included record levels of anti-Semitic violence in the United Kingdom , a nearly one - fifth jump in racially motivated attacks in Russia and a 24 percent increase in violent incidents involving sexual orientation bias in the United States , according to a recent survey by Human Rights First .
The trend across Europe , the fomer Soviet Union and North America is alarming .
One critical question is how to get governments to acknowledge hate crimes and take steps against them .
There is no easy answer .
In many countries , human rights organizations that might document and calm tensions simply do not exist .
Many governments lack the will or the ability to tackle deeply rooted racial , ethnic , religious , cultural and sexual hatreds .
Some , it must be said , simply turn a blind eye toward hate crimes out of indifference or for political considerations .
Worse , others may even stir hatreds out of cynical self - interest .
Democratic nations , too , often have failed to systematically address hate crimes .
The survey reveals that only 13 of the 56 countries that make up the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the world ’s largest regional security body , have adequate hate - crime monitoring and reporting systems in place .
More than 40 nations fail to collect and publish complete information on hate crimes and thus do n’t have a clear picture of the problem .
International nongovernmental organizations such as Human Rights
First seek to overcome these roadblocks by exposing the reality of hate crimes through the gathering and publicizing of data from nongovernmental sources and the media .
This is critical work ; demonstrating the extent of the problem serves as a powerful advocacy tool for pushing recalcitrant nations to take responsibility for crimes within their borders .
This strategy has resulted in several recent improvements :
* In Canada , the government for the first time collected and released national hate crime statistics .
* In Croatia , authorities prosecuted their first hate crime case , using a new hate crime law to prosecute a man who attempted to firebomb a gay pride parade .
* In the Netherlands , where only NGOs previously collected hate crime statistics , authorities have undertaken new measures to register and track cases of hate crimes through the criminal justice system .
* In Norway , although official hate crime statistics are not currently available , the justice minister has noted that hate violence against gay men and others is increasing , and announced that police have begun to register such crimes .
* In the United Kingdom , the government has taken a number of steps to enhance its response by committing to produce nationwide statistics on anti-Semitic hate crime by 2009 .
* In Ukraine , the government created an interministerial commission to combat racism and xenophobia .
These are tangible and important steps forward .
Of course , much remains to be done .
Legal and administrative directives are meaningless unless police and other security forces are trained and prodded to track hate crimes and enforce provisions to investigate and prosecute them as such .
Additionally , hate crime definitions must be broadened to include all forms of bias that might be the grounds for hate violence .
Today , few governments systematically collect information on anti-Semitic hate crimes , even as NGOs have reported significant increases in such crimes .
This is the case in some nations with long histories of anti-Semitism .
On the other hand France , whose nearly half - million - member Jewish community is one of the world ’s largest , has achieved considerable success in its efforts to combat anti-Semitism .
The government has ordered police to work with the Jewish community in responding to anti-Semitic violence .
The number of crimes has dropped significantly , although more remains to be done .
Hate crimes committed against Muslims in much of Europe and North America also go largely undocumented .
Only five of the 56 OSCE member states publicly report such incidents .
Nations are sensitive about their image abroad — and much more so in a world made smaller by globalization .
Even authoritarian regimes take pains to burnish their image , if only to encourage international investment .
Nothing diminishes a nation ’s luster as does documenting and publicizing its human rights failings .
This leverage must not be wasted .
We must continue to hold governments ’ feet to the fire by revealing the failure to pay attention to hate crimes .

It has been nine months since our last Web Inspector update and we have a lot of cool things to talk about .
If you diligently use the Web Inspector in nightly builds , you might have seen some of these improvements , while other subtle changes might have gone unnoticed .
Some of the Web Inspector improvements were contributed by members of the WebKit community .
We really want to get the whole community involved with making this the best web development tool available .
Remember , most of the Web Inspector is written in HTML , JavaScript , and CSS , so it ’s easy to get started making changes and improvements .
Redesigned Interface
First and foremost , the Web Inspector is now sporting a new design that organizes information into task - oriented groups — represented by icons in the toolbar .
The toolbar items ( Elements , Resources , Scripts , Profiles and Databases ) are named after the fundamental items you will work with inside the respective panels .
Console
The Console is now accessible from any panel .
Unlike the other panels , the Console is not just used for one task — it might be used while inspecting the DOM , debugging JavaScript or analyzing HTML parse errors .
The Console toggle button is found in the status bar , causing it to animate in and out from the bottom of the Web Inspector .
The Console can also be toggled by the Escape key .

Elements Panel
The Elements panel is largely the same as the previous DOM view — at least visually .
Under the hood we have made number of changes and unified everything into one DOM tree .
Descend into sub-documents — expanding a frame or object element will show you the DOM tree for the document inside that element .

Resources Panel
The Resources panel is a supercharged version of the previous Network panel .
It has a similar looking timeline waterfall , but a lot has been done to make it even more useful .
Graph by size — click
Size in the sidebar to quickly see the largest resources downloaded .

Multiple sorting options — there are many sorting methods available for the Time graph , including latency and duration .

View XHRs — the time and size graphs also show XMLHttpRequests .
Selecting an XHR resource in the sidebar will show the XHR data and headers .
Scripts Panel
The previous standalone Drosera JavaScript debugger has been replaced with a new JavaScript debugger integrated into the Web Inspector .
The new integrated JavaScript debugger is much faster than Drosera , and should be much more convenient .
From the Scripts panel you can see all the script resources that are part of the inspected page .
Clicking in the line gutter of the script will set a breakpoint for that line of code .
There are the standard controls to pause , resume and step through the code .
While paused you will see the current call stack and in - scope variables in the right - hand sidebar .
The Web inspector has a unique feature regarding in - scope variables : it shows closures , “ with ” statements , and event - related scope objects separately .
This gives you a clearer picture of where your variables are coming from and why things might be breaking ( or even working correctly by accident ) .
Profiles Panel
The brand new JavaScript Profiler in the Profiles panel helps you identify where execution time is spent in your page ’s JavaScript functions .
The sidebar on the left lists all the recorded profiles and a tree view on the right shows the information gathered for the selected profile .
Profiles that have the same name are grouped as sequential runs under a collapsible item in the sidebar .
There are two ways to view a profile : bottom up ( heavy ) or top down ( tree ) .
Each view has its own advantages .
The heavy view allows you to understand which functions have the most performance impact and the calling paths to those functions .
The tree view gives you an overall picture of the script ’s calling structure , starting at the top of the call - stack .
Below the profile are a couple of data mining controls to facilitate the dissection of profile information .
The focus button ( Eye symbol ) will filter the profile to only show the selected function and its callers .
The exclude button ( X symbol ) will remove the selected function from the entire profile and charge its callers with the excluded function ’s total time .
While any of these data mining features are active , a reload button is available that will restore the profile to its original state .
WebKit ’s JavaScript profiler is fully compatible with Firebug ’s console.profile ( ) and console.profileEnd ( )
APIs , but you can also specify a title in console.profileEnd ( ) to stop a specific profile if multiple profiles are being recorded .
You can also record a profile using the Start / Stop Profiling button in the Profiles panel .
Databases Panel
The Databases panel lets you interact with HTML 5 Database storage .
You can examine the contents of all of the page ’s open databases and execute SQL queries against them .
Each database is shown in the sidebar .
Expanding a database ’s disclosure triangle will show the database ’s tables .
Selecting a database table will show you a data grid containing all the columns and rows for that table .
Selecting a database in the sidebar will show an interactive console for evaluating SQL queries .
The input in this console has auto- completion and tab - completion for common SQL words and phrases along with table names for the database .
Search
Accompanying the task - oriented reorganization , the search field in the toolbar now searches the current panel with results being highlighted in the context of the panel .
Targeting the search to the current panel allows each panel to support specialized queries that are suited for the type of information being shown .
The panels that support specialized queries are Elements and Profiles .
The Elements panel supports XPath and CSS selectors as queries in addition to plain text .
Any search you perform will be attempted as a plain text search , a XPath query using document.evaluate ( ) and a CSS selector using document.querySelectorAll ( ) .
All the search results will be highlighted in the DOM tree , with the first match being revealed and selected .
The Profiles panel supports plain text searches of the function names and resource URLs .
Numeric searches are also supported that match rows in the profile ’s Self , Total and Calls columns .
To facilitate powerful numeric searching , there are a few operators and units that work to extend or limit your results .
For example you can search for “ > 2.5 ms ” to find all the functions that took longer than 2.5 milliseconds to execute .
In addition to “ ms ” , the other supported units are : “ s ” for time in seconds and “ % ” for percentage of time .
The other supported operators are “ < ” , “ < = ” , “ > = ” and “ = ” .
When no units are specified the Calls column is searched .
In all the panels pressing Enter in the search field or ⌘G ( Ctrl+G on Windows and Linux ) will reveal the next result .
Pressing ⇧ ⌘G ( Ctrl + Shift +G on Windows and Linux ) will reveal the previous result .
In the Resources , Scripts and Profiles panels the search will be performed on the visible view first and will automatically jump to the first result only if the visible view has a match .
Availability and Contributing
All of these things are available now in the Mac and Windows nightly builds .
Give them a try today , and let us know what you like ( or do n’t like ) .
If you would like to contribute , there are some really interesting tasks in the list of Web Inspector bugs and enhancements , and other contributors in the #webkit chat room are pretty much always available to provide help and advice .
Alcohol Abuse is a Dangerous Disease – But there is Help !
You may not recognize the early signs of problem drinking and for many , this alcohol abuse will lead to a more severe form of addiction that is plagued by physical and psychological dependence on alcohol .
Abusing alcohol can cause addiction to seemingly sneak up on you and before you know it , you ’ve already suffered the rash consequences of addiction .
Problem drinking can be overcome with time and treatment but the first step is to recognize the sign that there is a problem and to seek help .
Alcohol abuse is common in many cultures and the effects of drinking are widely curtailed from one person to the next .
For some , drinking socially will never become a problem while for others , the decision to drink can lead to long term consequences associated with addiction .
The bottom line is that the only way to know if drinking is a problem in your life or if you are prone to alcohol addiction is to learn how alcohol affects you personally and to know when it ’s time to stop .
If you do recognize that you have a drinking problem , you can get help and achieve lasting recovery through social support , treatment and care .
Various methods of recovery and treatment are available to assist you in your fight against this potentially fatal disease .
If you , or someone you love has a drinking problem , seek immediate help to reduce the lasting effects that this devastating disease can have .
Monday Master Class : Getting Things Done for College Students … Made Easy
October 6th , 2008 · 27 comments
Complicated Goodness
In July of 2007 , the first month of Study Hacks ’ existence , I posted an article introducing Getting Things Done for College Students ( GTDCS ) .
This time management system was a modification of David Allen ’s Getting Things Done ( GTD ) , tweaked for the college lifestyle .
It was meant for students who needed something more than the simple system described in Straight - A or in this infamously titled post .
Here ’s the problem …
Though the original article has become a cult classic among some GTD aficionados , it has also been described as …well …long and boring and complicated and hard to follow .
There .
I said it .
In this post , I want to provide a much more simple summary of GTDCS — something that does n’t require monastic concentration to understand .
Below I hit the highlights you need to get started .
If you crave the obsessive details , check out the original post .
GTDCS Made Easy
The GTDCS system is built of five pieces .
The first three match GTD almost exactly .
The last two contain the extra magic I threw in to fit the college lifestyle .
Collect Consolidate Review Plan Act
We review each piece below .
Collect
Every time a new obligation enters your life , immediately record it somewhere safe .
The key is to have a small number of collection bins in which such new tasks are always captured .
For a student , I suggest the following three collection bins : a notebook in your backpack , your e-mail inbox , and a physical inbox as your collection bins .
( The physical inbox will prove useful for capturing letters , forms , or other physical pieces of paper that need to be dealt with . )
Consolidate
Once a day , review your three collection bins .
For each item you encounter : if it ’s an appointment , meeting , or deadline , add an entry on your calendar , if it ’s a task , put it on a master to - do list you keep somewhere safe .
Review
Every Sunday , review what ’s on your calendar for the next few weeks and read through your master to - do list .
This review is crucial .
If you never look at your calendar or master to - do list , then you wo n’t trust yourself to remember the things you put here .
This will cause the whole system to fall apart .
Plan
Because you are a student , many of the tasks you face are time sensitive ; e.g. , assignments have to be done before class , studying has to be finished before the exam .
To accommodate this reality , include the following step in your Sunday review : add time sensitive tasks onto specific days on your calendar .
Everything that absolutely has to get done during the upcoming week should be put on a specific calendar day .
Act
Each morning you need to plan your day .
Your first step is to review your calendar and see what appointments , meetings , and classes you face .
Next , plan a time to work on each of the tasks that was added to this day during the planning stages .
Remember : it ’s not enough to just say you ’ll work on these tasks , you must actually block out the specific hours in which you will work .
This keeps your schedule reaslistic .
Finally , if your day does n’t look too hectic , block out some time to knock of a few non -date sensititve tasks from your master to - do list .
The ideal work day will look roughly like a normal work day ( all work done between breakfast and dinner ) , though some schedules might require work at night .
Try to avoid , however , scheduling every waking hour .
That is decidedly non-Zen .
Conclusion
If you ’re happy with your current time management system , do n’t sweat GTDCS .
If you feel constantly behind , or like you ’re forgetting things , than consider this approach .
We ’ll conclude the same way as the original article :
Many students identify the first few days of the semester as their favorite .
Why ?
Because there are no obligations yet .
No deadlines or due dates have been injected into their life .
You can relax , and enjoy the sense of possibility .
GTDCS aims to make every day feel like the first .
Sounds good to me .
A paramilitary policeman stands guard in front of the Great Hall of the People , in Beijing March 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jason Lee
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A police chief in a remote county of southwestern China has taken down 48 of his relatives , including brothers , cousins and a number of his wife ’s family , for various crimes , local media said on Tuesday .
Laobulaluo , a police chief in Heizhugou township , Sichuan province , had seen 25 relatives either jailed , sent for " re-education through labor , " or punished in other ways , according to a report posted on state news portal Chinanews.com ( www.chinanews.com.cn ) .
The police chief , who is in his 30s , is a member of China ’s Yi ethnic minority .
Over a 10 - year career , He had personally arrested a brother and two cousins after finding they had beaten local teachers at a primary school while drunk .
Other family members were arrested after stealing a woman ’s handbag .
The policeman ’s sense of duty had inflamed his relatives , some of whom had taken turns threatening his parents , and had “ even secretly cut off the tails and slashed the legs of their cows , ” the report said .
“ In the first few years , I did not dare head back to my hometown to pass the New Year holiday , but now it ’s all right .
Everyone understands and supports what I was doing at the time , ” the report quoted him as saying .
In response to the injustices of the Second World War , on December 10 , 1948 , the United Nations ’ General Assembly adopted what it called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) .
On this , the 60th anniversary of the Declaration , it is time to take a look at the ways that one of the human rights it listed , the idea of religious freedom , is being used , ironically , to further discriminatory agendas .
Here is what the Declaration has to say about religious freedom :
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief , and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in teaching , practice , worship and observance .
This right , which we have grown to take for granted , was far from certain sixty years ago when the Declaration was adopted .
As late as the 19th century , for instance , the Catholic Church rejected the right to religious freedom .
They feared that this right would marginalize religious belief ( or perhaps more accurately , they feared that this would open the door for more than one path to salvation ) .
In the course of World War II , the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and the Second Vatican Council , the Catholic Church came to be one of religious freedom ’s greatest allies .
But the clock seems to be ticking backwards .
The Catholic Church and LGBTQ Rights
On the occasion of this anniversary , France — which is , at present , heading up the European Union — and the rest of the EU , is introducing a UN declaration condemning discrimination and violence on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity .
Currently , over 80 countries have laws condemning homosexuality with punishments including anything from long - term prison sentences to the death penalty .
The Catholic Church has chosen to oppose this declaration .
But instead of citing the doctrine of the institutional Catholic Church that condemns the act of homosexuality ( not homosexuals , mind you ) , they have instead based their opposition on the right to religious freedom .
After taking some heat over several inflammatory — bordering on discriminatory — comments of apostolic nuncio to the United Nations , Archbishop Celestino Migliore , Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi stated :
[ This proposal ] introduces a declaration of political value that could result in systems of control , according to which , every norm — not only legal , but also related to the life of social or religious groups — which does not place every sexual orientation on exactly the same level could be considered as contrary to respect of human rights .
This could clearly become an instrument of pressure or discrimination against those who , just to put a very clear example , consider marriage between a man and a woman to be the fundamental and original form of social life , and as such , [ believe ] that it should have a privileged place .
What the Vatican is claiming here is that this UN declaration on LGBT rights would violate the religious freedom of those who would like to oppress homosexuals .
The Vatican is , in a brilliant stroke of PR , playing the “ religious freedom ” card by using this idea as part of a strategy .
The stance hails back to the time the Catholic Church feared that the right to religious freedom would move Catholic ideology to the fringes .
The Vatican now fears that this declaration would marginalize institutional Catholic thought on homosexuality , thereby undermining the Vatican ’s position as the moral authority on the human rights stage .
The Pulpit Initiative and Nonprofit Status
The religious right in the United States has done a similar thing , standing behind the shield of religious freedom to fight against the restriction of speech for 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations .
In 1954 , Senator Lyndon Johnson presented an amendment to Internal Revenue Code 501( c ) ( 3 ) , which was subsequently adopted by Congress .
The amendment defined nonprofit tax - exempt entities — including churches — as those “ which [ do ] not participate in , or intervene in ( including the publishing or distributing of statements ) , any political campaign on behalf of ( or in opposition to ) any candidate for public office . ”
During the recent election cycle , the Alliance Defense Fund ( ADF ) — who considers itself the antithesis of the American Civil Liberties Union — launched their “ Pulpit Initiative ” to combat the 1954 Johnson Amendment .
ADF considers the restriction a violation of a church ’s right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion .
The Pulpit Initiative White Paper states :
The prohibition also violates the free exercise of religion .
Under the Free Exercise Clause , laws are closely scrutinized by courts when they discriminate against religion or when they substantially burden religious exercise and other constitutional rights are also at stake …
When the IRS threatens to revoke a church ’s tax - exempt status for a pastor ’s sermon from the pulpit , it is expressly discriminating against religious speech .
Such direct discrimination , and the prospect of civil or criminal penalties , make the amendment unconstitutional .
Joe Conn , spokesperson for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , suggested that the ADF ’s project was simply a “ stunt ” by the religious right to “ put their candidates into office .
It ’s part of the overall game plan . ”
Assuming Conn is right in his assertion , then the ADF is using the idea of religious freedom in the most cynical way , seeming to place religious freedom above all other rights — such as the right to self - determination — in order to achieve their political goals .
The Religious Left and Proposition 8
The religious left seems to have picked up on this strategy as well , but with a different aim .
On November 4 , the state of California passed Proposition 8 , which adds the following phrase to the California state constitution : “ only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ”
Losing Prop 8 by only a slight margin , the progressive community has been working together to find solutions to negate the passage of this discriminatory amendment .
On November 17 , California religious leaders and organizations , including the Unitarian Universalist Legislative Ministry of California , the General Synod of the United Church of Chirst , two Episcopal Bishops , and the Progressive Jewish Alliance , filed a petition with the California Supreme Court “ asking the court to invalidate Proposition 8 . ”
The petition asserts that Proposition 8 is a violation of the right to religious freedom .
It states :
If Proposition 8 is valid , taking away from gay men and lesbian citizens the right to equal protection of the laws as it affects a fundamental right ( the right to marry ) , then the petitioners ’ right to be free from discrimination or persecution on the basis of religion is similiarly vulnerable to being overridden in a general election by a simple majority vote …
We must remind ourselves , even today , that minorities in general — and religious minorities in particular — require protection from the majorities .
Although a person ’s religion is not an “ immutable , ” it is , like other characteristics that receive strict scrutiny , an “ integral aspect of a person ’s identity ” which it is not “ appropriate to require a person to repudiate … in order to avoid discriminatory treatment . ”
Here , religious groups are using the idea of religious freedom to protect the rights of gay men and lesbians .
They are not creating a hierarchy of rights with religion at the top , but calling for the equal protection of all rights — from the right to religious freedom to the right to marry .
So , is Religious Freedom a Right , or Just Another Card to be Played ?
When they claim that freedom of religion trumps all other rights — like the right to safety , the right to education , the right to equality in the workplace , and so on — religious groups are assuming a hierarchy of rights that simply does not exist anywhere in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights :
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration , without distinction of any kind , such as race , color , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status .
On this anniversary , as we note the different ways religious communities have used the idea of religious freedom , it must be remembered that the UDHR called for human rights without distinction .
" For The Bible Tells Me So " is a thought - provoking and informative movie for people who are struggling with guilt and oppression resulting from conflicts over religion and homosexuality .
The film gives an accurate analysis of the passages on homosexuality in the context of the time period , and offers brilliant insight in showing that sexual minorities are not sinners as has been mistaught by religious scholars for centuries .
Discovering Pride provides links to all 10 youtube clips for you to view at your leisure .
This is a powerful film and should be seen by all LGBTQ people of faithsand for all those who believe homosexuality is a sin .

Long ago , Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion , which were the work of genius .
But Sir Isaac ’s talents did n’t extend to investing :
He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble , explaining later , ‘ I can calculate the movement of the stars , but not the madness of men . ’
If he had not been traumatized by this loss , Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion :

After a heady experience of that kind , normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball .
They know that overstaying the festivities — that is , continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future — will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice .
But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party .

@ Reyn ,
I know some off the top of my head !
' Everything looks bad if you remember it '' They have the internet on computers now ? '
And ...' The internet - where the whole world can see what some nerd thinks about Star Trek '
Imagine a store where most of the products are kept in the back .
You order from the cashier .
The products can't be sold below a legislated minimum price .
And the overwhelming majority are made by one of three large companies , which also own the store .
In Ontario , that is how $ 2.5 billion worth of beer is sold each year .
Surprisingly , few consumers know this is the set - up .
On a sunny Friday afternoon , shoppers outside The Beer Store at Bayview and Eglinton were surprised to learn the government does n't own the store .
Some said they 'd like to see beer sold in corner stores , for convenience , and said they hope competition would lead to lower prices .
" I 'd like to see the price of beer go down , " said Grant Skiffington , 57 .
Six out of 10 people think The Beer Store is a government entity similar to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario , according an independent survey for a review of the distribution and sale of alcohol in Ontario .
In reality , the retail chain responsible for just over 80 per cent of beer sales in Ontario " is essentially a private monopoly " owned by the province 's three largest brewers , Labatt , Molson and Sleeman , the provincial study noted .
The brewers , in turn , belong to some of the highest - grossing beer makers in the world – Belgium 's InBev SA , the United States ' Molson Coors Brewing Co. and Japan 's Sapporo .
Analysts estimate that these foreign entities earn a combined $ 1 billion a year in profits in Canada , mostly in Ontario , making the province one of the most lucrative beer markets in the world .
And Ontario's beer consumers pay the freight , with higher prices , less choice and lack of convenience , the Beverage Alcohol System Review concluded three years ago .
The review recommended opening beer sales to competition .
But Ontario's government decided against sweeping changes .
So little has changed .
A 24 - pack of popular brands , such as Coors Light , is regularly priced at $ 36.95 in Ontario , at least 25 per cent more than in such markets as Quebec and New York State , where beer is almost always on sale .
The brewers who own The Beer Store argue that taxes account for much of the difference in prices , and say the chain is one of the most efficient , environmentally friendly , socially responsible beer - marketing systems in the world .
Moreover , the brewers say they uphold the founding principles of what was originally a co-operative , ensuring access to all brewers and brands .
But many smaller brewers , restaurant operators and convenience store owners say that it 's time the province took a closer look at how beer is sold in Ontario .
In 1927 , at the close of Prohibition , Brewers Warehousing Co. Ltd. was founded as a brewers ' co-operative .

The provincial government retained control of the sale of wine and spirits through the LCBO , but beer , with its lower alcohol content , could be distributed by the hundreds of mom-and - pop breweries .
Initially , the brewers were involved only in wholesale operations , jointly warehousing and distributing their product to stores operated by private contractors .
But in 1940 , the brewers bought out the contractors and took over the stores , changing their name to Brewers Retail Inc .
The stores were later renamed The Beer Store .
Along the way , Canada 's beer industry changed dramatically .
Governments signed trade agreements in the 1990s that removed barriers to beer sales between provinces and countries .
The Beer Store began selling imported beer , which the LCBO had carried for years .
For a while , competition increased .
Successive waves of consolidation – in the 1950s and 1960s , then again in the 1990s – saw ownership of the beer industry shrink to the current handful of multinationals .
The Beer Store ended up in the hands of some of the world 's largest brewers .
Government oversight dwindled to a handful of regulations related to public safety .
Beer prices soared .
" I can't believe we let that go on , " says Chris Wilcox , general manager of Quickie Convenience Stores , based in Ottawa .
" How does this province legislate two ( or three ) foreign - owned multinationals to run the manufacturing , distribution and the retail network for beer in this province ?
...
That 's like telling Ford and General Motors , ` You 're the only two companies that can sell cars in this province . ' "
Convenience store operators have long wanted to take over beer and wine sales , partly to help offset declining sales of tobacco .
Restaurant , bar and hotel owners , would love to be able to sell booze for " off - premise " consumption .
" What we question is the total lack of transparency at The Beer Store .
They are not beholden to anyone .
There 's no real overseer , " says Syd Girling , strategic issues and research manager at the Ontario Restaurant Hotel & Motel Association .
But successive governments have been loath to privatize sales of booze , fearing it could lead to more crime , drunkenness , underage drinking and other public ills .

When the workers at Republic Windows and Doors -- in Chicago , USA -- were notified their factory would close in three days , they took matters into their own hands .
The unionised workers seized control of the factory for six days to demand the entitlements they were owed by law .
They also demanded that Bank of America , which was ``bailed out '' with taxpayers ' money just weeks before , make funds available to the company to pay the workers .
On the sixth day , December 10 , 2008 , of their occupation , they won all their demands , and showed the world 's working class a classic example of people 's power .
This short video from Labor Beat ( http://www.laborbeat.org) represents a fraction of its coverage of this historic event ( something not seen in the USA for decades ) .
Republic workers protest against Bank of America , December 10 , 2008
Solidarity with Republic workers
December 15 , 2008 -- Socialist Worker --
The sit -in by more than 200 workers at Chicago 's Republic Windows and Doors factory galvanised solidarity actions in cities across the US last week as people identified the fight for justice at Republic as their own fight .
The workers -- members of the United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers of America ( UE ) Local 1110 -- began occupying the plant on December 5 , after learning that they would not be paid the severance and vacation time they were owed .
Republic 's main creditor , Bank of America , had cut off the factory 's line of credit -- despite US $ 25 billion in taxpayers ' money that the bank received as part of Congress ' Wall Street bailout .
People across the country facing foreclosure , unemployment and economic uncertainty , saw in the fight back at Republic proof that it is possible to stand up and win -- even against Corporate America .
In Chicago , up to 1000 supporters turned out to Bank of America 's downtown headquarters December 10 for a picket that included unionists , activists and Republic workers themselves .
" The people work , and guess whose money is in these banks ? , " said Reverend Gregory Livingston of Rainbow / PUSH .
" Guess whose money is in the market ?
Guess whose money is in their pockets ?
It 's our money . "
That sentiment was repeated elsewhere .
In Portland , Oregon. , more than 100 people turned December 10 to march from Key Bank to Bank of America in solidarity with workers left out of the government bailout .
The protests forced both banks to close their doors early .
The demonstration , called by Jobs with Justice , started at Key Bank , which was approved for $ 2.5 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Key Bank finances Oak Harbor Freight Lines , whose workers in International Brotherhood of Teamsters Locals 81 and 174 have been striking over unfair labor practices since September 23 .
The union says that the company " has violated workers ' rights by coercing and intimidating striking workers , discriminating against minorities and women in its hiring practices and by cutting off health care for retired employees . "
Chanting " Bail out the workers , not the banks , " the spirited crowd marched down the street to Bank of America , where organizers spoke in solidarity with the members of United Electrical Workers Local 1110 .
Eliana Machuca , staff organizer for Portland Jobs with Justice , pointed to the Chicago worker 's " militant action " as the way forward for the labor movement .
In San Francisco , 50 people gathered at a Bank of America office downtown on the evening of December 9 .
Though small , the rally was very vocal , with chants of " Money for jobs and education , not for banks and corporations " ringing through the downtown shopping area .
The rally was called on less than 24 hours notice by the San Francisco Labor Council and ANSWER .
There were speakers from the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and Service Employees International Union on hand to offer support to the Chicago workers .
Four activists entered the bank during the course of the rally , and within half an hour were led out in handcuffs .
Amidst chants of " let them go ! " they were then apparently arrested , and taken away by police .
Smaller actions also took place in several other cities .
In Amherst , Mass. , a crowd of 20 picketed a Bank of America branch downtown on December 10 , chanting , " The workers united will never be defeated . "
Although the picket was called on less than 24 hours ' notice , it was energetic , with protesters forming a roving picket around the entrance of the bank .
The picket actually grew as time went on , as several people passing by joined in .
In New Brunswick , New Jersey , 30 people came out despite the rain , including members of the Campus Antiwar Network chapter from Rutgers University , the Central New Jersey Coalition Against Endless War , Say No to War , a Latino workers ' association , and the College of New Jersey .
To explain the situation to passersby , protesters chanted : " The workers ask for money , the banks say that they can't .
We support the workers when they occupy their plant ! "
In Baltimore , more than 30 people picketed outside of the Bank of America building in downtown on December 10 .
The protest was called by a small network of groups , including the recently formed Baltimore Emergency Crisis Response Network -- a coalition of individuals and organisations that have come together to attempt to coordinate a progressive , activist response to local aspects of the economic crisis .
In Ithaca , New York , 25 people came out on a snowy evening December 12 to celebrate following the announcement that Republic Windows and Doors workers had won their struggle .
Members of Students for a Democratic Society , the Campus Antiwar Network , the Workers Center , the community Peace Now group , the Cornell Labor Action Project and the International Socialist Organization were in attendance .
Protesters demanded a bailout for regular people and , during a short speakout , discussed the Greek general strike , recent protests of Italian and Spanish students , and the importance of people fighting back .

Ten years ago this week , President Clinton ( remember him ? ) signed the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act into law .
Ostensibly passed to bring US copyright law in line with World Intellectual Property Organization treaties , the law has had a variety of effects , some good , others obviously not .
If there has been any unambiguous impact of the law , it has been that it has provided a whole new venue for companies to file frivolous lawsuits that attempt to deny others the chance to communicate or engage in business .
The two main features of the DMCA are its " safe harbor " provisions for sites that host user - generated content , and its anticircumvention provisions , which apply to anything that could crack a DRM scheme .
We 'll take a look at each of these separately , since they 've had very different impacts .
Safety in harbors
The safe harbor provisions of the DMCA function in much the same way as those that appeared in the Communications Decency Act , which dates from two years earlier .
In general , they legally protect service providers from being held responsible for the actions of their users in regards to otherwise illegal content .
Thus , ISPs can't be held responsible for the file sharing that rushes across their networks , nor can video - sharing websites be sued if one of their users posts a portion of a copyrighted film on their servers .
All these companies have to do is demonstrate they respond to complaints about the presence of copyrighted material ; generically , those complaints are termed a DMCA takedown notice .
Overall , the system has worked remarkably well .
The last 10 years have seen an explosion of user - contributed content to sites like Flickr , YouTube , and many others .
If the Web 2.0 movement has been all about social web use , then content contributed by members of those social groups has been its fuel .
I think it 's safe to say that , if companies faced the prospect of Jammie Thomas - sized penalties every time one of their users posted a bit of copyrighted material , then a lot fewer of those companies would have entered the market .
That 's not to say that the safe harbor provisions have worked flawlessly .
Google is facing down a $ 1 billion lawsuit from content owner Viacom , which alleges a pattern of profiting from infringing content , despite YouTube 's rapid response to DMCA takedown notices .
Another recent case found that DMCA safe harbor rules applied to video services , but that has n't protected Google from racking up legal fees defending itself .
Meanwhile , frivolous takedown notices have ensnared everyone from critics of Scientology to the McCain / Palin campaign .
Although frivolous notices carry the possibility of heavy penalties on those that file them , right and wrong in these cases can be hard to sort out : does a one - minute clip count as infringement ?
How about 10 seconds ?
All of that is slowly being hashed out by the courts , but a lot of time and energy could have been saved if the safe harbor provisions were clarified when first formulated .
But that pales in comparison with the anticircumvention aspects of the DMCA , which are deeply flawed as written .
Fair use treated unfairly
The principle behind the anticircumvention provisions is that any effort to get around a scheme that protects copyrighted content is illegal .
Although that seems reasonable at first glance — those schemes are designed to prevent the illegal duplication of copyrighted material , after all — the provisions ignore a key aspect of copyright : there are situations where duplication of copyrighted material is legally acceptable , called fair use .
By eliminating any consideration of fair use , the DMCA has essential made motivation irrelevant in defining criminal activity .
The decade since has produced countless cases that show the absurd consequences of this provision .
Researchers held off on publicizing the rootkit that Sony placed on some of its CDs as a form of copy protection , in fear that publicizing details of this security threat would leave them on the wrong side of the DMCA .
A Russian programmer was actually forbidden from leaving the US for several months at the behest of Adobe , which was upset that his company had cracked its eBook protection scheme .
As with safe harbor , the anticircumvention provisions have lent themselves to abuse .
Lexmark devised a scheme to determine of an ink cartridge for its printers was made by the company itself , then sued third party ink-makers , claiming that the DMCA covered the software features that secured this scheme .
The company lost , but this hardly prevented other companies from going down this route .
One manufacturer or garage doors started authenticating its remotes , and used this as a pretense to suing a universal remote maker using the DMCA .
That company lost , too .
But the big loser here has been the public .
As more devices gain the ability to handle music and video — I can think of five different device classes that handle one or the other lying around my ( quite small ) apartment right now — consumers have found the DMCA is a hurdle that keeps them from having the content they own available on the device of their choosing .
Want to watch a DVD movie on an iPhone ?
Good luck ; software that allows you to do so violates the DMCA .
Sophisticated users know how to find the software that does what they want , but the average consumer is stuck with lots of formats and protection schemes , and no guarantee that they 'll be able to get the content they own where they want it .
One hand giveth ...
Ironically , if the anticircumvention provisions have the potential to be a nightmare for the consumer , the safe harbor provisions have helped undercut their effect .
By providing a degree of protection to sites that host user - generated content , they have helped to ensure that those looking for a way to transcode some of their media can usually find some user - contributed directions on how to manage it .
None of this , however , means that the US should accept the obvious problems with the statute ; the only question is whether reform is possible without providing an opening to those who would prefer to see even more draconian restrictions .
Further reading :
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has updated its report on the statute ( PDF ) .
Rumors of tomorrow's " important changes " at GM have approached a fevered pace , but the latest one we 've heard is coming directly from someone who 's directly related to someone who could be directly affected if the rumor is true .
So , it must be true , right ?
Anyway , we 've just been told by the family of a Chevy Volt engineering team member that not only is the untouchable Volt program on hold , GM 's even letting some of the engineering team , aka " the chosen people , " go .
Hit the jump for the full rumor .
UPDATE : One PR source is telling us this morning that the Volt program is definitely not on hold and another is telling us all options are still on the table .
We guess we 'll find out later today .
UPDATE # 2 : We 're now being told , more vigorously this time , that there 's no plan to cut the program .
" My uncle works on the Volt as an engineer .
He 's getting laid off Friday because apparantly the project ( aka VOLT ) is on hold indefinitely . "

We 've put in a call to GM PR to ask them about the veracity of our tipsters claim , but we 've yet to receive a response .
We 'll let you know when we 've got more to tell you — but in terms of reliability , it would mean yesterday 's Reuters report claiming GM was expanding R&D spend on hybrid electrics was total baloney .
I hate baloney .
Even when it 's fried .
ONE QUESTION that Sarah Palin should answer during tomorrow 's debate is why , during her tenure as mayor of Wasilla , the town started charging rape victims or their insurers for hospital emergency - room rape kits and examinations .
The policy so outraged the Alaska Legislature that in 2000 it passed unanimously a bill forbidding such fees .
But Palin has never explained why , under her leadership , the town stopped picking up the cost of the swabs , specimen containers , and tests .
A spokeswoman for Palin wrote to USA Today that Palin " does not believe , nor has she ever believed , that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence - gathering test . "
But that was the practice in Wasilla while she was mayor .
If Palin were like most vice - presidential nominees of the past , reporters would have long since had a chance to quiz her on this subject , and many others .
So far , though , the McCain campaign team has treated her as though she were in the witness protection program , permitting just three interviews with television personalities and no open - ended press conferences .
After the Alaska legislature banned the fees , Palin 's handpicked police chief , Charlie Fannon , complained that the state 's action would force the town to spend $ 5,000 to $ 14,000 a year to cover the costs .
" I just do n't want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer , " Fannon said .
But the policy on rape kits may have had less to do with easing the burden on taxpayers and more to do with Palin 's position on abortion .
She has said she opposes it even in cases of rape or incest .
Generally , victims of sexual assault have the option of an emergency contraception pill , which some opponents of abortion consider tantamount to abortion itself .
Does Palin support the decision two years ago of the US Food and Drug Administration to allow over - the - counter sales of emergency contraception pills ?
Whether the fee - for - kits policy reflected Palin 's budgetary zeal or her extreme view on abortion , voters deserve to know .
As Alaska 's governor in 2000 , Tony Knowles , put it : " We would never bill the victim of a burglary for finger - printing and photographing the crime scene , or for the cost of gathering other evidence . "
But in Wasilla they would , if the crime was rape .

Now That 's A Neat Trick was originally published on September 9th , 2006 .
Brian was excited to join an organization that boasts managing data for " 93 % of all health care facility inspections . "
That 's important stuff , after all : inspections are essential to maintaining the integrity of facilities and can make the difference between life and death of its patients .
But after eight months working there , Brian now looks for facilities in the " other 7 % " for his personal health care needs .
While most companies measure the quality of their product with the ratio of bugs to lines - of - code , Brian 's employer uses their own , unique metric called The Cleverness Scale .
Utilized primary by upper management ( also known as , the Original Coders of the system ) , code and design techniques are rated as follows :
1 - The Shrug --
Gets the job done , efficient , all that ; but just plain boring .
2 - The Nod -- Creative , as in , using a single 32 - bit integer variable to store two 16 - bit integers .
3 - The Raised Left - Eyebrow --
Very creative , as in , combining all function arguments into a single pipe - delimited string
4 - The " Now That 's a Neat Trick ! " --
The ultimate in cleverness , as in , code that rewrites itself but maintains the original using generated comments
Despite this scale , most of the developers have actually learned to write code that scores only a 1 ; it turns out that there 's some sort of relationship between clever code and incredibly painful maintenance .
Actually , the real problem is when the CTO decides to " take the day off " and join the developers to " show 'em how it 's done . "
Admittedly , the CTO is able to crush objects and goals in a matter of hours .
Granted , his solutions are chock full of bugs , implement a fraction of the requirements , and are generally completely unusable .
But as this next example shows , his code always employs " A Neat Trick " ...
$ sql = " SELECT CONCAT ( ' < a href= \ " javascript : ; \ " onclick= \" window.open ' + '( \' site_info.php?siteid= ' , site_id , '\ ' , \' siteW ' , \' height=480 , width=550 ,status=no , ' + ' toolbar=no,menubar=no,location=no,scrollbars=yes , ' + ' resizable=yes\ ' ) ; \ " class= \" siteInfoLink\ " >'
, DATE_FORMAT ( insp_date , '% c/%e/%Y ' ) , '</a>' ) AS ` Inspection Date` , insp_date AS `_realInspectionDate` , CONCAT ( '< NOBR >' , DATE_FORMAT ( insp_date , '% H:%i' ) , '</ NOBR >' ) AS ` Inspection Time` , insp_date AS `_realInspectionTime` , insp_requestor AS ` Requestor` , insp_originator AS ` Originated By` , site_status AS ` Status` , site_loc AS ` Location` , IF ( job_priority IN ( ' Important ' , ' ASAP ' ) , job_priority , '' ) AS `Job Notes` , insp_type AS ` Inspection Type` , IF ( job_priority = ' Important ' , '# 990000 ' , IF ( o_priority = ' ASAP ' ,'# 330000 ' , '# 000000 ' ) ) AS `_rowColor` FROM tbl_site_inspections INNER JOIN tbl_sites ON site_id = insp_site_id " ;
The CTO managed to avoid the Stored Procedures , the Data Access components , the Business Logic components , and smooch SQL , PHP , HTML , and JavaScript into a single statement .
A neat trick indeed .

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank urged Israel 's prime minister to ease Israeli pressure on the Palestinian banking system .
" We understand and appreciate Israel 's legitimate security concerns , " said Mr. Blair , who is now a Mideast negotiator , IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn and World Bank President Robert Zoellick in a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .

Today 's announcement that the government is to name and shame a list of foreign - born " preachers of hate " who will be denied entry to the UK bears all the hallmarks of a PR gimmick designed to make the home secretary look as if she is being tough on those who promote terrorism .
A list of more than 200 foreigners " suspected of stirring up tensions " will be made public and is expected to include anti-abortionists , animal rights extremists and holocaust deniers as well as extremist clerics .
This is not how a confident democracy should be responding .
What is wrong with the good old - fashioned method of simply upholding the law , ie allowing these people to visit the UK like everybody else and then prosecuting them if they happen to break the law ?
This morning 's Guardian reports :
" The burden of proof is to be placed on the individuals concerned by demanding that they refute accusations made against them by publicly denouncing or retracting their reported views . "
This is a strange inversion of all principles of natural justice .
If the government believes these individuals are up to no good then it is for the government to establish this in a court of law .
The presumption should be innocence until proven guilty , not the other way round .
Several of today 's papers focus on the example of Omar Bakri Mohammed , the former leader of al - Muhajiroun who departed these shores in 2005 after living here for more than 20 years and was then barred from ever returning to this country by the Home Office .
Now there is certainly a legitimate question to be asked about why Bakri was ever allowed to settle in the UK in the first place – but that is a separate matter from refusing him entry to the UK just because we find his views objectionable .
Make no mistake : many of Bakri 's pronouncements were disgraceful .
He revelled in the tabloid attention that his grotesque views attracted , and many British Muslims – myself included – breathed a sigh of relief when he decided to relocate elsewhere .
But to reiterate my basic point : simply having odious views is not and should not be a reason to refuse people entry to the UK .
The same also goes for holocaust deniers .
However nutty their views may be , the best response to holocaust deniers must be to publicly and systematically demolish their arguments , not by seeking to refuse them entry to the UK or , as in parts of Europe , imprison them because they hold some repulsive opinions .

Herald , via AP Dave Morken says a buyer could turn this former missile site into a lodge or bed - and - breakfast .
Merle Paaverud was raised on a farm near a nuclear missile site outside Finley , N.D.
He remembers how missile sites in the area were " shrouded in mystery . "
" Here we were farming around them , raising kids and going to school , and we were sitting in one of the most powerful areas in the world as far as nuclear weapons , " Paaverud , 59 , says .
" We never really knew what was going on , but it was life and death , part of the chess game that was going on in the world . "
Today , Paaverud is the director of the State Historical Society of North Dakota .
Next summer , he will oversee the opening to the public of the former Oscar Zero missile silo and launch facility near Cooperstown , N.D.
The museum , set to open next July , is one of several new uses being found for missile sites , ranging from homes and businesses to recreation and tourist attractions .
There is increasing interest in these sites , as Americans who came of age during the Cold War want to learn more about the history of the era , Paaverud and others say .
" A lot of the people who grew up and lived through it are coming back and sort of re-experiencing that time , " says Chris Wilkinson , an interpretive park ranger at the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in western South Dakota .
Since January , 21,000 visitors have toured the Minuteman site near Philip , S.D. , which is operated by the National Park Service , Wilkinson says .
The Cold War , he says , had " a defining and pervasive influence " not only on Americans but on people throughout the world .
The South Dakota site includes artwork that missile crewmembers drew on walls to pass the time .
One painting , made to look like a pizza company 's logo , is a reminder that Minuteman missiles travel more than 15,000 mph and could reach Russia in a half - hour .
" Worldwide delivery in 30 minutes or less or your next one is free , " someone wrote beneath the artwork , recalls retired Air Force captain David Blackhurst of Black Hawk , S.D. Blackhurst , 67 , was a crew commander in the mid-1970s at a Minuteman site near White Owl , S.D.
When an alarm sounded , he says , " we never knew whether something was for real , or whether it was n't . "
Many of the sites are in the Dakotas , Wyoming , Nebraska , Kansas , Texas and other central and western states , says Edward Peden , who operates a Kansas real estate business selling former missile sites .
An area near Plattsburgh , N.Y. , was home to the only Intercontinental Ballistic Missile sites east of the Mississippi River , Peden says .
The 12 Atlas F sites near Plattsburgh were decommissioned in 1965 , he says .
Peden says there are more than 100 sites across the U.S. that housed the first generation of missiles , which included the Atlas series .
These sites were decommissioned in the mid-1960s , Peden says , and the Air Force upgraded to missiles including the Minuteman .
Today , there are about 450 Minuteman missiles operational in central and western states , Wilkinson says .
Peden lives underground in an Atlas E complex outside Topeka , where he operates his missile - base real estate agency .
He and his wife have closed 48 sales , he says , and buyers have used the sites for homes , offices and as investment properties .
" These are some of the strongest structures ever built on the planet , " Peden says .
" They are historic sites much like the castles of Europe and forts that exist around the country . "
Elsewhere : • The National UFO Reporting Center plans to move from the Seattle area to a former missile base between Davenport and Harrington in eastern Washington state .
Director Peter Davenport says he bought the site in 2006 and is cleaning it up .
• Near Abilene , Texas , divers can explore a water - filled silo known as Valhalla during tours given by Family Scuba Center .
The 130 - foot - deep water seeped in through 4 - foot - thick concrete walls over several years , the company 's website says .
• About 60 miles west of Grand Forks , N.D. , David Morken is trying to sell property once used as the India - Zero missile complex .
It is listed at $ 40,000 .
Morken , a 52 - year - old farmer , says he hopes it might offer opportunities as a hunting lodge or bed - and - breakfast .
• Bruce Townsley 's home near Abilene is a former Atlas F site .
The former social worker says he paid $ 99,000 for it in 1997 .
" It seemed like a cool idea — nothing more complicated than that , " Townsley says .

165 - Lindy Effect and Psychological Findings
Psychology is undergoing a replication crisis ; most of its research is suspicious ( statistics are shoddy ) .
Further , I 've also shown in Silent Risk that many ideas of " rationality " come from an incomplete application of probability theory .
Some derivations ( hot hand fallacy ) are just mathematically flawed .
Some things ( hyperbolic discounting , intransitity of preferences , mental accounting , myopic loss aversion , 1/n , " dread risk " fears ) are extremely rational once one uses a more rigorous or realistic probability model or consider the difference between the collective and the individual -- survival of the collective matters .
Rational , it can be shown , is what allows those things that are supposed to survive , to survive .
Here I surmise that everything that works in social science and psychology has to be Lindy - proof , that is , have an antecedent in the classics ; otherwise it will not replicate or not generalize beyond the experiment .
By classics we can define the Latin ( & late Helenistic ) moral literature ( moral sciences meant something else than they do today ) : Cicero , Seneca , M. Aurelius , Epictetus , Lucian , or the poets : Juvenal , Horace or the later French so - called " moralists " ( La Rochefoucault , Vaugenargues , La Bruyere , Chamfort ) .
Bossuet is a class on his own .
One can use Montaigne and Erasmus as a portal to the ancients : Montaigne was the popularizer of his day .

The Paradox of Progress / Choice ( Lucretius ) : there is a familiar story of a NY banker vacationing in Greece , talking to a fisherman & , scrutinizing the fisherman 's business , comes up for a scheme to help the fisherman make it a big business .
The fisherman asked him what the benefits were ; the banker answered that he could make a pile of money in NY and come back vacation in Greece ; something that seemed ludicrous to the fisherman who was already there doing the kind of things bankers do when they go on vacation in Greece .
The story was very well known in antiquity , under a more elegant form , as retold by Montaigne I , 42 : ( my transl . ) when King Pyrrhus tried to cross into Italy , Cynéas , his wise adviser , tried to make him feel the vanity of such action .
" To what end are you going into such enterprise ? " , he asked .
Pyrrhus answered : " to make myself the master of Italy " .
Cynéas : " and so ? " .
Pyrrhus : " to get to Gaul , then Spain " .
Cynéas : " Then ? "
Pyrrhus : " To conquer Africa , then ... come rest at ease " .
Cynéas : " but you are already there ; why take more risks " ?
Montaigne then cites the well known Lucretius ( V , 1431 ) on how human nature knows no upper bound , as if to punish itself .

164 - Is Levantine " Arabic " ?
Not by any metric , no more than Italian is French
I spent part of my summer " vacation " of 2015 doing intense Syriac at Beth Mardutho .
Levantine is a standalone Semitic language that is close to Aramaic , predates Arabic , has some Arabic influences ( perhaps no more than Farsi or Turkish ) , and has inherited from it broken plurals but not its rich verb forms .
Grammar remains nonArabic .
Many words that are in Arabic but not common in Aramaic happen to be in North - Phoenician ( Ugaritic ) .
Unlike genetics that has rigorous mathematical formulations and clear - cut distinctions ( haplogroups show vertical not lateral transmission ) , linguisitc categories are fuzzy and , for Semitic languages , unrigorous .

When I trained in the Lebanese army the march ( one - two - three ) was in Syriac " 7ad , Tr( n ) en , Tlete , Arb3a " ( not Wa7ad , Etnen , ... ) .
Note the difference : mim in Arabic ( beytohom ) become noun in Aramaic and North Levantine ( beyton , beytkon ) .
Even Ibrahim becomes Brohin .
Same with grammar .
The stucture is largely Aramaic .
For instance , we use the plural form for a verb before a plural subject ; in Arabic the verb is singular .
It is foolish to think that a population will speak a language , say Aramaic , then suddenly , tabula rasa , switch to another one without bastardization .
Traditional linguistics categorizes languages as independent variables , failing to take into account co-linearity , i.e. , if Y= a_1 X_1+a_2 X_2 + \eta ( noise ) , the effect will show loading in a_1 or a_2 , not both .
So if Levantine resembles Arabic , and Arabic resembles Aramaic , and Aramaic resembles Canaanite / Hebrew , the tendendy is to believe that Levanine comes from one ( the a_1 with the highest load ) not another .
Accordingly , simplified linguistics fail with Semitic languages because of confounding , much more consequential with Semitic tongues than IndoEuropean ones .
In English we know that what comes from Latin has no colinearity with Northern European sources , except for remote roots .
An argument is that the dhad in Canaanite became a 3ayn ( Eretz in Hebrew became Ar3a in Aramaic ) .
So there was a shift that stayed in Aramaic and Levantine use the Arabic dhad that does not have the shift ( which is believed to imply that we did not get these words from Aramaic ) .
But the argument is not strong : Arabs did not pronounce the dhad as modified tzadeh .
Verbs forms : Arabic has 15 forms ; Levantine and Aramaic have the same 4 - 6 forms ( depending on regions ) .
So it looks after deeper investigation that in fact except for broken plurals , and a few other words , what resembles Arabic is what is in both Aramaic and Arabic , or in both Arabic and Canaanite .
( Note that Syriac has broken plurals ) .

162 - That Thing We Call Religion
The problem of the verbalistic ( and the journalistic ) is expressed in an aphorism earlier in the Incerto : mathematicians think in ( well precisely defined and mapped ) objects , philosophers in concepts , jurists in constructs , logicians in operators (... ) , and idiots in words .
We saw that risk and tail risk are mathematically separate objects , conflated by the IYI ( intellectual yet idiot ) crowd .
Two people can be using the same word , meaning different things , yet continue the conversation , which is fine for coffee , but not when making decisions , particularly policy decisions affecting others .
But it is easy to trip them , as Socrates did , simply by asking them what they mean by what they said –hence philosophy was born as rigor in discourse and disentanglement of mixed up notions , in precise opposition to the sophist ’s promotion of rhetoric .
But , since Socrates we have had a long tradition of mathematical science and contract law driven by precision in mapping terms .
But we also have had many pronouncements by idiots using labels .
People rarely mean the same thing when they say " religion " , nor do they realize that they do n't mean the same thing .
For early Jews and Muslims , religion was law .
Din means law in Hebrew and religion in Arabic .
For early Jews , religion was also tribal ; for early Muslims , it was universal .
For the Romans , religion was social events , rituals , and festivals – the word religio was opposition to superstitio , and while present in the Roman zeitgeist had no equivalent concept in the Greek - Byzantine East .
Law was procedurally and mechanically its own thing , and early Christianity , thanks to Saint Augustine , stayed relatively away from the law , and , later , remembering its foundations , had an uneasy relation with it .
The difference is marked in that Christian Aramaic uses a different word : din for religion and nomous ( from the Greek ) for law .
Jesus , with his imperative “ give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar ” , separated the holy and the profane : Christianity was for another domain , “ the kingdom to come ” , only merged with this one in the eschaton .
Neither Islam nor Judaism have a marked separation between holy and profane .
And of course Christianity moved away from the solely - spiritual domain to embrace the ceremonial and ritualistic , integrating much of the pagan rites of the Levant and Asia Minor .
When the nation - state idea came about , things got more , much more complicated .
When an Arab now says " Jew " he largely means something about a creed ; to Arabs , a converted Jew is no longer a Jew .
But for a Jew , a Jew is someone whose mother is a Jew .
But it somewhat merged into nation - state and now means a nation .
In Serbia - Croatia and Lebanon , religion means something at times of peace , and something quite different at times of war .
When someone discusses the “ Christian minority ” in the Levant , it does n’t mean ( as Arabs tend to think ) promoting a Christian theocracy ( full theocracies were very few in Christian history , just Byzantium and a short attempt by Calvin ) .
He just means “ secular ” or wants a marked separation of church and state .
Same for the gnostics ( Druids , Druze , Mandeans , Alawis ) .
We will see that “ belief ” can be epistemic , or simply procedural ( pisteic ) –leading to confusions about what sort of beliefs , are religious beliefs and which ones are not , disentangled through signaling .
For , on top of the “ religion ” problem , there is a problem with belief .
Some beliefs are largely decorative , some are functional ( they help in survival ) ; others are literal .
And to revert to our metastatic Salafi problem : when one of these fundamentalists talks to a Christian , he is convinced that the Christian is literal , while the Christian is convinced that the Salafi has the same oft - metaphorical concepts to be taken seriously but not literally –and , often , not very seriously .
Religions , such as Christianity , Judaism , and , to some extent Shiite Islam , evolved ( or let their members evolve in developing a sophisticated society ) precisely by moving away from the literal –in addition to the functional aspect of the metaphorical , the literal does n’t leave any room for adaptation .

155 In Arabic , " Jew " Means Something Else than in Western Languages
When a Westerner says " Jew " , he means a race , or in the case of Slavs , a nationality .
In Arabic ( at least until a few years ago ) , to be a Jew is to have a certain religion , a mazhab , not an ethnicity and can only be an ethnicity if the origin is from non Arab land .
Being an Arab is Ibn 3 arab regardless of " belief " .
Arab " antisemitism " ( sic ) is not racial like European antisemitism , it is just religious intolerance that can be solved ( and has been traditionally solved ) by conversion , often forced conversion .
Which is why people are talking past each other when they discuss history and historical distinctions .
In references , Maimonides was an Arab , so was Sa3adiah Ga3on , so were so many .
They wrote in Arabic , and Hebrew was a sort of Latin reserved for learned texts .
Indeed so many Palestinians claim Jewish origin , though converted ...
This is not to say that there is no Arab racism , but it was never directed at Jews Ibn 3 arab per se ( unlike Western Jews ) .
In Bagdad , during the Abbasites , Arabs had ethnic tensions with Persans ( Ctesiphon was largely a Persian town and the Abbasides used the Sassanide imperial structure ) and the Jews counted as Banu 3 arab as they were favored as Arabs ; the rulers encouraged them to settle there in order to lower the rate of " foreigners " , the " shu3ubiyyin " , Moslems of Persian or Turkic stock ...
Which explains why circa 1900 30 % of the population of Bagdad was Jewish .
Same with the Christians .
Arabic speaking Christians are Arabs , Banu 3 arab , but not the Chaldeans .
Likewise , today when a Westerner tells a Lebanese Shiite that he has a separate " ethnicity " , he is baffled .
Mazhab is not ethnicity , no more than being a democrat in the US would be a different race ( although it should be ) .
Some Christians Levantines only started to claim separate ethnicity on spurious grounds in response to Western classifications .
The reasons for Arabs seeing Jews as Arabs but not Chaldeans are 1 ) Judaism in late antiquity was not tribal ; it was proselytic ( a proselytism which benefited Christianity ) , and 2 ) it was assumed that they mixed with Arab tribes or many Arab tribes have Hebraic blood .
Also I noticed " happy Easter " and " happy passover " are different words in English .
In Arabic , 3eid el Fise7 is the same word for both .
Happy Easter means happy passover .
( Same as pasqua ) .
-- Note : I actually believe that religious intolerance has been more murderous than racism in the West until 1939 .
Consider the cathars in France , the protestants , etc .
154 Bounded , Unbounded , Finite and Infinite
Having spent more than two decades , as an option trader and book - runner ( ~ 650,000 trades ) , I have always been leery of inexperienced academics talking about " prediction markets " when we have organic , spontaneously formed markets , and have had them since civilization started -- my reaction is that of an old plane engineer and pilot being lectured by a high school English student who never flew a plane .
You can't tell them what they do n't know .
Prediction markets have to be necessarily in " binary space " , i.e. one - dimensional and only deliver probabililities when real world exposures are variable and always always open ended or with a remote bound .
They test the wrong variable : a bet does n't hedge the ecology of the real world .
Here is my mooc explaining it .
And here is my paper .
I ignore other problems that a bet can reflect risk aversion rather than prediction .
But , it turned out , things are worse than that .
In my debate on twitter with Robin Hanson , one of the proponents of prediction markets , he argued ( defending the necessary boundedness of a binary bet ) that " Within a finite time , real financial assets will only have a finite number of possible outcomes . "
He was justifying the boundedness of bets with the fact that prices appear finite .
This set me off as a worrying violation of statistics and probability since all processes , no matter what their " support " is ( on which further down ) , will deliver finite outcomes ( have you ever observed an " infinite " realization ? ) .
But finite at which values ?
Forget statistics , this it is a blatant violation of elementary trading , something that uneducated traders and stockbrokers understand .
Every rookie in trading knows that , in your projections about the future , you cannot " cap an outcome " , i.e. find an upper bound to it , beyond which no realization is possible , unless there is an organic cap , like a contractual ceiling .
No matter how high your " cap " , it can be topped by another one ( albeit with a declining probability under unimodal distributions ) .
So educated and uneducated traders use " infinite " as proxy for " cannot find a bound for the payoff " .
We call this open - ended .
When there are reasons to cap , we cap , and it is no longer open - ended .
The converse is " floor an outcome " , a stock price is deemed to be " floored " at 0 , which is reasonable though not fully rigorous , as we have seen weird things with negative interest rates .
Likewise for academic finance and economics : infinity means " no known upper bound for the outcome " .
Now more worrisome is the flaw in statistical reasoning on the part of Hanson and , what is worse , all these little social scientists who did n't get it from observing the discussion .
Let me repeat : finiteness of realizations does not imply finitness of support .
The support of a probability distribution , say ( 0 , Infinity ) , is the space of " possible " realizations that the variable can take .
But all realizations ex post have to be " finite " , take on a number you can use , like 101.36 or 176.32 , etc .
Otherwise we would have no probability distributions ; very few continuous distributions are compact in their support , such as the uniform and the beta distribution .
The Gaussian is deemed close to compact , but we still have infinities on both sides .
So listening to Hanson , all supports need to be pre-defined in compact intervals .
But the flaw in reasoning is that he went backwards from realizations to support , rather than the opposite .
For a minute I thought about giving Hanson the benefit of the doubt , until I remembered his papers on prediction markets which I found not even wrong to cite them in my own commentary .
It is necessary to engage someone who is wrong , but impossible to engage someone who is not even wrong .
Staying in the debate meant having to explain to Mr Hanson what finite and infinite mean in probability , along with why realizations are never infinite , stuff that is required to understand before writing about these matters .
This is similar to having to discuss a Fourier Transform and needing to explain something as elementary as what a complex number means , and facing the idiotic " show me a complex number in real life " .
The good thing about twitter is that you can publicly bust someone and show his incompetence with a single question , just as in a Wall Street interview .
Academics in their papers can make things complicated so they can go a long time making us believe they know what they are talking about .
You can only tell their competence when you engage them / ask them questions .
( Technical note : you can turn a vanilla into a binary , but never a binary into a vanilla unless there is a contractual ceiling . )
( Technical note : Option theoretical formalization .
I am rewriting the paper , formalizing the " elementary unit " , a binary bet as an Arrow - Debreu state price , or Butterfly , as building block for all decision theory .
It makes all the math come out formally .
It is remarkable how sloppy decision science is .
Arbitrage trading is the best school to be formal : you need to have a clear , very very clear idea of the specification of what we are talking about , otherwise the book blows - up ) .
153 The Supreme Scientific Rigor of The Russian School of Probability
I would like to record here ( so people get off my back ) that I do not belong to the so - called " Austrian School " of economics , in spite of a few similar positions on bailouts and bottom - up systems .
I believe in mathematical statements .
But if I were to belong to a school of thought designated by a nationality , the {NATIONALITY} SCHOOL of {DISCIPLINE} it would be the Russian school of probability .
Members across three generations : P.L. Chebyshev , A.A. Markov , A.M. Lyapunov , S.N. Bernshtein ( ie. Bernstein ) , E.E. Slutskii , N.V. Smirnov , L.N. Bol'shev , V.I. Romanovskii , A.N. Kolmogorov , Yu.V. Linnik , and the new generation : V Petrov , S.V. Nagaev , A.V. Nagaev , A. Shyrayev , etc .
They had something rather potent in the history of scientific thought : they thought in inequalities , not equalities ( most famous : Markov , Chebyshev , Bernstein , Lyapunov ) .
They used bounds , not estimates .
Even their central limit was a matter of bounds .
A world apart from the new generation of users who think in terms of precise probability .
It accommodates skepticism , one - sided thinking : A is >x , A O( x ) [ Big - O : " of order " x ] , rather than A=x .
Working on integrating the rigor in risk bearing .
We always know one - side , not the other .
152 " Déja Vu " Illusion
For something to look original to people in a profession , say academia , it is needs to be nonoriginal , and , what is worse , vice versa .
When work is original , it tends to elicit " nothing new " .
The " nothing new " response is likely to come from nonspecialists or people who do not know a subject well .
For a philistine , Verdi's Trovatore is not new , since it sounds like another opera he heard by Mozart with women torturing their throat .
One needs to know a subject very well to place it in context .
Now academics learn to take a paper or a class of papers , imitate the style , the organization ; copy the phraseology , discuss the historical literature and find some wrinkle on the problem that makes it look like a contribution .
This is what tends to be published , and this is what seems to be " original " .
And these works never survive the author .
150 The Stickiness of Languages
Many Greek Cypriots still speak the language called " Cypriot Maronite Arabic " , that is , 12 centuries after their settlement and integration in the Greek side of the Island .
Languages are stickier than we think ( People tend to associate languages with states , when the correlation was low before 1917 : around the Mediterranean , particularly in Asia Minor , languages had no link to the rule ( Armenians spent thousands of years in the area between Cilicia to Aleppo , way past the lifetime of some " Armenian State " ; etc . ) ) .
It is only today that the Cypriot Arabic language has weakened , thanks to Facebook and intermarriage .
Semitic languages being based on the triplet of consonnants -- using vowels mainly for declensions -- are very stable ( the drift in Cypriot Maronite Arabic appears very small ) .
This stickiness of the Semitic languages supports a speculation : by the 7th Century there had to be many pockets in the Western Mediterranean of Punic - Canaanite speakers , about a thousand years after the fall of Carthage .
Falling under Roman rule did not turn the population into Latin speakers ( only for scholarly purposes , say Saint Augustine of Hyppo ; we have much evidence of diglossia in the Levant , of the use of a language at home and for oral communication that is different from the language of writing , and doing so for 1000 years ) .
And there had to be plenty of Semitic language speakers ; just follow placenames from Carthage to Ramatuelle in France near Saint Tropez ( ramat el means hill of God in both Canaanite and Hebrew ) .
Even Marseilles seems to come from Marsa , port in Canaanite ( and not from Massilia the Roman name since the Romans did not make names , but transcribed them ) .
I estimate that the third of the coastal villages spoke Semitic dialects .
The modus of the Phoenicians was network , hence a system of trade links built on trust ( you send merchandise to a relative who pays you back ; you needed a certain amount of trust before the letter of credit ) .
The region is large : it extends all the way to Mogador on the Atlantic coast .
This explains the mystery of the effortless Arab invasion of the Southern and Western Mediterranean , all the way to Spain ( and , less advertised , the Portuguese Algarve ) .
They had to be welcomed by the local population along the coast .
Canaanite and Arabic are easily mutually comprehensible ( the distance between Semitic languages is very short , a corrollary of the stability thanks to the triplet of consonnants ) .
And it is wasy for a Punic speaker to progressively become an Arabic speaker , since he already knows 80 - 90 % of the vocabulary .
This also gives some credibility to the thesis that was popping up in the 19th century that the North African Jews had a Phoenician origin ( or that the difference between Canaanite and Jew before the rabbinical period was not very pronounced for people to see an immediate difference ) .
This is very plausible , since the Phoenician Canaanite diaspora had characteristics in trade networks that is similar to that of the Jews of later period .
We find them in the same places as the Phoenicians .
They had similar Gods ( plus or minus monotheism & the beastly tophet , but we know of syncretisms as because religions were not very differentiated , as we saw evidence in Doura Europos and there were places of worship that would accommodate both Jews , early Christians , and pagans ) .
They had a nearly identical language in the East ( Canaanite ) and a very similar one in the West ( we only have one punic passage transcribed into Latin in a play by Plautus : in spite of the geographic distance it remained very close to classical Hebrew and Canaanite ) .
My speculation is that many of the Jews are those locals who did not convert to Islam , and did not feel that had to .
I voiced the idea to Jacques Attali ( of North African Jewish ancestry ) who boasted a historical relation to Phoenicians ; he blurted out " tu me dis que les juifs sont des phéniciens , je te dis que les phéniciens sont des juifs " ) .
It is remarkable how people fall for the retrospective distortion , by imparting to ancient religions modern definitions and differentiations from rituals and theologies developed after , and to ancient " states " the definition of the modern state .
" Identities " did not exist at the time , so " Canaanite " or " Arab " were not part of the discussion : one belonged to a certain network , a tribe , bottom up , using the Semitic patrilinear line of belonging .
Ibn 3 am means " cousin from the father 's side " ( Remarkably , in Hebrew 3 am means people , or tribe ) .
Finally , the Maltese , in spite of having been a bastion of Christianity , still speak a Semitic language easy to understand by Arabic speakers .
149 Why Is Fragility in the Nonlinear
I- There have been works on the link between risk and nonlinearity ( initially by Arrow and Pratt , then followed by a collection of authors such as Rothchild , Stiglitz , Machina , and others ) .
These fellows were not option traders ; their work was mistakenly focused on nonlinearity of preferences ( which they got wrong since preferences are not concave , but convex - concave and path dependent as shown by Kahneman & Tversky ) .
What they missed is that the nonlinearity of probability of harmful events automatically determine nonlinearity in survival , hence concavity of harm .
It is not a matter of psychology and preferences , but a physical property stemming from the structure of survival probabilities .
Probabilities decline ( under all standard monomodal distributions and all unbounded distributions ) in an accelerated and convex manner .
All unbounded continuous distributions look like half - bell curves on the right below their maximum density .
And the probabilities fall in a very , very rapid manner .
Even with power laws , but slightly less so than with standard cases of exponential decline .
The upper bound of the harm function is the negative of the inverse of the survival probability , hence concave in shape .
More clearly : tail events need to hit you disproportionately more than regular events .
From ANTIFRAGILE :
Let me explain the central argument — why is fragility necessarily in the nonlinear and not in the linear ?
That was the intuition from the coffee cup I mentioned in the Prologue .
Just as with the large stone hurting more than the equivalent weight in pebbles , if , for a human , jumping one millimeter ( an impact of small force ) caused an exact linear fraction of the damage of , say , jumping to the ground from thirty feet , then the person would be already dead from cumulative harm .
Actually a simple computation shows that he would have expired within hours from touching objects or pacing in his living room , given the multitude of such stressors and their total effect .
The fragility that comes from linearity is immediately visible , so we rule it out because the object would be already broken and the person already dead .
This leaves us with the following : what is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects — and extreme , rare events since hits of large size ( or high speed ) are rarer than ones of small size ( and slow speed ) .
Let me rephrase it , in connection with Black Swans and extreme events .
There are a lot more ordinary events than extreme events .
In the financial markets , there are at least ten thousand time more events of .1 % than events of 10 % .
There are close to eight thousand micro-earthquakes daily on planet earth , that is , those below 2 on the Richter scale — about three million a year .
These are totally harmless , and , with three million per year , you would need them to be so .
But shocks of intensity 6 and higher on the scale make the newspapers .
Take objects such as coffee cups get a lot of hits , a million more hits of ( to take an arbitrary measure ) , say , one hundredth of a pound per square inch than hits of a hundred pounds per square inch .
Accordingly , we are necessarily immune to the cumulative effect of small deviations , or shocks of very small magnitude , which implies that these affect us disproportionally less ( that is , nonlinearly less ) than larger ones .
I simplify the theorem .
Take x a shock to your system .
The higher x , the more damage .
Take H( x ) the harm from x .
The upper bound is H( x ) = - 1 / F( x ) where F( x ) is the probabilityof harm as in the figure below .
with H'( x ) < 0 at x0 .
Since P[x >K ] the probability of having encountered intensity K in the past conditional on having survived is concave , then the form of H( x ) needs to have a negative second derivative at the initial value x0 .
But there is an additiona complexity : H( x ) F( x ) need to be declining for the expectation to be integrable , unless harm is bounded by some amount ( a maximum harm beyond which it makes no difference ) .
The only probability distribution giving linear harm would have the shape p( x ) =1/x , one that would not have any moment .
The result of the convexity of probabilities is also seen in evolution , since probability of harm map into fitness and has to be conditioned by the statistical property of the size of exposures .
II - Take this medical application .
The Second Principle of Iatrogenics : it is not linear .
I do not believe that we should take risks with near - healthy people and treat them at all ; I also believe that we should take a lot , a lot more risks with those deemed in danger .
Why do we need to focus treatment on more serious cases , not marginal ones ?
Take this example showing nonlinearity .
When hypertension is mild , say marginally higher than the zone accepted as “ normotensive ” , the chance of benefiting from the drug is close to 5.6 % ( only one person in eighteen benefit from the treatment ) .
But when tension is considered to be in the “ high ” or “ severe ” categories , the chance of benefiting are now 26 % and 72 % , respectively ( that is that one person in four and two persons out of 3 will benefit from the treatment ) .
So the treatment benefits are convex to condition ( the benefits rise disproportionally , in an accelerated manner ) .
But consider that the iatrogenics should be constant for all categories !
In the very ill condition , the benefits are large relative to iatrogenics , in the borderline one , they are small .
This means that we need to focus on high symptom conditions and ignore , I mean really ignore , other situations in which the patient is not very ill .
Another way to view it is by considering that mother nature had to have tinkered through selection in inverse proportion to the rarity of the condition ( in a convex manner according to the probabilities we saw above ) .
Of the hundred of thousands of drugs today , I can hardly find a via positiva one that makes a healthy person unconditionally “ better ” .
And the reason we have not been able to find drugs that make us feel unconditionally better when we are well ( or unconditionally stronger , etc. ) is for the same statistical reason : nature would have found this magic pill .
But consider that illness is rare , and the more ill the person the less likely nature would have found the solution , in an accelerating way .
A condition that is three mean deviations away from the norm is more than three hundred times rarer than normal ; an illness that is five mean deviations from the norm is more than a million times rarer !
148 The Central Idea : the conflation of event and exposure , or difference between f( x ) and x
- f(x ) is exposure to the variable x. f( x ) can equivalently be called “ payoff from x ” , even “ utility of payoff from x ” where we introduce in f a utility function .
x can be anything .
This explains why innovation when in f(x ) ( trial and error ) does not require understanding of x as much as being smart about f( x ) .
The difference between theory and practice is in x vs f(x ) .
Example : x is the intensity of an earthquake on some scale in some specific area , f( x ) is the number of persons dying from it .
We can easily see that f(x ) can me made more predictable than x ( if we force people to stay away from a specific area or build to some standards , etc. ) .
Example : x is the rainfall in NY , f( x ) is the health of my garden .
Or x is arsenic , f(x ) is my health ( in low doses f( x ) is actually OK ) .
Example : x is the number of meter of my fall to the ground when someone pushes me from height x , f(x ) is a measure of my physical condition from the effect of the fall .
Clearly I can't predict x very easily ( who will push me ) , rather f( x ) .
Example : x is the number of cars in NYC at noon tomorrow , f(x ) is travel time from point A to point B for a certain agent .
f( x ) is more predictable than x , particularly if he modifies his route .
- Some people talk about f( x ) thinking they are talking about x .
This is the problem of the conflation of event and exposure .
This errors present in Aristotle is virtually ubiquitous in the philosophy of probability ( say , Hacking ) .
- One can become antifragile to x without understanding x , through convexity of f( x ) .
- The answer to the question “ what do you do in a world you do n’t understand ? ” is , simply , work on the undesirable states of f( x ) .
- It is often easier to modify f(x ) than get better knowledge of x .
( In other words , the robustification rather than forecasting Black Swans ) .
Example :
If I buy an insurance on the market , here x , dropping more than 20 % , f( x ) will be independent of the part of the probability distribution of x that is below 20 % .
( This is an example of a barbell ) .
- If one is antifragile to x , then the variance ( or volatility , or other measures of variation ) of x benefit f( x ) , since distributions that are skewed have their mean depend on the variance ( the lognormal for instance has for mean a term that includes + ½ sig^2 ) .
[ BARBELL THEOREM ]
- The probability distribution of f(x ) is markedly different from that of x , particularly in the presence of nonlinearities .
+ When f(x ) is convex ( concave ) monotonically ) , f(x ) is right ( left ) skewed .
+ When f(x ) is increasing and concave on the left then convex to the right , the probability distribution of f(x ) is thinner - tailed than that of x .
For instance in Kathneman - Tversky ’s prospect theory , the so - called utility of changes in wealth is more “ robust ” than that of wealth .
- Where p(x ) is the density , F ( X ) p(x ) is the true function , the integral will depend increasingly on f rather than p , and the more nonlinear f , the more it will depend on f rather than p .
For instance , Jensen ’s inequality , will increase with the convexity of f .
143 The error about the error ( Fukushima , again )
An error rate can be measured .
The measurement , in turn , will have an error rate .
The measurement of the error rate will have an error rate .
The measurement of the error rate will have an error rate .
We can use the same argument by replacing " measurement " by " estimation " ( say estimating the future value of an economic variable , the rainfall in Brazil , or the risk of a nuclear accident ) .
What is called a regress argument by philosophers can be used to put some scrutiny on quantitative methods or risk and probability .
The mere existence of such regress argument will lead to two different regimes , both leading to the necessity to raise the values of small probabilities , and one of them to the necessity to use power law distributions .
142 Time to understand a few facts about small probabilities
The Japanese Nuclear Commission had the following goals set in 2003 : " The mean value of acute fatality risk by radiation exposure resultant from an accident of a nuclear installation to individuals of the public , who live in the vicinity of the site boundary of the nuclear installation , should not exceed the probability of about 1x10 ^6 per year ( that is , at least 1 per million years ) " .
That policy was designed only 8 years ago .
Their one in a million - year accident almost occurred about 8 year later ( I am not even sure if it is at best a near miss ) .
We are clearly in the Fourth Quadrant there .
I spent the last two decades explaining ( mostly to finance imbeciles , but also to anyone who would listen to me ) why we should not talk about small probabilities in any domain .
Science cannot deal with them .
It is irresponsible to talk about small probabilities and make people rely on them , except for natural systems that have been standing for 3 billion years ( not manmade ones for which the probabilities are derived theoretically , such as the nuclear field for which the effective track record is only 60 years ) .
1 ) Small probabilities tend to be incomputable ; the smaller the probability , the less computable .
( Forget the junk about " Knightian " uncertainty , all small probabilities are incomputable ) .
( See TBS , 2nd Ed. , or Douady and Taleb , Statistical undecidability , 2011 . )
2 ) Model error causes the underestimation of small probabilities & their contribution ( on balance , because of convexity effects ) .
Any model error , just as any undertainty about flying time causes the expected arrival to be delayed ( you rarely land 4 hours early , more often 4 hours late on a transatlantic flight , so " unforeseen " disturbances tend to delay you ) .
See my argument about second order effects with my paper .
[ INTUITION : uncertainty about the model used for calculation of random effects causes a second layer of randomness , causing small probabilities to rise on balance ] .
3 ) The problem is more acute in Extremistan , particularly the manmade part .
The probabilities are undestimated but the consequences are much , much more underestimated .
4 ) As I wrote , because of globalization , the costs of natural catastrophes are increasing in a nonlinear way .
5 ) Casanova problem ( survivorship bias in probability ) :
If you compute the frequency of a rare event and your survival depends on such event not taking place ( such as nuclear events ) , then you underestimated that probability .
See the revised note 93 on αδηλων .
6 ) Semi-technical Examples : to illustrates the point ( how models are Procrustean beds ) : Case 1 : Binomial
Take for example the binomial distribution with B [ N , p ] probability of success ( avoidance of failure ) , with N=50 .
When p moves from 96 % to 99 % the probability quadruples .
So small imprecision around the probability of success ( error in its computation , uncertainty about how we computed the probability ) leads to enormous ranges in the total result .
This shows that there is no such thing as " measurable risk " in the tails , no matter what model we use .
Case 2 : More scary .
Take a Gaussian , with the probability of exceeding a certain number , that is , .
1 - Cumulative density function ..
Assume mean = 0 , STD= 1 . Change the STD from 1 to 1.1 ( underestimation of 10 % of the variance ) .
For the famed " six sigmas " , the area in the tails explodes by 2400 % .
For the areas above 10 sigmas ( common in economics ) , the area explodes by trillions .
( More on the calculations in my paper ) .
140 Why Did Communism Fail ?
The common interpretation is that communism failed because it did not line - up to human nature , disregarded incentives , free - market matters etc .
But I have not heard any commentary attributing a share of the failure to the top - down implementation by gigantic states & the necessity of a large state for that -- making nonlinearities & second order effects dominate .
The large state is qualitatively different from the very small municipal state , one in which people have visual contact with those implementing public policy .
The large state brings fragility , the small municipality brings robustness .
Just as there is a fallacy of aggregation , I believe in the fallacy of scale ( because of concavities ) .
Properties change with scale .
93 [ REVISED ]- Epilogism , the adelon αδηλων & the unmanifested
( After two years I received a letter from Perilli correcting a typo & informing me that Sextus was actually citing the much earlier Anaxagoras , 5th C. BC ) .
( Sextus , Ad. Mat. : οψι ς γαρ τ ων αδηλων τα φ αινομεναι ) .
The central concept of empiricism is the passage from the observed to the unobserved –making inference on the unseen based on the seen .
I have no trouble explaining it to a cab driver – but not to a " rigorous " academic proto - turkey ( or someone with Asperger ) simply because what is not observed is " handwaved " in a discussion and not precise enough for them .
The concept was used by the brand of skeptics reviled by history : Empirical Tripodists / Aenasidemans ( see Galen ’s Subf. Emp. ) .
It died very quickly .
People in technology may understand it ( if they are making speculative bets ) .
Not Harvard Business
School half - men / professors who write on biotech or insurance ( Froot ) .
Certainly not bankers ( “ it never happened before ” ) .
My statistical translation : look for rare events that are not part of your sample because of its limitations : where can the unobservables be ?
I am working on uncovering historical heuristics of adelon .
[ The only living scholar I found who used –& understood – epilogism is Lorenzo Perilli ] .
Before him , a Frenchman , Albert Favier , used it ( died c. 1914 ) –he was a joint MD - philosopher .
Philosophers of science are far , very far behind : they just talk & cannot have the right ecological intuitions .
Induction & deduction are for those who do not take decisions : they do not exist in practice ] .
Where is the adelon , The unmanifested in the data ?
135 - Income , Happiness & the Less is More Effect
Iatrogenics of wealth :
As a child I was certain that poor people were happier because they had less complicated but more social lives , huddled together in small quarters , and having no soccer mom ( or the then - equivalent ) , they could just play in the streets etc .
In addition , rich people use harmful technologies , go to the gym instead of playing in the streets , meet economists and other frauds , etc ...
So there were things money could not buy , in effect , money caused you to lose ...
Later on when I got a windfall check , in my twenties ( before it became more common for people in finance to get big bucks ) , I discovered another harmful side of wealth : unless one hid the cash , it was hard to know who one 's friends were ...
134 - Megalopsychia in the Republic of Letters
133 - Galen 's Megalopsychos ( The Magnificent in my New Work )
Les Belles Lettres has just issued an unpublished treatise by Galen called ΠΕΡΙ ΑΛΥΠΗΣΙΑΣ , ne pas se chagriner ( avoiding sorrow ) - a strange brand of Levantine stoicism quite different from the then prevailing Roman version .
In it Galen describes how he suffered the loss of his books and manuscripts with equanimity .
At [ 50 - 51 ] he uses μεγαλοψυχία , greatness of soul αλλα το παντα μεν απολε σ αντα τα φαρμακα , παντα δε τα βιβλια , και προ σ ετι τα ς γραφα ς των αξιολογων φα ρμακων , ετι τε τα ς περι αυτ ων εκδο σ ει ς γεγονια ς αμα πρα γματ ειαι ς πολλαι ς αλλαι ς και ων εκαστη μονη γεγον υια την καθ ολον τον βιον ικανην φιλοπονιαν εδει κνυτο μη λυπηθηναι γ ενναιον ηδη τουτο και μεγαλοψ υχια ς εχομενον επιδειγμα πρωτον .
[ the fact that , after the loss of the totality of my pharmaceutical remedies , the totality of my books , as well as these recipies of reputable remedies , as well as the various editions I wrote on them , in addition to so many other works , each one of which exhibits that love of work that was mine my entire life ; the fact that I felt no pain shows firstthe nobility of my behavior and my GREATNESS OF SOUL . ]
Also pre-Christian thoughts on greatness of soul in the Hellenistic Levant : The Pagan Virtue of Megalopsychia in Pagan Syrian by Glanville Downey ( Historian of Antioch on the Orontes ) .
Note that humility in pre-Christian ethics was an insult .
The Arabs translate it literally : كبير النف س
131 - Les Grands Erudits -- One Who Had it All
The Roman Emperor Gordian had it all .
Twenty - two acknowledged concubines , and a library of sixty - two thousand volumes , attested the variety of his inclinations , and from the productions which he left behind him , it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than ostentation .
( in Gibbon 's Decline & Fall )
Because of its genuine character , erudition is usually absent from academia where you would think you would find it -- and has been so for a long time ( nothing new , since the Renaissance was not an academic production but one by dilettantes ) .
Of history 's great erudites , perhaps the most remarkable is Joseph Juste Scaliger -- I had thought that the most cultured of all was Pierre Daniel Huet , but Huet who thought Montaigne was ignorant and ungroomed in the classics held Scaliger in greatest respect .
Scalinger had such a hunger for texts he read Hebrew & Arabic .
Of course there are many identifiable others : Pierre Bayle , and , earlier , the commonly known pre-renaissance scholars Nicholas d'Autrecourt , Gerardo of Cremona , Michael Scotus , Rodolphe Agricola , etc .
And there are many we are missing because they left nothing of interest behind ; or nothing they left has reached us .
Note that Gibbon , though luminous , is not in the same league -- one of the finest English prose writers , but not exceedingly broad in his knowledge since he was just classically trained , and not deeply at that -- his sources are concentrated ( mostly Diodorus Siculus , Ammianus Marcellinus , Procopius I think ) .
I am only impressed by a man's two attributes : courage & erudition .
I disrespect those who lack the former , & crave the company of those endowed with the latter .
Erudition is wealth , robust knowledge , being alive ; it is organic diversification & signals open mindedness .
129 - Pascal & Mutanabbi
I was in Arabia talking to people about ancestral wisdom when Mohammed AlQatari pointed out to me that Pascal 's saying on rationality le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ignore ( the heart has its reasons that the reason ignores ) has been said in the very same exact words some seven hundred years earlier by al - Mutanabbi : I transcribe in Arabic without even translating because a good translation would produce exactly the same words as Pascal's .
لهَوَى النّفُوسِ سَرِيرَةٌ لا تُعْلَم ُ
Also it hit me that the ubiquitous word " khair " , or " kheir " خيرin Arabic comes from the Greek χάρι ς ( " grace " , also " gift " , the root of charm , charisma , etc . )
So does جنس ( kind , gender , nationality when in the feminine form ) from γένο ς ( genus ) .
128 - Plato , a Treasure Trove
The philosopher ( popularizer of philosophy ) Bryan Magee , in his memoirs discusses how he is often surprised , reading an author , how his perception of the author conflicts with that of the prevailing trends in commentary ( his Wittgenstein was not that of his contemporaries ) .
Simply , academics cluster into a research tradition , with a standard interpretation ; such interpretation is unstable as they may all cluster to a new focus , etc .
They may collectively miss on a central idea of the author -- something the fresh reader may get .
After a half a lifetime of reading commentary on Plato , I 've embarked on my own re-reading of the complete works , and have been quite shocked at what I saw , in relation to my specialty of probability & randomness : topics brought up in the mouth of Socrates that were rarely discussed in the commentaries , or , at best , treated marginally .
Now , granted much of the commentary comes from classical writers ; still it remains that the commentators are not looking at Plato with our eyes & concerns .
1 ) PHAEDRUS Fooled by Randomness ; the cognitive distortions of mistaking the subset for the superset ( modern research by Kahneman & Tversky showing how people after a vivid description think Linda is more likely to be a feminist bankteller than a bankteller ; or how people can be manipulated to overpay for terrorist insurance , more than general insurance that includes terrorist coverage ) .
In Phaedrus , Socrates warns against the sophists Tisias & Gorgias who who make the probable more likely than truth , and make small things appear large & large things appear small .
Τεισίαν δὲ Γοργίαν τε ἐάσομ εν εὕδειν , οἳ πρὸ τῶν ἀληθῶν [ the true ] τὰ εἰκ ότα εἶδον [ " see what resembles " , εἰκών , a copy , shares roots with the probable , εἰκάζω ( " I guess " ) and ἔοικε ( " it looks like " , εἰκότα is neutral plural for εἰκώ ς used as " the probable " in Plato ] ὡς τιμητέα μᾶλλον [ value more ] , τά τε αὖ σ μι κρ ὰ μεγάλα καὶ τὰ μεγάλα σ μι κρὰ φαίνε σ θαι ποιοῦ σιν διὰ ῥώμην λόγο υ ...
2 ) PROTAGORAS
The hindsight bias ( one aspect ) .
Socrates explains how he " prefers Prometheus to Epimetheus " -- Prometh = forward ; Epimeth = backward .
There was the myth of the two brothers , retold by Hesiod , but presented in Plato to warn about thinking in the past & not projecting properly into the future .
3 ) PROTAGORAS
Use of conditionals is SOPHISTRY I was once discussing with Richard Thaler , a behavioral finance researcher his work on a psychological explanation of the equity premium puzzle .
My point is that his interpretation might be true , but it lacks in empirical rigor , as we first needed to ascertain whether there was such a thing as the equity premium puzzle -- to me , Black Swan events were not accounted for by the story , so we could not ascertain under " fat tails " what the risk was to make such statement ; indeed whatever equity premium there was has evaporated in recent years .
The behavioral economist agreed with me , but continued : " IF there was an equity premium puzzle , then ... " .
I was highly irritated by the matter and could not see any sincerity in work that is so CONDITIONAL ( the practice in economics has exploited some unrigorous paper on positivism by Milton Friedman ; in Medicine nobody says " if man were mice , then this ... " ; in physics nobody says " if the Moon had water ... " ) .
I had been worried ... until I read Socrates ' view that one cannot conduct a dialectic unless one SINCERELY agrees to every step of the argument .
SOCRATES , refuting the sophist Protagoras who assented for the sake of argument with one of his statement : " I do not think an argument 's validity can be tested unless these " ifs " are removed from it " .
127 - Learning From Erwan Le Corre & Robust Exercise
Spent some time with Erwan Le Corre , whom many describe as the fittest man in the world , in a broad , naturalistic sense ( along with John Durant the expert on Paleo nutrition & their friends ) -- we were filmed by French TV who picked up the links between their ideas and mine on the need for a certain class of randomness .
Le Corre understands the value of moderate unpredictability , the importance of improvization , and unconstrained exercise -- to avoid the " fossilization " of routines .
My idea of naturalistic / Paleo fitness : the broadest domain bandwidth , freedom from the captivity & injurious gym machines ( resembling Tayloristic methods in working out ) .
So started walking / sprinting on " rough " , fractal sufaces .
I am lucky to have a place within walking distance from the best parc for that ; along the coastline with close to a mile of rocks .
Exhilarating , except for my broken nose .
Just as chess skills only help you in chess ( we know that those who can play chess games from memory do n't have strong memory for other matters ) , classroom math only helps in classrooms , weight training in gyms almost only helps you in gyms , a specific sport almost only helps you in that specific sport , and walking on smooth Euclidian surfaces causes injuries somewhere deep inside your soul .
When you run and jump on rocks , your entire brain and body are at work ; you stretch your back better than with yoga ; every muscle in your body is involved ; no two movements will be identical ( unlike running in gyms ) ; you become yourself .
Absence of effort :
So I can get the benefits of a hunter - gatherer lifestyle with less than 20 % changes in my day -- as I can manage a 5 - course dinner at Le Bernardin , drink good wine , dress with some elegance , yet have the benefits of the caveman ...
To me it is mostly about absence of effort in my life , outside of intense moments , freedom , work without constraints , unpredictability in my day , lounging whenever I feel like it , minimal contact with businessmen & other half - men , etc .
I spent 7 years in total as an employee .
When I look back , it was half way between being dead & alive .
Also I just realized that , in the same vein , broad erudition , when supported by a good mathematical culture , is vastly more robust than any specialization .
The wisdom of the ancients was domain - independent .
126 - Evidence that we human use thought largely for ornamental purpose
At the Harvard Symposium for Hard Problems in Social Science , Emily Oster presented a very simple , elementary problem : almost all people with type - 2 diabetes who are overweight can be cured by losing a little bit of weight .
They are made aware of it , yet they usually gain weight after diagnosis ( she mentioned " Atkins " among the options , so it was not just AMA low - fat . ) .
It is so obvious that we know what to do yet do not carry the action because thinking can be largely ornamental .
The proof of the sterility of ( a significant class of ) knowledge was right there ( among the obvious evidence that the population has been gaining weight in spire of technological and educational progress ) .
Yet the others social scientists kept exalting the value of " education " in spite of this simple devastating evidence .
Someone even suggested teaching more " critical thinking " .
This is the great sucker problem : people who teach truly think that teaching , or , worse , preaching , cures .
125 - Nerdiness , " Interesting " Heuristic for Natural Intelligence
I 've always wondered why males with boring professions , even when wealthy , do not attract females as much as artists do : rock stars , painters , & ( in Europe ) novelists & poets are more " interesting " than mathematicians , engineers , computer scientists , or physicists .
Likewise men with flamboyant objects like red Ferraris or colorful clothes attract like a magnet , compared to the more conservative , but stable , plodding accountant .
Same with wit compared to intelligence .
Is it about the Zahavian showoff with language & artistic prowess ?
We have been playing with linguistic prowess and cave paintings for tens of thousand of years .
Anyway , this metric can be used as a guideline to define true intelligence & relevant subjects : whatever subject is boring & unattractive in a Zahavian way will not be ancestrally fit & will be not natural to society .
Painting , wit , music are more NATURAL than abstract mathematics or abstract , not exhibited wealth .
What I take is that intelligence in the sense of IQ tests and SAT scores is not as natural & ancestrally fit as wit , l'ésprit fin .
By not natural I mean not Black - Swan robust , skills we call intelligence because of a certain construction , but that are not needed ecologically .
Mate selection has the right heuristics & intuitions -- though in the right domain , & in the right domain only ( the modern world we 've constructed is quite different ) .
So , Is " intelligence " without wit & verbal briliance really intelligence ?
123 - That Treacherous Thing ...
I vividly remember my long afternoon walks in the park du Luxembourg in the Latin Quarter in Paris , as I used to lived across from it , Rue d'Assas .
There were retired men talking about their war stories and playing pétanque , lovers silently hugging on benches , people just trying to be friends with each other , and me , flaneur crossing the park because it was on the Eastern side ( the 5th arrondissement ) that the philosophers were based , rue d'Ulm and I felt something vibrate in me there , just breathing the air & imbibing philosophy and the hype that came with it ; it was a pilgrimage to my promised land .
For years , as I routinely crossed that park , the same APlatonic depressing idea haunted me upon seeing the lovers embracing & cuddling each other on the benches , the idea of the transitory aspect of such intensity , and its potential reversal .
The more intensely enthralled two being are with each other the harder they will try to hurt each other upon separation .
They seemed to want to unite with each other , care about each other , protect each other , minister the smallest need in the other , cure the other of the small wounds , but , at some point in the future they might be inflicting the most scathing injury to the other .
The nonlovers might be less close , but , in all likelihood , they should unconditionally stay friends , or , at least they are not expected to inflict harm on the other .
I realized that there was an element in this treacherous thing called love that was not for philosophers .

103 - The translational gap
How long can something be held as wrong before its practice is discontinued ?
A long , very long time , much longer than we think .
We 've know that " modern finance " and economics represented a danger to society [ since 1961 , with close to 400 blowup episodes including the crash of 1987 ] to no avail -- and this blowup of the banking system will not bring any relief .
Even the fact that I may have made the point in what may turn out to be the ALL TIME bestseller in economics and philosophy of science [ and the mother of all empirical evidence ] might not help displace the charlatans .
Some ideas from the history of Medicine ( Medicina , soror philosophiae ! ) .
Noga Arikha " Just Life in a Nutshell : Humours as common sense " , in The Philosophical Forum Quarterly , XXXIX , 3 :
When William Harvey demonstrated the mechanism of blood circulation in the 1620s , humoral theory and its related practices should have disappeared , because the anatomy and physiology on which it relied was incompatible with this picture of the organism .
In fact , people continued to refer to spirits and humors , and doctors continued to prescribe phlebotomies , enemas , and cataplasms , for centuries more -- even when it was established in the mid-1800 , most notably by Louis Pasteur , that germs were the cause of disease .
See also Arikha 's book ( it was swallowed by my uncatalogued library so I am ... reordering it ) .
The most complete compendium is in Wooton Bad Medicine : Doctors Doing Harm Since Hippocrates .
p 184 [...] why doctors for centuries imagined that their theories worked when they did n't ; why there was a delay of more than two hundred years between the first experiments designed to disprove spontaneous generation and the final triumph of the alternative , the theory that living creatures always come from other living creatures ; why there was a delay of two hundred years between the discovery of germs and the triumph of the germ theory of disease ; why there was a delay of thirty years between the germ theory of putrefaction and the development of antisepsis ; why there was a delay of sixty years between antisepsis and drug therapy .
[ he explains elsewhere that there was no money in microscopy , which delayed implementation ... ]
Elsewhere Wooton shows how surgeons resisted anesthesia ( because it was considered cheating ) , how doctors in France were still bleeding patients at the end of the 19th century , yet : In 1851 [...]
Dietl showed that bloodletting tripled the death rate in a pneumonia .
p 240- Pasteur had a sensible distrust of doctors .
p 14 I took it for granted that in an open argument , good ideas would always defeat bad ideas . [...]
Peer group pressure often halt progress in its track .[...]
Despite the brilliant work of philosophers and historians of science , no one has really worked out how to write a history that takes account of this .
p 293 Shapin tells us that " The Harvard biochemist L.J. Henderson [ 1878 -1942 ] was supposed to have remarked " that it was only sometime between 1910 and 1912 ... that a random patient , with a random disease , consulting a doctor chosen at random , had , for the first time in the history of mankind , a better than 50 - 50 chance of profiting from the encounter . " '
Also , something that explains why I am going nuts .
By 1861 [ Semmelweiss ] was denouncing those who had not adopted his views as murderers .
James Le Fanu : The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine ( 1999 ) talks of " collective deception " .
I call this the translational problem because of a great paper by Ioannides ( my hero ) et al .
Life Cycle of Translational Research for Medical Interventions in Science ( Sept 5 , 2008 ) -- they show how long it takes from initial scientific paper to implementation -- and how the cycle is lengthening .
But my problem is that the gap knowledge / practice is not curable -- the arrow goes from practice to knowledge .
New books on medical history : Gloria Origgi have me a book on Semmelweiss by ... Louis Ferdinand Celine ! ( merci mille fois ) .

I also got a long paper by Gerd Gigerenzer on medical practice and conditional probability ( I guess it is the misunderstanding of Type 2 error that is costing us so much ) .
Also I consider the work of Gary Taubes ( and soon the book by Art DeVany ) as documents in the history of medical errors .

Canguilhem wonders why it took so long to figure out iatrogenesis : " Quant a l'iatrogenese medicale , comment peut - on penser que les médecins aient attendu la deuxieme moitié du XXe siecle pour observer les effets secondaires " [ Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie des sciences , Vrin , 1968 , 1994 ] .
Scribonius Largus : who accompanied Claudius , was interested in pharmacology but not interested in hidden causes .
Comme indices plaidant en faveur de cette orientation empirique chez Scribonius , on peut noter la place de choix acordée a la pharmacologie , le respect scrupuleux des auctores , de meme que l'absence d'interet pour la connaissance des choses cachées .

113 - Negative Advice ; Why We Need Religion
At the core of the expert problem is that people are suckers for charlatans who provide positive advice ( what to do ) , instead of negative advice ( what not to do ) , ( tell them how to get rich , become thin in 42 days , be transformed into a better lover in ten steps , reach happiness , make new influential friends ) , particularly when the charlatan is invested with some institutional authority & the typical garb of the expert ( say , tenured professorship ) .
This is why my advice against measuring small probabilities fell on deaf ears : I was telling them to avoid Value - at - Risk and the incomputable rare event and they wanted ANOTHER measure , the idiots , as if there was one .
Yet I keep seeing from the history of religions that survival and stability of belief systems correlates with the amount of negative advice and interdicts -- the ten commandments are almost all negative ; the same with Islam .
Do we need religions for the stickiness of the interdicts ?
Telling people NOT to smoke seems to be the greatest medical contribution of the last 60 years .
Druin Burch , in the recently published Taking the Medicine
The harmful effect of smoking are roughly equivalent to the combined good ones of EVERY medical intervention developed since the war . (...)
Getting rid of smoking provides more benefit than being able to cure people of every possible type of cancer " [ emph . mine ]
Life expectancy : Another problem .
I keep hearing the fiction that medical practitioners doubled our life expectancy .
Life expectancy increased because of 1 ) sanitation , 2 ) penicillin , 3 ) drop in crime .
From the papers I see that medical practice may have contributed to 2 - 3 years of the increase , but again , depends where ( cancer doctors might provide a positive contribution , family doctors a negative one ) .
Another fooled - by - randomness style mistake is to think that because life expectancy at birth was 30 , that people lived 30 years : the distribution was massively skewed : the bulk of the deaths came from birth & childhood mortality .
Conditional life expectancy was high -- I do not know of many measurements ( it should not be too hard ) -- just consider that Paleo men had no cancer , no tooth decay , almost no epidemics , no economists , and died of trauma .
Perhaps legal enforcement contributed more than doctors to the increase in life .
60 Religion Protects You From Bad Science -- Medicine , Expert Problems , and the Rationality of Temples
I - Medicine
Nobody seems to notice that over the millennia religions ( all religions ) have saved people from death – because it protected them from doctors and “ science ” .
Because of the illusion of control , we feel like “ doing something ” when facing a problem – “ seeing an expert ” , etc .
If religion is at least neutral then it is a great way to stay out of harms ’ way : science , faux - experts , quacks , etc .
Martial in his epigrams gives us an idea of the perceived expert problem in medicine in his time ( i.e. , the doctor causing more harm than expected , but exploiting his expert status ) :
Nuper erat medicus , nunc est uispillo Diaulus : quod uispillo facit , fecerat et medicus I thought that Diaulus was a doctor not a caretaker –but for him it appears to be the same job .
Non habui febrem , Symmache , nunc habeo .
I did not feel ill , Symmache ; now I do ( after your ministrations ) .
Montaigne goes deeper .
He reports on the attribution problem seen by the ancients –not too different from current stockbrokers & economists .
Doctors claimed responsibility for success and blame failure on mother nature .
On demandoit à un Lacedemonien qui l'avoit fait vivre sain si long temps : L'ignorance de la medecine , respondit il .
Et Adrian l'Empereur crioit sans cesse , en mourant , que la presse des medecins l'avoit tué .
A Lacedaemonian was asked what had made him live so long ; he answered “ ignoring medecine " .
The Emperor Adrian continually exclaimed as he was dying that it was his doctors that had killed him .
Mais ils ont cet heur , selon Nicocles , que le soleil esclaire leur succez , et la terre cache leur faute ; et , outre - cela , ils ont une façon bien avantageuse de se servir de toutes sortes d'evenemens , car ce que la fortune , ce que la nature , ou quelque autre cause estrangere ( desquelles le nombre est infini ) produit en nous de bon et de salutaire , c'est le privilege de la medecine de se l'attribuer .
Tous les heureux succez qui arrivent au patient qui est soubs son regime , c'est d'elle qu'il les tient .
Les occasions qui m'ont guery , moy , et qui guerissent mille autres qui n'appellent point les medecins à leurs secours , ils les usurpent en leurs subjects ; et , quant aux mauvais accidents , ou ils les desavouent tout à fait , en attribuant la coulpe au patient par des raisons si vaines qu'ils n'ont garde de faillir d'en trouver tousjours assez bon nombre de telles ...

Effectively you hear accounts of people erecting fountains of even temples to their favorite gods after these succeeded where doctors fail ( see Vivian Nutton ’s Ancient Medicine , an interesting book for a start , though near - silent about my heroes the empiricists , and not too detailed about ancient practices outside of a few standard treatises ) .
I truly believe that it was rational to resort to prayers in place of doctors : consider the track record .
The risk of death effectively increased after a visit to the doctor .
Sadly , this continued well into our era : the break - even did not come until early in the 20th Century .
Which effectively means that going to the priest , to Lourdes , Fatima , or ( in Syria ) , Saydnaya , aside from the mental benefits , provided a protection against the risks of exposure to the expert problem .
Religion was at least neutral –and it could only be beneficial if it got you away from the doctor .
Montaigne on why the last thing a doctor needs is for you to be healthy [ Agency Problem ] .
Nul medecin ne prent plaisir à la santé de ses amis mesmes , dit l'ancien Comique Grec , ny soldat à la paix de sa ville : ainsi du reste .
The easy part is to show that religion was superior to science .
It is hard to accept it : religion protects you from bad science .
Now my conjecture , which I am trying to substantiate , is that the empiricists ( Agrippa , Philinus , Menodotus , etc. ) and to some extent the medical methodists , did not have the expert problem .
The empiricists insisted on the “ I did not know ” while facing situations not exactly seen in the past , for which an exact treatment did not repeatedly yield a cure .
The methodists did not have the same strictures against analogy , but were still careful .
II - Agrippa ( no relation )
Which brings me to a strange , and strangely overlooked writer –or perhaps a literary mystery as we could be dealing with two writers .
Or a joke .
Or a madman –a victim of acute schizophrenia .
Montaigne ’s sources on medicine come from the recycling of the very erudite Henry Cornelius Agrippa ’s
De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum atque artium declamatio invectiva ( “ De vanitate ” ) , published c.1530 .
It is a strange skeptical attack on the negative aspect of science and knowledge by a 16th century man who is mostly known for a treatise on magic that he wrote before that , & for his practice of magic & alchemy .
And it was not a change of heart : Agrippa continued to practice magic & alchemy after writing the De vanitate ( which attacked alchemy and magic ! ) .
De vanitate is a Pyrrhonian treatise though , seemingly , Agrippa was not aware of the works of Sextus Empiricus ( which had not been available in Latin ) .
He covers literally everything : mathematics , medicine , EVEN FINANCE , in way that is suspiciously similar to ( but more extensive than ) Adversus mathematikos .
I just got a photocopy of the text that Montaigne read ( in Medieval Latin , almost impossible to read owing to the characters & even harder to understand ) , & the only readable document a photocopy of a Medieval French translation by Louis Turquet de Mayerne .
The only bound volume I managed to locate was selling for $ 4000 on Abebooks ( photocopying such text is legal ; photocopied but bound volumes make for a much better reading quality than originals ) .
Agrippa might be the only Pyrrhonian skeptic who was imprisoned for his writings ( I guess if you do not take my brief jail episode in Lebanon into account ) .

87 - Alexander of Aphrodisias & Stochastic Arts
Questio 2.16 .
[ that the stochastic arts do not just differ because they have the same ends and different means , they have ]
So for [ these stochastic arts ] the end is not the achieving of their objective , but the completion of what belongs to the art [ itself ] .
[ Stochastic arts : medicine & navigation as compared to deterministic arts , like weaving or building .
He thinks that the objective of a stochastic art , one that depends on external factors , is the perfect practice itself , which is reminiscent of stoic doctrines ] .
Ierodiakonou & Vanderbroucke [ 1993 ] .
More fundamentally , the Greeks wondered what gave rise to the stochastic nature of medicine .
Here , their ways split .
In the second century AD Alexander of Aphrodisias held it to be an inherent property of medicine .
Medicine does not proceed by syllogisms to the effect that something necessarily and invariably is the case .
Rather , medical propositions are concluded in terms such as " for the most part " , or " in only a rare case " .
These expressions hold true generally , but not necessarily for the individual .
Others such as Galen in the same century , believed that medical science in itself was as impeccable as any other but that its practical application was fallible because of variation in the individual patient .
[ Medicine as a stochastic art .
Ierodiakonou , Katerine , Vandenbroucke , Jan P. , Lancet ; 2/27/93 , Vol. 341 Issue 8844 , p542 , 2 ] .
I looked for Ierodiakonou ’s research ( she is a classicist , V. is a medical researcher ) on the vanishing Aenasidemians .
107 - Misc. Notes
Mathematized Frauds in Medicine ( birth and death of iatromathematics ) : Aside from the Aristotilization of Medicine with the Galenic method ( imbued with logic and rationalizations after Aristotle whom Paracelsus who scorned any form of learning from words called " the great illusionist " ) , there have been forgotten attempts to mathematize medicine .
There was a period during which " medicine derived its explanatory models from the physical sciences " [ Andrew Wear , in Conrad et al. , 1995 ] .
Giovanni Borelli , in De Motu Animalium , compared the body to a machine consisting of animal levers .
" He wrote that God applied geometry when making animal organs , and that since the movements of animals are the proper subject of mathematics they can be understood in terms of levers , pulleys , winding - drums , and spirals , etc.

79 - Bibliography on Ancient Medical Empiricism : very , very few sources
Misunderstanding of empiricism : For bildungphilisters ( financial economists & other ) , empiricism is looking at data and formulating opinions congruent with the data ( using a mental disease commonly called statistical methods ) .
Wrong .
The true meaning of empiricism is the avoidance of inductive generalizations outside the instances in which a given observation was made : you cannot extend the properties too aggressively outside the sample set of observation , particularly when you encounter slight dissimilarities .
So an empirical doctor would focus on the extremely similar .
History can only repeat itself in the exact circumstances of prior occurrences .
It also implies the avoidance of top down theorization , ideas about how things should be in order to fit the presumed mind of nature ( Aristotelian ’ final causes , Galen ’s natural purpose of an organ , today notions of “ equilibrium ” , naïve evolutionary theorists etc. ) .
[ This explains why some cannot understand why I can be skeptical and empirical at the same time ] .
Another major error ( again voiced by two economists , among whom was ( angry ) Lord Eatwell ) : you can not observe without some theory .
Even Galen used it as his lame argument “ Logos is needed for observation … observation is impossible without logos ” .
It misses the point entirely .
Empiricism is not about not having beliefs : it is about avoiding to be a sucker , a decided and preset bias on where you want your error to be –where the default is .
An empiricist defaults to suspension of belief ( hence the link with the skeptical Pyrrhonian tradition ) , while others prefer to default to a characterization or a theory .
Mostly , avoid the confirmation bias !
( we empiricists prefer the disconfirmation / falsification bias ) .
Tension between “ rationalism ” and empiricism :
The distinction appears to be expressed in modern terms ( Claude Bernard - l ' empirisme compris dans son sens le plus large et le plus général est l ' opposé du rationalisme ; l ' empirisme est alors l' exclusion de tout raisonnement de l ' observation et de l' expérimentation . ( emph . his ) )
The medical empirical tradition supposedly died out c. 200 AD .
( to be revived later first by Paracelsus , then by a collection of surgeons , but waxed and waned .
I suppose that it was stamped out by the Arabs ) .
Within Hippocrates ’ corpus some writings are said to be in the rationalist tradition , while others ( the oldest ) are in the empirical tradition .
& Al - Razi on the difference :
فالرازي مثلاً يقدم النظري على العملي، ويعطيه الأسبقية إذ يقول : " من قرأ كتب أبقراط ولم يخدم، خير ممن خدم ولم يقرأ كتب أبقراط " ، ويقول أيضاً : " إن قليل المشاهدة ( أي الخبرة ) المطلع على الكتب خير ممن لم يعرف الكتب "
Note that Al - Razi , nevertheless , stood up to Galen , something that did not take place again for 5 centuries .
He wrote a book called : " الشكوك على جالينوس " .
Primary ( or close to ) : Galen ( almost all there is to know in found subf .
empirica ) , Sextus Empiricus , Diogenes Laertius , Photius , Celsus ( De Medicina ) , Caelius Aurelianus , Arabic texts ( ? ) : Ibn Sina , Al - Razi , Comments on “ Jalinos ” by Averroes ,

OLDER SEQUENCE
114 - " Where is the Evidence ? "
Why do we put passengers through checkpoints when we " have no evidence " that they carry weapons ?
How " unscientific ! "
Why do n't we drink from a stranger 's glass ( in a bar ) , when " we have no evidence " we may get sick ?
Just consider that if airports had no checkpoints , I could predict , with a very high probability , that a plane will be blown up by some terrorist .
Which is also , from a risk management standpoint , why I can safely predict that any enterprise managed by a certain class of " rigorous " idiot savants using a certain class of certainties would blow up .
I leave aside the confusion absence of evidence / evidence of absence -- and the misunderstanding of the very notion of " empiricism " .
It is a fact that in the real world of our daily decision - making 1 ) we do not have much evidence of most relevant things , yet we need to take action ; 2 ) in most situations , " true / false " is never symmetric ( one side is more harmful than the other ) , so the burden of evidence is one - sided .
Which is why once these fakes " doing science " lose their tenures after the endowments ( and charity ) run out of funds , they will be barely fit to do anything in the real - life ecology .
I wonder what you can do with an unemployed , say , academic orthodox economist .
You could do better with non-post - academic cab drivers .
Clearly those the most fit at dealing with " just evidence " will be idiot savants outside their evidence domain .
And I can expect that with the SP500 about 20 % lower than here , you will see tenures unexpectedly evaporating .
The silver - lining of the crisis , perhaps , with the de-academification of society .
When I was warning about the risks of the financial system , I encountered nasty resistance from these types -- recall that I blame the academic establishment for this idiotic risk taking .
" Where is the evidence ? " , they kept saying , missing the subtlety of the a - delon & evidence of fat tails .
Two unpleasant situation , worth naming names because these two individuals are exceedingly harmful to society .
1 ) The most unpleasant situation was the psychologist Dan Gilbert from Harvard who broke the Brockman dinner party etiquette by shouting insults within earshot , c. Feb 2007 , ( and with Harvard 's endowment at > twice its current value ) , and kept ranting in my back that " he offers no evidence ! " .
2 ) The second one was in London , in 2006 , when one Herr Doktor Prof .
Armin Falk University of Bonn , who did some bullshit experiments on bounded rationality , not knowing that I was a trader , shouted in a strong German accent : " I do science ; you just do philosophy " .
Science it was .
So let me take this into more interesting territory , and express my anti-social - planner views .
Even more that in Hayek 's days , the ecology of the real world is becoming too complex for Aristotelian logic : very , very little of what we do can be safely formalized , meaning asymmetries matter more than ever .
Which puts the Western World today at the most dangerous point in its history : unless we get the Bernanke - Summers crowd out of there , it will eventually be destroyed by the machinery of arrogant , formal - thinking civil servants , and Ivy - league semi-retards .
Finally , beyond the current mess , I see no way out of this ecological problem , except through that tacit , unexplainable , seasoned , thoughtful , and aged thing crystalized by traditions & religions -- we can't live without charts and we need to rely on the ones we 've used for millennia .
Le 21e siecle sera religieux , ou ne sera pas !
PS - I went on a European radio to express my ideas .
When asked : what should we do , I replied : just listen to John Gray .
He is the greatest living thinker .
It was a great surprise when a few hours later , I opened my mail and saw John Gray 's book with a handwritten note from him .
111 - The Black Swan , You Fools
People think that I wrote TBS to communicate my ideas about human errors , epistemic arrogance , complexity , and high - impact uncertainty .
The fools .
I wrote a book to talk about Yevgenia , Lebanon , Casanova ; I wanted to express my love for il Deserto and my outrage for the very existence of frauds like Robert Merton le petit .
And I used that Black Swan idea as an excuse .
Any other topic would have bored me .
Had I written a book about the black swan idea almost nobody would have read it .
Some people think they attend the opera for the story .
It is the same with language .
Language is largely made to show - off , gossip , confuse people , delude them , charm them , seduce them , scare them , exploit them , etc .
And , as a side effect , convey information .
Just a side effect , you fools .
110 - Being Self - Owned is a State of Mind
A man is morally free when , in full possession of his living humanity , he judges the world , and judges other men , with uncompromising sincerity .
George Santayana
Is it true ?
How about the reverse : you do not become free by acting intransigent ; those who are free have the obligation to be intransigent .
Fat Tony to Nero : " Being self owned is a state of mind " .

106 - On Killing Oneself
Thierry de la Villehuchet -- an acquaintance of mine -- just killed himself in the aftereffects of the Madoff case .
He had dragged his clients into investing with Madoff .
" Killing himself over money ? " I kept hearing .
No , it is not about the money -- it was other people 's money .
It is about dignity .
I could not help comparing it to Madoff , pictured walking around Manhattan with a faint smirk -- totally insensitive to the harm he caused .
This is an aristocratic act coming from an aristocratic character : you take your own life when you believe that you failed somewhere -- and the solution is to inflict the ultimate penalty on yourself .
It is not the money ; but the embarrassment , the shame , the guilt that are hard to bear .
Someone callous , indifferent to the harm done to others would have lived comfortably ( " it is all about money " ) .
A life of shame is not worth living .
Christianity never allowed suicide ; the stoics did -- it allows a man to get the last word with fate .
Thierry , veuillez recevoir l'expression de mon respect le plus profond .
105 - The Strange Story of Scientific Maleficence
Iatrogenics at the core of professionalism and knowledge .
Iatrogenics only entered my private vocabulary quite recently thanks to a conversation with Bryan Appleyard ; I have been haunted by it since then .
How can such a major idea remained hidden from our consciousness ?
-- indeed iatrogenics sneaked into modern medicine very late ( see Canguilhem 's commentary ) .
This to me is a mystery : how professionals can cause harm for such a long time in the name of knowledge and get away with it .
So to me the history of knowledge is indissociable from the history of intellectual frauds and the mental biases that make us believe in " men of science " .
It entered the vocabulary in 1924 -- but initially referred to the harm caused by the doctor in causing distress to the patient while informing him about his ailment .
It was not until the 1960s that it became part of the culture -- and until recently nobody considered the type 2 error .
Practitioners who were conservative and considered the possibility of letting nature do its job were accused of " therapeutic nihilism " .
See Sharpe and Faden 1998 , Medical Harm .
The authors link skeptical empiricism to therapeutic skepticism . [
I encountered the same insults later with the charlatan Philippe Jorion who considers not wanting to be a turkey " nihilism " .
I also encountered the same with another intellectual fraud , Robert Merton with his " these are the best models we 've got " ( they never consider that " nothing " may be better that the best model ) .
I also encountered resistance from another sucker , a certain physicist - but - critical - of - blind - use - of - physics - in - finance , who could not make the leap from the point that ludified models were impractical to a refusal of the supremacy of a top - down theoretical background -- and that rigor might not resemble what he is used to , or that an " Enstein in finance " might be just a fat Tony ( or , better , a Montaigne ) . ]
Sadly , these iatrogenics were mere rediscoveries after science got too arrogant .
Alas , once again , the elders knew better .
Iatrogenics and harm were not strange to ancient medicine ; they were even formalized - See : Medical Ethics of Medieval Islam with Special Reference to Al - Ruhāwī 's " Practical Ethics of the Physician " , Martin Levey , Transactions of the American Philosophical Society , New Series , Vol. 57 , No. 3 ( 1967 ) , pp. 1-100 .
Church and Epistemic Arrogance : Lateran II , 1139 ( pope Innocent II ) bans the use of complicated weapons in battle " We prohibit under anathema that murderous art of crossbowmen and archers , which is hateful to God " which denotes awareness that complex weapons can break the link action / planned consequence -- but with a disclaimer : the ban is limited to action against Christians and Catholics .
( Source : the jesuit scholar Etienne Perrot ) .
Other Discovery : An original Arabic language medieval commentary on Galen 's discussion of the empiricists : by anonymous reviewer of the differences between the three schools : analogists ( أصحاب القياس ) , empiricists ( أصحاب التجارب ) and methodists ( أصحاب الحيل )

102 - " You are worldly ... i.e. , a theoretician "
The rewards of reading in the text , a great investment : Croesus to Solon [ in the account by Herodotus ] , expressing his admiration at the Athenian visitor : ὡς φιλο σ οφέ ων γῆν πολλὴν θε ω ρίη ς
εἵνεκ εν ἐπελήλ υθα ς -- " you are a lover of wisdom ( φιλο σοφέων ) and have seen a lot of things around the earth ( γῆν πολλὴν θ ε ω ρίη ς εἵνεκ εν ἐπελήλυθα ς ) " .
( Histories , Book 1 , 30.2 ) .
In other words : " you are a philosopher and a theoretician " meant " you are wise and worldly " -- theoria means looking !
It is exactly the opposite of the modern effect for both : lover of wisdom ( not a nerd ) , and someone who has seen things ( not some tenured person with blinders ) !
100 - Platonism , Randomness & Ancestral Lifestyle
Skeptical - empirical lifestyle & ecological conservatism : try to replicate as much as feasible the type of randomness that prevailed in our natural , ancestral environment -- even if it " does not make sense " .
Defer to nature , not to your intuition .
It does not mean that the ancestral world is necessarily better -- it is just a default assumption that what has been around for a long time is more robust and more stable than what is less seasoned .
And mother nature 's ecological intelligence is vastly superior to that of humans ( particularly academic scientists ) .
It looks like we need randomness in both energy output and expenditure , with a negative correlation between the two .
Just consider that we worked harder when hungry ( thus compounding the deficit ) , and conserved energy during periods of feeding -- exactly the opposite of the dictates of Platonic " equilibrium " .
The effect is to make our net energy " lumpier " : large deficits followed by large excesses , followed of course by large deficits , etc .
I am discovering from the literature ( under Art De Vany 's guidance and based on his ideas on metabolic switches ) that three meals a day is for morons -- we need episodes of hunger punctuated brief by periods of replenishing .
Hunger improves insulin sensitivity , brain function , etc .
So it is a good idea to , counterintuitively , fast on days when we need the energy , rather than the opposite .
Our Platonic " make sense " indicates that you need to " eat well " during a period of physical stress -- the opposite holds true empirically : fasting chemo patients do much much better .
Without actual testing , every cancer patient has been told to " eat well but not excessively " .
The same applies to thirst .
Stochastic sleep :
I have not seen anything on the subject in the literature , but I am also realizing that stochastic sleeping periods might be good for us .
I have been traveling on red eye flights and went through such memorable experiences as a whole night standing at Mumbai airport ( there were no seats available and I needed to stay near the gate ) .
After a sleepless night .
I always manage to catch up , as I design my own schedule .
I am now discovering that sleep if vastly more enjoyable after periods of deprivation -- much like the taste of water under extreme thirst .
So , by tinkering , I figured out that I fare best under the following conditions : no breakfast , working out randomly ( but in a lumpy way : long walks & intense weight lifting without a scheduled time limit ) , " working " randomly , fasting when working out , avoiding modern carbs ( and modernized fruits ) , avoiding contact with economists and finance idiots , taking red eye flights & fasting during episodes of jet lag and similar physical stressors .
99 - The Black Swan ... of Absence of Secrecy
In the past , pre-Web days , people used to stash money in Switzerland .
They felt safe -- the last spot in the world where they could be found out is such a place with a long tradition of banking secrecy .
Today , UBS –who lured many into concealing assets in its “ safe ” harbor – is going to hand the names of the clients to the US Justice department .
All clients .
Weakened by the subprime crisis , UBS ( and other banks ) are vulnerable .
Now ... surprise .
The clients were not paranoid enough .
For hundreds of years , Switzerland was a black hole of information .
Then , suddenly ...
This extends to the Web .
People do not realize that EVERYTHING they have done on the web , in the illusion of anonymity , has traces .
And these will remain for 5 , 10 , 100 years !
Everyone was shocked to see Yahoo handing over to the Chinese the name of a dissident ( now in jail ) .
A simple subpoena can make any entity deliver all details about a web subscriber .
But that is not even necessary : the weak point in any organization is the employees .
Just as the Germans bribed employees in Luxemburg banks ( and the French have been getting anything they want out of Geneva ) , I AM CERTAIN that you can bribe someone at any web server to deliver anything ( Web detectives ? ) .
The other problem is that someone who wants to sue you can arbitrage forums .
If I want to sue someone for libel in the UK , all I need to do is prove web hits in the UK –so a US resident can sue another US resident in the UK , the Philippines , or Lebanon – wherever the laws are more favorable and the definition of defamation is broadest .
I thought the web would make us anonymous ... we are no more anonymous than if we lived in a small pre-industrial settlement where almost nothing you do can be secret .
We just do n’t know it .
97 - Non-Neutrality of Representation
Having a risk number is not trivial .
It does lead you to do foolish things , even if you knew that the measure was wrong .
If I can show that , many people [ who offered quantitative risk measures in finance ] will have to be held accountable –& I can show that !
One of Fannie Mae director ’s , a quack & proponent of “ Modern Finance ” charlatanism , kept promoting “ scientific ” risk measurement methodologies that do not measure risks adequately , but lead people to TAKE MORE RISK foolishly thinking they know something .
[ This is the reason I singled out Fannie Mae in The Black Swan as a firm sitting on dynamite & the International Association of Financial Engineers as a society of snake oil vendors harmful to society ] .
After > 1 trillion in losses I can safely say that my statement that the banking system has been taking more risks than they thought SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY .
So I hold that giving someone a bad risk measure was just as CRIMINAL as giving someone the wrong medicine .
For a long time nobody sanctioned doctors who poisoned their patients .
Why do n’t we take on the proponents of quantitative risk management , put them in jail so they stop harming us ?
Now I generalize the point with non-neutrality of representation .
Goldstein & I will be testing experimentally on risk measures ( cohorts given a risk measure v/s another one deprived of such “ tool ” ) .
But we can take the non-neutrality of representation into something much more general , more interesting than finance .
95 - Pre-Popper – Negative Empiricism & the Sophistication of Sextus
From Brochard ( the 1887 text , 1932 reprint ) :
Negative theses :
" Les theses négatives tiennent chez les sceptiques bien plus de place que chez les positivistes .
" Si par exemple les empiriques ne se contentent pas d'énumérer simplement les cas où un phénomène se produit , procédé qui , suivant la très juste remarque de Stuart Mill , ne permet que des inductions très générales , et perd toute valeur quand on veut formuler une loi particulière ; s'ils tiennent compte des cas où un phénomène ne se produit pas , appliquant ainsi ce qu'on a appelé de nos jours la méthode de différence ; s'ils veulent s'assurer que le phénomène se produit ou toujours , ou rarement , ou qu'il fait défaut autant de fois qu'il apparaît , ou qu'il n'arrive jamais , c'est très probablement à Ménodote qu'ils doivent cet excellent précepte : on peut du moins le conjecturer d'après le passage de Galien où il est rapporté ; nous y voyons en effet que c'est Ménodote qui a donné un nom à l'expérience qui ne se conforme pas à cette règle . "
On why Sextus is not truly Pyrrhonian ( he was vastly more sophisticated than his predecessors –and followers ! ) :
" Le mot indifference ( αδιαφορια ) que Pyrrhon avait toujours a la bouche ne se trouve pas une seule fois dans les trois gros livres de Sextus .
La doctrine a fait du chemin depuis le pauvre ascete Pyrrhon jusqu 'au savant médecin Sextus Empiricus "

Overview
Laser illuminated HDTV has arrived , in the form of a 10 Ã ¢â ‚ ¬Â deep 65 Ã ¢â‚ ¬Â display .
It represents MitsubishiÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s effort to capture the top rung of home theater enthusiasts .
ForÃ‚Â $ 7000 retail price , the L65 - A90 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s will treat you to a level of performance that exceeds any display I have tested to date in terms color gamut , brightness and low power consumption .
In addition , its black levels were as deep as the darkest display previously reviewed .
Ã‚Â Complimenting the TVÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s black level is its ability to resolve dark detail and not bury it ( into black ) as some other displays do .
Overall the L65A90 rates in the stratosphere of top displays , specifically the Pioneer Kuro Elite plasmas , the LED backlit Samsung 950 LCDs and the 65Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Panasonic Premiere TH - 65VX100 .
Mitsubishi has announced it will sell additional models in the future , including a 73Ã ¢â‚ ¬Â in 2009 .
Lasers have been demonstrated by other companies for use in LCD flat panels and front projectors and while Mitsubishi remains hush - hush regarding other future products , after seeing the L65 - A90 , I have no doubt that we will be seeing a line of LaserVue HDTVs in the not to distant future .

The L65 - A90 is housed in an attractive high gloss black plastic cabinet , with a very thin ( about Ã‚Â ½ Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â ) bezel encompassing the top , left and right side of its 65 Ã ¢â ‚ ¬Â screen .
The bottom contains the left right speakers , electronics and optics .
The screen is a sandwich made up of at least four layers of material ( Mitsubishi would not specify the exact number ) .
They include a Fresnel lens specially designed to achieve the L65 - A90 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 10.05 - inch depth , a lenticular layer , a glass layer ( it adds to screen rigidity ) and a very effective anti-reflective top layer with a matte finish .
The closed mouths at Mitsubishi would nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t reveal the details on how they shrunk the depth of the 65 Ã¢â‚ ¬Â projector , however previous Mitsubishi thin design commercial rear projectors used a convex mirror along with the special cut Fresnel lens to accomplish the reduction .
The setÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s dimensions are 57.7 inches wide by 38 inches high by 10.05 inches deep .
The weight is 136.4 pounds .
There is an optional wall bracket available ( $ 199 ) that adds about 2 ″ to the depth .
The LA65 - A90 uses a Texas Instruments .65Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Dark Chip 4 DLP ( Digital Light Processor ) as the microdisplay imager .
As with all 1080 p DLP rear projectors , the chip uses a pixel shifting technique to produce 1920 x 1080 pixel frame every 1/60 of a second .
The red , blue and green lasers each fire sequentially 28 times the frame rate ( according to a Mitsubishi spokesperson ) , resulting in freedom from color breakup ( often called rainbows ) , that can be seen by some viewers using conventional DLPs with projection lamps and spinning color wheels .
The remote control is similar the ones Mitsubishi supplies with it other HDTVs , except the backlight is blue rather than red .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a simple , straightforward affair with a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ hotÃ¢â‚ ¬Â button for Video settings ( as well as a dedicated audio setting button ) .
The easy to use on - screen graphic user interface is carried over from the previous yearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Mitsubishi HDTVs .
My only gripe , the menu expires in 5 seconds , an insufficient amount of time to compare different video settings .
Features
There are three picture modes called Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚ ¬Â , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ BrightÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚ ¬Â .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚
¬Â picture mode employs a color space that is close to the HDTV broadcast standard called Rec. 709 , while theÃ¢â‚ ¬Â BrilliantÃ¢â‚
¬Â mode expands the color points beyond 709 to the widest color space I have ever measured .
A special algorithm converts HDTV content to MitsubishiÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s expanded color gamut .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrightÃ¢â‚ ¬Â mode falls somewhere in - between Natural and Brilliant in its color range .
The color point data for Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚¬Â and Brilliant are listed in the performance section below as well as a graphic above that compares the color gamut of the LaserVue TV inÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚
¬
Â mode against the showroom modes of SamsungÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s LN - 46A650 and LN46A860 and Panasonics TH - 46PZ850U .
There is also a Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ GameÃ¢â‚
¬Â picture mode , used with the MitsubishiÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s PC input and was not tested .
The L65 - A90 has a 120 Hz display mode option Mitsubishi calls Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Smooth 120Ã¢â‚ ¬Â .
Engaging the circuit significantly improves motion resolution ( more on this later ) .
There are two other picture enhancement modes .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ SharpEdgeÃ¢â‚
¬Â adds edge enhancement , but also creates a white halo around sharp edges .
The other picture control called Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Deep Field ImagerÃ¢â‚
¬Â analyzes the image and dynamically enhances black levels in portions of the screen to provide strong detail .
There are six aspect ratios for standard definition signals : Standard , ( some other set makers call it Full ) ; Expand ( linear Zoom ) Zoom ( recommended for 2:35 anamorphic DVDs ) Stretch ( often called Just by other set makers , it stretches the image progressively from center ) Stretch Plus ( Similar to Stretch it distorts the image less that Stretch but crops more of the top and bottom ) and Narrow ( 4:3 ) .
When viewing HD images the aspect ratio choices are Standard , Wide Expand and Zoom ( for window box images with black bars on all four sides ) .
The L65 - A90 incorporates MitsubishiÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Perfect Color and Perfect Tint adjustments .
Using both controls allowed the taming of exaggerated reds called Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Red PushÃ¢â‚
¬Â lowering the intensity of red its proper proportion to the other primary and secondary colors .
Connectivity
The L65 - 90 has all its inputs jacks mounted on the rear side panel ( see photo ) .
They include two antenna jacks , four HDMI 1.3 jacks , one 15 pin sub D connector for a PC , one component video input , one composite input , and one component video input .
The L65 - A90 accepts 480i / p ; 720 p ; 1080 i and 1080 p ( 24 p or 60 p ) .
It also accepts a number of computer formats including VGA , WVGA , XGA and SXVGA .
There is also a digital audio output a jack for a 3D sync emitter ( for viewing PC 3D games with 3D glasses , which were not tested ) .
Performance Tests
I performed all tests and evaluations at MitsubishiÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US headquarters in California .
User controls were adjusted in the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚ ¬Â modes .
Geometry tests revealed Mitsubishi ( like other shallow depth projection TV makers ) uses electronic geometry correction to eliminate screen distortions such as keystone errors .
This requires an overscan of about 2.5 % .
Placing a crosshatch pattern on - screen revealed a very slight bowing of horizontal lines in the center about 25 % from the bottom of the screen .
A Mitsubishi spokesperson said this was correctable using built - in adjustments performed by a technician and future production will fix this minor issue .
The white lines of the crosshatch test pattern were uniformly crisp from edge to edge with no color fringing .
Since lasers are very narrow wavelength devices , ( see photo ) the optics can not cause color fringing ( chromatic aberrations ) , according to a Mitsubishi representative .
Next , an evaluation of a full screen Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ white fieldÃ¢â‚ ¬Â called 100 IRE Raster pattern .
This test revealed a slight non-uniformity and brighter screen center ; however , neither effect was noticeable in any source material viewed , including scenes with a solid blue sky .
There was no speckle ( sparkles causes by lasers reflecting off the screens flat surface ) a breakthrough considering all other laser displays seen in the past ( including earlier Mitsubishi prototypes ) had speckle issues .
Off - axis viewing confirmed an acceptable viewing angle of around 130 degrees horizontal with a gradual drop off in brightness as one moves from center .
There was no color shift seen as one moves off center .
The viewing angle compares favorably to many LCD flat panels and is far better than any of the LED backlit LCDs observed to date .
Plasma is still is the king in uniform horizontal off - axis viewing .
Vertical viewing brightness drops off considerably as one shifts above or below center , this is similar to many LCD flat panels , once again , plasma is the best performer in this category .
Image brightness was nothing short of amazing .
The maximum brightness on - center using 100 IRE full raster with the Deep Field Imager ( DFI ) activated produced a 110.88 - foot lamberts , shutting off the DFI circuit dropped it down to 93.75 ftl.Ã‚Â
To compare , the brightest LCDs ( in uncalibrated showroom mode ) LCDs typically about 70 ftl while most fall in the 40 - 50 ftl range .
Ã‚Â After Calibration , most LCD displays drop down to 20 - 30 ft lamberts in order to provide the deepest black levels ( the LCDÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s backlights are turned down ) .
The L65 - A90 produced 66.1 ft lamberts in the post calibration , using the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚ ¬Â mode .
This extremely high brightness level allows excellent viewing and contrast in rooms with intensely high ambient light levels ( think of the levels found in supermarkets or during daylight in homes with huge picture windows and no window treatment ) .
In Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚
¬Â mode , after optimizing the user control settings , 100IRE brightness came in at 50.2 ft lamberts .
The L65 - A90 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s black level was far below the ambient light levels of the room used for testing .
With lights out , a 0 IRE black screen was jet black .
Observing bright white credits on the screen center revealed a very dim glow at the bottom center of the screen , however , this was the only circumstance where this phenomena was observed .
Color Temperature
There are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ HighÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ LowÃ¢â‚ ¬Â color temperature settings .
In Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ HighÃ¢â‚ ¬Â mode , the reading was 11,199 K , making white and grays too blue .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ LowÃ¢â‚ ¬Â setting was very close to the industry standard of 6500 K with reading of 6518 K ( x.3115 , y.3394 ) @ 20 IRE ( dark gray ) and 6570 K ( x. 3110 , y.3347 ) .
There are service mode adjustments of gray scale ( also called white balance ) however ; the readings were so close to perfect I do not believe a calibration would yield a noticeable improvement .
Color Gamut
( Photo - Color Gamut List NTSC , Mitsubishi L65 - A90 - “ Brilliant ” mode , Samsung LN - 46A650 “ Dynamic ” mode , Samsung LN - 46A860 “ Dynamic ” mode , Panasonic TH - 46PZ850 “ Vivid ” mode )
Color reproduction by the LaserVue in its Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚
¬Â mode was unlike any other display device previously tested .
Reds are so intense and crimson theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re indescribable .
Ditto for yellows , purples and other colors and hues .
You really need to see the LA65 - A90 to appreciate it ( more on color later ) .
Ã‚Â The Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚
¬Â mode constricted the color gamut to approximate the Rec. 709 HDTV standard .
For the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ techiesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â the x.y. coordinate readings were as follows Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœBrilliantÃ¢â‚¬Â and Natural modes , for reference , the coordinates of the Digital Cinema Initiative ( DCI ) and Rec. 709 standards are also listed

Signal Processing
Silicon Optix HQV standard DVD and high definition Blu-ray test discs were utilized to evaluate the L65 - A90 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s signal processing .
` The SD test results were excellent , except for the jaggies tests and two of the minor film cadence tests ( used occasionally with animation ) .
The HD test patterns provided similar results , passing all tests but the 3:2Ã‚Â and jaggies tests .
The findings are as follows :
SD HQV TestsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Test Score / Maximum Possible Score

Static and Motion Resolution
There is a 120 Hz mode called Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Smooth 120Ã¢â ‚
¬
Â that is designed to reduce motion blur .
The results were similar to the readings of most top scoring 60 Hz and 120 Hz LCD conventional fluorescent back lit ( CCFL ) flat panels with 1080 lines Static Resolution ; 610 lines in 120 Hz mode and 320 lines resolution in 60 Hz mode .
Power Consumption
Simply stated the Laser TV is the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ greenestÃ¢â‚ ¬Â display measured to date .
It consumed between 93 to 96 watts depending on source material .
With its 65 Ã¢â‚
¬Â screen power and 94 watt average power consumption , usage is only .052 watts per square inch .
LCD and Plasma flat panels typically use 3 - 4 times ( or more ) power .
( Photo of power consumption meter reading of 92.88 watts )
Viewing Tests
Images from Blu-ray movies and television programs were the sources used for the evaluation .
Alien vs. Predator ( AVP ) Requiem is my favorite for checking out low - level detail .
The results were excellent .
AVP has some of the darkest segments of any recent movies viewed .
The L65 - A90 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ability to create deep black while maintaining the surface features of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ AlienÃ¢â‚
¬Â were quite impressive .
A number of other displays would bury parts of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ AlienÃ¢â‚
¬Â into the background , while the Mitsubishi kept them separate and distinct .
DisneyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Sleeping Beauty recent Blu-ray release was a masterpiece .
The digital restoration is defect free and extremely impressive .
In the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚ ¬Â mode , the colors were solid and vibrant .
In the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚ ¬Â mode , they practically popped of the screen !
I highly recommend Sleeping Beauty to readers for its incredible non-computer age animation art .
Casino RoyaleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s opening color scene ( it begins as a flashback in black and white ) provided an excellent test bed for motion detail , contrast , flesh tones and color reproduction .
During the crane portion , I noted the bright intensity of the yellow construction workerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s safety vests , the deep azure sky behind Daniel Craig and the amazing range of brightness this display was capable of reproducing .
It was at the end of a 12 - hour testing evaluation session and the high brightness of the display provided an incredible punch and contrast even though all the test roomÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ceiling lights were on .
Overall , the expanded color gamut of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BrilliantÃ¢â‚
¬Â mode provided a more satisfying viewing experience than the Rec.709 constricted color of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ NaturalÃ¢â‚
¬
Â mode setting .
Some of my colleagues dispute assertions as to why a wider color range is better , however , with the L65 - A90 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ability to choose either setting ( Natural and Brilliant ) , you too can compare color reproduction and draw your own conclusions .
To wrap up , the L - 65A90 has its place among the best HDTVs in the market today .
Price wise , it is comparable or less than competing size flat screen displays such as the 65Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Panasonic Premiere .
The HD Guru awards the Mitsubishi L65A90 its highest Ã¢â „ ¢Â¥Ã¢â „ ¢Â¥Ã¢â „ ¢Â¥Ã¢â „ ¢Â¥ rating .

While Bob Sutton knows GM very well ( research , speaker , existing contacts there ) , he can't stop himself from feeling compelled to speak his mind .
Here are some extracts from his piece ;
I am ambivalent about whether the auto industry should receive the 25 billion dollars ...
I worry that it will be a waste because the industry has lost so much money and so many jobs in recent years that these firms are in a death spiral that is impossible to stop ...
I also believe it will be a waste because the leaders of these firms ( at least GM , which I know best ) are so backward and misguided that the thought of giving these bozos any of my tax money turns my stomach – which is pretty much the same point made by observers ranging from ultra-capitalist Mitt Romney to near - socialist documentary filmmaker Michael Moore .
Bob continues ;
To me , a pair of root causes standout :
Most of the senior executives -- and many of the managers -- are ( 1 ) clueless about what matters most and ( 2 ) suffer from a “ no we can ’t ” mindset ... the norm in meetings is that the highest status person in the room does all or most of the talking ... more so than any organization I have ever dealt with , employees are expected to express agreement with their bosses ...
GM is a culture where subordinates are expected to shut - up and kiss - up when the boss is around ...
Do I believe that that the current crop of executives could transform the GM culture to include these and other practices that will increase their awareness of what is going in their company and in the marketplace ?
No ...
But this “ ca n’t do ” mentality is pervasive .
Perhaps the most salient example comes from the perks offered to executives ...
Consider the case of the free GM cars .
This is n’t a new problem .
Many other observers have commented on it before me .
I commented about it very forcefully about to some GM managers a few years back .
I argued that they needed to abolish the program because it caused the whole top of the company to be out of touch with the car ownership experience .
They answered that GM could n’t possibly get rid of the program because they had negotiated such a great tax deal with the state of Michigan ( much better than Ford , they bragged ) and because it was one of the few perks left for white collar employees .
I was not very nice , I argued that this mentality was one of the reasons that the company was in trouble and would get in more trouble .
They treated me like I was insane .
If there were ever a case of a firm 's human and economic values being out of line , this must be one of them !

There is overwhelming evidence that power corrupts .
Of course , some people claim the foregoing chronology is wrong : it is not power that corrupts but the corrupt who seek power .
I think both are true .
I do not deny the phenomenon of decent people running for office or otherwise trying to assume unjust authority over others .
But such people do not seek power per se .
It is not a goal in - an - of - itself but a means to achieving another end .... social justice , individual rights , religious purity .
Power is merely a necessary evil or an expedient .
Of course , the decency does n't last long once people start wielding their authority over others ; you cannot embrace injustice and remain a just human being .
At some point , being powerful becomes a habit -- that is , it becomes part of who you are -- so it seems only natural for you to enjoy special privileges or a respect that you are denying to others .
This creates elitism -- the kind of double standard by which those who make or administer the law do not believe they have to abide by it themselves .
I understand that process far better than I understand its corollary : namely , why do " the people " agree with the politician and accept that he or she deserves special privileges and respect ?
Turkeys will join their feathery cousins , chickens , in having their genome sequenced .
During this Thanksgiving season , hungry diners wo n't be the only ones turning their attention to the tasty birds .
Scientists plan to use the latest technology to sequence the turkey genome .
The domesticated turkey , Meleagris gallopavo , is native to North America .
Turkeys have a distinctive wattle that hangs from the underside of their beak and a fleshy piece at the top of their beak called a snood .
Their wingspans can reach up to nearly 6 feet ( 1.8 meters ) , though they are generally unable to fly .
According to the National Turkey Federation , turkey was the fourth most popular choice of " meat protein " for consumers in the United States in 2007 .
An estimated 271 million turkeys will be raised in 2008 .
The genome sequencing project is being done by the Turkey Genome Sequencing Consortium and will be completed at Virginia Tech 's Virginia Bioinformatics Institute .
Once the turkey 's genome is sequenced , it will be compared with the already sequenced chicken genome to examine similarities and differences in genome organization .
The genome sequence will help turkey breeders improve commercial breeds of turkey for production traits such as meat yield and quality , health and disease resistance , fertility , and reproduction , the researchers said .
" Having the turkey genome sequence at hand will help uncover disease - resistance and immune - related genes that can then be targeted to improve our understanding of disease development in the context of host - pathogen interactions , " said Rami Dalloul , assistant professor of poultry immunology at Virginia Tech .
Other food staples for which the genomes are now known include corn , chicken and rice .
Other animals that have been sequenced include dogs , chimpanzees and mice .

Morgan Stanley Is One Bank That Cites a Loan From TARP Money Several banks refuse to account for billions in public funds .
Dec. 17 , 2008  --
Banks that were rescued with billions of dollars in public funds have , in most cases , refused to provide specifics about how they have used or intend to use the money .
ABC News asked 16 of the banks that have received money from the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion Trouble Asset Relief Program the same two questions :
How has your financial institution used the money , and how much has your financial institution allocated to bonuses and incentives this year ?
To read the banks ' responses , click here .
Goldman Sachs reported Tuesday that it paid $ 10.93 billion in compensation for the year , which includes salaries and bonuses , payroll taxes and benefits .
That is down 46 percent from a year ago .
Goldman Sachs received $ 10 billion from the Treasury .
Is Your Adjustable - Rate Mortgage About to Reset ?
Tell ABC News
" Bonuses across Goldman Sachs will be down significantly this year , " a bank representative told ABC News .
The spokesman refused to disclose the size of the bonus pool or how much of the compensation fund of $ 10.93 billion was planned for bonuses .
" We do not break down the components of compensation ; however , most of that number was not bonuses , " he said .
Goldman Sachs added , " TARP money is not being paid to employee compensation .
It 's been and will continue to be used to facilitate client activity in the capital markets . "
Goldman Sachs has pointed out that seven of its senior executives were forgoing bonuses this year .
The company also reported Tuesday that it lost $ 2.1 billion in the last quarter .
" It looks like Goldman Sachs is treating this as business as usual , " said compensation expert James Reda .
" They are taking our taxpayer money .
They should be able to account for that money .
" What 's missing from this report is the exact amount of bonuses that were paid , " said Reda .
He later added , " They 're hiding the ball . "
Fred Cannon , chief equity strategist with Keefe Bruyette and & Woods , an investment bank that specializes exclusively in financial services , said , " It is difficult to say what the TARP funds are directly used for .
In terms of compensation , while TARP funds may not directly pay for compensation , the funds do provide additional overall cash to the companies . "
When pressed for what the TARP money was being used for , Goldman Sachs replied that it is spent to " facilitate client activity in the capital markets . "
Only One Bank Cited a Loan It Made
Of the 16 banks that were contacted by ABC News and asked how they were spending the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars , only one bank pointed to a specific loan that it made with the cash .
That was a $ 17 billion loan that Morgan Stanley made to Verizon Wireless .
Morgan Stanley , which received $ 10 billion from TARP , released its quarterly finances today .
The bank announced a dramatic and larger - than - predicted $ 2.37 billion quarterly loss but an overall year - end profit of $ 1.59 billion .
That was down 49 percent from last year .
The bank 's stock price dropped 72 percent this year .
In response to an ABC News email request , Morgan Stanley public information officer Mark Lake confirmed that bonuses are down " approximately 50 percent . "
Besides the Verizon loan cited by Morgan Stanley , the banks declined to detail how they were using the federal funds .
" Tarp money does n't go into bonuses , " Lake said , in an email to ABC News .
Wells Fargo said that of the $ 25 billion it received , it " cannot provide any foward - looking guidance on lending for this quarter [ and ] Intend[s ] to use the Capital Purchase Program funds to make more loans to credit - worthy customers . "
More typical was the generic response by the Bank of New York Mellon , which said of the fortune it had banked in public moneys : " Using the $ 3 billion to provide liquidity to the credit markets . "
Congress and fiscal watchdogs have been frustrated and upset that the banks do not have to account for the way they are spending these publicly financed bonanzas .
The U.S. Treasury has spent or committed $ 335 billion of the $ 700 billion in the TARP fund in an attempt to get banks back in the lending business and to unfreeze the nation 's credit markets .
Last week Congress was angered to learn that giant insurance company American Insurance Group , which received $ 150 billion in TARP cash to stay afloat , was paying more than $ 100 million in " retention bonuses " to 168 employees .
That revelation prompted Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md. , to complain , " It 's absolutely and incredibly wrong that we do n't have more transparency . "
All the Banks That Got TARP Cash Indicate They Are Paying Bonuses
While several banks said that its top executives would skip bonuses this year or its compensation pool was smaller this year than in past years , all indicated that some end - of - year compensation was in the works .
When asked how much the banks were paying out in bonuses and whether TARP funds would be used to finance them , most of the banks did not make such a declaration .
" Incentive compensation not yet allocated , " was as far as JP Morgan Chase , which received $ 25 billion from TARP , would go .
Bank of America , which got $ 15 billion from TARP , said only , " Have reduced the incentive targets by more than half .
Final awards have not been determined . "
State Street Bank ruled out using TARP to reward its top officers .
" Will not use any of the proceeds from the TARP Capital Purchase Program to fund our bonus pool or executive compensation , " the bank insisted .
Cannon said the banks are being very conservative with their money .
After reviewing the statements the banks provided to ABC News he said , " The banks are expressing good intention in line with the good intention of the program .
However , the answers from the bank belie the current challenge ; the economy is deteriorating rapidly and making good loans , with strong underwriting into an economy that is falling apart is very difficult . "

Home workout can be as affective as exercising at the gym .
What you get back from your home workout sessions is what you give in the exercise .
This , of course , does not mean that in order to achieve the desired result you should spend countless hours each day exercising .
When exercising at home you should know that not all types of exercise bring the same result .
Some home exercises are more effective than others ; some seek to exercise multiple muscles , some to burning more calories .
Regardless what is your goal there are several types of exercises you can do at home and a number of tips to follow to make your home workout more effective .
7 Tips for the effective home workout
1. Exercise with varying intensity
This practice can be implemented in walking as well as in other aerobic exercises and will help you strengthen your physical condition but also it will help you to lose weight fast .
It ’s also very simple to achieve , while walking , for a few minutes increase your speed and start running and after that go back to walking pace again .
In aerobics accelerate a little your intensity of exercise and then relax again .
These variations in intensity helps the heart to strengthen the pulses , your body to accelerate blood circulation and to oxygenise better , while burning more calories .
2. Better breathing better exercise
Psychologists insist that the various scents that invade our body through smelling may be particularly beneficial for the body and assist towards a more effective workout .
Studies has proved that smelling mint before you start running helps you breathe better and thus improving your running performance and stamina .
The experiment was with 40 people that run for 15 minutes .
Half of them smelt mint before running .
The results proved that those who smelled mint managed to run for more time and needed less time to rest than those who have not smell mint .
So the next time you start your workout at home , do not wear your favourite perfume , but prefer a mint flavour body cream .
If you choose to do something more intellectual such as yoga , cinnamon is said to be miraculous in helping you meditate and jasmine is very good to help you rest after any exercise .
3. Music can help you exercise better
There are times when music can be annoying while exercising , but it is proven that music can be very beneficial for some exercises , especially running .
Scientists of Brunel University argue that when we listen to music while we workout , we increase our levels of strength by 13 % !
Some people use music to calm and relax while for others listening to music produces the exact opposite results .
Music gives them more power and strength to work out harder .
When exercising at home , select music that gives you more power and makes you feel like dancing and jumping .
It is important to identify the kind of music that wakes your senses and start listening to music while you workout .
4 . A few peanuts , please !
It is a little strange to see someone eating peanuts while resting from exercise , but the truth is that nuts are a rich source of protein , essential for proper functioning of muscles after the intensity of exercise .
They also include carbohydrates and other necessary ingredients to help our body recover those lost during the exercise through sweat .
With a few pistachios our body can recover from losses and receive all necessary supplies to be able to continue exercising .
Do not forget the next time you start exercising at home to have some nuts handy , in addition they taste very nice .
5 . The best time to exercise is in the afternoon
Maybe is more convenient to do your workout early in the morning before going to work , but scientists tell us that the best time for exercise is the afternoon hours .
This is because the morning rates of the body are not in full alert as needed to make the exercise effective .
The ideal time for healthy exercise is between 5 and 6 pm , the hour that the body is more flexible and muscles more ready to be exercised .
6 . Proper selection of sports shoes can make the difference
For each type of exercise there are different types of athletic shoes .
For example , if you intend to do jogging you cannot wear shoes you use for aerobic exercise .
Choose the appropriate shoes for the exercises you are going to perform .
The perfect athletic shoe should not be very narrow or very tight to your feet but at the same time should not be very wide and bigger than your feet .
The proper size of athletic shoes should feel comfortable on your feet .
Finally , do not forget to tight your laces , to avoid injuries .
7. Attention to hyperthermia and hypothermia
During the exercise , the body temperature rises .
In conjunction with the high temperature of the environment you may suffer hyperthermia ( dizziness , headache , difficulty orientation … ) .
In this case , stop exercising immediately .
To avoid , however , hyperthermia , be sure to consume enough water before the start of the workout .
If again , you exercise in a place where the temperature is low , protect yourself from hypothermia by wearing enough clothes to keep you warm .
5 Exercises for the effective home workout
There are a number of exercises you can do at home .
Not all exercises bring the same results .
The 5 exercises below are the most efficient exercises for your home workout sessions .
8. Walking
Walking is perhaps the most important form of exercise .
Exercise by walking can be done by anyone , anywhere , any time of the day .
In addition walking is one of the best exercises for the heart arteries .
Walking can strengthen the heart and also assist your body in burning calories .
Walking is not only for « beginners » , even the most athletic types consider the advantages of walking .
Walking is also good for maintaining and controlling your weight .
Taking into account that when walking in a quick pace you can burn up to 500 calories per hour , you can assume that if a woman must take a day from 1,200 to 1,500 calories , with one hour walking a day she will lose – without reducing the consumption of food around two - kilos a month .
Nevertheless , experts advise not to start walking one hour a day .
Half - hour sessions , three times a week is good for beginners and you can slowly increase the time depending on your strengths .
9 . Deep seats
The type of exercises that need power and strength are very important .
The more fit you are , the easier it can be to burn calories .
This is why it is suggested to perform exercises that workout many muscles at the same time , such as deep seats .
More specifically , with deep seats you exercise your triceps , the tendons of the knee and buttocks .
At the same time they help for the much better support of whist and back .
What is making this exercise a success is the way we do it .
If we use the wrong technique , better not do it at all .
How to perform deep seats exercises correctly :
For best results open feet in width of your shoulders and keep your back straight .
Bend your knees and keep low the rear .
The knees must remain above the height of the ankles for as much time as possible .
In other words imagine , you sit in a chair , but without a chair .
To help you achieve the correct position for deep seats you can use for the first time a chair .
Deep seat exercises will help you make your knees stronger and thus avoid the pain during your daily movements .
10 .
Body weight lunge
As with deep seats , so the projection exercises all key muscles of the lower part of the body : Buttocks , triceps and knees .
It is indeed an excellent exercise because it imitates walking , only to a bigger extend .
The projections , however , are more intensive than the deep seats and help you also improve your balance .
How to perform body weight lunge exercises : Stand with your feet about hip width apart and take a big step forward .
Lower your body so that your back knee almost touches the floor .
Pause and then come back up .
In the bottom position the shin of the front leg should be perpendicular to the ground .
If the knee of the front leg is coming out over the toes then step farther out .
This is very important for the health of the knee .
The front knee should also be tracking over the front foot , do not allow it to fall in or out .
Keep the torso upright throughout the course of the movement .
After completing the set switch legs .
For added resistance place a barbell on your back or grab a pair of dumbbells .
11 . Push -ups
If done in the right way , push - ups are the best exercise for the upper body , exercising harmoniously chest , shoulders , triceps and muscles of the trunk alongside the vertebral column .
It is , moreover , an exercise that responds to each type of trainee ( beginner or not ) and can be applied anywhere , with the hands to touch a table , chair or – the standard - on the floor .
How to perform push - ups correctly : Lay prone ( face down ) on the floor with hands resting under the shoulders .
Push up with the arms lifting the body off the floor .
You may move the hands slightly in any direction to make it more comfortable .
Lower and repeat .
12 . Crunch / sit ups
Who does not want tight , flat belly ?
Experts say that abdominal exercises – and their variations - if done properly can lead to the desired effect soon .
How to perform crunch / sit ups exercises correctly : Lay supine ( face up ) on the floor and bend the knees so that your heels are just in front of your butt .
Cross your arms across the chest .
Contract the abs to curl up lifting the head and upper torso of the ground .
You may stop there or continue up until your torso is touching the front of your thighs .
Lower and repeat .
Written pornography obviously does not depict the actual abuse of children , and does not foster the market for such abuse , except in the sort of attenuated way that the Supreme Court has already found unconvincing .
See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 535 U.S. 234 , 250 ( 2002 ) .
These types of prosecutions are not aimed at people who actually abuse children , and do nothing to protect children from such abuse .
They are simply outdated attempts at enforcing decency by prohibiting certain written words : just the sort of thing attempted centuries ago by the banning of Fanny Hill ( who , by the way , is depicted as a minor ) .
And not enforcing public decency , either , but private decency .
In any case , they have no foundation in the law of child pornography .
Later this week , Karen Fletcher of Donora , Pennsylvania , will be sentenced under a plea bargain for having written fictional stories about sex with children .
( More here , here and here ) .
Other prosecutors have already indicted writer Frank McCoy for similar writings , depicting the written stories in question as “ child pornography . ”
Whatever value or lack thereof that such writings may have , I think these prosecutions are obvious violations of the First Amendment and totally unwarranted by Supreme Court precedent .
The reason it ’s illegal to manufacture child porn is obvious : it violates the rights of children ; they are too young to consent to sexual acts , and therefore it violates their rights to make them do things of that sort .
The reason possessing it is illegal is a bit more complicated : the law is that possession and distribution contributes to the black market that exists for child porn , and because the manufacturing of it is so heinous .
In New York v. Ferber , 458 U.S. 747 , 756-64 ( 1982 ) , the Supreme Court explained that the First Amendment does not bar the state from prosecuting people for selling child pornography for five reasons : first , the need to protect children was obviously very strong , much stronger than the need to protect , say , adult porn actors .
Second , “ [t ] he distribution of photographs and films depicting sexual activity by juveniles ” is much more closely related to the actual abuse of children than adult pornography , id .
at 759 , because it leaves a permanent record of the child ’s exploitation , and because it is “ difficult , if not impossible , to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies . ”
Id. at 758-60 .
Third , the economic motives involved create a special incentive to the abuse of children even though that abuse is illegal in every state .
Fourth , there is very little value in protecting “ live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct . ”
Id. at 762 .
And finally , precedent did not bar the Court from taking the position that child porn has no First Amendment protection .
Similarly , in Osborne v. Ohio , 495 U.S. 103 ( 1990 ) , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment is not violated when a person is prosecuted for possessing child porn , because : ( 1 ) the state was not trying to control what the consumer of porn was doing , or asserting “ a paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne ’s mind , ” id . at 109 , and ( 2 ) because it was “ reasonable for the State to conclude that it will decrease the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the product , thereby decreasing demand . ”
Id. at 109 -10 .
So while the First Amendment would not allow the state to try to force people to stop consuming pornography by simply making it illegal , the First Amendment does allow the government to protect child victims by trying to shut down the market as a whole , and that includes prosecuting makers and sellers of photographic material .
In Ashcroft , the court held that a law against “ virtual ” child porn — in which no actual children were involved in the production — was unconstitutional .
The government argued that the market for virtual , computer - created child porn helped foster a market for the real thing , and that it was hard for prosecutors to tell the difference between the real stuff and computer - generated material .
The Court rejected this argument for “ turn[ing ] the First Amendment upside down . ” 535 U.S. at 255 .
It noted that such an argument would “ allow [ ] persons to be convicted in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in the production , ” id . at 256 , which is clearly unconstitutional because it would “ leave [ ] unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government ’s interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones . ”
Id. at 256 .
The ban on virtual child porn
prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production .
Virtual child pornography is not ‘ intrinsically related ’ to the sexual abuse of children , as were the materials in Ferber .
While the Government asserts that the images can lead to actual instances of child abuse , the causal link is contingent and indirect .
The harm does not necessarily follow from the speech , but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts .
Id. at 250 ( citations omitted ) .
Now , in United States v. Williams , 128 S.Ct. 1830 ( 2008 ) , a few months ago , the Court upheld the constitutionality of a law that banned solicitation ( that is , offers to provide , or requests for ) child porn .
The law also makes it illegal to offer virtual child porn as depicting actual children .
Id. at 1839 .
But here , too , the Court emphasized that it was not expanding the category of unprotected speech : “ an offer to provide or request to receive virtual child pornography is not prohibited by the statute .
A crime is committed only when the speaker believes or intends the listener to believe that the subject of the proposed transaction depicts real children .
It is simply not true that this means ‘ a protected category of expression [ will ] inevitably be suppressed . ’
Simulated child pornography will be as available as ever , so long as it is offered and sought as such , and not as real child pornography . ”
Id. at 1844 .
What these cases make clear is that the government may prohibit the depiction — that is , the photographic or motion picture imagery — of child pornography .
None of these cases have held that the government may prohibit the written description of children engaged in sex .
In fact , the Court has very strongly suggested that written descriptions are not to be thought of in the same terms as photographic depictions .
In Ashcroft , for example , the Court observed that prohibiting the images of “ virtual child porn ” might block legitimate productions or movies of works like Romeo and Juliet , who are minors .
535 U.S. at 247 .
But if written depictions of children having sex qualify as child pornography , then the actual written text of Romeo and Juliet could indeed be rendered illegal [ See update below ] — along with many , many other works that depict children having sex or being the victims of sexual abuse .
Most of all , given the fact that the written stories in question are unquestionably fictitious , it ’s hard not to see these prosecutions as simple moralizing : as attempts , in the Osborne Court ’s words , at paternalistically controlling the heads of the people who write these stories .
Now , the general public may find such stories highly offensive , but that is not gounds for prosecuting them .
Just about everybody has some sexual fantasy or other that they would be extremely embarrassed to make public — fantasies they would never act out in real life .
The whole point of prosecuting acts and not thoughts is that mere thoughts cannot wound .
It is true that words can wound sometimes , but this does not appear to be one of those times .
The prosecution of child pornography should be limited to photographic images or other recordings of actual acts of abuse or exploitation , and not to mere words on paper or on a screen that merely describe or conjure the imagination .
Update : I wrote this part in haste ; of course Romeo and Juliet contains no descriptions of sex and would not itself be banned under the wrong interpretation of the law I 'm attacking .
But there are plenty of other perfectly legitimate works of literature that would qualify and would be subject to censorship under the theory that written descriptions of minors having sex or being abused qualify as child porn .
I ’m all for clean energy .
I think solar panels are sweet , and wind turbines are über cool .
The problem for me is the cost.[ social_buttons ]
While it may make sense for some people to add these to their house , for most of us , they ’re simply out of the question .
Our budget does n’t include ten or twenty thousand dollars for future energy costs .
The easiest way to go green with our energy use is to simply reduce our consumption .
Instead of adding megawatts , let ’s focus on “ negawatts ” – cutting our usage through conscious energy management .
Most houses were not built with energy efficiency in mind , but there are some easy , low - cost hacks for the home that will help you to cut costs and lower your energy footprint .
Some municipalities even offer rebates to cover some of the costs .
Seal the envelope :
The perimeter of your house , or the “ envelope ” , holds the heat in during cold weather and keeps the heat out during the summer .
Chances are , you ’ve got some big holes in your envelope .
Luckily , it ’s one of the easiest things to fix .
Start by examining your windows .
If you feel a draft coming from the sill , your heating budget is going right out the window .
Weatherproofing strips ( closed cell foam or silicone ) are easy to install and generally a cheap fix .
Some key points to check are where the window meets the sill and the joint between the upper and lower window ( if you have windows that open ) .
Also check between the windowsill and the wall , and stuff with insulation and then fill with caulking .
If you have storm windows , seal the frame to the sill ( do n’t caulk the windowpane if you want to be able to remove them during the summer . )
If you have only single pane windows , an easy hack is bubble wrap .
Simply cut a piece to fit your window , moisten it and apply it to the inside of the pane .
You ’ll still get a fair amount of light through it , and you ’ll slow the heat loss considerably .
Now check your doors .
Add weatherstripping to the doorjamb where the door meets it , and put a “ sweep ” on the bottom that will seal the crack when it ’s closed .
Check the area where the doorjamb meets the wall .
Many houses were built during the building boom , when quick outweighed quality .
If you do n’t have a storm door , now might be the time to install one .
Places like Habitat for Humanity or Resource usually have plenty of used ones , and a building supply center may have some on the clearance rack for way below full price .
Get control : Investing in an automatic thermostat for your furnace can save tons of money over the course of just one winter .
Setting it to keep the temperature down at night and to kick on in the morning just before you wake up makes it a no - brainer .
If nobody ’s home during the day , program it to keep a lower temperature until right before you get back .
Close the heating vents in rooms that are n’t in use most of the time .
You can easily open them when you want to be in there .
If you have a space that water pipes go through , wrap them in insulation rather than heating the whole room .
Check the thermostat on your hot water heater .
Chances are , it has n’t been adjusted since installation , and the factory setting is generally way too hot .
Think about it :
When you take a shower , you have to turn on the cold water to make it tolerable , and then you ’ve just undone all of the heating of the water that you paid for .
Turning the temperature down to below scalding will save you money every single day of the year .
After adjusting it , wait 12 hours before changing it again , as you do n’t want to get lukewarm water when expecting hot .
Wrap that sucker :
If your hot water heater is in an unheated space , consider wrapping it with insulation to improve efficiency .
There ’s no sense in heating up the tank and then letting most of the heat dissipate into the surrounding room .
Most building supply stores sell “ jackets ” that fit perfectly , and they do n’t wear out , so you only buy it once .
The same thing goes for your hot water pipes .
Ask at the hardware store for the right product for your needs .
A good investment might be an on - demand water heater , as you only heat the water you need , not 50 gallons at a time .
With natural gas as your heat source , you ’ll also be shifting demand away from a coal - burning electric plant .
Put on an extra layer : Because heat rises , much of the heat loss in your house is through the attic and roof .
If you ’ve got snow on the roof , check for spots where it ’s melted , as those are sure signs of an insulation issue .
A well insulated house will keep a layer of snow on the roof ( which in turn will help to keep the house warmer ) .
If you have an older house , rolling out another layer of insulation over what ’s already there will allow you to keep the heat you ’re already paying for .
It ’s kind of a dirty job , but does n’t take any special skills or tools .
You ’ll need to wear long sleeves , some good gloves , a dust mask , and some goggles .
Use your dryer :
The clothes dryer sends huge amounts of heat right outside that may be used to partially heat your home .
An electric dryer can be unhooked from the outside vent , letting the warm moist air circulate inside .
One caveat here is that if your dryer is in a confined space , you may find that it puts too much moisture into the air and may lead to other issues ( like mold ) .
Caution :
Do n’t do this with a gas dryer !
The exhaust from a gas dryer should always be vented outside .
What have you done to cut your home energy costs ?

Pensioner 's life of grime : Workmen clear 100 TONS of rubbish from OAP 's home
It 's been a while since pensioner Merv Jones tidied up or vacuumed .
In fact , it 's been so long that he might never have been able to find the Hoover amid the astonishing 100 tons of rubbish and bric - a - brac in his home - assuming he ever looked for it .
Every room in the terraced house was filled from floor to ceiling with mouldering junk .
It was even piled up in the hall .
Both front and back gardens were also a mess .
Officials clear pensioner Merv Jones 's house , filled from floor to ceiling with 100 - tons of rubbish , which made it almost impossible to get inside
After years of complaints from neighbours , council officials finally moved in to empty the building in Grimsby , filling skip after skip .
The extraordinary array of bric - a - brac had been collected over decades by the 73 - year - old , including old rifles , ammunition and swords , along with hundreds of more ordinary items , such as dolls , electrical equipment , toys , pictures , books and ornaments .
As well as all the junk , there was a great deal of household rubbish .
Windows were broken , pigeons had moved into the loft and bait traps had to be laid for the rats .
Mr Jones claimed : ' I wanted to clear it myself .
I was trying to get it done . '
The pensioner was put up in a hotel while his house was emptied over three weeks .
North - East Lincolnshire Council intends to reclaim the cost of the operation from him .
Mr Jones , left , looked on as workers cleared his house and is now set to be billed for the removal work
Filled to the brim :
The bric - a - brac was piled so high it nearly touched the ceiling
Residents regarded the property as a blight on their neighbourhood .
Alyson Thomson , 58 , a sales manager , said : ' It is hard to imagine how he did it , but I believe he was living in the house .
It has been complete hell being next door to him . '
She said that , as well as the weapons , council officials found propane gas and chemicals and had to stop work while the fire brigade was called in to deal with them .
She also claimed six dog skeletons were found in the rubbish .
' On the day they started clearing he challenged me in the street , saying " what have you been saying about me ? " .
' I told him what I honestly thought and the police cautioned me , ' Mrs Thomson added .
Council officials are believed to be investigating other addresses owned by Mr Jones .
A warrant for the house clearance was granted at Grimsby Magistrates '
Court under the 1936 Public Health Act , which allows authorities to take control of ' filthy and verminous properties ' .
The house has now been boarded up and it is not clear what Mr Jones will do with the property , which in a good condition would be worth around £ 100,000
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Two customers are suing Wal - Mart for negligence after being injured in a mad rush for post - Thanksgiving bargains that left one store employee dead , the men's attorney said Tuesday .
A temporary worker at this Wal - Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week .
Temporary Wal - Mart worker Jdimytai Damour , 34 , was crushed to death as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a store on Long Island at 5 a.m. Friday .
Attorney Kenneth Mollins said Fritz Mesadieu and Jonathan Mesadieu were " literally carried from their position outside the store " and are now " suffering from pain in their neck and their back from being caught in that surge of people " that rushed into the Wal - Mart .
New York Newsday reported that the Mesadieus are father and son , ages 51 and 19 .
The lawsuit alleges that the Mesadieus ' injuries were a result of " carelessness , recklessness , negligence . "
In a claim against the Nassau County police department , the men also contend that they " sustained monetary losses as a result of health care and legal expenses ... in the sum of $ 2 million . "
" This is a tragic situation that could have and should have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable care .
There are very simple measures that could have been put in place to avoid this , such as barriers along the line to spread people out , extra security and a better police presence , " Mollins said .
He said his clients and others who were at the scene contend that the police " were there ... saw what was happening , and they left . "
Calls seeking comment from Wal - Mart Stores Inc. were not immediately returned .
Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County Police Department said , " it 's our policy that we do n't comment on open litigations " and would not respond directly to Mollins and his clients ' claim that officers left the scene .
He said it is " incumbent upon the store to provide security " but noted that there was no security force present when officers responded to an initial phone call after 3 a.m.
Friday for an unknown disturbance at the site .
Smith said the officers noticed a lack of order with the crowd and began to organize them into a line , remaining on site for about 30 minutes until the crowd had become orderly .
Throughout the morning , officers went back to check on the crowd and continued to notice no disturbance , Smith said .
He said that there were no additional calls for assistance until about 5 a.m. , when people began rushing the doors of the store and trampled Damour .
An autopsy showed that Damour died of asphyxiation after being trampled , Nassau County officials have said .
Video showed that as many as a dozen people were knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the store .
The employee was " stepped on by hundreds of people " as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd , said Nassau County Police Detective Lt. Michael Fleming .

The Indian navy is now patrolling off the Somali coast An anti-piracy watchdog has welcomed the destruction of a suspected Somali pirate vessel in the Gulf of Aden by an Indian navy warship .
INS Tabar sank the pirate " mother ship " after it did not stop for investigation and instead opened fire , an Indian navy statement said on Wednesday .
There has been a surge in piracy incidents off the coast of Somalia .
The latest attack came days after the Saudi - owned Sirius Star supertanker and its 25 crew were seized by pirates .
The supertanker is now anchored off the Somali coast .
' Heartened ' " If all warships do this , it will be a strong deterrent .
But if it 's just a rare case , then it wo n't work , " Noel Choong , who heads the International Maritime Bureau 's piracy reporting centre in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , told Associated Press .
Mr Choong said he was heartened by the Tabar 's success .
" It 's about time that such a forceful action is taken .
It 's an action that everybody is waiting for , " he said .
India is among several countries patrolling the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes which connects the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean .
" The United Nations and international community must decide how to solve this grave problem ( of piracy ) .
They must be more forceful in their action , " Mr Choong said .
He said that action should have been taken " years back or even last year when piracy was just starting - it's clearly getting worse and out of control " .

On Wednesday , the Indian navy said the Tabar spotted the pirate vessel while patrolling 285 nautical miles ( 528 km ) south - west of Salalah in Oman on Tuesday evening .
The navy said the pirates on board were armed with guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers .
When it commanded the vessel stop for investigation , the pirate ship responded by threatening to " blow up the naval warship if it closed on her " , the navy statement said .
Pirates then fired on the Tabar and the Indians retaliated .
There was an explosion and the pirate vessel sank .
Some of the pirates tried to escape on two speedboats .
The Indian sailors gave chase and one boat was later found abandoned , while a second boat escaped .
INS Tabar has been patrolling the Gulf of Aden since 23 October , and has escorted 35 ships safely through the " pirate - infested waters " , the statement said .
Last week , helicopter - borne Indian marine commandos stopped pirates from boarding and hijacking an Indian merchant vessel .
More than 90 vessels have been attacked by pirates this year .
Piracy off the coast of East Africa and the Gulf of Aden - an area of more than 1 m sq miles ( 2.6 m sq km ) - is estimated to have cost up to $ 30 m in ransoms this year , a UK think tank has said .

ED #104 : Intel Reveals More Details On The Core i7 Processors
Earlier today , Intel talked to us about their upcoming Core i7 processors , which would be officially launched this month .
They gave us some additional details on the processors as well as a look at its performance and overclockability .
We also had the opportunity to see four Intel Core i7 systems in action .
As we mentioned in the article Intel 's Desktop CPU Roadmap @ October , 2008 , Intel will be launching three Core i7 SKUs - the Core i7 -965 Extreme Edition , Core i7 -940 an Core i7-920 .
Here are their specifications :
Processor Codename Cores Threads Clock Speed QPI Speed QPI Width QPI Bandwidth L3 Cache TDP Core i7-965 Extreme Edition Bloomfield XE 4 8 3.20 GHz 6.4 GT/s 20 - bits 25.6 GB/s 8 MB 130 W Core i7 -940 Bloomfield 4 8 2.93 GHz 4.8 GT/s 20 - bits 19.2 GB/s 8 MB 130 W Core i7 -920 Bloomfield 4 8 2.66 GHz 4.8 GT/s 20 - bits 19.2 GB/s 8 MB 130 W
For more specifications of the Intel Core i7 ( and other Intel and non-Intel ) processors , please take a look at the Desktop CPU Comparison Guide .
Let 's take a look at what we found out at the session .
Intel Turbo Mode Technology
As we covered in the BIOS Optimization Guide , the Intel Turbo Mode Technology is an Intel Core i7 - specific feature .
It is similar to the Intel Dynamic Acceleration feature that was introduced in the 4th - generation Intel Centrino Duo ( Santa Rosa ) mobile platform .
However , there are some fundamental differences in the way it works .
When there are only two active threads , the Intel Core i7 will automatically ramp up two of its processing cores by one bin ( 133 MHz ) .
When only one thread is active though , the Core i7 will ramp up the sole active processing core by two bins ( 266 MHz ) .
If there are three or more threads , the Core i7 processor will not overclock any of its processing cores .
The two bin limit can be circumvented by the Core i7 Extreme Edition processor .
Because it has unlocked multipliers , the Core i7 Extreme Edition processor can be set to " overclock " its processing cores to much higher clock speeds when there are only 1 - 2 threads running .
To even out the thermal output , the four cores will automatically rotate being the " active overclocked cores " when Intel Turbo Mode is active .
The other 2 - 3 inactive cores will idle ( while remaining at the full clock speed ) to reduce thermal output .

About three weeks ago , Jim Moss over at The Seminal laid the 2008 electoral results map over maps of poverty and income inequality .
The visual comparison was illuminating , and Jim ’s post got me to thinking – what if you did the same thing with a wider range of measures and rankings ?
What kind of picture would emerge ?
( Jim has himself expanded on the exercise in a couple follow - up postings here and here . )
So I spent some time digging , looking for data that may tell us something about how America is constructed at our current moment in time .
Specifically , I went in search of information that would reveal something about the cultural progress we ’re making .
I ’m not the first to do something along these lines – this red state / blue state comparison from after the Bush / Kerry election was revealing , to say the least – but I think it ’s important to continue tracking ourselves according to how we ’re doing on the values that are most likely to drive us onward and upward .
I focused on things like basic measures of prosperity , education , the arts , and so on .
My reasons are pretty simple – education , in particular , is probably the single most important determiner for achievement and social health .
More educated people earn more money , engage in fewer anti-social behaviors , contribute more to the economic and tax base , drive more innovation , and so on .
Education is strongly linked to any number of economic vitality measures , and a recent study “ finds the number of jobs created by increasing education spending is larger than jobs lost from raising taxes to support that spending . ”
On the whole , there ’s no desirable social quality I ’m familiar with that does n’t correlate strongly with education .
I doubt my findings are going to tell you anything you probably do n’t already know , but still , maybe the pictures will be interesting .
First , a note or two on methodology .
What I did , in essence , was note that we have 51 jurisdictions voting for the president – 50 states +
Washington , DC .
Obama carried 29 , McCain 22 .
So I color - coded each measure according to that 29 - 22 break in a way that will make sense once you look at it .
Blue represents the high side – the top 29 jurisdictions – and red the low 22 .
This is not scientific , nor is it intended to be .
The data I was able to find is imperfect in places , and I wish some of it were a little more current .
The break around the 29 - 30 mark is often based on minute differences , and so on .
So take these maps for exactly what they are – rough depictions of how our nation breaks down along a variety of subjective measures .
Let ’s start by having a look at the electoral results from the presidential election .
Next , let ’s see how these results correlate with financial well - being .
The first graphic here indicates average pay .
Per capita income rates are obviously quite similar …
… as are median household income rates .
It appears that Obama did well in states where people are comparatively better off financially .
Now , let ’s compare these maps with a few that tell us about our commitment to education .
First , have a look at this graph , which depicts adult population levels with a bachelor ’s degree or higher .
If you ’re noticing that there ’s a higher concentration of grads in blue states , maybe it ’s because these states tend to spend more on education .
We do n’t exactly lavish our teachers with money anywhere , but again , they have it better in blue states .
I ’m not exactly sure what this next map tells us , but it ’s interesting to note the relationship between income levels , attendance rates and voting behaviors .
At this stage , we at least have enough evidence to suspect a relationship between academic achievement , financial success and education .
We probably wo n’t be surprised at what happens when we begin adding arts expenditures to the equation .
Here , for instance , we see state appropriations for arts organizations .
The Americans for the Arts Action Fund report card evaluations returned results that look strikingly similar .
Do you see a pattern ?
I know I do .
And I suspect that if I had excellent data on every measure of progressive tendency I can think of , the pattern would be even stronger .
Is the correlation perfect ?
Of course not – if you overlay all these maps , what emerges looks like this :
So no , we ’re not as perfect bifurcated as we might fear .
And that ’s good news .
While I hate how we ’ve had our country turned into a red vs. blue battleground , for now the colors illustrate something important .
Here , blue stands for prosperity , educational achievement and a commitment to the pursuit of our higher selves .
And on these measures , bluer is better .

Plans to produce the Prius hybrid in the United States have been put on hold indefinitely , Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday .
Reports surfaced in Japan last month that the automaker was delaying the start of Prius production at its plant near Tupelo , Miss. , until 2011 at the earliest .
Plans had called for the gas - sipping cars to start rolling off the line in 2010 .
Now , as Prius sales continue to plunge along with auto sales in general , “ it is impossible to say at this time when production will begin , ” Toyota said in a statement .

Spokesman Mike Goss said Toyota remained committed to starting Prius production in Mississippi someday .
To date , Toyota has spent about $ 300 million of the Mississippi plant ’s anticipated $ 1.3 - billion price tag .
The automaker plans to finish building the facility , now about 90 % complete , but it wo n’t install the metal - stamping machines , robotics and other expensive equipment needed to assemble cars .
Prius sales plunged 48.3 % to 8,660 in November compared with the same month a year earlier , worse than the 36.7 % drop in overall U.S. light vehicle sales .
The year - to - date picture is somewhat better , with Prius down 9.6 % versus 16.3 % for the industry overall .
Prius sales have been hit by a double whammy of falling gasoline prices and the U.S. recession , which is keeping buyers out of dealer showrooms .
In the summer , when gas prices were topping $ 4.50 a gallon , dealers in Southern California were selling Priuses for $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 over sticker , said Jesse Toprak , executive industry analyst at auto information website Edmunds.com .

Those days are gone , Toprak said .
Priuses occasionally sell below the sticker price , which ranges from $ 22,000 to $ 24,270 , depending on the model .
Toyota now has about a one - month supply of Priuses in the U.S. compared with a 14 - day supply a year ago .
During the summer , the cars were basically selling as soon as they hit the lot .
Overall , Toyota has a 73 - day inventory of cars in the U.S .
There may be further bad news for the Prius on the horizon .
Honda ’s new five - passenger Insight hybrid is due out next year , and the talk is that it will have a base price around $ 17,000 .
“ It ’s going to be the most serious competition Prius ever had in the U.S. market , ” Toprak said .

" Today at our finance lecture one student asked the teacher the following question :
" Is there any negative effects for the economy by a banning short selling ? "
And the teacher answered by saying that he did n't know or could n't think of any negative effects by doing this .
My instinct though says that a banning of short - selling is NOT good for the economy but I cannot explain why .
I do n't have any arguments except that it interfers with the free market .
Do you have a better answer on this question ? "
Pehr has once again posted a question in my Q&A section of such great general interest that it deserves a separate post .
His question was as follows : Yes , I do .
Banning short - selling delays price adjustment to the correct value .
The efficient market hypothesis is based on the assumption ( as well as many other assumptions ) that short - selling is possible .
While I do n't believe in the efficient market hypothesis for other reasons ( that is , many of those other assumptions are wrong ) , it is correct in noting that the ability to sell short helps move markets closer to that ideal .
If a certain stock ( or other asset ) is overvalued , yet the people who realize this have already gotten out of the stock , then the way for them to correct this overvaluation is to sell the stock short .
That way , these informed investors can bring the price closer to its fair value .
But if short - selling is banned , this kind of adjustment can't take place .
Another aspect of this is that people who for some reason believe a certain stock is too cheap can use their money or even borrowed money to buy stocks they think are too cheap .
Yet people who come to the conclusion that a certain stock is overvalued can't do anything about it unless they already owned the stock in the absence of short - selling .
And even those that already owned the stock are limited to their stocks , while people bullish about the stock could possibly borrow to buy more of it .
This creates an asymmetric situation where people bullish about a stock will have much greater influence than those that are bearish about it , which increases the risk that some stocks will be over - valued .
This would be similar to say an election where both Republicans and Democrats had the possibility of voting for the Republican candidate , but only those who had previously voted for the Republican candidate could vote for the Democrat , while previous Democratic voters who wanted to support the Democratic candidate could only have the option of abstaining from voting ( abstaining from buying , so to speak ) for the Republican .
It should be obvious just how great bias for the Republican candidate this would create .
Similarly , bans on short - selling creates a significant bias for bulls that distort stock prices and makes markets less efficient .
Olbermann : ' The president is just full of crap ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This As George W. Bush prepares to leave office , he and his staff appear to be attempting to rewrite history to cast him in a more favorable light -- but it seems that history may have the last laugh .
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann featured three examples of " Revision - gate " on his program Tuesday , starting with Press Secretary Dana Perino 's insistence that , rather than Americans being occupiers , " we are absolutely a guest " in Iraq .
" Obviously , that microphone flying in the post - shoe fracas hit her in her grammar , " Olbermann suggested .
Olbermann 's prime example , however , was Bush 's claim while visiting Afghanistan this week that " I never said the Taliban was eliminated , I said they were removed from power . "
Olbermann refuted this a flurry of Bush quotes , including his statement in September 2004 that " the Taliban is no longer in existence . "
Bush has also repeatedly referred to the " defeat " of the Taliban and claimed in September 2002 that " the Taliban 's ability to brutalize the Afghan people and to harbor and support terrorists has been virtually eliminated . "
" See , here 's the thing , " Olbermann concluded , literally throwing up his hands .
" The president is just full of crap . "

The FTP team at the Debian project have decided that the Affero GPL version 3 licensing ( AGPLv3 ) is consistent enough with the guidelines of the Linux distro that software with the licensing can go into Debian 's main archive .
FTP master Joerg Jaspert reported in the Debian news mailing list that a working group met in Spain the end of November and decided to include AGPLv3 licensed software in Debian 's main archive .
The GNU Affero Public License tries to get around an issue that the usual GPL does n't address : many in the Internet age use free server and web service software that does n't reside on their computers .
Google and Yahoo are among the largest users of free software .
Under previous GPL terms they could adapt this software for their own use and commercialize it , and users would have rights to the source code only when running the software residing on their systems .
The AGPL has an additional paragraph , " Remote Network Interaction ; Use with the GNU General Public License , " that gives users rights to remote source code as well .
This licensing has been an ongoing discussion at Debian , including in wishlist bug reports .
The Debian project has been following its own social contract , primarily addressed in the Debian Free Software Guidelines ( DFSG ) .
Debian releases only software in its Linux distro that falls under these guidelines .
Conflicts arose , for example , around Mozilla 's trademarks on for Firefox and Thunderbird .
With the usual licensing in place , Debian feared that embedded AGPL software could be too much of a cost and trouble for users .
The FTP team therefore came to the conclusion that this usage cost was not " a severe enough problem to restrict the freeness of a work licensed under AGPL , " citing that running network services are already enough of a cost .
They argued that source code distribution costs over the Internet are fairly low to begin with .
Also , sources can come from free software repositories such as Alioth , Savannah and Source Forge instead of from one 's own servers .
The FTP team 's decision opens the way for AGPLv3 software to enter Debian 's main archive , unless the Debian project comes up with another plan or contradictory Grand Resolution .

Good news : we were all able to testify against the bill today , and we gave them a response they were n’t expecting .
There were 10 of us who spoke out against it , ZERO who spoke in support .
Members from Campaign for Liberty , Ohio Freedom Alliance , We Are Change Ohio , John Birch Society , Institute for Principled Policy , Constitution Party of Ohio , and the Libertarian Party of Ohio showed up in support , most of them testified .
After seeing how many of us came , Committee Chairman Blessing changed his mind and decided not to vote on it today .
In fact , he acted like it was a mistake that the paper said “ possible vote . ”
Teri ( OFA , JBS , CPO ) thinks it ’ll probably be voted on at the next committee meeting ( which will also probably not include further testimony ) so we ’ll need to keep watching .
The Senate version was introduced yesterday as well , but last I heard it has n’t yet been assigned to a committee .
Still another thing to keep an eye on .
The committee had some questions and a couple repeatedly voiced concerns , enough so that I definitely think we have a good shot at getting this defeated .
Anthony from We Are Change Ohio recorded all of our testimonies and hopes to have a video put together by Friday , I ’ll post it here as soon as I get it .
Everybody ’s testimonies were GREAT , here are three of them :
Ohio House Judiciary Committee – HJR 8 Opposition Testimony
Frank Koch
Chairman Blessing and members of the House Judiciary Committee , thank you for the opportunity to testify today in opposition to House Joint Resolution 8 .
As fiscal conservative , I ’m in complete agreement that something must be done to limit federal spending and reverse our growing $ 10 trillion dollar debt currently enslaving our country and our children .
I stand before you not against fiscal responsibility , but against the method in which you plan to implement to limit the federal government .
A Constitutional Convention is a very deadly tool to use because the states have little power to control which sections of the Constitution will be opened for manipulation .
Article V of the Constitution says that only Congress , not the States , can appoint delegates to the Constitutional Convention .
The fate of our liberties , freedoms , and rights will be in the hands of these few select delegates who could be ignorant of the law or in the pocket of special interests .
An unbalanced federal budget is caused from irresponsible leadership within Congress and not a flaw within the Constitution .
In fact , an unbalanced federal budget is caused directly from not following the Constitution .
We ’ll be on the right track to fix our $ 10 trillion dollar debt if we started to cut the wasteful and unconstitutional federal programs such as Department of Education , Department of Energy , and Homeland Security .
Lastly , I would like to point out a potential Trojan horse within the proposed resolution that could render the resolution powerless .
Within the resolution it states , “ First , the amendment shall require the President to submit and the Congress to adopt only balanced budgets for all federal programs and agencies , except in times of war . ”
The statement “ except times of war ” may encourage the President and Congress to start and prolong wars as long as possible to escape the peacetime fiscal restraints .
I ask you to please reconsider the wording of this resolution if you choose not to oppose the Constitutional Convention .
In conclusion , I find it quite disturbing how fast this resolution is being pushed through the House .
One must proceed slowly and with extreme caution before even considering a radical action such as a Constitutional Convention .
America , with a few strokes of the pen , can be transformed from a Constitutional Republic into a Socialist Dictatorship and we ’ll be at the complete mercy of the delegates that will change the Constitution as to how they see fit .
I , as a liberty loving American , am not willing to take that chance .
Ohio House Judiciary Committee – HJR 8 Opposition Testimony
Robert Owens
I want thank Chairman Blessing and the members of the committee for allowing me to speak today .
My name is Robert Owens , I am a lawyer from Delaware , Ohio and I am an active member and leader in a number of Christian conservative organizations that embrace the time tested and proven concepts of limited constitutional government , free enterprise and individual liberty bestowed upon us by our creator .
I urge you to vote no on HJR 8 .
Here are some of the possible results of a “ run away ” article 5 convention as described of by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger :
1. Total civilian disarmament .
2. Socialization of industry .
3. Confiscation of private property .
4. Torture of citizens .
5. Suppression of the Press and of Religion
If you started this day unaware of the reasons and legal arguments of a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court that talks of a “ run away ” convention and ,
If you started this day unaware that a totally different ratification process than what you might expect is perfectly lawful and consistent with legal precedent , and
If you started this day unaware that if a article 5 convention is called in the next two years , Nancy Pelosi and her team would get to choose how delegates are selected , how they are paid , where the convention would be held and if the convention were to be held in public or in secret .
And ,
If you started today unaware that Ohio would be the 33rd state in the history of the republic to call for the convention and that 34 is the magic number to forcibly trigger Congress to call the convention .
Then caution is urged .
If any or all of these facts were unknown to you , please do not risk giving Congress a blank check without doing all the research .
We are talking about possible political suicide to the conservative movement .
This move must be carefully examined , not hurried through a December session without scrutiny .
One point of irony should not be missed in this process .
If Congress actually followed the Constitution , we would have a balanced budget and there would be no need for this committee to consider this resolution .
What makes anyone think Congress would be limited by new rules if it does not follow the existing ones ?
The proposed convention could have devastating effects upon our American tradition of being a free people .
This tradition has made us the most prosperous nation and the most charitable nation in the history of the world .
Ohio House Judiciary Committee – HJR 8 Opposition Testimony
Laura Robeson
Chairman Blessing , members of the Committee , I ’m here today to speak out in opposition to this bill because of its potentially massive and irreversible ramifications .
While I am certainly in favor of a balanced federal budget , this is not the right way to bring it about .
It ’s not an error in our Constitution that is resulting in our massive debt , it ’s much more complicated than that , and holding a Constitutional Convention will not solve the problem .
You would do better to support Ron Paul ’s HR 2755 legislation which would abolish the Federal Reserve System and return the monetary power to Congress and the Treasury .
Not only the lack of necessity , but also the speed with which this is being shuffled through is very worrisome .
Both the recent banking industry bailouts and the Patriot Act have shown us what can happen when legislation is rushed through before doing proper research and planning .
How educated is everybody here on what a Convention really entails ?
Not since 1787 has there been one , and this was when the Articles of Confederation were completely thrown out .
Who ’s to say the same wo n’t be done with our Constitution ?
30 states have passed bills similar to HJR 8 and 7 have since realized the danger and rescinded them .
In Alabama ’s HJR 347 ( 2000 ) , it says :
“ There is great danger … in opening the Constitution to sweeping changes , the adoption of which would only create legal chaos in this nation and only begin the process of another two centuries of litigation over its meaning and interpretation . ”
Idaho ’s SCR 129 ( 1999 ) states :
“ … the Constitution of the United States of America has been amended many times in the history of this nation and may be amended many more times , without the need to resort to a constitutional convention . ”
And in New Hampshire ’s HCR 12 ( 2003 ) , it says :
“ … the New Hampshire legislature urges all other states that have applied to Congress to call either a general or a limited constitutional convention to repeal and withdraw their applications . ”
I strongly urge this committee to heed the advice of our fellow states and vote against this bill .
THANKS to everybody who came out today to testify , esp. those who drove quite a while to make it .
I think we made a huge difference , much to their dismay — this is n’t turning out to be a walk in the park as they had hoped .

Many at the government - backed demonstration carried banners , shouted anti-US slogans and waved pictures of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .
Riot police surrounded the US embassy in Damascus , which American officials closed blaming security fears .
The Syrian government has demanded that Washington apologise for the incident .
The US state department and the White House have refused to confirm the alleged attack .
Slogans
The protesters , including many civil servants and students , converged on the central Youssef al - Azmi square .
Closing the Damascus embassy on Thursday , American officials cited " violence and significant damage to US facilities and other embassies " in past demonstrations .
Officials warned US citizens to avoid the area and an American school was also shut temporarily .

Advertisement Damascus has threatened to cut off co-operation on Iraqi border security if the US carries out any more raids on Syrian territory .
Unnamed US officials said last Sunday 's raid killed Iraqi al - Qaeda chief Abu Ghadiya .
They said he had smuggled thousands of fighters across the border into Iraq .
Fury sweeps Syria over raid Profile : Abu Ghadiya Syria has labelled those claims " totally unjustified " and said it was doing all it could to stem any traffic of foreign fighters across the long and porous border .
Iraq , which has also condemned the alleged strikes , said it would share the results of its own investigation into the incident near Abu Kamal .
Five of those killed last Sunday were from the same family , and the BBC's Paul Wood spoke to a woman who lost her husband and four sons in the incident .
She said all the men were working on the house that was in the compound where the Americans landed , and denied any link between them and al - Qaeda .
If confirmed , the strike - some eight kilometres ( five miles ) north of Iraq 's border with Syria - would be the first American attack in Syria since the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .

Transhumanism as Simplified Humanism
Frank Sulloway once said : “ Ninety - nine per cent of what Darwinian theory says about human behavior is so obviously true that we do n’t give Darwin credit for it .
Ironically , psychoanalysis has it over Darwinism precisely because its predictions are so outlandish and its explanations are so counterintuitive that we think ,
Is that really true ?
How radical !
Freud ’s ideas are so intriguing that people are willing to pay for them , while one of the great disadvantages of Darwinism is that we feel we know it already , because , in a sense , we do . ”
Suppose you find an unconscious six - year - old girl lying on the train tracks of an active railroad .
What , morally speaking , ought you to do in this situation ?
Would it be better to leave her there to get run over , or to try to save her ?
How about if a 45 - year - old man has a debilitating but nonfatal illness that will severely reduce his quality of life – is it better to cure him , or not cure him ?
Oh , and by the way :
This is not a trick question .
I answer that I would save them if I had the power to do so – both the six - year - old on the train tracks , and the sick 45 - year - old .
The obvious answer is n’t always the best choice , but sometimes it is .
I wo n’t be lauded as a brilliant ethicist for my judgments in these two ethical dilemmas .
My answers are not surprising enough that people would pay me for them .
If you go around proclaiming “ What does two plus two equal ?
Four ! ” you will not gain a reputation as a deep thinker .
But it is still the correct answer .
If a young child falls on the train tracks , it is good to save them , and if a 45 - year - old suffers from a debilitating disease , it is good to cure them .
If you have a logical turn of mind , you are bound to ask whether this is a special case of a general ethical principle which says “ Life is good , death is bad ; health is good , sickness is bad . ”
If so – and here we enter into controversial territory – we can follow this general principle to a surprising new conclusion :
If a 95 - year - old is threatened by death from old age , it would be good to drag them from those train tracks , if possible .
And if a 120 - year - old is starting to feel slightly sickly , it would be good to restore them to full vigor , if possible .
With current technology it is not possible .
But if the technology became available in some future year – given sufficiently advanced medical nanotechnology , or such other contrivances as future minds may devise – would you judge it a good thing , to save that life , and stay that debility ?
The important thing to remember , which I think all too many people forget , is that it is not a trick question .
Transhumanism is simpler – requires fewer bits to specify – because it has no special cases .
If you believe professional bioethicists ( people who get paid to explain ethical judgments ) then the rule “ Life is good , death is bad ; health is good , sickness is bad ” holds only until some critical age , and then flips polarity .
Why should it flip ?
Why not just keep on with life - is - good ?
It would seem that it is good to save a six - year - old girl , but bad to extend the life and health of a 150 - year - old .
Then at what exact age does the term in the utility function go from positive to negative ?
Why ?
As far as a transhumanist is concerned , if you see someone in danger of dying , you should save them ; if you can improve someone ’s health , you should .
There , you ’re done .
No special cases .
You do n’t have to ask anyone ’s age .
You also do n’t ask whether the remedy will involve only “ primitive ” technologies ( like a stretcher to lift the six - year - old off the railroad tracks ) ; or technologies invented less than a hundred years ago ( like penicillin ) which nonetheless seem ordinary because they were around when you were a kid ; or technologies that seem scary and sexy and futuristic ( like gene therapy ) because they were invented after you turned 18 ; or technologies that seem absurd and implausible and sacrilegious ( like nanotech ) because they have n’t been invented yet .
Your ethical dilemma report form does n’t have a line where you write down the invention year of the technology .
Can you save lives ?
Yes ?
Okay , go ahead .
There , you ’re done .
Suppose a boy of 9 years , who has tested at IQ 120 on the Wechsler - Bellvue , is threatened by a lead - heavy environment or a brain disease which will , if unchecked , gradually reduce his IQ to 110 .
I reply that it is a good thing to save him from this threat .
If you have a logical turn of mind , you are bound to ask whether this is a special case of a general ethical principle saying that intelligence is precious .
Now the boy ’s sister , as it happens , currently has an IQ of 110 .
If the technology were available to gradually raise her IQ to 120 , without negative side effects , would you judge it good to do so ?
Well , of course .
Why not ?
It ’s not a trick question .
Either it ’s better to have an IQ of 110 than 120 , in which case we should strive to decrease IQs of 120 to 110 .
Or it ’s better to have an IQ of 120 than 110 , in which case we should raise the sister ’s IQ if possible .
As far as I can see , the obvious answer is the correct one .
But – you ask – where does it end ?
It may seem well and good to talk about extending life and health out to 150 years – but what about 200 years , or 300 years , or 500 years , or more ?
What about when – in the course of properly integrating all these new life experiences and expanding one ’s mind accordingly over time – the equivalent of IQ must go to 140 , or 180 , or beyond human ranges ?
Where does it end ?
It does n’t .
Why should it ?
Life is good , health is good , beauty and happiness and fun and laughter and challenge and learning are good .
This does not change for arbitrarily large amounts of life and beauty .
If there were an upper bound , it would be a special case , and that would be inelegant .
Ultimate physical limits may or may not permit a lifespan of at least length X for some X – just as the medical technology of a particular century may or may not permit it .
But physical limitations are questions of simple fact , to be settled strictly by experiment .
Transhumanism , as a moral philosophy , deals only with the question of whether a healthy lifespan of length X is desirable if it is physically possible .
Transhumanism answers yes for all X . Because , you see , it ’s not a trick question .
So that is “ transhumanism ” – loving life without special exceptions and without upper bound .
Can transhumanism really be that simple ?
Does n’t that make the philosophy trivial , if it has no extra ingredients , just common sense ?
Yes , in the same way that the scientific method is nothing but common sense .
Then why have a complicated special name like “ transhumanism ” ?
For the same reason that “ scientific method ” or “ secular humanism ” have complicated special names .
If you take common sense and rigorously apply it , through multiple inferential steps , to areas outside everyday experience , successfully avoiding many possible distractions and tempting mistakes along the way , then it often ends up as a minority position and people give it a special name .
But a moral philosophy should not have special ingredients .
The purpose of a moral philosophy is not to look delightfully strange and counterintuitive , or to provide employment to bioethicists .
The purpose is to guide our choices toward life , health , beauty , happiness , fun , laughter , challenge , and learning .
If the judgments are simple , that is no black mark against them – morality does n’t always have to be complicated .
There is nothing in transhumanism but the same common sense that underlies standard humanism , rigorously applied to cases outside our modern - day experience .
A million - year lifespan ?
If it ’s possible , why not ?
The prospect may seem very foreign and strange , relative to our current everyday experience .
It may create a sensation of future shock .
And yet – is life a bad thing ?
Could the moral question really be just that simple ?
Yes .
Defective C++
Part of C++ FQA Lite
This page summarizes the major defects of the C++ programming language ( listing all minor quirks would take eternity ) .
To be fair , some of the items by themselves could be design choices , not bugs .
For example , a programming language does n't have to provide garbage collection .
It 's the combination of the things that makes them all problematic .
For example , the lack of garbage collection makes C++ exceptions and operator overloading inherently defective .
Therefore , the problems are not listed in the order of " importance " ( which is subjective anyway - different people are hit the hardest by different problems ) .
Instead , most defects are followed by one of their complementary defects , so that when a defect causes a problem , the next defect in the list makes it worse .
No compile time encapsulation
In naturally written C++ code , changing the private members of a class requires recompilation of the code using the class .
When the class is used to instantiate member objects of other classes , the rule is of course applied recursively .
This makes C++ interfaces very unstable - a change invisible at the interface level still requires to rebuild the calling code , which can be very problematic when that code is not controlled by whoever makes the change .
So shipping C++ interfaces to customers can be a bad idea .
Well , at least when all relevant code is controlled by the same team of people , the only problem is the frequent rebuilds of large parts of it .
This would n't be too bad by itself with almost any language , but C++ has ...
Outstandingly complicated grammar
" Outstandingly " should be interpreted literally , because all popular languages have context - free ( or " nearly " context - free ) grammars , while C++ has undecidable grammar .
If you like compilers and parsers , you probably know what this means .
If you 're not into this kind of thing , there 's a simple example showing the problem with parsing C++ : is AA BB ( CC ) ; an object definition or a function declaration ?
It turns out that the answer depends heavily on the code before the statement - the " context " .
This shows ( on an intuitive level ) that the C++ grammar is quite context - sensitive .
In practice , this means three things .
First , C++ compiles slowly ( the complexity takes time to deal with ) .
Second , when it does n't compile , the error messages are frequently incomprehensible ( the smallest error which a human reader would n't notice completely confuses the compiler ) .
And three , parsing C++ right is very hard , so different compilers will interpret it differently , and tools like debuggers and IDEs periodically get awfully confused .
And slow compilation interacts badly with frequent recompilation .
The latter is caused by the lack of encapsulation mentioned above , and the problem is amplified by the fact that C++ has ...
No way to locate definitions
OK , so before we can parse AA BB ( CC ) ; , we need to find out whether CC is defined as an object or a type .
So let 's locate the definition of CC and move on , right ?
This would work in most modern languages , in which CC is either defined in the same module ( so we 've already compiled it ) , or it is imported from another module ( so either we 've already compiled it , too , or this must be the first time we bump into that module - so let 's compile it now , once , but of course not the next time we 'll need it ) .
So to compile a program , we need to compile each module , once , no matter how many times each module is used .
In C++ , things are different - there are no modules .
There are files , each of which can contain many different definitions or just small parts of definitions , and there 's no way to tell in which files CC is defined , or which files must be parsed in order to " understand " its definition .
So who is responsible to arrange all those files into a sensible string of C++ code ?
You , of course !
In each compiled file , you #include a bunch of header files ( which themselves include other files ) ; the #include directive basically issues a copy - and - paste operation to the C preprocessor , inherited by C++ without changes .
The compiler then parses the result of all those copy - and - paste operations .
So to compile a program , we need to compile each file the number of times it is used in other files .
This causes two problems .
First , it multiplies the long time it takes to compile C++ code by the number of times it 's used in a program .
Second , the only way to figure out what should be recompiled after a change to the code is to check which of the #include files have been changed since the last build .
The set of files to rebuild generated by this inspection is usually a superset of the files that really must be recompiled according to the C++ rules of dependencies between definitions .
That 's because most files #include definitions they do n't really need , since people can't spend all their time removing redundant inclusions .
Some compilers support " precompiled headers " - saving the result of the parsing of " popular " header files to some binary file and quickly loading it instead of recompiling from scratch .
However , this only works well with definitions that almost never change , typically third - party libraries .
And now that you 've waited all that time until your code base recompiles , it 's time to run and test the program , which is when the next problem kicks in .
No run time encapsulation
Programming languages have rules defining " valid " programs - for example , a valid program should n't divide by zero or access the 7th element of an array of length 5 .
A valid program is n't necessarily correct ( for example , it can delete a file when all you asked was to move it ) .
However , an invalid program is necessarily incorrect ( there is no 7th element in the 5 - element array ) .
The question is , what happens when an invalid program demonstrates its invalidity by performing a meaningless operation ?
If the answer is something like " an exception is raised " , your program runs in a managed environment .
If the answer is " anything can happen " , your program runs somewhere else .
In particular , C and C++ are not designed to run in managed environments ( think about pointer casts ) , and while in theory they could run there , in practice all of them run elsewhere .
So what happens in a C++ program with the 5 - element array ?
Most frequently , you access something at the address that would contain the 7th element , but since there is n't any , it contains something else , which just happens to be located there .
Sometimes you can tell from the source code what that is , and sometimes you can't .
Anyway , you 're really lucky if the program crashes ; because if it keeps running , you 'll have hard time understanding why it ends up crashing or misbehaving later .
If it does n't scare you ( you debugged a couple of buffer overflows and feel confident ) , wait until you get to many megabytes of machine code and many months of execution time .
That 's when the real fun starts .
Now , the ability of a piece of code to modify a random object when in fact it tries to access an unrelated array indicates that C++ has no run time encapsulation .
Since it does n't have compile time encapsulation , either , one can wonder why it calls itself object - oriented .
Two possible answers are warped perspective and marketing ( these are n't mutually exclusive ) .
But if we leave the claims about being object - oriented aside , the fact that a language runs in unmanaged environments can't really be called a " bug " .
That 's because managed environments check things at run time to prevent illegal operations , which translates to a certain ( though frequently overestimated ) performance penalty .
So when performance is n't that important , a managed environment is the way to go .
But when it 's critical , you just have to deal with the difficulties in debugging .
However , C++ ( compared to C , for example ) makes that much harder that it already has to be , because there are ...
No binary implementation rules
When an invalid program finally crashes ( or enters an infinite loop , or goes to sleep forever ) , what you 're left with is basically the binary snapshot of its state ( a common name for it is a " core dump " ) .
You have to make sense of it in order to find the bug .
Sometimes a debugger will show you the call stack at the point of crash ; frequently that information is overwritten by garbage .
Other things which can help the debugger figure things out may be overwritten , too .
Now , figuring out the meaning of partially corrupted memory snapshots is definitely not the most pleasant way to spend one 's time .
But with unmanaged environments you have to do it and it can be done , if you know how your source code maps to binary objects and code .
Too bad that with C++ , there 's a ton of these rules and each compiler uses different ones .
Think about exception handling or various kinds of inheritance or virtual functions or the layout of standard library containers .
In C , there 's no standard binary language implementation rules , either , but it's an order of magnitude simpler and in practice compilers use the same rules .
Another reason making C++ code hard to debug is the above - mentioned complicated grammar , since debuggers frequently can't deal with many language features ( place breakpoints in templates , parse pointer casting commands in data display windows , etc. ) .
The lack of a standard ABI ( application binary interface ) has another consequence - it makes shipping C++ interfaces to other teams / customers impractical since the user code wo n't work unless it 's compiled with the same tools and build options .
We 've already seen another source of this problem - the instability of binary interfaces due to the lack of compile time encapsulation .
The two problems - with debugging C++ code and with using C++ interfaces - do n't show up until your project grows complicated in terms of code and / or human interactions , that is , until it 's too late .
But wait , could n't you deal with both problems programmatically ?
You could generate C or other wrappers for C++ interfaces and write programs automatically shoveling through core dumps and deciphering the non-corrupted parts , using something called reflection .
Well , actually , you could n't , not in a reasonable amount of time - there 's ...
No reflection
It is impossible to programmatically iterate over the methods or the attributes or the base classes of a class in a portable way defined by the C++ standard .
Likewise , it is impossible to programmatically determine the type of an object ( for dynamically allocated objects , this can be justified to an extent by performance penalties of RTTI , but not for statically allocated globals , and if you could start at the globals , you could decipher lots of memory pointed by them ) .
Features of this sort - when a program can access the structure of programs , in particular , its own structure - are collectively called reflection , and C++ does n't have it .
As mentioned above , this makes generating wrappers for C++ classes and shoveling through memory snapshots a pain , but that 's a small fraction of the things C++ programmers are missing due to this single issue .
Wrappers can be useful not only to work around the problem of shipping C++ interfaces - you could automatically handle things like remote procedure calls , logging method invocations , etc .
A very common application of reflection is serialization - converting objects to byte sequences and vice versa .
With reflection , you can handle it for all types of objects with the same code - you just iterate over the attributes of compound objects , and only need special cases for the basic types .
In C++ , you must maintain serialization - related code and / or data structures for every class involved .
But perhaps we could deal with this problem programmatically then ?
After all , debuggers do manage to display objects somehow - the debug information , emitted in the format supported by your tool chain , describes the members of classes and their offsets from the object base pointer and all that sort of meta -data .
If we 're stuck with C++ , perhaps we could parse this information and thus have non-standard , but working reflection ?
Several things make this pretty hard - not all compilers can produce debug information and optimize the program aggressively enough for a release build , not all debug information formats are documented , and then in C++ , we have a ...
Very complicated type system
In C++ , we have standard and compiler - specific built - in types , structures , enumerations , unions , classes with single , multiple , virtual and non-virtual inheritance , const and volatile qualifiers , pointers , references and arrays , typedef s , global and member functions and function pointers , and templates , which can have specializations on ( again ) types ( or integral constants ) , and you can " partially specialize " templates by pattern matching their type structure ( for example , have a specialization for std::vector < MyRetardedTemplate < T> > for arbitrary values of T ) , and each template can have base classes ( in particular , it can be derived from its own instantiations recursively , which is a well - known practice documented in books ) , and inner typedef s , and ...
We have lots of kinds of types .
Naturally , representing the types used in a C++ program , say , in debug information , is not an easy task .
A trivial yet annoying manifestation of this problem is the expansion of typedef s done by debuggers when they show objects ( and compilers when they produce error messages - another reason why these are so cryptic ) .
You may think it 's a StringToStringMap , but only until the tools enlighten you - it 's actually more of a ...
// do n't read this , it 's impossible .
just count the lines std::map<std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > , std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > , std::less<std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > > , std::allocator<std::pair<std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > const , std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > > > >
But wait , there 's more !
C++ supports a wide variety of explicit and implicit type conversions , so now we have a nice set of rules describing the cartesian product of all those types , specifically , how conversion should be handled for each pair of types .
For example , if your function accepts const std::vector < const char *>& ( which is supposed to mean " a reference to an immutable vector of pointers to immutable built - in strings " ) , and I have a std::vector < char * > object ( " a mutable vector of mutable built - in strings " ) , then I can't pass it to your function because the types are n't convertible .
You have to admit that it does n't make any sense , because your function guarantees that it wo n't change anything , and I guarantee that I do n't even mind having anything changed , and still the C++ type system gets in the way and the only sane workaround is to copy the vector .
And this is an extremely simple example - no virtual inheritance , no user - defined conversion operators , etc .
But conversion rules by themselves are still not the worst problem with the complicated type system .
The worst problem is the ...
Very complicated type - based binding rules
Types lie at the core of the C++ binding rules .
" Binding " means " finding the program entity corresponding to a name mentioned in the code " .
When the C++ compiler compiles something like f( a , b ) ( or even a+b ) , it relies on the argument types to figure out which version of f ( or operator + ) to call .
This includes overload resolution ( is it f( int , int ) or f( int , double ) ? ) , the handling of function template specializations ( is it template < class T > void f( vector < T>& , int ) or template < class T > void f( T , double ) ? ) , and the argument - dependent lookup ( ADL ) in order to figure out the namespace ( is it A : : f or B : : f ? ) .
When the compiler " succeeds " ( translates source code to object code ) , it does n't mean that you are equally successful ( that is , you think a+b called what the compiler thought it called ) .
When the compiler " fails " ( translates source code to error messages ) , most humans also fail ( to understand these error messages ; multiple screens listing all available overloads of things like operator << are less than helpful ) .
By the way , the C++ FAQ has very few items related to the unbelievably complicated static binding , like overload resolution or ADL or template specialization .
Presumably people get too depressed to ask any questions and silently give up .
In short , the complicated type system interacts very badly with overloading - having multiple functions with the same name and having the compiler figure out which of them to use based on the argument types ( do n't confuse it with overriding - virtual functions , though very far from perfect , do follow rules quite sane by C++ standards ) .
And probably the worst kind of overloading is ...
Defective operator overloading
C++ operator overloading has all the problems of C++ function overloading ( incomprehensible overload resolution rules ) , and then some .
For example , overloaded operators have to return their results by value - naively returning references to objects allocated with new would cause temporary objects to " leak " when code like a +b+c is evaluated .
That 's because C++ does n't have garbage collection , since that , folks , is inefficient .
Much better to have your code copy massive temporary objects and hope to have them optimized out by our friend the clever compiler .
Which , of course , wo n't happen any time soon .
Like several other features in C++ , operator overloading is not necessarily a bad thing by itself - it just happens to interact really badly with other things C++.
The lack of automatic memory management is one thing making operator overloading less than useful .
Another such thing is ...
Defective exceptions
Consider error handling in an overloaded operator or a constructor .
You can't use the return value , and setting / reading error flags may be quite cumbersome .
How about throwing an exception ?
This could be a good idea in some cases if C++ exceptions were any good .
They are n't , and can't be - as usual , because of another C++ " feature " , the oh - so - efficient manual memory management .
If we use exceptions , we have to write exception - safe code - code which frees all resources when the control is transferred from the point of failure ( throw ) to the point where explicit error handling is done ( catch ) .
And the vast majority of " resources " happens to be memory , which is managed manually in C ++.
To solve this , you are supposed to use RAII , meaning that all pointers have to be " smart " ( be wrapped in classes freeing the memory in the destructor , and then you have to design their copying semantics , and ... ) .
Exception safe C++ code is almost infeasible to achieve in a non-trivial program .
Of course , C++ exceptions have other flaws , following from still other C++ misfeatures .
For example , the above - mentioned lack of reflection in the special case of exceptions means that when you catch an exception , you can't get the call stack describing the context where it was thrown .
This means that debugging illegal pointer dereferencing may be easier than figuring out why an exception was thrown , since a debugger will list the call stack in many cases of the former .
At the bottom line , throw / catch are about as useful as longjmp / setjmp ( BTW , the former typically runs faster , but it 's mere existence makes the rest of the code run slower , which is almost never acknowledged by C++ aficionados ) .
So we have two features , each with its own flaws , and no interoperability between them .
This is true for the vast majority of C++ features - most are ...
Duplicate facilities
If you need an array in C++ , you can use a C - like T arr [ ] or a C++ std::vector<T > or any of the array classes written before std::vector appeared in the C++ standard .
If you need a string , use char * or std :: string or any of the pre-standard string classes .
If you need to take the address of an object , you can use a C - like pointer , T* , or a C++ reference , T& .
If you need to initialize an object , use C - like aggregate initialization or C++ constructors .
If you need to print something , you can use a C - like printf call or a C++ iostream call .
If you need to generate many similar definitions with some parameters specifying the differences between them , you can use C - like macros or C++ templates .
And so on .
Of course you can do the same thing in many ways in almost any language .
But the C++ feature duplication is quite special .
First , the many ways to do the same thing are usually not purely syntactic options directly supported by the compiler - you can compute a+b with a - b * - 1 , but that 's different from having T* and T& in the same language .
Second , you probably noticed a pattern - C++ adds features duplicating functionality already in C .
This is bad by itself , because the features do n't interoperate well ( you ca n't printf to an iostream and vice versa , code mixing std :: string and char * is littered with casts and calls to std:: string :: c_str , etc. ) .
This is made even worse by the pretty amazing fact that the new C++ features are actually inferior to the old C ones in many aspects .
And the best part is that C++ devotees dare to refer to the C features as evil , and frequently will actually resort to finger pointing and name calling when someone uses them in C++ code ( not to mention using plain C ) !
And at the same time they ( falsely ) claim that C++ is compatible with C and it's one of its strengths ( why , if C is so evil ? ) .
The real reason to leave the C syntax in C++ was of course marketing - there 's absolutely NO technical reason to parse C - like syntax in order to work with existing C code since that code can be compiled separately .
For example , mixing C and the D programming language is n't harder than mixing C and C ++.
D is a good example since its stated goals are similar to those of C++ , but almost all other popular languages have ways to work with C code .
So IMO all that old syntax was kept for strictly commercial purposes - to market the language to non-technical managers or programmers who should have known better and did n't understand the difference between " syntax " and " compatibility with existing code " and simply asked whether the old code will compile with this new compiler .
Or maybe they thought it would be easier to learn a pile of new syntax when you also have the ( smaller ) pile of old syntax than when you have just the new syntax .
Either way , C++ got wide - spread by exploiting misconceptions .
Well , it does n't matter anymore why they kept the old stuff .
What matters is that the new stuff is n't really new , either - it 's obsessively built in ways exposing the C infrastructure underneath it .
And that is purely a wrong design decision , made without an axe to grind .
For example , in C++ there 's...
No high - level built - in types
C is a pretty low - level language .
Its atomic types are supposed to fit into machine registers ( usually one , sometimes two of them ) .
The compound types are designed to occupy a flat chunk of memory with of a size known at compile time .
This design has its virtues .
It makes it relatively easy to estimate the performance & resource consumption of code .
And when you have hard - to - catch low - level bugs , which sooner or later happens in unmanaged environments , having a relatively simple correspondence between source code definitions and machine memory helps to debug the problem .
However , in a high - level language , which is supposed to be used when the development - time - cost / execution - time - cost ratio is high , you need things like resizable arrays , key - value mappings , integers that do n't overflow and other such gadgets .
Emulating these in a low - level language is possible , but is invariably painful since the tools do n't understand the core types of your program .
C++ does n't add any built - in types to C ( correction ) .
All higher - level types must be implemented as user - defined classes and templates , and this is when the defects of C++ classes and templates manifest themselves in their full glory .
The lack of syntactic support for higher - level types ( you ca n't initialize std:: vector with { 1,2,3} or initialize an std : : map with something like { " a " : 1 , " b" : 2 } or have large integer constants like 3453485348545459347376 ) is the small part of the problem .
Cryptic multi-line or multi-screen compiler error messages , debuggers that can't display the standard C++ types and slow build times unheard of anywhere outside of the C++ world are the larger part of the problem .
For example , here 's a simple piece of code using the C++ standard library followed by an error message produced from it by gcc 4.2.0 .
Quiz : what 's the problem ?
// the code typedef std:: map<std::string,std::string >
StringToStringMap ; void print ( const StringToStringMap& dict ) { for ( StringToStringMap::iterator p=dict.begin( ) ; p!=dict.end ( ) ; ++p ) { std::cout << p->first << " -> " << p->second << std::endl ; } } // the error message test.cpp : In function ' void print ( const StringToStringMap& ) ' : test.cpp:8 : error : conversion from ' std::_Rb_tree_const_iterator<std::pair<const std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > , std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > > >' to non-scalar type 'std::_Rb_tree_iterator<std::pair<const std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > , std::basic_string<char , std::char_traits<char> , std::allocator<char > > > >' requested
The decision to avoid new built - in types yields other problems , such as the ability to throw anything , but without the ability to catch it later .
class Exception , a built - in base class for all exception classes treated specially by the compiler , could solve this problem with C++ exceptions ( but not others ) .
However , the most costly problem with having no new high - level built - in types is probably the lack of easy - to - use containers .
But to have those , we need more than just new built - in types and syntax in the C++ compiler .
Complicated data structures can't be manipulated easily when you only have ...
Manual memory management
Similarly to low - level built - in types , C++ manual memory management is inherited from C without changes ( but with the mandatory addition of duplicate syntax - new / delete , which normally call malloc / free but do n't have to do that , and of course can be overloaded ) .
Similarly to the case with low - level built - in types , what makes sense for a low - level language does n't work when you add higher - level features .
Manual memory management is incompatible with features such as exceptions & operator overloading , and makes working with non-trivial data structures very hard , since you have to worry about the life cycles of objects so they wo n't leak or die while someone still needs them .
The most common solution is copying - since it 's dangerous to point to an object which can die before we 're done with it , make yourself a copy and become an " owner " of that copy to control its life cycle .
An " owner " is a C++ concept not represented in its syntax ; an " owner " is the object that is responsible to deallocate a dynamically allocated chunk of memory or some other resource .
The standard practice in C++ is to assign each " resource " ( a fancy name for memory , most of the time ) to an owner object , which is supposed to prevent resource leaks .
What it does n't prevent is access to dead objects ; we have copying for that .
Which is slow and does n't work when you need many pointers to the same object ( for example , when you want other modules to see your modifications to the object ) .
An alternative solution to copying is using " smart " pointer classes , which could emulate automatic memory management by maintaining reference counts or what - not .
To implement the pointer classes for the many different types in your program , you 're encouraged to use ...
Defective metaprogramming facilities
There are roughly two kinds of metaprogramming : code that generates other code and code that processes other code .
The second kind is practically impossible to do with C++ code - you can't reliably process source code due to the extremely complicated grammar and you can't portably process compiled code because there 's no reflection .
So this section is about the first kind - code generation .
You can generate C++ code from within a C++ program using C macros and C++ templates .
If you use macros , you risk getting clubbed to death by C++ fanatics .
Their irrational behavior left aside , these people do have a point - C macros are pretty lame .
Too bad templates are probably even worse .
They are limited in ways macros are n't ( however , the opposite is also true ) .
They compile forever .
Being the only way to do metaprogramming , they are routinely abused to do things they were n't designed for .
And they are a rats ' nest of bizarre syntactic problems .
That would n't necessarily be so bad if C++ did n't rely on metaprogramming for doing essential programming tasks .
One reason C++ has to do so is that in C++ , the common practice is to use static binding ( overload resolution , etc. ) to implement polymorphism , not dynamic binding .
So you can't take an arbitrary object at run time and print it , but in many programs you can take an arbitrary type at compile time and print objects of this type .
Here 's one common ( and broken ) application of metaprogramming - the ultimate purpose is to be able to print arbitrary object at run time :
// an abstract base class wrapping objects of arbitrary types .
// there can be several such classes in one large project struct Obj { virtual void print ( std : : ostream& ) const = 0 ; } ; template < class T > struct ObjImpl : Obj { T wrapped ; virtual void print ( std : : ostream& out ) const { out << wrapped ; } } ; // now we can wrap int objects with ObjImpl< int > and string objects // with ObjImpl < std : : string > , store them in the same collection of Obj* // and print the entire collection using dynamic polymorphism : void print_them ( const std::vector < Obj*>& objects ) { for ( int i=0 ; i<( int)objects.size ( ) ; ++i ) { objects [ i]-> print ( std::cout ) ; // prints wrapped ints , strings , etc. std::cout << std::endl ; } }
Typically there are 10 more layers of syntax involved , but you get the idea .
This sort of code does n't really work because it requires all relevant overloads of operator << to be visible before the point where ObjImpl is defined , and that does n't happen unless you routinely sort your #include directives according to that rule .
Some compilers will compile the code correctly with the rule violated , some will complain , some will silently generate wrong code .
But the most basic reason to rely on the poor C++ metaprogramming features for everyday tasks is the above - mentioned ideological decision to avoid adding high - level built - in types .
For example , templates are at the core of the ...
Unhelpful standard library
Most things defined by the C++ standard library are templates , and relatively sophisticated ones , causing the users to deal with quite sophisticated manifestations of the problems with templates , discussed above .
In particular , a special program called STLFilt exists for decrypting the error messages related to the C++ standard library .
Too bad it does n't patch the debug information in a similar way .
Another problem with the standard library is all the functionality that 's not there .
A large part of the library duplicates the functionality from the C standard library ( which is itself available to C++ programs , too ) .
The main new thing is containers ( " algorithms " like max and adjacent_difference do n't count as " functionality " in my book ) .
The standard library does n't support listing directories , opening GUI windows or network sockets .
You may think that 's because these things are non-portable .
Well , the standard library does n't have matrices or regular expressions , either .
And when you use the standard library in your code , one reason it compiles slowly to a large binary image is that the library extensively uses the ...
Defective inlining
First , let 's define the terms .
" Inlining " in the context of compilers refers to a technique for implementing function calls ( instead of generating a sequence calling the implementation of the function , the compiler integrates that implementation at the point where the call is made ) .
" Inlining " in the context of C++ refers to a way to define functions in order to enable ( as opposed to " force " ) such implementation of the calls to the function ( the decision whether to actually use the opportunity is made by the compiler ) .
Now , the major problem with this C++ way to enable inlining is that you have to place the definition of the function in header files , and have it recompiled over and over again from source .
This does n't have to be that way - the recompilation from source can be avoided by having higher - level object file formats ( the way it 's done in LLVM and gcc starting from version 4 ) .
This approach - link - time inlining - is one aspect of " whole program optimization " supported by modern compilers .
But the recompilation from source could also be avoided in simpler ways if C++ had a way to locate definitions instead of recompiling them , which , as we 've seen , it has n't .
The crude support for inlining , designed with a traditional implementation of a C tool chain in mind , would n't be as bad if it was n't used all the time .
People define large functions inline for two reasons .
Some of them " care " ( emotionally ) about performance , but never actually measure it , and someone told them that inlining speeds things up , and forgot to tell them how it can slow them down .
Another reason is that it 's simply annoying to define functions non-inline , since that way , you place the full function definition in a .cpp file and its prototype in a .h file .
So you write the prototype twice , with small changes ( for example , if a class method returns an object of a type itself defined in the class , you 'll need an extra namespace qualification in the .cpp file since you 're now outside of the namespace of the class ) .
Much easier to just have the body written right in the .h file , making the code compile more slowly and recompile more frequently ( changing the function body will trigger a recompilation ) .
And you do n't even need to actually write any inline functions to get most of their benefits !
A large subset of the inline functions of a program are ...
Implicitly called & generated functions
Here 's a common " design pattern " in C++ code .
You have a huge class .
Sometimes there 's a single pseudo - global object of this class .
In that case , you get all the drawbacks of global variables because everybody has a pointer to the thing and modifies it and expects others to see the changes .
But you get no benefits of global variables since the thing is allocated on the stack and when your program crashes with a buffer overflow , you can't find the object in a debugger .
And at other times there are many of these objects , typically kept in a pseudo - global collection .
Anyway , this huge class has no constructors , no destructor and no operator= .
Of course people create and destroy the objects , and sometimes even assign to them .
How is this handled by the compiler ?
This is handled by the compiler by generating a gigantic pile of code at the point where it would call the user - defined functions with magic names ( such as operator= ) if there were any .
When you crash somewhere at that point , you get to see kilobytes of assembly code in the debugger , all generated from the same source code line .
You can then try and figure out which variable did n't like being assigned to , by guessing where the class member offsets are in the assembly listing and looking for symbolic names of the members corresponding to them .
Or you can try and guess who forgot all about the fact that these objects were assigned to using the " default " operator= and added something like built - in pointer members to the class .
Because that would n't work , and could have caused the problem .
Implicit generation of functions is problematic because it slows compilation down , inflates the program binaries and gets in the way when you debug .
But the problem with implicitly calling functions ( whether or not they were implicitly generated ) is arguably even worse .
When you see code like a=f ( b , c ) ( or even a=b+c , thanks to operator overloading ) , you do n't know whether the objects are passed by reference or by value ( see " information hiding " ) .
In the latter case , the objects are copied with implicitly called functions ; in the former case , that 's possible , too , if implicit type conversions were involved .
Which means that you do n't really understand what the program does unless you know the relevant information about the relevant overloads and types .
And by the way , the fact that you can't see whether the object is passed by reference or by value at the point of call is another example of implicit stuff happening in C ++.
One more problem with automatically generated functions ( such as constructors and destructors ) is that they must be regenerated when you add private members to a class , so changing the private parts of a class triggers recompilation ...
Which brings us back to square 1 .

Heartbeats may power future pacemakers
Pacemakers and defibrillators of the future may generate an extra power boost from a surprising energy source - the heart .
Using a microgenerator powered by heartbeats , a British team says their experiment produced nearly 17 % of the electricity needed to run an artificial pacemaker .
They believe the next era of pacemakers could incorporate this technology and result in longer - lasting devices with more added functions to help manage the heart .
" This was a proof - of - concept study , and we provided the concept , " says Dr Paul Roberts at Southampton University Hospital , Britain .
" Harvesting surplus energy might be a major transition in implantable pacemakers and defibrillators because engineers will have more energy to work with . "
A pacemaker sends electrical impulses to the heart to speed up or slow cardiac rhythm , while an implantable cardioverter defibrillator signals the heart to normalise its rhythm if it gets too fast or slow .
Power hungry
The devices are incorporating evolving technology to become increasingly sophisticated , which require more power and increased battery size .
This makes them uncomfortable and cosmetically less appealing , the researchers say .
" The small devices now are really very good , but power consumption must increase if we want to take them to the next level , " say Roberts .
The researchers , who presented their findings at the American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans , tested a generator that helps the heart produce more than enough energy with each beat to pump blood .
The device uses two compressible bladders and a microgenerator mounted on the lead of a pacemaker or defibrillator , the wire that connects the device to the heart .
This lead is attached to the end of the right ventricle , and the bladders relay the energy from the pressure of each heartbeat to the microgenerator , which transforms it into electricity for use by the battery , the researchers said .
The researchers are now working with different materials in the microgenerator , which they believe will produce significantly more power in their next - generation device .
" While at the moment we see about 20 % harvesting , we 're anticipating that will be significantly more in the next iteration of the device , " says Roberts .

Things are getting hot in Iceland e-mail : author : Aftakae - mail : aftaka@riseup.net
Since early this winter , Iceland has been facing economic crisis .
At the same time as " regular " mass demonstrations are taking place , more radical actions have been increasing .
Anarchists , socialists , other radical leftists , and just average people have started taking direct action against the government and global capitalism .
Here is a summary of what has been happening in Iceland for the last two and a half months .
Burning the flag of Landsbanki bank Mass protests in Iceland People break into the Central Bank of Iceland Since early this winter , Iceland has been facing economic crisis .
The three major business banks have been nationalized , putting their dept on the people 's shoulders .
People have been losing their livelong savings , loans have increased and are getting sky high ( and for sure they already were high enough ) .
200 people lost their job , every single day of November and more and more people are facing the threat of losing their houses .
Original text and photos from here : http://aftaka.org/2008/12/12/direct-action-in-iceland/
People are getting angry , some of them wanting back the " good old " prosperity , while others and hopefully the majority , are realizing the real cost of capitalism .
More and more people are standing up against corruption and demanding new form of society - society of justice .
But every day the current government proves that it 's main aim is to save their own and their friend 's ass .
A loan from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has been granted , most likely leading to the common aftermaths of an IMF loan : the privatization of social systems as the health care and the education system , and more destruction of the Icelandic wilderness .
- Weekly demonstrations -
For more than 2 months people have gathered weekly in a park in front of the parliament .
The first protests demanded that the government would " break it 's silence " about the current situation .
People were tired of not even being told about what was happening and what the government was doing about it .
But soon people realized that it was not enough to ask the government to speak , so the protests took up another and more radical demand : the resign of the government and new elections as soon as possible .
The government has completely ignored this demand and people are getting more and more angry .
Anarchists and other radical leftists have come to most of the protests , but not to protest against the economic situation , not to ask the government for solutions , not to ask for new elections , not to ask any member of the government or parliament or any other official institution to do anything to " solve " the crisis we are facing .
But to spread anarchistic and anti-capitalistic information among people , analyze the problems of authority and capitalism and to encourage Icelandic people to take direct action against the forces of corruption .
- Burning of bank flags and " hanging " of a capitalist -
During a protest in front of the prime minister 's office in late October , the flags of two icelandic banks were burned .
A group of anarchists , probably the biggest in Icelandic history at that time , shouted anarchistic slogans , pointing out capitalism as the real problem .
Until then , capitalism seemed to be a ban - word among the protesters .
The flag burning caught the interest of foreign media , e.g. CNN which showed the burning in their news show later the same evening .
An event like this had not happened in iceland for a long time .
A week later , a big demonstration parade went through the center of Reykjavík , demanding the resign of the government .
Anarchists , which grew bigger and stronger every week , joined the march with banners , black flags , leaflets about direct actions , and anarchistic slogans .
While other protesters chanted " Away with the government " , anarchists shouted " Never again government ! "
When the parade came down the the park were weekly speeches took place , a group of people climbed a big fence and hung a doll of a capitalist .
Again foreign media captured the performance on tape and screened it around the world .
Couple of meters away from the park were the protests take place , a Food Not Bombs groups has been giving away food every Saturday for the last 8 or 9 months .
Food Not Bombs has for sure had it's effect of the walking - by Icelanders , who are getting more curious and interested in alternative solutions to the problems of capitalism .
- The government is a cheap and dirty pig -
During a protest , Saturday November 8th , an anarchist climbed on top of the parliament were he hung the flag of Bónus , Iceland 's cheapest supermarket .
The message was clear since the flag is yellow with a pink pig on it : " The government is a cheap and dirty pig ! "
Unlike to the usual Icelandic protesters , people celebrated this act and sang along " The government is a cheap and dirty pig ! "
Soon hundred protesters surrounded the parliament to help the anarchist to get away from the police , which had already arrested a mate of him .
After a bit of a struggle with the police , people managed to help the flag - man ( like he later became known as ) to get down of the roof and de-arrested him more than once .
One could feel some change in the air .
- Illegal arrest -
Less than a week later , on a Friday night , the police arrested the flag - man .
He was in the middle of a research trip to the parliament , organized by his university , when some parliament staff recognized him and called the pigs .
The man had been arrested two years before , for an action with the environmental direct action campaign Saving Iceland , protesting against the building of a big dam , Kárahnjúkavirkjun , in the eastern highlands .
For this action he had got sentenced and fined , but refused to pay the fine and instead insisted on sitting in jail for 18 days .
But after only four days of his jail - sentence he was " thrown out " because of lack of space in the prison .
Now , the police stated that the man would have to sit the other 14 days of the sentence .
The fact is though that the it is not allowed to split the sentence like this , and the man was supposed to get an announcement about finishing his sentence with at leas 3 weeks notice .
This had not been done in his case .
People claimed this was especially done by the police , fundamentally to " take out " an activist who was likely to take more actions during the upcoming weekly demonstration .
So the next day , during the protest which 10.000 people had joined , another protest was announced , this time in front of the police station , a little bit later that day .
- Riots by the police station -
500 people came to the police station and demanded that the man would be set free .
After a while , no sign of the police was seen and nothing looked like the man would be set free .
The protest got heated and soon people had started to break windows of the station and in the end the door of the station was broken .
A group of people went in were the police welcomed them with a splash of pepper spray , without even announcing it .
The protest got even hotter , red paint and eggs were thrown at the station and on the riot squad which now had formed a chain in front of the station .
A lot of people were pepper sprayed , including the flag - man 's mother and young kids down to 16 years old .
In the end , the flag - man was payed out of the prison by an unknown person .
The flag - man came out were he was celebrated like a hero .
He thanked people for the support but encouraged people to use their energy for something else : a revolution !
- Invasion of the Central Bank -
A week after the riots by the police station , the weekly protest was a little more chilled .
Instead people hoped for something big taking place the upcoming Monday , December 1st , the day of Iceland 's sovereignty .
1st of December used to be a free day in Iceland but couple of years ago the proletariat movement disclaimed it´s right .
This 1st of May people were encouraged not to pay their bills , not show up in work and come to a big outdoor meeting on a big hill close to the government offices and the Central Bank .
Few speeches took place , most of the including some nationalistic piffle which the radicals answered with a slogan : " No nationalism - International solidarity ! "
After the meeting was formally over the word on the street was that more radical action was going to take place .
Suddenly a big group of people marched to the Central Bank and entered the first entrance .
The entrance was completely full of people shouting and demanding that Davíð Oddsson , the chairman of the Central Bank board and a former prime minister , would resign .
Few policemen had closed the second entrance but people shouted at them , asked in " what team " they were in , telling them to join the public , leave the entrance and let the people in .
Suddenly the police left the entrance , the people cheered and opened the door to the second entrance .
- Pepper spray again ? -
The second entrance became completely full as well as the first one , but behind big glass doors the riot squad had formed a chain of c.a. 30 pigs , armed with shields , clubs and pepper spray .
Again , instead of speaking to the people , the pigs started shaking their spray cans , forcing to use it against the people it they would not leave .
People started banging on the door , shouting slogans against the Central Bank and the police .
After a while , when a police officer had several times threatened to use the pepper spray , people decided to sit down peacefully and not stand up until Davíð Oddsson would resign .
The action stood over several hours and had it 's peaks when people stood up , lifted up their hands to show they were unarmed and challenged the police to leave , open the doors and let the people bring Oddsson out .
When it became clear that Oddsson had already left the building the protesters gave the police an offer : the riot squad would leave and than the protesters would leave the building .
About 30 seconds later , the pigs walked back and the people cheered some kind of a victory of the people .
- Into the parliament -
A week later , last Monday December 8th , thirty people went in to the icelandic parliament , heading to the inside balcony were the public is legally allowed to sit , watch and listen to what takes place there .
The group announced that the parliament no longer served it 's purpose and the government should therefor resign right now , the other MP 's should use their time for something more constructive .
Only two persons got to the balcony and shouted at the MP's and ministers to leave the building .
Quickly they were brutally removed by a police officer , while the rest of the group was stuck in a staircase inside the building .
The parliamentary session was delayed and all the MP 's left the room .
Meanwhile the protesters were brutally handled by security guards and police , which ended up arresting 7 people , most of them for housebreaking .
But like said before , the public is allowed to enter the parliament balcony .
- A government meeting delayed with human chain -
The next morning , 30 people had gathered in front of the prime minister 's office were a government meeting was supposed to take place .
The people had formed a human chain blockading the two entrances of the house .
When ministers started to show up , the police had already arrived and started to try to remove the chain .
The people resisted heavily and read out a statement sent out by the group .
The statement said that the aim of the action was to " prevent the ministers from entering the house and therefor stop further misuse of power .
Money has controlled people on the cost of their rights and the authorities and their cliques have manipulated finance for their own benefits .
That manipulation has not entailed in a just society , just world .
Time of action has dawn , because a just society is not only possible , but it is our duty to fight for it . "
With the help of the police , all the ministers got in , but heard the statement and were under big pressure from the media .
They were not prepared for questions and came out badly when asked .
The government meeting was delayed because of the actions .
Two were arrested , one for entering a police line and the other one for sitting in front of the police car which was about to drive the other arrested one to the police station .
More people sat on the street and it took the police quite a long time to get out of the street .
Only when a police officer gave the driver an order to " just drive hard " , the driver did so and nearly drove over two persons .
One of the biggest newspapers in Iceland , DV , reported the brutal behavior of the police .
The paper 's journalist and photographer were both attacked by the police , as well as noticing when a police punched a protester in the face , while he lay on the street .
Most other media did not dare to report the brutal behavior .
A left wing website , Smugan , told about a police officer who was asked by the protesters if he would have protected Hitler .
His answer was simple : " Yes , if it would have been my duty . "

More actions have been announced and it will be interesting to see what comes next .

NEW YORK – Bone growth is controlled in the gut through serotonin , the same naturally present chemical used by the brain to influence mood , appetite and sleep , according to a new discovery from researchers at Columbia University Medical Center .
Until now , the skeleton was thought to control bone growth , and serotonin was primarily known as a neurotransmitter acting in the brain .
This new insight could transform how osteoporosis is treated in the future by giving doctors a way to increase bone mass , not just slow its loss .
Findings are reported in the Nov. 26 , 2008 issue of Cell .
Researchers have known that 95 percent of the body 's serotonin is produced by a part of the gastrointestinal tract known as the duodenum , where it was presumed to be involved in digestion .
The brain is where the remaining five percent of the body 's serotonin is produced .
The Columbia research group , led by Gerard Karsenty , M.D. , Ph.D. , chair of the Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , had originally set out to elucidate two rare human diseases affecting bone that are both caused by a mutation in a gene called Lrp5 .
To their surprise , Dr. Karsenty and his team found that Lrp5 regulates synthesis of serotonin in the gut , and that by turning on or turning off the production of this chemical within the gut , they could control bone formation .
Specifically , they found that serotonin tells cells in the skeleton to slow production of new bone .
By turning off the intestine 's release of serotonin , the team was able to prevent osteoporosis in mice undergoing menopause .
" This proof - of - principle paper shows , to our amazement , that bone formation is regulated to a significant extent by the gut !
Through our observations of two rare and severe forms of osteoporosis , one that causes drastic bone loss and one that causes extremely high bone mass , we were able to see clearly what happens with over - production or under- production of serotonin , " said Dr. Karsenty .
" Our hope is that this novel discovery will inform the development of new therapies for the millions of people with osteoporosis . "
Challenging Fundamental Understanding of Bone Formation
Far from being inert , bone constantly undergoes renovation , with some cells responsible for removing old material and other cells responsible for creating new bone .
In humans , after age 20 , the balance between bone formation and breakdown tips toward breakdown , and bone mass starts to decline .
In women , the rate of decline increases after menopause , when estrogen levels drop and cells that tear down old bone become overactive .
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile and porous , increasing the risk of breaks .
It is diagnosed when bone mass drops below a certain level .
This discovery that intestinal serotonin is central to bone formation will likely challenge previously held beliefs among researchers in the field , who have thought for years that the majority of hormones that control bone mass had been identified .
A crucial clue uncovered in Dr. Karsenty 's lab turned his attention to the small intestine .
His research team found that the gene Lrp5 , which had been previously linked to a rare form of osteoporosis , controls the production of serotonin in the gut , and that serotonin is an inhibitor of bone formation .
Indeed , by inactivating Lrp5 in the small intestine of mice and thereby turning on the production of serotonin , bone mass decreased .
While in contrast , the deletion of the same gene in the bone cells of mice , on the other hand , had no effect on bone mass .
" The findings demonstrate without a doubt that serotonin from the gut is acting as a hormone to regulate bone mass , " said Dr. Karsenty .
" As an endocrinologist , I have spent a large part of my career investigating the interplay between energy metabolisms and bone mass .
This demonstration of the vital function of bone proliferation stemming from the gut gives pause to those in my field who perhaps have not given the gut its due examination or the credit it deserves for how much it controls in the body , and that includes me . "
Though all the experiments were conducted in mice , the findings apply to humans , according to Dr. Karsenty , since this work was prompted by the elucidation of the two human genetic bone diseases .
Indeed , Dr. Karsenty 's group verified that circulating serotonin levels were abnormal in human patients with both diseases .
Implications for the Treatment of Osteoporosis
Most osteoporosis drugs , including those currently under clinical investigation , do not generate new bone but prevent the breakdown of old bone .
Only one drug currently on the market can generate new bone , but due to reports that it may increase the risk of bone cancer , its use is restricted for short - term use in women with severe osteoporosis .
" This lack of bone promoting drugs is a major concern because osteoporosis is often diagnosed when the damage to bone is already significant and fracture risk is already too high , " said Dr. Karsenty .
" We need something to build bone , not just prevent or repair its loss . "
Reducing serotonin release from the small intestine should be relatively simple to achieve with a drug , according to Dr. Karsenty , because the cells that produce serotonin come into direct contact with drugs that pass through the gastrointestinal tract .
An inhibitor of gut - derived serotonin synthesis would not need to enter the general circulation , thereby avoiding many potential side effects .
Dr. Karsenty and his colleagues did not find any gastrointestinal problems in mice unable to produce serotonin in their guts , suggesting that a serotonin inhibitor would not produce any such side effects in humans .

The problem with a deflationary collapse of a credit bubble is that everything that worked for you on the way up works against you on the way down .
It ’s sort of like Judo gone wrong .
Where rising levels of credit masked poor business decisions and models , shrinking credit will expose them .
Where credit led to more credit , defaults will lead to more defaults .
Where optimism fueled the ride up , pessimism will drag it back down .
The difficulty for the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department ( and soon , Obama ) is that all the big solutions with the big numbers being thrown at the big problems are insufficient .
The stimulus is not reaching the right places – it ’s getting stuck in the big institutions .
So even as prodigious amounts of money are being created and applied to “ the problem , ” the evidence suggests that their efforts are not working down on Main Street .
The reason for this is very simple – it is not possible to solve a crisis of solvency with liquidity .
It is not possible to fix a crisis of malinvestment with the purchase of bad debts .
Here ’s one example .
Take retail store space .
On the ride up , malls were developed at a furious pace .
By every definition or comparison , the US overbuilt capacity in this sector by a very large amount .
Given this , what ’s going to happen next when this malinvestment is exposed ?
Well , we do n’t have to wait to find out the opening notes of this symphony .
Retailers Will Face Darwinian Fight as Losses Mount
Dec. 18 ( Bloomberg ) — U.S. retailers will face a Darwinian fight for survival next year as they run out of cash as early as January and competition forces thousands of store closings , according to private - equity buyers and restructuring experts .
Probably 50,000 stores could close without any effect on consumer choice , Gregory Segall , a managing partner at buyout firm Versa Capital Management Inc. , said yesterday during a panel discussion held at Bloomberg LP ’s New York offices .
“ The United States is massively over - stored in all categories , ” Segall said .
He said his firm is in “ a wait mode ” and he expects banks to squeeze retailers after Jan .
1 .
The answer is that retail companies will go out of business , stores will become vacant , and the Federal Reserve will find themselves buying up a lot of the failed mortgage notes and exotic derivatives built out of commercial real estate debt , if they have n’t already .
But how does this help ?
The debts are going bad because they represent a bad business decision , undertaken because of false price information , flashed by the mega - credit bubble , spawned by the meddling activities of the Federal Reserve .
The stores are going out of business because the vaunted consumer has left the store and is n’t buying anything .
The ripple starts there and spreads throughout the system , knocking debt pillars out at every step of the way .
As consumers cut back , inventories pile up , and then the production gets cut at the factories .
In turn , their suppliers feel the burn and have to cut back .
The fear for the Fed is that once this dynamic takes hold , it can develop a life of its own that is extremely difficult to control .
Here are two examples of this dynamicat play :
The Consumer Electronics Inventory Glut
Automakers are n’t the only ones halting production as inventories pile up .
The consumer electronics industry is also coming to grips with rising stockpiles of unsold goods that are likely to result in price pressure and falling profit .
Recent evidence of growing inventories came Dec. 15 , when SanDisk ( SNDK ) , a maker of memory cards and storage drives , said it will temporarily stop production at two Japanese plants for two weeks through Jan. 12 .
After that , the factories will resume work at 70 % capacity .
SanDisk hopes the cutbacks will help it whittle away at the piles of unsold devices in warehouses and on retailers ’ shelves .
Bracing for the Global Downturn
Last Friday , the world came to a standstill in Sindelfingen , a town located near Stuttgart .
On normal days , about 1,500 trucks and 52 rail cars arrive at the Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen , carrying steel and glass , tires and dashboards , headlights and seats .
More than 36,000 employees pass through the factory gates every day to develop new models and assemble the current ones — the Mercedes C , E and S classes .
On normal days , at least 1,500 cars roll off the assembly lines at the plant .
But what is normal nowadays , with new reports on the recession coming in each day ?
Now the Mercedes plant is closed — until Jan. 11 .
Production facilities worth billions have been shut down .
Everything , from the paint shop to the welding and production robots to the assembly line itself , has stopped moving .
The worry here is that the economy will hit stall speed , at which point its downward momentum just feeds on itself ruining banks , companies , lives , and even countries .
The whole chain comes to a halt and then morphs into a vicious cycle , where cutbacks lead to job losses , which lead to reduced economic activity , which lead to cutbacks , and so on , down and down , until some sort of a bottom is reached .
Typing “ Production Halt Slowdown ” into Google and constraining the results to the past month yields 150,000 results from all over the world .
We ’ve recently seen headlines about 20 % + export declines for Japan and a shipping index that does not even cover the cost of the fuel and the crews , let alone debt service and insurance .
We ’ve heard about Rio Tinto , the mining giant , laying off 14,000 workers .
We ’ve seen the record declines in spending and capital investment .
Taken together , we have many more signs that the game is being lost by the world ’s central banks than signs of progress .
Whether this can be fixed with another few hundred billion , or even a few more trillion , tossed in the general direction of a few well - connected Wall Street banks is highly questionably at this point .
Given that neither the Fed nor the Treasury has displayed any real understanding about the roots of this problem , it would be wise to prepare for a protracted slowdown and a possible hard landing .
We are very close to stall speed .
The Stone Roses could be the latest iconic Britpop outfit to reunite , at least according to their bassist Gary “ Mani ” Mounfield .
Mani , who currently plays with Primal Screen , recently told Channelbee : “ Me , John [ Squire ] and Reni [ Alan “ Reni ” Wren ] are up for doing it and Ian [ Brown ] just needs some working on .
It ’s something I would love to do before we are all fat and bald .
Start the campaign . ” [ via Gigwise.com ] .
Mani also pointed out that 2009 would be the perfect year for the “ Madchester ” movement pioneers to get back together , in light of the fact that it would be timed to the 20th anniversary of the band ’s self - titled debut album .
Watch : The Stone Roses , “ Fools Gold ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A third of U.S. workers say they have called in sick with fake excuses at least once this year , according to a survey released on Wednesday .
One in 10 said they skipped work to avoid a meeting , buy time on a project or avoid the ire of a boss or colleague , the survey found .
It was conducted by Harris Interactive for CareerBuilder.com , an online jobs site .
Other respondents cited a need to relax and recharge , visit a doctor , sleep , run errands , catch up on housework or spend time with family and friends .
Most employers in the survey said they typically did not question the reasons workers gave for being absent .
However , 31 percent said they have checked up on an employee who called in sick , and 18 percent have fired a worker for missing work without a legitimate excuse .
The nationwide poll was conducted online among 3,388 hiring managers and human resource professionals and 6,842 U.S. full - time employees between August 21 and September 9 , 2008 .

Sunrise is at least an hour away when Atsushi Sasaki steers his fishing boat out of Oma and into the notorious straits separating Japan 's mainland from its northernmost island , Hokkaido .
By the time he reaches the open water of the Tsugaru Strait , the wind has turned into a gale and the waves grow higher with every assault on the bow of his boat .
But Sasaki , a wiry 61 - year old with a crewcut and the teak complexion of an inveterate fisherman , is unfazed : even the discovery that the coolbox containing his lunch is now flooded with seawater is accepted with a shrug .
For now , his concern is directed solely at his prey : the bluefin tuna .
Global stocks of the highly prized fish have plummeted by 90 % in the last 30 years , and much of the blame rests with Japan , by far the world 's biggest consumer .
Every year the Japanese get through about three - quarters of the world 's bluefin catch ; 80 % of tuna caught in the Mediterranean ends up on the Japanese market .
Faced with the imminent collapse of bluefin stocks , fisheries officials from 45 countries are meeting in Morocco this week to discuss bluefin quotas for the Atlantic and Mediterranean next year .
Conservationists want a moratorium , but Japan is reportedly about to support a scientific panel 's recommendation that the quota be set at 15,000 tonnes , about half the current level .
But while attempts are being made to rescue bluefin tuna populations in seas thousands of miles away , nothing is being done to prevent Japan 's appetite for tuna sushi and sashimi from ripping through stocks along its own coastline .
But Sasaki is not part of Japan 's overfishing problem .
Rather , he could be the solution .
There are no trawler nets or lines coiled in heaps on his boat ( named , with incidental irony , Man'yu , or Ten Thousand Tuna ) .
He is one of barely 200 ippon - zuri fishermen around Japan , who catch tuna sustainably using a combination of a rod and line , a basic sonar and occasional luck .
The former salaryman , who quit his office job 20 years ago to lead the life of an itinerant fisherman , is a regular visitor to Oma , one of just three places in Japan where the method survives .
In an attempt to prevent the tradition from dying out and to protect local stocks from being fished into oblivion , the local authorities have assigned the Tsugaru Strait for the exclusive use of Oma 's 60 rod-and - line fishermen .
The move has met with mixed results .
The ippon -zuri have become embroiled in a row with longline fishermen who violate the exclusion zone by using baited lines often several miles long .
Elsewhere , trawlers , equipped with sophisticated sonar , plunder coastal waters , aided by the absence of official quotas and collusion between politicians and the powerful fishing lobby .
High fuel prices , lower profit margins and stricter quotas in other parts of the world have created an irresistible urge for Japanese boats to take more bluefin from their own waters .
And all the time demand is growing , not only in Japan , the US and Europe , but increasingly in China and Russia .
" Japan 's fisheries have no idea how many tuna they are catching or what size they are , " says Sasaki , in the smoke - filled cabin of the Man 'yu .
" The smaller tuna have all been caught , along with the fish they feed on , and unregulated fishing with trawlers is to blame . "
Faced with official diffidence and scant popular enthusiasm for conservationism , Sasaki is spurred on by relatively low operating costs and the knowledge that he is playing a small part in a nascent interest among the Japanese in sustainable sushi .
" We need proper stock management , " he says .
" Collapse is just around the corner . "
The bluefin tuna caught off Oma , a town of 6,000 people on the northern coast of Aomori prefecture , are seen as the tastiest in Japan and typically fetch twice as much as imported fish at auction .
In 2001 , a 202kg ( 445lbs ) Oma bluefin sold for a record ¥ 20.2 m ( £ 141,400 ) .
The yearly average catch for Oma is 2,500 tuna , worth about ¥ 1.6 bn ( £ 11 m ) to the local economy .
This is tiny compared with a few decades ago , says Hirofumi Hamabata , head of the town 's fishing cooperative .
" After the war , each boat returned with about half a dozen tuna every day , " he says .
" They were so cheap you 'd have to sell 4 kg of fish just to be able to afford a pack of cigarettes . "
Akihiro Furukawa , a longline fisherman for 13 years , admits he fears for the future : " My son wants to follow in my footsteps , but by the time he 's old enough to go to sea , there wo n't be any fish left to catch . "
In the Tsugaru Strait it is usual to see 150 boats fishing for tuna .
Today , though , the weather has put most fishermen off .
And after several hours at sea on an empty stomach , Sasaki is ready to call it a day .
As darkness descends on Oma , another ippon - zuri fisherman who has had better luck returns .
Watched by groups of children , six tuna weighing up to 100kg are unloaded and packed into wooden vats of crushed ice , ready be driven to the Tsukiji market in Tokyo before dawn .
The fish may well fall under the gaze of Toichiro Iida , a wholesale trader who seeks out Oma tuna at auction .
His family firm , Hicho , has been in business for almost 150 years .
He says many of his fellow traders know nothing about the provenance of their tuna .
" They 're just happy to buy the cheaper fish and make easy profits , but to do that they have to buy tuna that has come off a trawler , " says Iida , who counts Tokyo's best sushi chefs among his clients .
" Even some sushi restaurateurs do n't know if their tuna is caught using nets or by more sustainable methods , " Iida says .
" It is about time they learned . "
Backstory
The Japanese eat 600,000 tonnes of tuna a year - about a third of the total fished worldwide , and about three - quarters of the total bluefin fished worldwide .
In 2006 , Japan mported 44,000 tonnes of bluefin , just over half of it from the east Atlantic and Mediterranean .
According to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna , which meets in Marrakech this week , about 61,000 tonnes of bluefin tuna were caught in these seas last year - more than double the permitted catch of 29,500 tonnes .
The commission has set a target of 25,500 tonnes by 2010 , but many experts believe this should be nearer 15,000 tonnes .
The Blue Ocean Institute 's guide says bluefin tuna should be avoided altogether .
Some restaurants , such as the Moshi Moshi chain in the UK , have removed bluefin from their menus .

I like this :
Al Franken 's campaign announced on Wednesday that , for the first time since the Minnesota recount began , the Democrat has actually pulled ahead of Republican Sen. Norm Coleman .
Speaking on a conference call with reporters , Franken 's chief counsel Marc Elias said the campaign 's own internal count showed them up 22 votes , a jump from the 13 vote deficit that they faced on Tuesday .
" We have approximately 138,000 ballots left to count , " said Elias .
" 94.3 percent of the state has now been counted ...
Obviously that number is going to change , but we are pleased thus far with how things are going . "
Nate Silver 's math is a little tricky for me , but he is predicting a Franken win by 27 votes ...
I obviously want Franken to win for many important reasons , but if he does , watching BillO 's never ending freak out would be an extra added bonus too ..
PyEphem now available for Python 3.0 !
Date : 13 December 2008
Tags : computing , pyephem , python
Eager not to be left behind by the advance of history , I have released PyEphem tonight for Python 3.0 !
After updating its C - language routines earlier this week , as described in my previous post , and adjusting its Python syntax , I thought that my work was done — until I received a bug report from Reto Schüttel , an enterprising Swiss programmer .
He had read my previous post , asked me for the location of PyEphem 's Python 3.0 branch , downloaded it with bzr , and already tried it out , not only on his Linux machine , but also on his OS X machine !
While the first twenty revisions of my branch deal with simple Python 3.0 mechanics , I must congratulate Mr. Schüttel for most of the improvements in the subsequent dozen revisions .
We not only exchanged emails all day as I produced one revision after another that I needed him to test , but he then joined me on IRC tonight until 3:30 am in his time zone as we worked out the last problems .
The issues were all related to localization under OS X .
The astronomy library underlying PyEphem used the C- language functions sscanf ( ) and atof ( ) to turn strings into numbers , and it turns out that these functions are very sensitive to locale under the specific combination of OS X and Python 3.0 !
Because of his locale , the functions wanted a comma instead of a period to separate whole numbers from their decimal fraction ( so that π would have to be input like 3,141 rather than like 3.141 ) .
They also wanted month name abbreviations to be in German rather than English , ruining my test cases that check planet positions against Naval Observatory tables which use English month abbreviations like Jan , Feb , and Mar with very little regard for how the months would be spelled in German .
We are still mystified by the combination of Python version and operation system that were necessary to cause this problem :
Python 2.6 under Linux : tests passed Python 3.0 under Linux : tests passed Python 2.6 under OS X : tests passed Python 3.0 under OS X : broken : sscanf ( ) / atof ( ) change with locale
But the tests worked fine if he put LANG=C on the command line .
To work around this problem , I discovered a wonderful PyOS_ascii_strtod ( ) function in Python 's C library that avoided all of the problems that I was having with localization , and so I gradually rewrote the astronomy routines to use that function instead .
Fixing the problems with month names was easier ; instead of trying to make Python convert month abbreviations by passing the ' % b ' conversion character to time .
strptime ( ) , I simply converted months to integers myself and then passed the integers in with the simpler ' % m ' format character .
It was only late at night that we finally tracked down every routine that was misbehaving .
The final puzzle was how to release my new software .
The Python Package Index does not yet allow a project to offer separate source code archives for both the Python 2.x and the 3.0 version of a project .
There might be some clever way of storing both versions of the source code in the same . tar. gz file , but the packages I see on PyPI that already support both 2.x and 3.0 contain enough #ifdef statements to convince me that I want to keep my branches separate !
I was saved by a peculiarity of my project .
Though it provides the Python package named ephem , the actual project on PyPI has always been named “ PyEphem ” instead .
The product has to have the “ Py ” in front , you see , to distinguish it both from the original text - screen ephem command and the modern XEphem graphical application , and my first instinct had been to name the project after the product .
But as I gained experience with PyPI , it seemed more and more awkward that programmers who wanted their programs to be able to :
import ephem
had to remember to type something different when installing :
easy_install pyephem
Since I had been wanting to switch PyPI names anyway , I suddenly saw my chance !
I have now released the new Python 3.0 version of PyEphem under the actual package name ephem and will continue to maintain the 2.x version of the package separately under the old pyephem name .
Obviously , this solution only works because of my project 's unique circumstances ; I have no idea what other projects should do who also want to come out with their new Python 3.0 versions this weekend .
Fans of PyEphem should rest assured that when I develop new features , I will be adding them to both versions of PyEphem for probably at least the next decade .
I have absolutely no intention of abandoning or slowing development of the Python 2.x version of the library ; I simply wanted the library available to users of the new platform .
As always , feel free to email me with bugs , suggestions , and new features — and , enjoy using PyEphem and Python !

As a result of decades of studies , Mars ' dichotomous landscape is now common knowledge for scientists .
It is known , for instance , that the mountainous southern hemisphere rises some 6 km ( 3.73 miles ) above the smooth northern one , and it 's much thicker .
This , together with the planet 's peculiar magnetic field were thought to be the result of a large asteroid impact .
But now a new theory sees this issue from a different perspective , one that would also explain the presence of the volcanic craters in the Tharsis Rise highlands .
US Scientist Shijie Zhong from the University of Colorado in Boulder believes the weird scenery is rather associated with some strange case of plate tectonics , never before observed in our solar system .
On Earth , life depends on this process , as plates are constantly recycled – reabsorbed by the mantle and generated anew – and as volcanoes spew out life - regulating nutrients .
Mars , which is approximately 6,794 kilometers ( 4,222 miles ) in diameter , 53 % that of the Earth , is considered to be too small in order to hold heat and host such activity for a longer period .
But , as the theory goes , this is not to say that nothing ever happened .
Quite the contrary .
Billions of years ago , claims
Zhong , the entire crust was moving above the molten mantle , driven by an uneven convection .
" Earth is the only planet with plates that move around , " he shared , cited by Discovery .
" But you can have the entire shell of crust rotating with respect to the interior . "
This caused the cooler material in the northern half to sink into the mantle , while hot material was pressed against the surface on the other hemisphere , thickening it and forming its tall features .
The crust moving southwards also caused the hottest stationary magma plume to emerge to the surface , breaching it as a series of volcanoes appearing in a row some 3.7 to 4.1 billion years ago and forming today 's three volcanoes lined up on Tharsis Rise .
In an attempt to prove this theory , which could also apply to many other bodies of the solar system , researchers will focus on crust fracture patterns , as well as on the magnetic signature of Mars ' rocks .
" There may be a lot of other places in the solar system where this is important , " explained Frances Nimmo from the University of California , in Santa Cruz .
" Mercury , Venus , even some moons – almost everywhere you look outside of Earth you have single - plate bodies . "

Astrophysics Workshop on Saturation and Transport Properties of MRI - driven Turbulence
Workshop overview :
The magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) is currently considered the most promising mechanism for driving the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence thought to enable efficient accretion in a wide range of astrophysical systems , from young stars to neutron stars and from galactic black holes to the massive black holes found in the centers of galaxies .
Understanding this process is essential for explaining the properties of quasars , active galactic nuclei , stellar X - ray sources , cataclysmic variable stars , jets from young stars and galaxy centers , and perhaps even planetary systems .
Because of this broad relevance , magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the MRI has been a major focus of attention in astrophysics since the early 90's .
These talks address current progress and future theoretical , numerical , and experimental challenges in this field .

Workshop on General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units in Astronomy and Astrophysics ( AstroGPU 2007 )
Workshop overview :
Graphics processing units ( GPUs ) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and cost - effective platform for high - performance parallel computing .
The current generation of GPUs sports capabilities in TFLOP range , already an order of magnitude greater than most powerful x86 CPUs .
Such an increase in computational power opens opportunities to explore previously inaccessible problems in astronomy and astrophysics .
However , it also brings the challenges of adapting existing algorithms and codes ( and devising new ones ) to run efficiently on intrinsically massively parallel SIMD / SPMD GPU architectures .
The goal of this workshop is to explore and discuss the applicability of GPUs to astrophysical problems .
It will bring together astrophysicists , colleagues from other areas of science where GPGPU techniques have been successfully applied , and representatives from the industry who will demonstrate in tutorial sessions the GPU hardware , programming tools , and GPGPU techniques .

Want to learn how to choose a laptop gaming performance over time ?
Continue reading this guide .
Otherwise , check out our selections of the best 15 " and 17 " laptops soon :
First of all , it 's important to define your user profile .
Indeed , not all games require the same computing power , so it is important to target your needs , especially if you have a limited budget .
If you play ( very ) old or 2D titles , at Candycrush ( or other similar titles online and on Facebook ) or more simply at card games / fail , good news , all current small laptops will be able to rotate them , so you do not need to worry about the graphics card for your future model .
However , if you are a fan of 3D games released in the last three years , the choice of graphics card will take on a much greater importance , even if , often , the budget may arbitrate for you .
For simplicity , we will cut by screen size and budget .
Playing on a laptop is a desire shared by many users , but also a source of frustration for many .
In question , the budget necessary to acquire a powerful model and sometimes , some desires incompatible with the technical constraints inherent in the presence of a powerful graphics card .
Through this file , we will try to provide answers and solutions to most of the questions you ask yourself .
What performance for which card ?
GeForce 940MX :
The minimum at the moment to consider play and more simply , the essential card for ( very ) tight budgets .
Concessions are expected but the majority of games will turn around 30 fps with a definition of 1366x768 pixels and a level of detail on Low or Medium ( depending on titles ) .
GeForce GTX 950M / GeForce MX150 : Still a bit fair to really suit the players , these two cards mark the step compared to the 940 MX and offer more latitude with recent titles .
GeForce GTX 1050 / GeForce GTX 1050 Ti : Unmissable on the mid-range , but still concessions to predict with the latest titles released .
The 1050 Ti is a little more powerful but is also more rare .
It also suffers from fairly high prices that , excluding promotions and flash sales , make it unattractive to the higher range .
With these two cards , we come to the graphics and performance of the current home consoles ( PS4 and Xbox One ) .
GeForce GTX 1060 : The best choice at the moment , this GPU allows you to enjoy excellent fluidity in Full HD , even on demanding titles .
Able to follow the releases of the next months .
Promotions can sometimes find offers from 800 € ( without Windows ) .
GeForce GTX 1070 : A solid foundation for virtual reality , the price starts however about 1500 $ .
To associate with a Core i7 not to curb it .
GeForce GTX 1080 : The most powerful card of the moment , able to run all games with a high level of detail and in 4 K .
Unfortunately the models that are equipped are at a rate inaccessible to most players ..

That is apparently an eligibility requirement , as evidenced by some leaked contracts that the contestants had to sign .
The contracts were made public this week and they state that contestants may not verbally disapprove of Cowell in public or on air .
Simon got wind of this and is of course denying that he knew of this clause .
" It 's slightly embarrassing when any commercial contract goes out .
I was n't aware that I was one of the clauses .
You can't be horrible about me ?
That 's probably the most useless clause in the history of contracts , because everybody does talk horrible about me , and you know what ?
I do n't care . "
The contracts also spell out a different payout than the show leads the audience members to believe .
The winner of the show is to get $ 1.5 million , when in reality they receive a $ 225,000 recording advance .

How embarrassing ... nothing like another President determined to make us the global laughingstock :
In comments that have caused a kerfuffle in Spain , McCain seemed to lump Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero in the same category as the anti-American leaders of Venezuela , Bolivia and Cuba .
McCain 's remarks came during in an English - language interview with Radio Caracol WSUA 1260 AM in Miami , part of the Spanish - language radio group Union Radio , conducted Tuesday .[.. ]
Zapatero is a center - left politician , but McCain has suggested that as president he would seek to repair relations that have been badly frayed in Europe during Bush 's tenure .
In an early - April interview with a reporter from Spanish newspaper El Pais , McCain said , " This is the moment to leave behind discrepancies with Spain . "
He added : " I would like for [ President Zapatero ] to visit the United States .
I am very interested not only in normalizing relations with Spain but in obtaining good and productive relations with the goal of addressing many issues and challenges that we have to confront together . "
The reporter for the Miami radio station seemed surprised that McCain , after discussing anti-American antagonists in Latin South America , acted so coolly to the idea of meeting with Zapatero .
" I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion , " McCain said , throwing in words of praise for the Mexican government .
The reporter asked a second time : " Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government ? "
McCain repeated his talking point : " I can assure you I will establish closer relations with our friends and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America . "
The reporter pressed again , and McCain replied : " I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us and standing up to those who are not . "
At this point , the reporter sought to clarify that McCain was not mixing up South America with Europe .
" I 'm talking about the president of Spain , " she noted .
Given this fourth opportunity to extend an olive branch , McCain stuck to his guns : " I 'm willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights , democracy and freedom and I will stand up to those who are not . "

Welcome to IGN 's 2008 Year in Review for the PlayStation family .
Over the next seven pages we 're going to cover the highest highs and lowest lows , the biggest news and highest reviews of 2008 .
We 're going to look back at the year 's events , like E3 , GDC and TGS , and see how well ( or how little ) Sony pushed the systems .
You 'll find a list of the year 's highest rated titles , as determined by both the IGN editors and our readers .
We 'll break down the biggest news of the year and provide a few tips and tricks on the hottest games .
And finally , we 'll take a look at 2009 and see what 's in store for Sony 's systems .
So sit back , pour yourself a nice beverage and have a read .
State of the Platform
2008 was quite the interesting year for all things PlayStation .
The PS3 has just wrapped up its second full year of existence , and what a year it was , with an incredible amount of fantastic releases .
The PSP had its share of stellar titles , though the amount of games we saw released for the system each month could be counted on your fingers , sometimes just one hand .
The aging PS2 just saw the release of Persona 4 , which will probably go down as the last great game for the system , all but signaling its unofficial death .
Yes , it was an interesting year to be a PlayStation fan , though not all for good reasons .
Fortunately though , much of the PlayStation 3's year was quite positive .
We saw a ton of huge games hit the system , including a handful that have been long - touted as reasons to pick up the console .
Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots hit shelves this past June and turned out to be one of the most astonishing games we 've seen in , well , ever .
LittleBigPlanet was released in late October after being delayed for a week due to " sensitive issues " regarding the game 's soundtrack .
It too proved to live up to its incredibly high promises and the community continues to surprise us with the amazingly unique and inventive levels that we see every day .
The list of big releases goes on and on .
Resistance 2 continued Nathan
Hale 's story and brought an immense online experience to gamers , while titles like Grand Theft Auto IV and Fallout 3 were amazing titles in their own right .
But fortunately for us all , the good news was n't just about the games themselves .
Sony made plenty of updates to the PlayStation 3 platform in general through numerous firmware updates .
Things like in - game Cross Media
Bar support finally let us manage and use our Friends list while playing any game , which was most certainly welcome .
Biggest of all though was the addition of Trophies , Sony 's take on the Xbox 360's Achievements .
Coming in Gold , Silver , Bronze and the coveted Platinum , they work to increase your overall gamer level and have already proven to reintroduce older titles to gamers who missed them the first time around , like the excellent Super Stardust HD .
But , Sony 's still not done yet .
We have yet to see voice support required in every game , which is a shame .
Custom soundtracks are built into the SDK for developers to use , but real - world use is far and between right now .
The PlayStation Store has some great downloadable titles , but there were many weeks this year where we did n't see new games while the 360 and Wii got new ( or classic ) titles .
Given the amount of games released on Xbox Live Arcade specifically that could and should also be on the PlayStation Store , it looks like Sony has some work to do to convince developers to spend the time and investment in porting their titles to the PSN .
On the PlayStation Portable front , we 're seeing a decline in the total number of games released each year .
Numbering well under 100 for 2008 , gamers do n't have anywhere near the selection that you 'll find on the PS3 or its main competitor , the Nintendo DS .
That 's not to say that there were n't great titles this year for the system ; on the contrary , looking at the top handful of titles makes this seem like the PSP 's best year yet .
God of War : Chains of Olympus , Crisis Core : Final Fantasty VII , Patapon and a handful of other titles proved that the system can be home to phenomenal games .
Now if only more developers would make titles for it we might have a great system on our hands .
However , the lack of software is n't the only thing missing from the PSP .
Over here in the US , we still have n't seen the release of the GPS add - on , nor the foldable keyboard promised so long ago .
These devices would do well to help expand the PSP 's non-game functionality beyond a standard media player , but where are they ?
Over on the PS2 front , things are grim .
The system is clearly on its deathbed and is struggling to take in one last gasp of air before it keels over and dies .
It 's been on life support for a long time now , with things like the LEGO Batman pack helping to put the hardware back in the news .
But why is the price still so high ?
Pretty much everyone who would have ever wanted a PS2 has bought one by now , so why not drop the price to $ 99 and make it something of an impulse buy ( in the realm of electronics and gaming , at least ) .
Persona 4 looks to be the system 's swan song , a fantastic eulogy for the system , but Sony should starting piling the dirt on it already .
Since a while ago I started a project with friends to develop an Open Source group / project management tool with the best web framework out there – Django !

XHTML （XMLも） から XSLT （じゃなくてもいいんだけど） によって汎用的にメタデータを抽出するための仕様、GRDDL （ Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages ） が 11日に W3C 勧告として公開されました。同時に W3C のプレスリリースにも GRDDL についての発表がされています 。
基本的に ( X) HTML は人間様向けの言語であって、アプリケーション等、機械から利用するには微妙な存在。機械向けのメタデータを提供する手段としては
RDF （ Resource Description Framework ） が存在するわけですが、人間向け、機械向け別々のデータが必要な場合、今までは両方とも制作者が用意するのが普通だったわけです。これはプログラムで自動生成するにしろ、手作業で作るにしろ手間がかかる作業だし、ファイルが増えて管理するのも面倒っていう悩みがありました。
今回勧告された GRDDL は XHTML であれば head 要素へのプロファイル指定と、リンクタイプ 「 rel= " transformation " 」 を持った link 要素による XSLT （など） との関連付けという組み合わせによってユーザエージェント側でメタデータの抽出をしてもらう仕様。だから制作者がやることは、
一貫した class 属性やrel 属性など （ Microformats とか DC が大活躍？） を使用してマークアップした XHTML を用意 メタデータを抽出するための XSLT を書く、もしくは汎用的な XSLT を探してくる XHTML に対し GRDDL の仕様に則ってプロファイルと link 要素を追加 （関連付けする XSLT は複数でも大丈夫 ）
ってだけで様々なメタデータを 1つの XHTML 文書から取り出せちゃう。これは便利、っていうか
XSLT さえ書ければいいし、使い回しが可能なので制作者側の負担も少ない。さらに神崎さん
（ The Web KANZAKI ） が公開している 「 XHTML metainformation profile 」 のような XSLT が関連付けられたプロファイルを利用すれば、XSLT の用意すら必要ないのでもっと簡単。
で、メタデータを抽出できたから何？自分では特に使い道ないし、ブラウザの対応は？みたいな方もいるかもしれませんが、検索エンジンがこれに対応した場合を考えてみればいいんじゃないかと。その気になれば実装は早いと思いますし......
とはいえ、RDF 検索 （これは RDF が検索に引っかかるとかのレベルではなく、RDF を解析した上で検索結果に反映する仕組み） の実装の方が重要だとは思いますが 。
あ、それから RSS リーダーなんかが対応してくれれば、いちいち フィードの URI を登録とか面倒なこともなくなりますね。例え ば
Blog の URI を登録しておけば RSS だろうが ATOM だろうがそこから取り出して使えたり。その他にも色々、広まったら面白そうな予感がするよ。
さて、GRDDL 関連のよりわかりやすい情報に関しては、前述した
The Web KANZAKI > ちょっとしたメモ にて「 XHTMLからRDFを抽出するGRDDL 」 というエントリー （もう 3 年以上前なんですね ......）
及び関連エントリーがいくつか公開されていますので、こちらは必読です。

At Neuroscience 2008 , the 38th annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience held last month in Washington D.C. , a number of researchers presented evidence that a small , soluble , clustered form of a protein called amyloid beta may be responsible for brain damage in Alzheimer ’s disease patients [ 1 ] .
In addition , scientists report that they are finding new sources and uses of neural stem cells that may replace cells damaged by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s disease [ 2 ] .
Why are these reports significant ?
Because until recently , large insoluble amyloid beta plaques , or deposits , were considered the likely cause of Alzheimer ’s disease .
The plaques were thought to disrupt brain cell communication .
However , new findings show that an early ( i.e. small ) , soluble , clustered form of amyloid beta called protofibrils is found in high levels in the brains of people with Alzheimer ’s disease [ 1 ] .
Researchers also found a strong correlation between the presence of high levels of protofibrils in the brains of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer ’s disease and the cognitive impairments associated with the disease .
Alzheimer ’s disease is the most common form of dementia , a progressive decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease .
Alzheimer ’s is a progressive and fatal brain disease , which destroys brain cells and causes problems with memory , thinking and behavior .
In June 2008 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) National Center for Health Statistics reported that Alzheimer ’s disease surpassed diabetes as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States [ 3 ] .
Although the cause and progression of Alzheimer ’s disease is not well understood , research suggests an association with plaques and tangles ( meaning pathological protein deposits and aggregates ) in the brain [ 4 ] .
Parkinson ’s disease is another neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs a person ’s speech and motor skills .
Parkinson ’s disease is characterized by muscle rigidity , tremors and a slowing and loss of physical movement .
The disease occurs when neurons ( nerve cells ) in the brain become impaired or die .
Neurons normally produce dopamine , a neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting signals that produce smooth , coordinated function of the body ’s muscles and movement .
Neural stem cells hold the promise as a source of dopamine - producing cells to replace the degenerating nerve cells in Parkinson ’s patients .
I ’ve featured content from TED in the past :
TED stands for Technology , Entertainment , Design .
The annual TED conference brings together some of the world ’s most fascinating people to talk briefly about science , business , the arts and global issues facing our world .
In his TED talk earlier this year , Gregory Petsko , a Professor of Biochemistry and Chemistry at Brandeis University , warned that :
Unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we ’re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale .
Why ?
Because biomedical research and better healthcare measures have enabled people to live longer .
The average lifespan is increasing and the world population is getting older .
In fact , Petsko states that the average lifespan is increasing at the amazing rate of ~ 5 hours everyday .
Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s disease usually affect individuals that are middle aged or older .
Petsko ’s solution ?
More research into the brain and its function .
Check out his short 4 minute talk below .
Lower your risks for neurodegenerative disease
Even though there is no current treatment to delay or halt the progression of Alzheimer ’s , there are a number of things you can do to lower your risk of developing the disease [ 5 ] :
advertisement Keep your cholesterol and homocysteine levels low
Keep your blood pressure down ( chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer ’s )
Engage in social and intellectually stimulating activities
Exercise regularly
Similarly , there are a number of things you can do today to lower your risk of developing Parkinson ’s disease :
Drink more coffee ( increased consumption is also associated with a lower risk of liver cancer )
Avoid head injuries
Avoid excessive exposure to toxins , such as herbicides and pesticides
Take a B vitamin ( folic acid ) supplement everyday
Exercise regularly

Biggest Loser WINNER
Season 6 is Michelle Aguilar ( Photos )
The season six finale of The Biggest Loser : Families was broadcast last night from Hollywood .
A very pregnant Alison Sweeney hosted the live two hour show .
She was joined on stage by personal trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels who led the participants throughout their twelve weeks on The Biggest Loser campus .
The $ 250,000 winner is 26 year old Michelle Aguilar of Dallas who lost 110 pounds from a starting weight of 242 for a weight loss percentage of 45.45 .
Coming in second place in this category was Ed Brantley , 31 year old chef from Raleigh , N.C .
He started at 335 and lost 139 pounds for a weight loss percentage of 41.49 .
Third place finisher was Vicky Vilcan , a 37 year old nurse from Houma , LA .
Her starting weight was 246 and she was able to shed 101 pounds for percentage of weight loss of 41.06 .
Interestingly , home viewers got a chance to decided whether Ed Brantley or his wife Heba Salama would be vying for top prize , alongside Vicky and Michelle .
Ed made a plea to home viewers to vote in his wife but they put Ed in the finale by an 84 % landslide .
The vote was likely a shout out from America that Heba , who clearly took charge of the blue team tactics , was a heavy handed player who used a bulldozer strategy throughout the competition .
As it turns out , if Heba had been voted into the top category she would have won the competition , but instead won the $ 100,000 prize .
Salama , a 30 year old pharmaceutical sales rep from Raleigh , N.C. , started out at 294 and was able to shed 138 pounds for a percentage of weight loss of 46.90 .
Heba said , " Everything happens for a reason , we have been so lucky to be on this show that honestly , because we were never here for a paycheck I just wanted the opportunity to be a finalist . "
We 've included before and after photos of our favorite competitors from the 16 member field .
Check them out in our gallery below .

379 + DEAD AFTER TASER USEWhat follows are the names ( where known ) , dates and locations of all North Americans who have died after they were shocked with taser weapons by law enforcement officials .
As far as I know , this list does not exist anywhere else in the world .
For the most part , the list has been generated from media accounts , with the first 167 names documented by reporter Robert Anglen of the Arizona Republic newspaper .
Since late December 2005 , Patti Gillman ( owner of this website , TNT - Truth ... Not Tasers ) and Cameron Ward have continued to record the names of those who have died after they were tasered .

Now that Windows Vista has been available for almost a month , the comparative performance benchmarks are in .
It 's about what I expected ; rough parity with the performance of Windows XP .
Vista 's a bit slower in some areas , and a bit faster in others .
But should n't new operating systems perform better than old ones ?
There are plenty of low - level improvements under the hood .
Why does Vista only break even in performance ?
To be fair , Vista does a lot more than XP .
I do n't want to get into the whole XP vs. Vista argument here , but suffice it to say that the list of new features in Vista is quite extensive -- although perhaps not as extensive as some would like .
Vista 's integrated search alone is enough for me to banish XP from my life forever .
Microsoft has gotten a giant security shiner from Windows XP over the last five years .
That 's why Windows Vista goes out of its way to radically improve security , with new features like User Account Control ( UAC ) and Windows Defender .
The existing security features in XP , such as Windows Firewall and System Protection ( aka restore points ) were significantly overhauled and improved for Vista , too .
Enhanced security is a good thing , but it 's never free .
In fact , Vista 's new security features will slow your PC down more than almost any other kind of software you can install .
For best performance , the first thing I do on any new Vista install is this :
Turn off Windows Defender Turn off Windows Firewall Disable System Protection Disable UAC
I 've had friends remark how " slow " Vista feels compared to XP , but when I ask them whether they 've disabled Defender or UAC , the answer is typically no .
Of course your system is going to be slower with all these added security checks .
Security is expensive , and there ain't no such thing as a free lunch .
You might argue that three out of these four security features would n't even be necessary in the first place if Windows had originally followed the well - worn UNIX convention of separating standard users from privileged administrators .
I wo n't disagree with you .
But Windows ' long historical precedent of setting user accounts up by default as privileged adminstrators is Microsoft 's cross to bear .
I can't rewrite history , and neither can Microsoft .
That 's why they came up with these painful , performance - sapping workarounds .
But this does n't mean you have to give up on security entirely in the name of performance .
If you 're really serious about security , then create a new user account with non-Administrator privileges , and log in as that user .
This is n't the default behavior in Vista , sadly .
Post install , you get an Administrator - But - Not - Really - Just - Kidding account which triggers UAC on any action that requires administrator privileges .
I 'm sure this torturous hack was conceived in the name of backwards compatibility , but that does n't mean we need to perpetuate it .
The good news is that Vista is probably the first Microsoft operating system ever where you can actually work effectively as a standard , non-privileged user .
As a standard user , you get all the benefits of UAC , Defender , and System Protection .. without all the performance drain .
Let me be clear here .
I 'm not against security .
I 'm against retrograde , band - aid , destroy all my computer 's performance security .
Speaking of retrograde , band - aid , destroy all my computer 's performance security , the one security feature Vista does n't bundle is anti-virus software .
And nothing cripples your PC 's performance quite like anti-virus software .
This is n't terribly surprising if you consider what anti-virus software has to do : examine every single byte of data that passes through your computer for evidence of malicious activity .
But who needs theory when we have Oli at The PC Spy .
Oli conducted a remarkably thorough investigation of the real world performance impact of security software on the PC .
The results are truly eye - opening :
Percent slower Boot
CPU
Disk
Norton Internet Security 2006 46 % 20 % 2369 % McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8 7 % 20 % 2246 % Norton Internet Security 2007 45 % 8 % 1515 % Trend Micro PC - cillin AV 2006 2 % 0 % 1288 % ZoneAlarm ISS 16 % 0 % 992 % Norton Antivirus 2002 11 % 8 % 658 % Windows Live OneCare 11 % 8 % 512 % Webroot Spy Sweeper 6 % 8 % 369 % Nod32 v2.5 7 % 8 % 177 % avast !
4.7 Home 4 % 8 % 115 % Windows Defender 5 % 8 % 54 % Panda Antivirus 2007 20 % 4 % 15 % AVG 7.1 Free 15 % 0 % 19 %
The worst offenders are the anti-virus suites with real - time protection .
According to these results , the latest Norton Internet Security degrades boot time by nearly 50 percent .
And no , that is n't a typo in the disk column .
It also makes all disk access sixteen times slower !
Even the better performers in this table would have a profoundly negative impact on your PC 's performance .
Windows Defender , for example , " only " makes hard drive access 54 percent slower .
And yet , despite the crushing performance penalty , anti-virus software is de rigeur in the PC world .
Most PC vendors would no sooner ship a PC without preinstalled anti-virus software than they would ship a PC without an operating system ( yeah , you wish ) .
The very thought of running a PC naked , vulnerable , unprotected from viruses sends system administrators screaming from the room in a panic .
When you tell a sysadmin you dislike running anti-virus software , they 'll look at you mouth agape , as if you 've just told them that you hate puppies and flowers .
I do n't see why they 're so shocked .
anti-virus software itself , while not self - propagating like a virus , certainly fits the definition of a Trojan Horse .
Once installed on your system , it has a hidden , unadvertised payload : it decimates your computer 's performance and your productivity .
In my opinion , what we really need is Anti-Anti -Virus software to keep us safe from the ongoing Anti-Virus software pandemic .
I 've never run any anti-virus software .
And Mac or Linux ( aka UNIX ) users almost never run anti-virus software , either .
Am I irresponsible to run all my computers without anti-virus software ?
Are Mac and Linux users irresponsible for not participating in the culture of fear that Windows anti-virus software vendors propagate ?
I think it 's braver and more responsible to recognize that anti-virus software vendors are not only telling us to be afraid , they are selling us fear .
The entire anti-virus software industry is predicated on a bad architectural decision made by Microsoft fifteen years ago .
And why , exactly , would any of these vendors want to solve the virus problem and put themselves out of business ?
I 'll certainly agree that you can't stop users from clicking on dancing bunnies if they have their mind set on it .
You should have a few different security layers in any modern operating system .
But we should also be treating the disease first -- too many damn users running as administrators -- instead of the symptoms .
As for remediation strategies , I 'm a fan of the virtual machine future .
We should treat our operating system like a roll of paper towels .
If you get something on it you do n't like , you ball it up and throw it away , and rip off a new , fresh one .
But if that 's too radical for you , I think Jan Goyvaerts is on to something with good old plain common sense backups :
In fact , with a proper backup system in place , you do n't have to be afraid of messing up your system .
I do n't use any anti-virus or anti-spyware software .
If my system starts acting up , I 'll restore the backup , and have a guaranteed clean system .
No spyware remover can beat that .
If I want to play with beta software , I do n't have to inconvenience myself by running it in a virtual machine .
I do use VMware for testing my applications on clean installs of Windows .
But when beta testing new versions of tools I use for development , I want to test them in my actual development environment rather .
When the beta expires , I wipe it off by restoring the OS backup .
It 's not terribly different from my virtual machine solution .
Either way , you go back to a known good checkpoint .
And I 'll take a backup strategy over a computer with hobbled performance any day .
This also begs the question of what safety really means .
No matter how much security software you install , nagging users with dozens of security dialogs clearly does n't make users any safer .
We should give users a basic level of protection as standard non-adminstrator users .
But beyond that , let users make mistakes , and provide automatic , unlimited undo .
That 's the ultimate safety blanket .
Kay Hagan , U.S. senator from North Carolina ( Photo credit : Wikipedia )
The anti-atheist bigotry utilized by Senator ( R - NC ) during her recent campaign is inexcusable .
I have joined countless atheist bloggers in expressing outrage that such bigotry is tolerated in modern America .
The challenge for us now , even after Dole lost the election , is one of recognizing that this may be a political tactic of which we will see more examples in future campaigns .
It is time to seriously rethink our lack of organization and the political power we sacrifice by refusing to come together .
Nobody is going to end anti-atheist bigotry for us ; it is our struggle and our responsibility Dole 's bigotry surfaced in late August in the form of a press release in which her campaign denounced her Democratic opponent , , for meeting with the Godless Americans Political Action Committee .
According to Dole 's campaign , no politician should meet with groups who do not profess belief in ancient superstitions .
Several of us in the reality - based community recognized Dole 's tactics for what they were - bigotry .
Unable to distinguish atheists seeking civil rights from " anti-religion activists , " the Dole campaign sought to paint Hagan as turning her back on " the values " of North Carolina ( as if there was only one set of acceptable values ) .
But Dole was not finished yet .
She received a sufficiently positive response from this strategy to stick with it .
In fact , Dole 's campaign decided to make Hagan 's association with atheists a central issue .
They distributed bigoted attack ads , claiming that Hagan should not be elected because atheists wanted her elected .
Although Hagan benefited from increased campaign contributions from atheists angered by Dole 's bigotry , nothing would deter Dole from sinking even lower by suggesting that Hagan herself was an atheist
Not surprisingly , Kay Hagan did the only thing she could do in order to salvage her political future .
She joined Dole in denouncing atheists the moment it became politically necessary to do so .
Never mind the many atheists who contributed to her campaign .
Having questions raised about her own belief in ancient superstitions was too much .
Hagan decided to interpret the ad as an attack on her faith Hagan could have labeled Dole 's tactics as bigotry , but this would have likely cost her the election .
Being perceived as too friendly to atheists amounts to political suicide for a candidate .
This , rather than even Dole 's bigotry , is the central issue to which we should be paying attention in this story .
It is great that Dole was defeated , but we have not seen the last of this sort of bigotry in political campaigns .
We are at an important crossroads .
Do we keep our heads down and hope nobody finds out what we really think , or are we willing to take what will surely be a risky stand ?
As much as I have struggled with my own misgivings around this , I am becoming increasingly convinced that our failure to speak out , organize , and flex our political power makes us at least partially responsible for continued anti-atheist bigotry .
So what if Hagan or some other politician was an atheist ?
Would that mean that they were unelectable ?
If so , why exactly is that ?
This is a discussion that needs to be had .
Anti-atheist bigotry is both widespread and commonly accepted .
We see it routinely in the news , and there is rarely anyone willing to speak out to oppose it .
Christians who might be our allies in other matters are unlikely to do so here .
After all , if atheists were truly equal to Christians , their dogma would likely collapse .
No , I think this task is going to fall primarily to us .
So far , it has not been one we have been willing to undertake .
Crikey !
According to Australian researchers , humans and kangaroos shared a common ancestor 150 million years ago and have similar sections of DNA .
" We thought they'd be completely scrambled , but they 're not , " said one expert .
" There is great chunks of the human genome which is sitting right there in the kangaroo genome . "
Well , this helps explain Yahoo Serious .

This one puzzles .
Rick Warren is the pastor of the California - based megachurch known as Saddleback and the author of super - bestseller The Purpose Driven Life .
He wins plaudits from mainstream media types and Very Serious People because he is trying to expand the evangelical community ’s priorities beyond the standard social issues .
He wants to see more attention paid to poverty , climate change , AIDS , and human rights .
That ’s all well and good , but Warren still has many views that match the hardline right .
He strongly supported Proposition 8 .
He considers stem cells “ non-negotiable . ”
He compares abortion to the Holocaust .
He has admitted the difference between between him and James Dobson is primarily “ a matter of tone . ”
In a move that would make George Orwell proud , he just gave George W. Bush an “ International Medal of P.E.A.C.E . ”
And this is the guy Barack Obama has chosen to give the invocation at his inauguration ?
A man whose views stand in stark contrast to the ones held by the tens of millions of Americans who elected Obama ?
I ’m not the only one who is shocked .
There is already a petition at whitehouse2.org that urges the President - elect to give this incredible privilege to one of the nation ’s thousands and thousands of men and women of the cloth whose views match Obama ’s , and those of the people who will have flown in from around the country to see the inauguration in person .
Take a look .

Maintaining privacy in the era of digital information requires work on a number of fronts , whether fending off spyware , protecting important files with encryption or configuring a Wi -Fi hot spot to keep interlopers off a wireless network .
One basic privacy measure , however , is easily overlooked : proper data destruction .
Deleting confidential data completely is essential when donating or selling old computers , and it can also help maintain privacy on computers that may end up lost or stolen .
And for businesses looking for ways to comply with the security requirements of laws like the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , a sound policy on data control and destruction is crucial .
When normal deletion methods like the Recycle Bin or the delete command are used , the computer 's operating system , for the sake of speed , creates an illusion that data has been deleted .
In fact , it merely earmarks that region of a disk or drive as being available for new data to overwrite the old data .
Until that overwriting occurs , the old data can be retrieved with undelete programs and tools used by data recovery labs and law enforcement agencies .
There are , however , several options for securely eliminating data from hard disks , U.S.B. flash drives and other storage media .
These programs overwrite data with meaningless characters to render it unrecoverable with today 's data recovery techniques .
Some of the programs can overwrite entire drives , while others can single out individual files or other information saved by a computer 's operating system or programs like Web browsers .
Shredding machines that can destroy diskettes , CD's and DVD 's are also available .

A small and simple mobile home … that does n’t look like a cheap trailer ?
Impossible some would say but architect Tom Kundig begs to differ .
Steel , plywood and cork give a combination of slick style and modernist aesthetic to these elegant prefabricated and portable houses - on - wheels .

Well , well , well  it looks like our war - birds over at the American Enterprise Institute are getting kicked out of their very well - feathered nest , as Jacob Heilbrunn , author of a fascinating book on the neoconservatives , reports :
" The neocon world has been rocked by recent events at AEI .
Numerous neocons told me that a vicious purge is being carried out at AEI , spearheaded by vice - president for foreign and defense policy studies , Danielle Pletka .
There can be no doubting that change is afoot at AEI .
Recently , Michael Ledeen and Reuel Marc Gerecht have departed AEI .
Joshua Muravchik is on the way out as well .
Other scholars face possible eviction . "
It could n’t have happened to a more deserving bunch .
Although Heilbrunn avers that Muravchik is one of the more " reasonable " neocons , in my book he ’s one of the worst .
Here , after all , is someone who openly argues that we must start bombing Iran immediately if not sooner , and defends the tragic history of our invasion of Iraq  the lies , the pointless deaths , the horrific blowback .
In an article published in Commentary , he accused anyone who so much as whispered the word " neocon " of spreading " conspiracy theories , " and , of course , anti-Semitism .
Ledeen is an outright loon , whose " faster , please " jeremiads  published even as the grandiose schemes of the neocons come crashing down on our heads  have only underscored how utterly clueless he ’s always been .
As for Gerecht , he ’s typical of these legends in their own minds , with his ex-spook persona of world - weary intelligence " expert " and air of smug certainty while mouthing the worst whoppers as undisputed fact .
He was even invited by the Cato Institute to palaver on one of their little - read Web sites , giving his pro-war , let ’s - invade - everyone spiel for the delectation of libertarians  as if this jerk did n’t have endless platforms from which to spread his line of guff !
It looks like Muravchik & Co. will retreat to the safety of the Hudson Institute , where Scooter Libby has gone to lick his wounds and write his memoirs .
The Foundation for the Defense of the Democracies , whose made - in - Israel stamp was detected in an investigative report published in The American Conservative , has already taken in Gerecht , and others will certainly jump into this particular lifeboat .
Whatever their fate as individuals , however , the neocons ’ brand of armed fanaticism will wind up in the same historical dustbin occupied by their intellectual progenitors and rivals , the Marxist - Leninists .
So , can we say , with absolute certitude  and unabashed joy  that the neocons are over , and the War Party is through ?
Not by a long shot .
Because what ’s rising on the left - end of the political spectrum is a new brand of neoconservatism , a " liberal " and even " enlightened " variety of the same old hubris - in - arms that animated the departed warmongers of AEI .
You can forget AEI ; it does n’t matter that much anymore , now that the Republicans are out of power  but get ready for PPI !
What the heck is PPI ?
I can hear you asking that question , and the answer is simple : it ’s the neocons all over again , albeit this time in " liberal " drag .
The Progressive Policy Institute was set up by the Democratic Leadership Council , a " centrist " Scoop Jacksonish group that aims to keep the Democrats on the pro-war straight - and - narrow : it is the War Party ’s intellectual outpost in the Democratic Party .
These " national security Democrats " are just as unabashedly militaristic as their right - wing counterparts over at AEI , the only difference being rhetorical .
Thus , PPI ’s chief theoretician Will Marshall avers , in a 2005 screed hailing " national service and shared sacrifice " :
“ True patriotism is at odds with the selfish individualism that shapes the Republicans ’ anti-government ideology .
It means accepting obligations to the community to which we all belong and must contribute if we are to enjoy the fruits of membership .
In wartime , not everyone can fight , but everyone can find ways to sacrifice for the common cause .
Bush has sent U.S. troops into battle , but he has n’t challenged the rest of us to do our part . ”
Marshall ’s beef is that the Bush crowd was n’t warlike enough on the home front .
Along with Marshall Wittmann , the ex-Trotskyist who went on to become chief public relations flack for the Christian Coalition and is now with PPI , the other Marshall spent the Iraq war years attacking the Bushian foreign policy from the right  it was n’t interventionist enough , and certainly not in a " smart " way .
Now PPI is pushing for NATO expansion , addressing an open letter of " advice " to our new president and declaring openly the war agenda of the left - neocons : " The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the most successful defense alliance in history , " intones Commander Marshall .
So it ’s time to declare victory , throw our hats in the air , and go home  right ?
Wrong , wrong , wrong  no government program , and especially not a transnational racket like NATO , is ever going to voluntarily dissolve the bureaucratic , financial , and cultural bonds that bind together the job - holders , the government contractors , and , in this case , the war profiteers .
It ’s far too lucrative a business to give up , and certainly the thought never even crosses Marshall ’s mind .
He bemoans the fact that " the alliance is stumbling badly , " and informs President Obama that he " will face no more important task than defining a coherent mission for NATO in the 21st century  a mission that transcends the alliance ’s origins as a strictly regional pact and reinvents it as a force for global stability , " i.e. , a fresh rationale for endless meddling .
You have to give Marshall credit , however .
He thinks big :
" You should seize the opportunity to lead NATO ’s transformation from a North American - European pact into a global alliance of free nations .
By opening its doors to Japan , Australia , India , Chile , and a handful of other stable democracies , NATO would augment both its human and financial resources .
What is more , NATO would enhance its political legitimacy to operate on a global stage . "
Imagine  we would be pledged to go to war in order to defend Chile .
Against whom would we be defending it ?
Hugo Chavez ?
Oh , there are plenty of new enemies in our brave new world , according to Marshall ’s lights .
While Russia merits a " watchful eye , " China is seen as the new rising threat : they dare to tout their " market Maoism " as an ideological competitor with Western - style social democracy , and they ’re getting richer by the hour !
While not yet " a direct threat " militarily , China ’s " stunning economic growth rates , sustained over two decades , " are clearly a source of envy and irritation on Marshall ’s part , as if he despises the market part of what he calls " market Maoism " far more than the Maoist aspect .
That ’s what being a left - neocon is all about .
With the new crew in the White House committed to " fair trade , " otherwise known as trade protectionism , it looks like we ’ll be confronting a new set of enemies : our economic competitors in the world marketplace .
If you were the Chinese government , and you read Marshall ’s missive , realizing that PPI is tremendously influential in Democratic Party circles , the veritable voice of the party establishment , what would you do ?
I ’ll tell you what I would do : launch a preemptive strike .
No , I would n’t mount a military assault , but a much more effective and devastating economic attack 
I ’d dump my Treasury bonds , sell off my federal agency bonds , and call in all private - sector debt .
The result would be a financial Pearl Harbor : the U.S. economy would sink so far below sea level that we ’d wind up alongside Atlantis .
What ’s scary about this PPI proposal is that its proponents are n’t some fringe group , but representative of what passes for the " centrist " wing of the Democratic Party .
John McCain may have lost the election , but his dotty neoconnish agenda lingers on in the form of this proposal , which resembles nothing so much as McCain ’s idea that the U.S. should organize a " Concert of Democracies , " as a new instrument of intervention worldwide .
In a piece for The American Conservative , I predicted that we would see this idea come up if Obama won the White House :
" If NATO as an instrument of the new Cold War is n’t working as the War Party hoped , then the Concert of Democracies is Plan B , one that will have appeal beyond the offices of the American Enterprise Institute and the Weekly Standard .
Neoconservative internationalists , such as Robert Kagan , are reaching out to liberal internationalists , such as Ivo Daalder of the Brookings Institution : the two recently authored an op-ed in the Washington Post calling for the establishment of such a league to fulfill ‘ the responsibility to protect . ’
Daalder is an influential advisor to Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign , while Kagan , Newsweek noted , is ‘ McCain ’s foreign policy guru . ’ "
Get ready for a new rationale for a massive military buildup .
PPI calls for at least 100,000 more troops to beef up our ability to intervene anywhere and everywhere , and it demands more money for the " defense " budget .
As the incoming administration takes the reins of power , watch for the " national security Democrats " to extend their talons .
With the mad Keynesian professors at the helm in Washington , looking eagerly about for " projects " to lavish ever - depreciating dollars on , preparations for war with China , or some newly - declared " rogue dictator " ( Putin ? ) , will no doubt be factored into their " stimulus package . "
When people are poor and getting poorer , it ’s fairly easy to convince them that the evil " foreigners " are to blame  for stealing " our " markets and selling quality consumer goods to " our " people at prices that Americans can actually afford .
Economic nationalism will be the War Party ’s new battle - flag .
As a great libertarian economist once put it , " if goods do n’t cross border , then armies soon will . "
Look for the return of the " Yellow Peril " and the revival of a half - forgotten " progressive " tradition of left - wing anti-Chinese and anti-Japanese feeling .
On the West coast , starting in the 19th century , the labor unions agitated against the importation of " coolie " labor , and anti-Japanese sentiment was also rife .
This anti-Asian movement found political expression in the Asiatic Exclusion League and the Workingman ’s Party .
The movement had enough clout in 1906 to pressure the San Francisco - based California state Board of Education to exclude students of Japanese descent from public schools white children attended .
We hear echoes of this in Rachel Maddow ’s rants against that Republican congressman from a southern state who has a Toyota factory in his district , which Rachel referred to as if it were an invading army instead of a source of income for thousands of Americans .
How dare he oppose the bailout of our sclerotic auto industry , which long ago deserved to go belly - up !
What I want to know is where - oh - where do these people learn economics ?
In short , it ’s going to get increasingly ugly out there , as the Democrats take control and this kind of talk becomes more commonplace .
Call it bread - and - butter imperialism  the War Party ’s appeal to the common working man .
Full employment through global interventionism  yeah , that ‘s the ticket !
The names change , the rhetoric undergoes a subtle shift in tone , but from AEI to PPI is not a long road to travel .
Those who are hoping for " change "  the mindless slogan relentlessly pushed by the Obama - ites until it becomes a mantra devoid of meaning  are in for a shock .
What we ’ll see in the foreign policy realm is more of the same , including a fresh crop of neocons with considerable influence among key policymakers .
As a new year dawns , it ’s the same old same old .

Back when life was simpler , Sesame Street produced a video showing how a crayon factory worked .
I do n't recall seeing the video as a kid , but watching it now , I learned a few things :
1. Words are not necessary to describe the process of making crayons .
An awesome soundtrack , on the other hand , is a must .
2. Making crayons is a messy business .
Orange wax everywhere !
3 . Skilled crayon - makers can pick up scores of crayons at once using a special two - handed grab .
Set aside two minutes for this look at the origins of a batch of crayons .

' Ultimately , it was the havaldar who caught the terrorist '
D
In a two - part interview with rediff.com 's Archana Masih , he assesses the Mumbai police 's responses against the backdrop of last fortnight 's terror attacks .
When you look back on the night of November 26 , as a former IPS officer and part of the Mumbai police , how do you assess what unfolded during the operation ?
Ultimately , who caught the terrorist ?
It was the conventional havaldar with his rudimentary weapons .
When you have so much police force and weapons , what was the need to wait for so long ( for the National Security Guard and the Marine Commandos ) ?
It is deplorable .
A city which boasts of a police force of 50,000 including the State Reserve Police -- could n't it have neutralised ten terrorists ?
They could have planned a strategy and done a big assault .
Neither did they try .
We have a State Reserve Police Force , two battalions in Goregaon ( north - west Mumbai ) , 3,000 to 4,000 armed reserve police in Naigaon ( north - central Mumbai ) -- most of these men are sent for regular commando training to various organisations .
The State Reserve Police is sent to Naxalite areas .
Had we wanted , we could have utilised them within half an hour .
We have excess weapons which are not being used .

Some legal scholars believe appointing Clinton to State would be unconstitutional Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday November 26 , 2008

While the appointment of Senator Hillary Clinton to Secretary of State appears to be an all but done deal , there are some legal scholars who believe that the move would be unconstitutional .
" Why ?
Because the Constitution forbids the appointment of members of Congress to administration jobs if the salary of the job they'd take was raised while they were in Congress , " NBC's Pete Williams reports .
Article I , Section 6 : " No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time ; and no Person holding any Office under the United States , shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office . "
An Emolument is defined as the product ( as salary or fees ) of an employment , The Atlantic 's Matthew Berger points out .
" Essentially , you cannot take a job if the salary was increased during your current congressional term , " Berger notes .
" And the salary for cabinet officials has gone up in the past year .
Even if it is lowered back down , constitutional scholars say that may not be enough to fix the problem . "
The Washington Post notes , " In Clinton 's case , during her current term in the Senate , which began in January 2007 , cabinet salaries were increased from $ 186,600 to $ 191,300 . "
MSNBC adds ,
" The usual workaround is for Congress to lower the salary of the job back to what it was so that the nominee can take it without receiving the benefit of the pay increase that was approved while the nominee was in Congress .
This maneuver , which has come to be known as ' the Saxbe fix , ' addresses the clear intent of the Constitution , to prevent self - dealing . "
The Post explains that the " ' fix ' came in 1973 , when President Nixon nominated Ohio Sen.
William Saxbe ( R ) to be attorney general after the famed ' Saturday Night Massacre ' during the Watergate scandal .
Saxbe was in the Senate in 1969 when the AG 's pay was raised . "
However , Professor Michael Stokes Paulsen , a Constitutional law expert at St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis , is skeptical that this ' fix ' is constitutional : " A ' fix ' can rescind the salary ,  he added ,  but it can not repeal historical events .
The emoluments of the office had been increased .
The rule specified in the text still controls . 
" The question is whether this would be an issue at confirmation - if Clinton is nominated to the post - and who would raise it , " Berger writes .
" Senators traditionally grant their colleagues some deference and it could be considered politics at its worst if Republicans try to block her nomination with this argument .
But senators may be loathe to vote for something scholars tell them is unconstitutional . "
Berger believes that " this development may make Obama , or Clinton , think twice about the appointment . "
The conservative Hot Air blog observes that " Obama would be far from the first President to run afoul of this restriction . "
" Nixon appointed William Saxbe to be Attorney General under similar circumstance , while Jimmy Carter appointed Ed Muskie to the same position Hillary will fill , " Ed Morrissey writes for Hot Air .
" Her husband appointed Lloyd Bentsen to run Treasury in the last such instance .
No one ever proposed impeachment or a disqualification for these appointments , all of whom took their offices without much controversy at all . "
Morrissey concludes , " Still , the intent of the founders is clear , and not something to shrug off so lightly .
They wanted to keep Congress from creating cushy sinecures for them to occupy when a friendly President took office .
The attraction of power , cash , and cronyism would lead to corruption and a permanent political class that would cease answering to the electorate .
The question should get asked , or Congress should amend the Constitution if no one wants to enforce that restriction any longer . "
We are in a process of financial de-evolution .
I ’m not sure what Darwin would call this but each subsequent day without missing a beat produces another more progressively disastrous “ idea ” to save the market .
I am cautious about calling what we are seeing as ideas since it is better to define it as flushing money down the toilet which would be a better characterization of what the Fed and U.S. Treasury are doing to our country .
The genius crony capitalist now think it would be a magnificent idea to get mortgage rates to 4.5 % .
Now why would the Treasury want to do this ?
Well according to the Wall Street Journal :
“ ( WSJ ) Treasury views this plan as potentially halting the slide in home prices by enabling borrowers to afford bigger mortgages , thus increasing demand for homes and pushing up home values . ”
Bwahahahaha !
The solution to the problem according to these bandits is to go back to the genesis of what caused this housing bubble .
That is , people taking on bigger mortgages and home prices getting too high was the freaking problem !
These are the people running our country .
In fact , dropping home prices are proving in certain areas to actually increase sales .
I ’m going to show you a chart for Southern California that may boggle your mind .
See , as prices dropped sales actually increased :
I know this is a shock to the MENSA members running our country into the ground but prices being too high is [ was ] the problem .
So why would you want to institute a policy that would artificially keep prices high ?
And since these guys do n’t think two steps ahead , this problem is doomed to fail .
Why ?
Well interest rates eventually will be set by market forces .
Mortgage rates are already at historical lows .
So let us take a look at a poor sap that buys a home with a 4.5 % 30 year fixed rate .
In a few years when we have to face the repercussions of the squandering of our entire wealth in pathetic bailouts , rates will undoubtedly be higher since we are going to need to attract more capital to the U.S. since we are flat broke .
So in the future , let us say rates go back to 6.5 % the price of the home will need to reflect that .
We are essentially screwing people once again and kicking the can down the road .
This is patently insane .
Let us examine a $ 300,000 home purchase at 4.5 % with 20 % down :
Down payment : $ 60,000
$ 240,000 mortgage at 4.5 % : PI = $ 1,216
Not bad .
But what if rates go back to 6.5 % in a few years when this person wants to sell the home ?
How much would a person be able to afford if they want a similar monthly payment ?
$ 193,000 mortgage at 6.5 % : PI = $ 1,219
You have lost an extraordinary amount of purchasing power here .
The purchase price would now have to be around $ 241,000 if we are trying to maintain a similar monthly payment .
Remember the original purchase price is $ 300,000 .
Do we really need to go through this exercise again when we just went through the pay Option ARM and subprime debacle that clearly screwed people over with a teaser rate ?
Do we really think housing is going to appreciate that much in the next few years ?
I doubt it .
Look at Japan and you ’ll get a glimpse into our future .
Trying to institute these low rates is simply unbelievable but like I said , the ideas get dumber as we go along so next year they may be giving free mortgages with your next GM car purchase .
Who really understands what the cronies are brewing in their ministry of bad ideas .
People are running to safety right now with 3 month treasuries coming in at 0.005 % .
Bwahahaha !
We ’ve become a big gigantic mattress for the world .
Banks are flat out sticking their money here and holding on to their pants for dear life .
Remember when the money was given to them for lending to the public ?
Never happened .
Why do n’t we go back and yank that capital out of their corrupt hands and use that to fund infrastructure projects and everything else we ’ll be launching next year .
If they are n’t going to lend it , might as well use it for something that will benefit the country .
I have always been adamant against any bailouts but allowing these banks to maintain this capital was a big freaking joke .
We ’ve just been ripped off by Wall Street and the bankers .
How long are we going to allow this to go on ?
In fact , I know the big spectacle today was with the big 3 automakers .
Regular readers know I have as much sympathy for them as I did for Paris Hilton spending a few days in county jail .
Yet I ca n’t believe the rage some Americans have at auto workers when the true crime is being perpetrated by Wall Street banks and our own Fed and U.S. Treasury .
Think about the ridiculous $ 306 billion back stop that was given to Citigroup on a Sunday night only a few days ago .
Did we see the CEO being forced to ride in on a mule to explain to us how they would manage the money ?
What about AIG and their extravagant parties ?
How about all those capital injections from the TARP into the largest banks ?
Last time I checked , I did n’t see anywhere in the bill that stated , “ money should be parked in short term notes while country implodes . ”
It is our money folks .
We have a right to have it back if we are not satisfied in how it is being managed .
Do you think any of these people are following the laws ?
They are the people who write the law !
Thomas Jefferson is rolling over in his grave :
“ If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation then by deflation , the banks and the corporations will grow up around them , will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properly belongs . ”
If this foreclosure crisis does n’t make you feel like we are quickly losing our national home , I ’m not sure what will wake you up .
Layoffs Get Worse
The employment situation is getting worse .
We are finally starting to look at the employment side of the equation but I ’m afraid it is too late .
Too much money has been squandered and unless we are going to go and retrieve it out of Wall Street ’s hands , we are going to be limited to the amount we will be able to spend since so much has been committed by the ministry of bad ideas .
Today , these were some of the announcements :
Du Pont : Looking to dismiss 6,500 employees
AT&T : Cutting their work force by 12,000 jobs
State Street Corporation : Cutting 1,700 jobs
This does n’t even include the 50,000 jobs from Citigroup or the 19,000 from JP Morgan or even the job cuts that will come from the big 3 no matter what happens .
Bailout or bankruptcy a lot of jobs will be gone .
That is a certainty .
State budgets are n’t exactly swimming in the green either .
Earlier this week I went into great detail regarding the dire situation in California and the group of incompetent boobs running the state .
Many states are in a similar situation with their own set of circus clowns .
The jobs report set to be released tomorrow will once again show much more damage .
Until people realize that this is about the lower and middle class of America getting fleeced over by Wall Street and puppet politicians , we are going to continue to see poorly planned bailouts that reflect the interests of a very small number of our population .
Do you realize that in our country , only 10 % of all households make more than $ 118,200 a year ?
In places like California and New York that does n’t go too far .
The most recent Census data tells us that there are about 110,000,000 households in the U.S.
So let us breakdown the raw numbers :
And this data is one or two years old from the Census Bureau so given the economic collapse , I would imagine that the numbers would still be accurate or even show lower numbers in many categories .
So when these banks talk about the people , they ’re probably talking about 100,000 households in a nation with 110,000,000 households .
Frugality Revisited
The unfortunate aftermath of decades of massive consumerism is that now many people conditioned on believing they are what they buy will have to come to terms with not buying as much .
This is going to be a shock for most .
We are so conditioned that things always get better as time goes on especially when it comes to finance that it is hard to believe that the current players have just set us back a decade or two .
The notion that today ’s car is better than one that came out last year because it has a $ 50 plastic iPod slot is absurd because it will cost you $ 5,000 more .
Does n’t make sense .
But if the core of a society is simply consuming blindly then anyone that does n’t consume is usually at the fringes .
Here in California , I know many of the readers from this state even though they had solid incomes and were prudent , probably felt like paupers in their groups because practically everyone around them were buying bigger homes and driving around in leased cars .
Yet it was never really wealth .
Yet the mind is hard to convince when you see everyone flocking together as a herd .
Frugality is coming whether we want it or not .
During the Great Depression , there were many people pining for the heyday of the Roaring 20 s but it never came back .
It could n’t .
It was one gigantic bubble just like the one we ’ve lived through .
All these bailouts and the gimmick of lowering rates to 4.5 % keep on grasping at this notion that we somehow are n’t a poorer nation .
We are .
We can try denying this but the sooner we come to terms the quicker we can get to being productive .
Yet so much of the money is being funneled into unproductive activities like propping up banks that should fail .
Fail as in right now .
Otherwise , we are going to have a lost decade like Japan where capital is diverted from productive activities to keeping pathetic banks on life support .
Think of wealth this way .
Why did gold cost $ 35 an ounce during the Great Depression and now is going for $ 765 an ounce ?
Did it somehow become 21 times more valuable ?
Well gold is actually tangible and has a fixed amount .
With a fiat currency our central bank can print as much as they like or create all these absurd facilities to channel the wealth to their own self serving interests .
Yet that is the problem .
Too much power is concentrated in a few hands .
This is the end effect .
There is nothing holding us back from printing or bailing out anything and everything .
Is n’t it funny that we have n’t heard someone say , “ well you know what , we only have about $ 1 trillion more left for bailouts . ”
They ’ll never say that because theoretically they have nothing keeping them in check .
They can print but our U.S. Dollar is being under siege by the people who we put into power to protect it .
Do n’t listen to their words .
Every action they are taking is to lower the dollar value to hopefully help us with our enormous debt .
Debt that is going to their crony Wall Street and central bank friends .

Computing Thoughts
The departure of the hyper - enthusiasts
by Bruce Eckel
December 18 , 2005
Summary
The Java hyper-enthusiasts have left the building , leaving a significant contingent of Java programmers behind , blinking in the bright lights without the constant drumbeat of boosterism .

But the majority of programmers , who have been relatively quiet all this time , always knew that Java is a combination of strengths and weaknesses .
These folks are not left with any feelings of surprise , but instead they welcome the silence , because it 's easier to think and work .
Where did the hyper - enthusiasts go ?
To Ruby , apparently .
This is chronicled in Bruce Tate 's book " Beyond Java , " which should probably be titled " Why Ruby is Better than Java . "
The book is roughly edited ; you 'll find yourself thinking " have n't I read this paragraph before ? " in any number of places , but that 's a disappointing experience I 've had with several O'Reilly books of late .
In many places he plays fast and loose , and almost at the end of the book he declares that he does n't have time to learn these other languages in any depth -- although he has no trouble condemning the same languages in his rush to Ruby .
Such a statement should be in the first paragraph of the book : " I 've decided that I love Ruby , so I will condemn other languages without fully understanding them " ( in one sentence repeated in a number of places in the book , for example , he declares that C# is no more than a clone of Java ) .
I 've been on the rollercoaster of language - love myself in the past and have made similar mistakes ; one error in particular was dismissing Python 's scoping - by - indentation when I first saw it ( months later realizing that we always indicate scoping by indentation anyway , even when we have curly braces available ) .
Now I try to investigate and support my ideas about these things more thoroughly .
It takes a lot more time and effort to do so , but it also leaves a more lasting impression .
This is not to say that Tate 's book is valueless ; on the contrary , it is worth reading .
I 've learned a number of new and useful things from it .
But you must be prepared to be annoyed in places .
Tate shrugs this off as being just a matter of opinion , but if you know more than he does about some of the languages he criticizes , you 'll realize that , as he admitted , he just did n't want to put in the effort .
Because of that , even the new things that you learn from the book you 'll wonder about -- did he actually do his homework on this particular topic , or will you be embarrassed in public if you use his explanation ?
For example , I think I now understand about continuations and continuation servers ( which seem to be very powerful concepts ) , but upon reflection I had better double - check that knowledge elsewhere .
Recently , two people that I know have gotten into an indirect tiff about what " simplicity " means .
Martin Fowler ( with whom I 've organized technical meetings ) first made the assertion that the Ruby library was simple and elegant .
For awhile , Martin was using Python , but several years ago he departed that camp for Ruby , explaining that Ruby had blocks like Smalltalk and that he liked blocks .
He seems to have been happy about his decision .
Martin's argument is that Java 's List interface requires you to say a List. get ( aList.size - 1 ) to get the last element , and this seemed silly to him .
Which it is , if you have unified all sequence containers ( that is , list containers ) into a single type , as Ruby and Python do .
Java , however , follows the C++ STL approach of providing different types based on the efficiency of various operations .
The Java libraries do not unify to a single list type because of efficiency issues , so you have to decide if you are going to be fetching the last element from a list a lot , and if you are you use a LinkedList , which does have a getLast ( ) method -- a fact which was completely left out of Martin 's original discussion , and the ensuing firefight ( other than some ignored comments ) .
Elliotte Rusty Harold ( who took over the management of the Java track at the SD conference from me ; I actually lived in the building next to his in Brooklyn for two months once ) observed that Ruby 's library design did n't seem so simple and clear to him , and he went into detail about many of the methods in the list class , pointing out that they often seemed to make no sense and wondering whether anyone was actually using some of them .
Elliotte has spent a lot of time on library design recently , producing the XOM XML library which , I think , represents some very clear thinking .
Look at what he writes ; I think he makes a good case .
On the other hand , I 'll bet that list was one of the first library classes that Matz wrote .
You can find plenty of methods and classes in Java 1.0 that appear to be amateurish additions , as well .
I think a better test , for both Ruby and Java , is to examine the classes that people have created when they have more experience with the language and its use .
I note that I rarely find methods in the Python libraries that make me wonder why they were included , and I think that comes from the maturity of Python ( which predates Java ) .
Also , understanding the constraints under which Josh Bloch designed the Java libraries might make you understand that design a little better .
Personally , I prefer the simplicity of Python 's single list class to Java or C++'s multiple implementations , but a single list implementation must make efficiency compromises .
Library design involves compromise , and if such a compromise disagrees with you you 're likely to feel it was a bad choice .
Aside from Tate , we know the hyper - enthusiasts have moved to Ruby because of the howls of protest at Harold 's opinion ( although much of this was before his analysis of list ) .
We can identify hyper - enthusiasts because the arguments have a strongly faith - based flavor to them .
X is the true way , therefore anything X is best by definition , and all other languages lack X's goodness .
For example , upon discovering metaclass programming , a number of Ruby hyper - enthusiasts ( I do n't have Tate 's book with me , so I do n't remember if he was one ) , have declared that Python is incapable of metaclass programming , which is untrue .
It may be true that Ruby 's metaclasses are easier to grasp and use than Python's , but Python has had the capability for many years .
Ruby is to Perl what C++ was to C. Ruby improves and simplifies the Perl language ( the name " Ruby " is even a tribute to Perl ) , and adds workable OO features ( If you 've ever tried to use classes or references in Perl , you know what I 'm talking about .
I have no idea whether Perl 6 will rectify this or not , but I stopped paying attention long ago ) .
But it also seems to carry forward some of the Perl warts .
For anyone used to , and tired of , Perl , this certainly seems like a huge improvement , but I 'm tired of all impositions by a language upon my thinking process , and so arbitrary naming conventions , reversed syntax and begin - end statments all seem like impediments to me .
But it 's hard to argue that Ruby has n't moved things forward , just like C++ and Java have .
It has clearly shaken the Python community up a little ; for a long time they were on the high ground of pure , clean language design .
Although the Perlish warts in Ruby do n't have that cleanliness , when Matz started from scratch on Ruby he was able to look at the problem in a fresh way and he 's done some things that have made the Python core folks look again at " what problem are we solving ? "
Ruby , for example has coroutines , as I learned from Tate 's book .
The expression of coroutines in Ruby ( at least , according to Tate 's example ) is awkward , but they are there , and I suspect that this may be why coroutines -- albeit in a much more elegant form -- are appearing in Python 2.5 .
Python 's coroutines also allow straightforward continuations , and so we may see continuation servers implemented using Python 2.5 .
And of course , who can ignore Rails ?
The backlash from heavyweight web frameworks has been significant .
We now know that EJB 1 & 2 were based on an entirely flawed set of use cases .
Because of the damage this ( still slowly dawning ) realization has wrought to Sun 's reputation , it 's hard to know whether EJB3 , which probably should have been called something else to disassociate it with the failures of its predecessors , will succeed , despite the fact that EJB3 is like a breath of fresh air .
You look at the code and it makes sense ; no bizzarre and obscure interfaces and concepts to puzzle over while thinking , " I wonder why I have to do this ?
Well , these guys are clearly smarter than I am . "
( I tried to understand EJB1 , but when I first heard that entity beans did n't actually work , my brain refused to let me invest any more time , which turned out to be the right choice ) .
As a result of all this , someone said " hey , all I want to do is create a database and use it from the web .
Why should I do all that work ? "
As it turns out , such activities seem to be about 90 % of all we ever do in " Enterprise " programming , and EJB 1/ 2 were solving an entirely different problem , and making the 90 % incredibly difficult in the process .
Thus , the Rails approach of " just connect the database to the web . "
Rails brings up a deeper issue , as well .
Apparently , something " relatively simple that you only do once , " such as setting up the database by writing SQL , really does benefit from automation , possibly because you actually end up doing these things more than once .
Or possibly because simplicity of both expression and of understanding really is important .
There is a faction among us that seems to feel that if you can do anything at all , it does n't matter how many hoops you must jump through to accomplish that thing .
These are the folks that assert that Java 's verbosity is " just finger typing that Eclipse / IntelliJ will do for me , " and it does n't matter if the resulting code has 20 times the visual bulk of a simpler approach .
One of the basic tenets of the Python language has been that code should be simple and clear to express and to read , and Ruby has followed this idea , although not as far as Python has because of the inherited Perlisms .
But for someone who has invested Herculean effort to use EJBs just to baby - sit a database , Rails must seem like the essence of simplicity .
The understandable reaction for such a person is that everything they did in Java was a waste of time , and that Ruby is the one true path .
The Rails fallout in the Python community has been significant .
Pythonistas have been busy since the beginning of the web , trying to understand the problem and spinning off a multitude of web frameworks to solve it .
Because of the confusion in the web space in general ( hindered further by the dead - end reasoning behind EJB1 / 2 -- how many billions of dollars were wasted by this ? ) , there was no nucleating agent that made any one of these frameworks come forward as clear winners , although it might be argued that Django had been in development for several years and appears to predate Rails , even if it was n't public until after Rails .
My own experience in web frameworks was with Zope .
In an interesting parallel with EJB3 , Zope is now on version 3 which is a from - the - ground - up redesign , and everything I 've seen of it indicates that , like EJB3 , it represents a great deal of rethinking of the problem .
I 've been bumping up against the problem of " but all I want to do is connect a database to the web " in Zope2 for several years now .
Oh , it 's definitely something you can do , but unfortunately it 's past the knee of the " Z - shaped learning curve , " and is only trivial if you live and breathe Zope every day .
Do n't get me wrong ;
Zope is an excellent system and incredibly powerful , and Zope3 may be much easier , but I 'm out of steam .
I have realized that on my site , I really just want to do a collection of simple things , and I do n't want to relearn Zope every time I want to accomplish something .
So -- sorry , Jim ( Fulton , not Kirk ) -- I 'm going to find something drop - dead simple to solve my drop - dead simple problems .
Probably PHP5 , which actually includes most of Java and C++ syntax , amazingly enough , and I wonder if that is n't what made IBM adopt it .
I 'm sure we will find that the Rails approach is n't the ultimate solution ; there will be plenty of other problems that we need to solve on the way to making web development easy .
But it represents a fundamental restart in the thinking process .
And it has caused , in the Python community , attention to Django , the development of Subway ( although I do n't know how that one is faring ) , and the creation of Turbogears , which seems like a very good solution because it builds on best - of - breed existing pieces using a Rails - inspired approach .
Clearly Ruby is making important contributions to the programming world .
I think we 're seeing the effects sooner in Python than elsewhere , but I suspect it will have an effect on Java as well , eventually , if only in the web - framework aspects .
Java - on - rails might actually tempt me into creating a web app using Java again .
However , I can't see Ruby , or anything other than C# , impacting the direction of the Java language , because of the way things have always happened in the Java world .
And I think the direction that C# 3.0 may be too forward - thinking for Java to catch up to .
But here 's something interesting .
I was on the C++ standards committee from the initial meeting and for about 8 years .
When Java burst on the scene with its onslaught of Sun marketing , a number of people on the standards committee told me they were moving over to Java , and stopped coming to meetings .
And although some users of Python like Martin Fowler ( who , it could be argued , was actually a Smalltalk programmer looking for a substitute , because the Smalltalk relationship never really worked out in the real world ) have moved to Ruby , I have not heard of any of the rather significant core of Python language and library developers saying " hey , this Ruby thing really solves a lot of problems we 've been having in Python , I 'm going over there . "
Instead , they write PEPs ( Python Enhancement Proposals ) and morph the language to incorporate the good features .
I think we 've mostly been hearing from people who have come from Perl and found Ruby to be a " better Perl , with objects that work , " or people who are finally convinced that dynamic languages have merit , and so mix the enthusiasm of the first time dynamic language user ( quite a rush , as I remember from my 2 - month experience with Perl many years ago ) with their experience of Ruby .
So far , I 've heard from the hyper - enthusiasts about Ruby being cool , or that it has begin - end blocks and they do n't like indentation to delineate scope .
That kind of thing : " I like this , I do n't like that , " which is fine but not compelling .
The person I want to hear from is the core Python expert , someone who knows that language incredibly well , who has decided that Ruby is just so much better that all the mature Python libraries and community expertise does n't hold a candle to the value of moving to Ruby .
That person would be able to make a compelling , feature - by - feature argument ( such an essay is better served as his or her own weblog entry , rather than posting it as a comment here ) .
