At the very end of May we saw NVIDIA ’s first effort to expand Fermi beyond the $ 300 space with the GeForce GTX 465 , a further cut - down GF100 core priced at launch at $ 279 .
Unfortunately for NVIDIA , it was n’t even a lackluster launch – while GF100 performs quite well with most of its functional units enabled ( i.e. GTX 480 ) , disabling additional units is n’t doing the GPU any favors .
Furthermore disabling those units does little to temper the chip ’s high power draw – something that ’s only reasonable on the higher - end cards – resulting in a card that ate a lot of power while losing to AMD ’s Radeon HD 5850 .
In short , the GTX 465 is a lesson of how you can only cut down GPU so far .
NVIDIA went too far , and ended up with a part that had GTX 285 performance and GTX 470 power consumption .
Today NVIDIA is back in the saddle with something entirely new : GF104 and the GTX 460 .
The second member of the Fermi family is ready for its day in the sun , and in many ways it ’s nothing like we expected .
Designed from the start as a smaller chip than GF100 , GF104 is the basis of the GTX 460 line of products which fix the GTX 465 ’s ills while delivering the GTX 465 ’s performance .
It ’s what the GTX 465 should have been , and it ’s priced as low as $ 199 .
And as we ’ll see , it ’s the first NVIDIA card in a long time that we can give a glowing review for .

GF104 , the heart of the GTX 460 series being launched today , is the first waterfall part of the Fermi family .
As we saw with AMD ’s Radeon HD 5000 series last year and NVIDIA ’s GeForce 9000 series before that , NVIDIA is in the process of taking the base GF100 design and reducing it for the construction of smaller , lower performing GPUs suitable for use in video cards at lower prices for the larger markets .
The final tally for GF104 is 1.95 billion transistors , which occupies a die space slightly more than that of AMD ’s Cypress in the 5800 series .
To put this in comparison , this is about 200 million fewer transistors than AMD ’s Cypress , or 550 million more than NVIDIA ’s older GT200 GPU that powered the GeForce GTX 200 series .
This makes the GF104 the biggest GPU we ’ve seen for the prices NVIDIA is targeting , a sign of the increasing pricing pressure between NVIDIA and AMD .
GF104 like GF100 before it is not initially being shipped in a “ full ” configuration .
The chip has 2 Graphics Processing Clusters ( GPCs ) containing 4 SMs each , for a total of 8 SMs adding up to 384 CUDA cores .
The GeForce GTX 460 will be shipping with 1 of the 8 SMs disabled , leaving it with 336 enabled CUDA cores .
NVIDIA tells us that the reason they ’re shipping the first GF104 parts with a disabled SM is due to yields – they would n’t be able to meet the demand for cards if they only shipped cards with 8 functional SMs .
Unlike GF100 , outirght poor yields do n’t appear to be a huge factor here .
Our impression from discussing the issue with NVIDIA is that GF104 is yielding around where it should be for a chip of its size , with NVIDIA choosing to take a hit on selling “ full ” chips for a higher price in order to sell more chips overall .
In any case it gives them some room for expansion in the future should they decide to release a “ full ” GF104 based product .
Perhaps the most surprising thing about GF104 is that it ’s not a simple reduced version of GF100 like what AMD did with the Evergreen series .
Instead NVIDIA made some very significant changes to the design of their SMs for GF104 , resulting in a waterfall product that ’s undoubtedly Fermi but also notably different from GF100 .
There ’s a lot to discuss here , so we ’ll get more in to this in a bit .
Moving on to the cards , NVIDIA is launching 2 cards today .
At $ 229 there is the GeForce GTX 460 1GB , the closest thing we ’ll see to a “ full ” GF104 part for the time being .
The GTX 460 1GB has 7 of 8 SMs enabled along with all 32 ROPs , with a 256 bit memory bus connecting the GPU to 1GB of GDDR5 .
The core is clocked at 675MHz core , 1350MHz shader , and 900MHz ( 3.6GHz effective ) memory .
The TDP for this part is 160W , with an unofficial idle power draw in the 20 W - 30W range .
The other GeForce GTX 460 being launched today is the GeForce GTX 460 768MB at $ 199 , a slightly further cut - down card .
As NVIDIA ’s ROPs are closely tied to their memory controllers , the only way to reduce the amount of memory on a card is to disable memory controllers along with the ROPs .
As a result the GTX 460 768MB has less memory than the GTX 460 1GB , but also only 24 ROPs connected to a 192 bit memory bus .
The shaders remain unchanged , giving the GTX 460 768 MB the same compute / shading abilities as the GTX 460 1GB , but only 75 % of the ROP capability and memory bandwidth .
The clocks are unchanged from the GTX 460 1GB : 675MHz core , 1350MHz shader , and 900MHz ( 3.6GHz effective ) memory .
Given these differences , we ’re a bit dumbfounded by the naming .
With the differences in memory and the differences in the ROP count , the two GTX 460 cards are distinctly different .
If NVIDIA changed the clockspeeds in the slightest , we ’d have the reincarnation of the GTX 275 and GTX 260 .
NVIDIA ’s position is that the cards are close enough that they should have the same name , but this is n’t something we agree with .
One of these cards should have had a different model number – probably the 768MB card with something like the GTX 455 .
The 1GB card does not eclipse the 768MB card , but this is going to lead to a lot of buyer confusion .
The best GTX 460 is not the $ 199 one .
Today ’s launch will be a mixed bag in terms of availability .
$ 199 has long been known to be a critical price point with buyers , which is what makes this card so important for NVIDIA as it allows them to finally tap that market once more .
However to get there they ’re using their entire initial run of GF104 to build the 768 MB versions of the GTX 460 .
There should be plenty of 768 MB cards available for today ’s launch , but the bulk of 1GB cards are roughly 2 weeks late ( 1 or 2 may show up early if the vendor does rush shipping ) .
So what we have is a hard launch for the GTX 460 768MB , but a soft launch for the GTX 460 1GB .
We ’re not entirely thrilled with this – particularly as we believe the 1GB cards to be the better buy – but if nothing else it ’s better than the GTX 480 launch .
Today ’s launch will also be resulting in an interesting mix of price points .
NVIDIA has lowered the MSRPs on the GTX 470 and GTX 465 , while AMD ’s prices have been slowly drifting down over the last month too .
As a result we end up with roughly the following :
With these prices AMD and NVIDIA both have themselves comfortably stratified until you drop below $ 250 .
AMD does n’t have anything between the 5850 and 5830 , while they have a price gap of $ 80 - $ 100 .
Meanwhile the 5830 is priced directly against the GTX 460 768MB .
NVIDIA ’s pricing will be taking advantage of this gap , while giving the 5830 a run for its money at $ 200 .
The Trouble with Atheism is an hour - long documentary on atheism , presented by Rod Liddle .
It aired on Channel 4 in December 2006 .
The documentary focuses on criticizing atheism , as well as science , for its perceived similarities to religion , as well as arrogance and intolerance .
The programme includes interviews with a number of prominent scientists , including atheists Richard Dawkins and Peter Atkins and Anglican priest John Polkinghorne .
It also includes an interview with Ellen Johnson , the president of American Atheists .
Liddle begins the documentary by surveying common criticisms of religion , and particularly antireligious arguments based on the prevalence of religious violence .
He argues that the “ very stupid human craving for certainty and justification ” , not religion , is to blame for this violence , and that atheism is becoming just as dogmatic as religion .
In order to support his thesis , Liddle presents numerous examples of actions and words by atheists which he argues are direct parallels of religious attitudes .
He characterizes Atkins and Dawkins as “ fundamentalist atheists ” and “ evangelists ” .
In response to atheistic appeals to science as a superior method for understanding the world than religion , Liddle argues that science itself is akin to religion : “ the problem for atheists is that science may not be as far away from religion as you might imagine ” .
He describes Fermilab , a U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory focused on particle physics , as a “ temple to science ” , and characterizes Charles Darwin ’s The Origin of Species as a “ sacred text ” for atheists .
Open source software vendors in Switzerland have lost their Federal Administrative Tribunal case against the award of an IT contract to Microsoft .
The court declined to hear the complaint .
The verdict can still be challenged in the Federal Court of Switzerland , the country 's highest court .
Eighteen open source vendors brought the case against Microsoft , following the award of a 42 million Swiss Franc contract from the Swiss Federal Office for Buildings and Logistics for extending licensing , maintenance and support , to Microsoft , following a restricted tender .
The contract included the procurement of 10,500 desktop computers and 17,500 laptops .
Companies contesting the tender process included Linux vendors Red Hat , Univention and Collax and groupware specialists Zarafa and Open - Xchange .
According to a report ( German language link ) in the Berner Zeitung newspaper , the Federal Administrative Tribunal stated in its verdict that the plaintiffs could not be considered potential suppliers for the contract and were therefore not affected by its being awarded to Microsoft .
The contract was , according to the court , about the efficient continuing use of the state 's existing IT systems , which have been based on Microsoft products since 1990 .
In the opinion of the court , these were not directly replaceable through products offered by the plaintiffs , meaning that they , the plaintiffs , were aiming to change the state 's IT strategy .
The Berner Zeitung report says that one of the five judges was of the opinion that both open source suppliers and Microsoft were active in the software market in question .
According to the dissenting judge , the award of the contract to Microsoft would mean that not only had the existing solution been retained , but the use of Microsoft products would be set in stone for the future .
This would radically restrict the software market to a single supplier .
The case has been cited by open source advocates as an example of the need to support open standards and alternatives to proprietary products .
In May 2009 , parliamentarians from the CVP , SP , FDP , EVP , GLP and Green parties founded the digital sustainability parliamentary group to promote this end .

Through co-ordinated raids across the country , Hungarian police have attempted to decimate the country 's BitTorrent scene .
Following the deployment of many officers , dozens of servers were seized and many of the country 's trackers shut down , including the prominent 900,000 peer ' ncore ' tracker .
An ISP , university and many seedboxes were also targeted .
This week saw unprecedented action against the Hungarian BitTorrent scene .
As is always the case with these types of actions , until the smoke clears most details are largely unverified but thanks to information provided to TorrentFreak by Sct of ASVA .
info ( the country ’s biggest P2P blog ) and our Hungarian contacts , we can provide an outline .
Following investigations carried out by ASVA.hu ( movie industry group ) and PROART .HU ( Association of Authors Rights ) since early 2010 , on Wednesday co-ordinated police raids across the country targeted many torrent sites , an ISP and even a technical university .
Ncore , the largest site targeted in the raids with around 900,000 peers , was the most prominent to be taken offline .
Unconfirmed reports suggest that the main site may still be intact as the police only found the site ’s proxy .
Ncore
While quite a few sites went down once news of the raids started to spread , it remains difficult to be 100 % certain which were actually visited by the police and which went down as a precaution .
1stTorrent appears to be trouble as they are calling out for a lawyer with IT / copyright expertise but have offered users assurances that their details are safe .
Bithorló definitely had their servers seized as did GigaTorrent , Evolution , Blue Dragon , Dreamland and Deja Vu .
Insane and Pirate Bay reportedly received warnings of a raid and shut down voluntarily .
It is clear , however , that the raids were significant .
According to the police , more than 50 servers were seized containing more than 500tb of data .
Sources have confirmed that in addition to searches on an ISP and university , many seedboxes were seized .
Some seized “ servers ” …
Labeling the operations as “ a huge milestone in the fight against Internet piracy ” , the Association of Authors Rights ( PROART ) thanked the police for carrying out the raids and praised them for “ establishing protection for the rights of creators ” .
Under pressure from the United States , Hungarian authorities have carried out at least two sweeps against torrent sites in recent years , notably in 2007 and 2009 .
Interestingly , a report on the PROART website from last month celebrates the news that the U.S. government recently removed Hungary from a blacklist due to its previously poor record in dealing with piracy .
In the meantime , the large Bithumen tracker , which was named in official documents as a target for closure , continues to operate from Germany .

Rocket Mass Heater Plans - now free for a while
Finland -- How long will the biochar produced by Preseco 's biomass reactor keep carbon out of the atmosphere ?
Probably at least until the next ice age , according to technical manager Sampo Tukiainen .
Unearthed cooking pits formerly used by roving bands of hunters in the region still contain the char generated by their cooking fires .
" Bugs cannot digest it , so it stays in the ground , " Tukiainen said .
" And putting this carbon back into the soil makes it more productive . "
Preseco's system -- a collection of boilers , valves , computers and pipes -- sits in a open - air workshop in Lempaala , just north of Helsinki .
At one end , a technician vacuums up wood chips with a giant shop vac .
The chips then get treated , plunged into a furnace heated to 800 degrees Celsius , and then converted to whatever combination of byproducts someone might want : biochar , which can be sold as fertilizer or industrial grade renewable carbon for 250 Euros a ton ; plant vinegar , a biopesticide ; natural gas ; heat for regional district heating systems ; tar ; or carbon credits .
Feeding chicken waste into the system also produces a dense , renewable form of fertilizer .
It can handle a half a ton of biomass in an hour .
Watch out when stepping over that aluminum pipe on the ground , Tukiainen says while giving the tour .
It contains gases from the furnace .
And do n't stare straight into the small window that gives a view into the central furnace for too long -- it can cause retinal issues .
How economical and efficiently the system works in practice , along with other biomass technologies from other companies , will likely have a substantial impact on Finland 's green industry and even the long - term health of the national economy .
Although Nokia has become Finland 's largest company and exporter , pulp and paper remain a huge part of the gross domestic product .
Forest covers 74 percent of the country ( Europe 's seventh largest ) and 97 percent of it has been logged at least twice .
In the 1800s , Sweden , which controlled Finland at the time , issued an order that only stumps could be harvested in an effort to stop rampant deforestation .
Because of replanting , deforestation has become less of a problem .
Instead , the big scare is the Kindle .
The decline in newspapers and magazines combined with the rise of e-books have the country 's paper industry quaking .
As a result , many firms in the sector have begun to transform themselves into energy companies .
" Why not use the woods as fuel ? " Tukiainen said .
Preseco has also devised a fish - waste - to - biofuel system that is now being tested in Vietnam .
Manufacturers of biomass equipment , meanwhile , want to take the expertise they 've developed for biomass installations in northern Europe worldwide .
Metso , an industrial equipment giant based in Helsinki that generates around 5 billion Euros in revenue a year , has sold a 100 - megawatt biomass system to Southern Company that will begin to produce power for Nacogdoches , Texas in 2012 .
Duke Energy and Xcel have also launched plans for biomass in the U.S. , says Kari Remes , general manager of sales and marketing for the power business line of Metso .
While Preseco's fuel and biochar system is in the experimental phase , Metso 's fuel - only systems play a key role in northern Europe 's energy infrastructure .
Finland gets about 38 percent of its heat from biomass systems .
Metso itself has built a large number of small biomass plants capable of generating 5 to 10 megawatts of electricity , or combinations of heat and electricity , in various cities in northern Europe .
These plants can serve homes or businesses within a 25 kilometer radius .
The company has also participated in a number of larger projects that can generate 20 to 300 megawatts of electricity and / or power .
Vattenfall installed a 60 - megawatt biomass boiler at the Vanaja coal / gas power plant in Hameenlinna , Finland .
The video shows the original coal boiler with the 60 megawatt one next door .
( The photo is of Preseco 's prototype .
More photos are coming in a subsequent slideshow . )
Wood and waste go in and get subjected to a circulating bath of liquefied silicon .
" Combustion lasts for a few seconds .
That is all , " he said .
Vattenfall then sends the heat generated through the local district heating system .
A 124 - megawatt plant is currently under construction in France , while a 183 - megawatt plant is under construction in Poland .
The new frontier lies in expanding beyond northern Europe , he said .
Biomass manufacturers are also tinkering with their products to improve efficiencies , allow for more flexible feedstock consumption , and get them to produce different byproducts .
Metso , for instance , now makes boilers , shredders and automation equipment for the biomass industry , and the byproducts of its equipment are heat , electricity and steam .
By 2020 , the company will expand its equipment line to generate biodiesel , biocoal , pellets for biomass burners , lignin separation , and lignin production .
" We have already produced 70 tons of oil in the lab , " he said .
Additionally , Metso is working on machinery for converting solid waste from sewage facilities into methane .
Biomass does have its flaws .
For instance , it costs more than coal , so policy and carbon taxation are important for the market .
The power generated by biomass is closer to the price of wind , he says .
Biomass is also less dense than coal .
Thus , in a retrofit situation where a coal burner is being replaced by a biomass boiler , the capacity of the plant will go down .
" You have to keep the flue gas output the same .
That is the limiting factor , " he said .
Additionally , most large - scale jobs are somewhat customized .
Large - scale biomass boilers can generally accommodate different types of feedstocks , but the boilers have to be optimized for the feedstocks that the owner will ultimately expect .
Deploying biomass as a form of distributed power can be challenging too because of the large , constant amounts of feedstock required .
The fuel depot for the Vanaja plant is a warehouse .
Still , biomass is one of the few renewable forms of energy that is not subject to the vagaries of weather conditions , and the burgeoning interest in the sector is undeniable .
" Forestry is glamorous again , " says Tukiainen .
Vintage sewing and fashion ephemera with a few other finds from my travels .
When Alison Gopnik thinks of what makes a good education , she thinks of a big Victorian house in Philadelphia and a smoky bistro in Montreal .
The house is where Gopnik , an internationally recognized expert on how children learn , spent her childhood .
The bistro , on Montreal ’s downtown Mountain St. in the early 1970s , is where she spent much of her free time as a student at McGill University .
Her childhood was stimulated by parents who laughed at Woody Allen , debated architecture , took her to museums , dressed her as the Greek goddess Athena or Shakespeare ’s Ophelia for Halloween , and had her read Henry Fielding novels out loud around campfires .
By comparison , she found elementary school “ hopelessly dull . ”
When she was 12 , her parents moved to Montreal to teach at McGill .
As a teenager she hobnobbed with artists , scientists , journalists and political activists at a place called Le Bistro , immersed in the revolutionary spirit of the times while drinking Pernod and smoking Gitanes .
“ For me , intellectual life was n’t something you achieved , it was something you breathed , ” Gopnik wrote in an essay on her upbringing .
“ The education most children get should be more like my informal education . ”
She ’ll be making the argument as a presenter at the annual ideaCity conference in Toronto from June 16 to 18 , an eclectic gathering that might remind Gopnik of her bistro days .
At 54 , Gopnik is the prolific and effusive professor of psychology — and affiliate professor of philosophy — at the University of California at Berkeley .
Her research in child development radically challenges schools —
“ They do n’t teach the way children learn , ” she argues — and the way many scientists think of babies .
Psychologists and neuroscientists have long viewed infants as “ irrational , amoral and egocentric , ” says Gopnik , the author or co-author of four books , including The Scientist in the Crib and The Philosophical Baby .
In the 1950s , psychologist B.F. Skinner believed they learned by responding to stimuli .
Linguist Noam Chomsky later argued that theory could not possibly account for the amount of learning that occurs in childhood .
He proposed that language , and much else that we end up knowing , is innate .
Gopnik ’s research on infants up to 5 years old instead indicates that , “ fundamentally , babies are designed to learn . ”
“ You want to know what it ’s like to be a baby ? ” Gopnik is fond of saying .
“ It ’s like being in love for the first time in Paris after four double espressos . ”
Infants , as every mother knows , have a knack for “ getting into everything . ”
Gopnik argues they ’re actually learning like scientists — exploring their environment , testing hypothesis and drawing conclusions .
“ That ’s a very rational approach , ” she says in a telephone interview .
“ If you wanted to design a robot that could learn as well as it possibly could , you might end up with something that looked a lot like a 3 - year - old . ”
In an essay to be published in the July edition of Scientific American , Gopnik reviews some of the experiments — conducted by her or others — that show babies using their experiences to try and make sense of the world .
In one experiment , 18 - month - olds faced a bowl of raw broccoli and a bowl of goldfish crackers .
The experimenter tasted some of each , making either a happy face or a disgusted one .
Then she put her hand out and asked , “ Could you give me some ? ”
The infants “ gave her broccoli when she acted as if she liked it , even though they would not choose it for themselves , ” Gopnik writes , adding it shows babies are able to take the perspective of others .
Some experiments suggest babies trying to grapple with the laws of physics .
They will , for example , look longer at unexpected events — like a toy car apparently passing through a solid wall — than predictable ones .
They also seem to learn by drawing references from statistical patterns and probabilities .
Twenty - month - olds were placed one at time in front of a box full of ping - pong balls — 80 per cent of the balls were white , 20 per cent red .
The experimenter took five balls from the box , and then asked the child to give her a ball from some red and white ones already on a table .
The children showed no preference between colours if mostly white balls were removed from the box .
“ Yet they specifically gave her a red ball if she had taken mostly red balls from the box — apparently the children thought her statistically unlikely selection meant that she was not acting randomly and that she must prefer red balls , ” Gopnik writes .
One Gopnik experiment resulted in preschoolers beating adults at deducing how to make a machine light up with an unusual causal relationship .
“ The adults seemed to rely more on their prior knowledge that things usually do not work that way , even thought the evidence implied otherwise for the machine in front of them , ” she writes .
Gopnik believes the long period children spend dependent on caregivers is evolution ’s way of freeing them to exercise brains with an immense capacity for learning and creativity .
Adults tend to instead make priorities of planning , executing and exerting executive control .
“ Children are really the research and development division of the human species and we ’re production and marketing , ” she says .

Yet resources for mothers or preschool caregivers are non-existent or woefully inadequate , she adds .
And where child rearing and apprenticeship into jobs and adulthood was once the function of extended families and communities , it now falls largely — and solely — on the shoulders of parents and schools .
Gopnick says some parents wrongly conclude from her research that “ taking out the baby Einstein tapes and reading drills ” will boost learning .
The best learning instead occurs through hands - on exploration guided by experts — the kind enjoyed by graduate students in university .
It ’s largely missing from elementary and high schools , which tend to focus on what Gopnik calls “ routinized learning ” — the mastery of skills through practice , repetition and discipline .
Done well , routinized learning helps develop top pianists or baseball players , for example .
But “ schools are both not progressive enough and not disciplined enough , ” Gopnik argues .
“ We do n’t give ( students ) a disciplined induction into a skill . . . and we ’re not giving them discovery and learning , either . ”
“ If baseball were taught the way we teach science ( in schools ) , ” she adds , “ we would talk to them about famous baseball players till they were eight or nine and then maybe , when they were ten , they would be allowed to throw the ball occasionally .
We would n’t allow them to play a game until they got to graduate school . ”
This partly explains why a young Gopnik and her five siblings “ alternately ignored and despised school , ” as she puts it .
Yet they became a magazine writer for The New Yorker , the head of the National Academy of Sciences ocean studies board , a Near Eastern archaeologist , the Washington Post art critic , and a public health manager .
She has written that each could trace the roots of their vocation “ somewhere in the polymath atmosphere of the Gopnik household . ”
Her parents , Irwin and Myrna Gopnik , dropped out of college to support their growing family .
Though poor , they were firmly anchored in the intellectual richness of the postwar period .
“ Science , Art and Modernity , ” Gopnik writes , “ were our constitutional principles . ”
They lived in a public - housing project in Philadelphia before moving , when Gopnik was five , to the big Victorian house she remembers so fondly .
She devoured books and made models of the Acropolis in the backyard .
Her parents eventually returned to their studies and earned PhDs — her father in English literature and her mother in linguistics .
At just 15 years old , Gopnik began studying philosophy at McGill University — the result of having skipped two grades , and of McGill temporarily accepting Grade 11 graduates while the province scrambled to set up its new , pre-university CEGEP system .
“ I wanted to answer big questions about humanity , about how it is that we understand about the world , how we can know as much as we do , why human nature is the way that it is , ” she says .
“ And it always seemed to me that you find answers to those questions by looking at children . ”
In 1988 , when she was hired to teach at Berkeley , dual citizenship between Canada and the U.S. was n’t allowed .
Gopnik eventually , and reluctantly , gave up her Canadian one .
“ I still think of myself as a Canadian , ” she insists .
Her three sons — the youngest is 22 — are dual citizens and one of them , Andres Gopnik - Lewinski , is a psychology major at the University of Toronto .
Last week , he began an internship at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health .
In August , Gopnik will marry for the second time .
“ It just goes to show you that development continues forever , ” she says .
Alison Gopnik speaks on Friday , June 18 at the ideaCity conference , being held at Koerner Hall in The Royal Conservatory of Music .

" Marquez has signed for a four - year contract with the New York Red Bulls and will join up with Thierry Henry , " they said .
" Marquez has gained his contract release from Barcelona and will get a salary of £ 2 million per season .
The official announcement of the deal will be next week . "
Ourprovides the best breaking news online and ourfootball fan community is unmatched worldwide .
Never miss a thing again !
By Mahmoud Maher and Matt Monaghan Barcelona defender Rafael Marquez is to join Thierry Henry at New York Red Bulls on a four - year contract , can exclusively reveal .
The 31 - year old defender had eyed a move to Major League Soccer before playing at World Cup 2010 with Mexico .
After starring for his nation in South Africa , he has now negotiated a release from his contract with the La Liga champions - which was set to run until 2012 - and has put pen to paper on a lucrative deal in the ' Big Apple ' .
Speaking exclusively to , a well placed source confirmed the deal will be officially announced next week .
The move brings to an end a glory - filled seven year stay in Catalunya , where Marquez won every club trophy available .
Despite this success , a series of injuries had limited his influence in Pep Guardiola 's set - up and he was restricted to just seven top - flight starts .
Marquez 's arrival means he joins Henry and Colombian striker Juan Pablo Angel to fill the limit of designated players at the Red Bulls .
MLS rules state a squad can only contain three designated players on higher wages , with the ex-Monaco man 's arrival sure to be above the salary cap limits .

The plume of ash and steam rising from the Eyjafjallajökull Volcano reached five to six kilometers ( 17,000 to 20,000 feet ) into the atmosphere on May 10 , 2010 , when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite captured this image .
The ash is blowing southeast over the North Atlantic Ocean .
Volcanic ash from previous days closed airports in Ireland and Portugal on May 10 , said CNN .

A high profile Melbourne lawyer has questioned the jail sentence given to a man who blew a bubble with his gum in court .
Magistrate Rodney Crisp sentenced 20 - year - old Mirza Zukanovic to 30 days in jail for contempt of court at the Moorabbin Magistrates ' Court yesterday .
He was later released on bail after his lawyer lodged an appeal in the Supreme Court .
Criminal lawyer Rob Stary says the jail term for such an offence is rare .
" I 've never heard of any similar example , " he said .
" Sometimes they 're placed in the holding cells of the court until they come back and give an apology to the magistrate .
That 's usually for a matter of hours or so for someone to cool their heels and have an opportunity to reflect upon their indiscretion . "
Mr Stary says the jail term would cost the taxpayers about $ 10,000 in prison management fees .
" If you fine the gentleman in question $ 10,000 , that might deter any future behaviour , " he said .
" But to imprison someone , especially a young person , you 've got to exhaust every other option before you ultimately come to the conclusion that imprisonment is the only appropriate course . "
July 21 , 2010 , New York and Charlottesville , VA – The Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) and the National Lawyers Guild ( NLG ) today filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Virginia challenging the Virginia Department of Corrections ' ( VDOC ) decision to ban their joint publication , the Jailhouse Lawyer 's Handbook ( JLH ) , from all Virginia prisons .
The JLH is a free resource for prisoners who wish to learn about legal options , including how to file a lawsuit in federal court to challenge abuse by guards or unsafe conditions .
Since its initial publication in 2003 , demand for the handbook has grown substantially ; both CCR and the NLG provide copies to several thousand prisoners every year .
The self - help publication explains the court system , shows methods for legal research , and summarizes prisoners ’ constitutional rights .
It contains no material that might cause legitimate security concerns , yet the VDOC asserts that the entire publication constitutes " Material whose content could be detrimental to the security , good order , discipline of the facility , or offender rehabilitative efforts or the safety or health of offenders , staff , or others . "
The Department of Corrections failed to notify CCR or the NLG that their handbook was being banned and failed to give either the opportunity to be heard as is required by law .
The lawsuit claims that the VDOC banned the JLH in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution .
Said NLG attorney Jeff Fogel , “ This effort to prevent prisoners from challenging the conditions of their confinement in court is not only patently unconstitutional , it drives them to find extralegal means to resolve their disputes , contrary to any conceivable penological objective . ”
According to attorneys , there is ample recent history of censorship in Virginia prisons .
A local book store had been providing free used books to prisoners until stopped by VDOC , though the department reversed its position after negative publicity .
Fogel and CCR cooperating attorney Steven Rosenfield are also representing the publication Prison Legal News , which has a pending case involving the banning of most of its issues of since 2007 .
A Nation of Islam member recently challenged the banning of nearly all issues of its publication The Final Call due to its position that Black people are entitled to their own nation .
Issues of Newsweek , US News & World Report , Time Magazine and mainstream newspapers also have been banned , prompting a critical editorial from The Daily Progress in Charlottesville .
Earlier this year , VDOC was given the " Free Speech Muzzle Award " by the Jefferson Center for Free Speech for their recent prohibition on talking CD's , including religious sermons .
Said CCR Attorney Rachel Meeropol , who co-authored the handbook along with CCR staff member Ian Head , “ Virginia prisons are banning a document that explains to prisoners how they can exercise their Constitutional rights to protect themselves from physical abuse , poor conditions and other mistreatment .
If it is dangerous to educate people about the Constitution , there are a lot of law schools who are going to be in trouble . ”
So I see this video of Utah GOP Senate candidate Mike Lee telling the Salt Lake Tribune that he basically believes the taxpayers should be on the hook for cleaning up the BP oil spill .
What can you say to this weird but consistently Republican attitude that the free market means never having to pay when you 've f& % #ed up ?
Think Progress has the whole exchange .
But then I read this article about the dire economic condition of my home state .
You know , the eighth largest economy in the whole world .
And we 're bankrupt .
It ’s a story that ’s being repeated all across California – and throughout the United States – as cash - strapped state and local governments grapple with collapsed tax revenues and swelling budget gaps .
Mass layoffs , slashed health and welfare services , closed parks , crumbling superhighways and ever - larger public school class sizes are all part of the new normal .
California ’s fiscal hole is now so large that the state would have to liberate 168,000 prison inmates and permanently shutter 240 university and community college campuses to balance its budget in the fiscal year that begins July 1 .
Think of California as Greece on the Pacific : bankrupt and desperately needing a bailout .
Another flipping bailout .
And then it hit me .
You know who the ultimate Welfare Queens are ?
They 're not those fictional mamas living high on the hog and driving Cadillacs as Ronnie Raygun insisted and Sharron Angle sneers at .
The true Welfare Queens are the Republican Party .
They do n't worry about income , fetishizing tax cuts beyond all reason , yet they spend like drunken sailors .
Then when they find themselves ( and the state or country ) completely destitute and hurting , do they consider raising taxes to pay for their rampant spending ?
Of course not .
They want to be bailed out .
California actually institutionalized this kind of Welfare Queen attitude , thanks to Republicans like Howard Jarvis 's Prop 13 and the California Consititution 's requirement that any budget item or proposed tax increase must get a near impossible 2/3 vote of the entire state legislature .
So now there 's literally no way to get the tax increases other than the Governor holding his hand out to the Feds .
So the next time you see overly - entitled Republicans saying that the taxpayers should be bailing them out , call them what they are : Welfare Queens .

CORPORATE WELFARE : Helping Companies Grab
More four articles published in the Boston Globe on how our political parties pay back their corporate donors : Helping Companies Grab All They Can Get The $ 150 Billion ` Welfare ' Recipients : U.S. Tax code gives companies a lift Business ' clout keeps the government breaks coming Helping Companies Grab All They Can Get By Charles M. Sennott , 07/07/96 WESTBOROUGH -
A secluded , hilltop campus here was once a state reform school for boys .
Now the institutional brick buildings house the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative - a quasi- state agency that critics say is a classic example of entrenched corporate welfare .
Supporters call the collaborative an innovative ``partnership '' between business and government .
But while it is clear that the companies and those who run the collaborative benefit , it 's less clear how the taxpayers do .
Some high - tech companies that rely on federal subsidies for product research and development , end up shipping the resulting manufacturing jobs overseas .
Other companies that create new technology , often are takeover targets of Fortune 500 corporations .
That can mean sizable profits for entrepreneurs , but few new jobs .
Collaborative officials say these federal programs promise long - term results and taxpayers should be patient .
But for now , some of these programs are at best high - risk investments .
Take for example the Technology Reinvestment Project , under which Massachusetts companies received about $ 500 million during 1993 and 1994 .
According to the collaborative 's own accounting , the project ``directly '' created about 100 jobs .
That comes out to about $ 5 million per job .
The collaborative is an initiative of Massachusetts Technology Park Corp. , an independent state authority created in 1982 .
It has a powerful board of directors and the strong support of William F. Weld , who has praised the collaborative for playing a ``vital role '' in assisting the high technology community .
The collaborative gets its funding by leasing to Taunton - based Kopin Corp .
a 70,000 - square - foot technology lab and fabrication facility , built by the state in the early 1980s .
The $ 1 million - a- year lease of the state - owned facility is considered far below market value and a total savings of as much as $ 400 million in construction costs to Kopin , which uses the space to do advanced development and some production of its flat panel displays for portable computers and virtual reality headsets .
Lease money pays the salaries of collaborative executive director Joseph Alviani , who earns $ 140,000 a year , and a dozen other executives who help Massachusetts companies access millions of dollars in federal funding .
Amid this partnership between government and business are some puzzling relationships .
Consider the collaborative 's Robert Kispert .
He heads a division called FEDTech , designed to help companies tap the $ 1 billion a year Small Business Innovative Research program .
But Kispert admits he also has consulting contracts from Foster Miller Inc. , a Waltham company that is the leading recipient of SBIR money in the country .
Foster Miller has received more than $ 40 million over the last 10 years to develop a variety of products which it , in turn , sells .
Kispert sees no conflict of interest in his dual role as a representative of a quasi- state agency and a paid consultant to a company that stands to benefit from that agency .
But Ann Markusen , director of Rutgers University 's Project on Regional and Industrial Economics , which has done extensive research on the issue of government assistance to the high tech and defense industries , says : `` It all sounds like a kind of corporate welfare ponzi scheme . ''
`` In a lot of states this has become a racket .
It makes me furious that politicians , from in - state and in Washington , are doing everything they can to help companies feed on corporate welfare , '' Markusen says .
`` They all want to make sure the businesses in their districts get their share , and in the meantime the country as a whole has to make tough decisions like cutting more programs for poor people . ''
In addition to its discounted lease , Kopin also receives roughly $ 10 million a year through various federal programs , some of which the collaborative has helped it access .
Despite this sizable public investment in the company , Kopin 's chief executive concedes he will be shipping a larger and larger percentage of its jobs overseas .
John Fan said the state and federal funding ``formed the underpinnings for us to grow our commercial activities . ''
Still , he acknowledges Kopin already has shifted roughly 30 percent of its manufacturing to Taiwan and Thailand .
`` As we grow , the ratio will increase because the manufacturing costs are better there .
`` It is a global economy now , and we are going to be competitive .
The brainpower is here .
So we can pay $ 18 an hour for someone 's brain ... and much less for someone to work with their hands over there . ''
When asked if he feels a responsibility to keep manufacturing jobs in the community that has helped his company flourish , Fann replied : ``Nobody wants to be tied down .
But if it 's good for us , we 'll stay .
That is natural , right ? ''
Lionel S. Johns , deputy director of the US Office of Science and Technology , concedes the lack of loyalty by companies that rely on government funding is ``a tough issue . ''
But as one of the White House 's leading specialists on federal technology transfer , Johns believes the Advanced Technology Program and others like it are essential .
The US , he says , is going to have to find ways to keep companies here through incentives , not by getting angry that they go to Taiwan .
`` This is a very complicated worldwide game in which this country 's economic prosperity is at risk .
These guys ( Taiwan and other nations offering incentives to lure American businesses ) are playing hardball and we are playing sandlot , '' Johns says .
`` We end up playing a politicized game with the words `corporate welfare . '
If we continue to cut federal R&D , we are going to undermine the technology infrastructure of our economy and then we will ultimately undermine our entire economy . ''
But critics like Richard Kogan , a senior analyst for the Washington - based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , which has tracked federal subsidies to high - tech companies , says : ``I tend to be skeptical of the investment , because the federal money is mostly going to companies that already have a lot of their own money to invest in product development . ''
The collaborative 's Alviani , who served as Secretary for Economic Affairs under Gov. Michael Dukakis , disagrees .
He points out that many recipients of Adanced Technology Program money are small companies .
But he concedes that many larger corporations , such as Digital and Raytheon , have benefited from direct funding and partnerships with smaller companies .
The collaborative has helped Massachusetts companies win millions of federal dollars through ``how - to '' seminars and brochures on Washington 's maze of programs .
Some federal programs have had questionable results in terms of job creation .
The Technology Reinvestment Project , for one , has done so poorly that Congress plans to phase it out .
In another , the Advanced Technology Program , the collaborative estimates Massachusetts businesses either led or participated in projects worth $ 90 million from 1990 to 1994 .
Nearly 15 percent of the program 's money goes to Massachusetts companies , second only to California .
A June 1995 report by the collaborative to assess ``ATP and Its Impact on the Economy '' stated : `` The most promising benefit of the program is undoubtedly the number of potential hires resulting from successful ATP projects . ''
But if that is the gauge of success , then by its own estimation it would appear to be failing .
The report states that ``on average , companies increased employment by 8 people .
Over 150 jobs have been ( directly ) created as a result of the awards .
Several hundred jobs have been indirectly created . ''
That comes out to $ 600,000 for each job directly created by ATP .
Asked if that is a sound investment in the economy , Alviani replied : `` It 's a fair question .
It 's very hard to monitor the return on these investments .
But you have to keep in mind the fact that there has not been a sufficient amount of time to reach the concrete return on investments .
...
We are investing money up front for the long - term growth of the economy . ''

The $ 150 Billion ` Welfare ' Recipients : U.S. Corporations : First of three parts By Charles M. Sennott , 07/07/96
It comes down to priorities .
And to understand the choices made every day by the federal government on who should benefit from taxpayers ' money , consider these stark examples : Walt Disney Corp. , whose profits in 1995 exceeded $ 1 billion , received $ 300,000 in federal assistance last year to perfect fireworks displays .
But Joseph and Phyllis Fagone of East Boston , who are in their mid-80s and struggling on a fixed income , were among 1,000 state residents whose federally funded fuel assistance ran out before Christmas .
Kopin Corp. , a Massachusetts technology company , has received $ 30 million in federal subsidies the last four years and tens of millions more in savings through the lease of a state - owned laboratory .
Despite this huge public investment , the company plans to send more and more of its new manufacturing jobs overseas .
Meanwhile , it looks like Derek Davis , 17 , of Roxbury will be among the thousands of Boston youths who wo n't get summer jobs due to limited federal and state funding .
He was hoping to save money for college .
Every year , an estimated $ 150 billion - in the form of direct federal subsidies and tax breaks that specifically benefit businesses - is funneled to American companies .
Critics call it ``corporate welfare . ''
The $ 150 billion for corporate subsidies and tax benefits eclipses the annual budget deficit of $ 130 billion .
It 's more than the $ 145 billion paid out annually for the core programs of the social welfare state : Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , student aid , housing , food and nutrition , and all direct public assistance ( excluding Social Security and medical care ) .
Now , a growing number of voices from both ends of the political spectrum question whether it is fair to provide such help to businesses while cutting back on aid to poor people - questions which at a minimum seek to frame corporate assistance as the missing piece of the national debate on welfare reform .
Stirrings on the corporate welfare issue have been set in motion by an unlikely coalition of politicians , policy makers and think tanks , ranging from Labor Secretary Robert Reich to Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan ; from liberal Democrat Sen.
Edward Kennedy to conservative Republican Sen. John McCain ; and from the libertarian Cato Institute to the Progressive Policy Institute .
They feel that if the White House and Congress were sincere about achieving a balanced budget , they could begin by cutting billions of dollars in direct subsidies to giant multinational companies .
The subsidies range from $ 1.4 billion annually in price supports for large sugar farming interests ; to nearly $ 2 million to help McDonald 's market Chicken McNuggets in the Third World ; to $ 20,000 for golf balls that defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin billed the federal government as an ``entertainment '' expense .
``Americans have been asked to tighten their belts across the board , from families who receive food stamps to our men and women in uniform , '' said McCain of Arizona , who has challenged fellow Republicans on the issue .
``We are morally obliged to ensure that the corporate sector shares in the sacrifice .
The public cannot understand why we are shelling out billions of dollars to powerful corporate interests when we simply cannot afford such largesse . ''
Robert Shapiro , an analyst for the Progressive Policy Institute , a think tank of the centrist Democratic Leadership Conference , said , `` The hypocrisy on corporate welfare is glaring .
We are in an era in which the Congress was able to find nearly a trillion dollars in cuts over seven years , the bulk of it from social services to the poor .
But less than 2 percent of those cuts came from subsidies to industry . ''
`` I do n't blame the businesses for trying to get whatever they can .
But I do blame the government for being willing to sacrifice the tax dollars of average people to satisfy these well - heeled and well - organized special pleaders , '' adds Shapiro , who has researched federal subsidies .
``We have encrusted the economy with layer upon layer of these subsidies to the point where it is having a profound impact on the economy and the allocation of limited resources . ''
Said Gloria Larsen , who until recently was Gov. William F. Weld 's secretary of economic affairs and served as deputy director of the Federal Trade Commission under President Bush : `` The personal responsibility argument is so readily tied to social welfare .
Now it is time that it is tied to corporate welfare . ''
Talk , but little action .
Despite such sentiments to cut back , corporate assistance continues .
President Clinton 's administration , through Labor Secretary Reich , has used the bully pulpit against these expenditures , but done relatively little to actually prevent them .
In some instances , Clinton has even sought to increase subsidies .
The Republican - controlled Congress has been equally recalcitrant about any proposed changes to tax provisions that steer billions of dollars to big business .
And in Massachusetts ,
Weld has endorsed an active policy of subsidizing business through trade missions , support services , tax breaks and state offices that guide businesses , big and small , on how to tap federal money .
Corporate welfare goes virtually unmentioned in political campaigns , where candidates like Clinton and Bob Dole square off on how to reform social welfare .
Neither has proposed ``two years and out '' for corporations receiving federal assistance .
And only recently has there been any policy debate on ``personal responsibility '' of corporations to the communities where they profit and receive public money .
Corporate welfare persists largely because of parochial politics .
State by state , politicians are applauded for bringing home corporate pork with little regard for its drain on the national economy .
``Corporate welfare is a fashionable phrase inside the Beltway , '' says Sheila Krumholz , research director for the Washington - based Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks campaign finance issues .
`` But when it comes to biting the hand that feeds them , politician after politician is walking away from their rhetoric .
They cave in to each individual subsidy , every one of which ... can be defended and rationalized . ''
A Boston Globe examination of the issue has found : A host of questionable federal giveaways , such as the $ 200 million a year Market Promotion Program which over the last two years gave Massachusetts - based Ocean Spray some $ 700,000 and California - based Gallo about $ 4 million to market ``Cranapple ' ' juice and wine all over the world .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars more were given to Concord - based Welch 's and a Lynn - based company that makes marshmallow Fluff .
While many federal programs have the stated purpose of creating jobs , some subsidized companies are downsizing .
AT&T , General Electric , Raytheon and Digital - among many large companies receiving federal assistance - have laid off about 100,000 workers among them .
And defense contractor Lockheed Martin is expected to receive $ 1 billion to help defray the cost of its $ 10 billion merger , including more than $ 16 million in pay and performance bonuses for top executives while nearly 50,000 of the conglomerate 's employees have been laid off in the last five years .
Government subsidies to high - tech industries have resulted in tens of thousands of jobs going overseas .
Federal officials and corporate chiefs boast about the promise of high - paying jobs created by ``partnerships '' with government .
But they say little or nothing about the fact that many of the jobs created end up in Ireland , Malaysia , Singapore or Thailand because of low labor costs and taxes .
The roughly $ 100 million a year Sematech consortium helped Digital Equipment Corp . and other semiconductor companies , but Digital still has shifted part of its workforce and capital to Ireland and Singapore .
There is little hard data and even less oversight of many federal programs , especially in the technology and science industries , to assess whether they are accomplishing their stated goals of creating jobs and stimulating the economy .
In the Advanced Technology Program , for example , Massachusetts companies participated in $ 90 million worth of projects .
But a state - funded study found that only 150 jobs were directly created as a result of the projects .
A rush by the federal government and states to accommodate business with favorable tax rates has created a historic shift in America 's tax burden .
After World War II , the nation 's tax bill was roughly split between corporations and individuals .
But after years of changes in the federal tax code and international economy , the corporate share of taxes has declined to a fourth the amount individuals pay , according to the US Office of Management and Budget .
A parallel trend has occurred at the state level .
In Massachusetts , corporations pay $ 900 million , or 8 percent , of the $ 13 billion in state tax revenue annually .
Many business leaders defend the tax breaks and subsidies they receive as necessary to create a ``level playing field '' in the global marketplace .
Industries in most of Europe and Asia , they note , are heavily subsidized by their governments .
Proponents of government partnerships argue that not just big business , but thousands of small startup companies rely on federal dollars to research and develop products with potential for great public benefit , products that would otherwise go unfunded .
It is an issue of great import to Massachusetts , which by many accounts is the most dependent of all 50 states on federal research dollars .
The hundreds of millions of dollars that pour into the state every year are the lifeblood of the commonwealth 's universities , hospitals and high tech firms .
Culture of dependency Defenders of corporate subsidies and tax benefits also point to technological breakthroughs , such as the Internet , created through federal research and development programs and largely paid for by the US Defense Department .
Others point out that because of agribusiness subsidies , Americans pay less for food than citizens of most other industrialized countries .
Joel Johnson , vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association and a top lobbyist for a business sector which every year receives billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks , defends the flow of public money to profitable companies .
`` There are business leaders and political leaders who recognize that the only way the government - whether it is the Defense Department or the Energy Department - can afford the new technology is if it works with business , '' he says .
`` But that is a partnership , not welfare . ''
Still , critics insist that if social welfare has created a ``culture of dependency , '' so too has corporate America grown reliant on federal help .
Many benefits seem to remain entrenched in legislation for decades , even though their purpose has become anachronistic .
Many agriculture subsidies , for example , were adopted as post - Depression safeguards against famine .
Putting a precise dollar figure on corporate welfare depends on how it is defined .
The Cato Institute considers corporate welfare to be the 125 Cabinet - level programs that provide direct subsidies to individual industries .
Cato 's estimate , generally regarded as conservative , is that such subsidies total $ 75 billion in 1996 .
Ralph Nader 's Center for the Study of Responsive Law offers a more expansive defnition that includes federal tax breaks , many of which are designed to funnel money to specific industries .
The center estimates total corporate aid at $ 167 billion annually , a figure most experts consider high .
The big money in corporate welfare comes in the subsidies to agribusiness , the oil industry and energy plants .
Comparatively , Massachusetts companies are smaller players , but the commonwealth is considered the leading recipient per capita of federal research and development money , specifically subsidies to the defense , technology , science and medical industries .
Historically , the movement of technology from federal laboratory to the marketplace was commercial kismet .
It was often a byproduct of defense research , but the government played a passive role .
Market forces and competitive corporations took the federal research and turned it into everything from television to Tang .
But there has been a profound change in the seven years since the end of the Cold War .
Now , Washington wants to play an active role in bringing government research into the marketplace .
This has spawned an array of programs , including Small Business Innovative Research , the Advanced Technology Program and the Technology Reinvestment Program - all aimed at creating partnerships with business .
In total , these partnerships with government provide an estimated $ 6 billion a year to industry giants in what critics have dubbed ``techno - pork . ''
Some programs , such as Cooperative Research and Development Grants , go largely unregulated , with little expert evaluation of the validity of the proposed work and great criticism of the process used to select commercial partners .
Although the Office of Science and Technology keeps track of the number of projects , critics point out there is almost no accounting of the return on this investment , or whether it is in the public interest .
The Department of Energy 's own advisory board reported in February 1995 that Cooperative Research and Development Grants , while valuable , leave federal laboratories ``vulnerable to charges that the selection process is flawed and that the competitive playing field is unfairly titled toward the labs ' chosen partners . ''
In other words , the government ends up picking winners and losers in the marketplace .
Tom Glynn , president of Maine - based Lighthouse Software is angry that the federal government has given about $ 40 million to help Icon Industrial Controls Corp. of Louisiana develop a product that Lighthouse already manufactures .
Says Glynn , whose company makes software to control robots in the machine tool industry , a growing international market : ``I 'm furious as a businessman and I 'm furious as a taxpayer that the federal government is funding my competition . ''
An incentive to leave Corporate dependence on federal dollars may be distorting the free - market system .
Many critics , including conservative economists and free - marketeer chief executives , believe some tax - code loopholes and many subsidies have created damaging incentives for companies to send jobs and capital overseas .
They have kept management focused on maintaining federal funding rather than increasing market share .
Says Stephen Moore , who has written a series of reports on corporate welfare for the Cato Institute : `` The point is , we have very efficient capital markets in this country .
The government has never been good at picking winners and losers .
The Commerce Department and Congress are influenced by lobbying more than the market .
That makes for a corruption of the market .
And this in the long run is bad for the national economy . ''
Moore says he knows the growing attack on corporate welfare has struck a raw nerve within American business .
Since he wrote a much - discussed and controversial report on the issue last year in response to a challenge by Secretary Reich , he says , ``IBM and the big guys want to have lunch with us a lot lately .
They are dying to tell us how important these programs are .'' `` But what people need to know is who gets hurt .
And that is the small business owners , who do n't have lobbyists in Washington and trade associations bringing them billions of federal dollars .
And they certainly are n't in Washington taking us out to lunch . ''

Tax code gives companies a lift By Aaron Zitner , Globe Staff , 07/08/96 WASHINGTON - When Robert M. Silva 's job moved to Singapore two years ago , his company flew him overseas so he could train his replacement .
Then the company closed its North Reading factory , laid off Silva and 119 co-workers and began importing from its Asian plant medical products once made in Massachusetts .
Moving jobs to Singapore had obvious advantages for Baxter International Inc .
Taxes are low , and Silva 's $ 26,000 salary was far higher than what the company pays his replacement .
But Baxter reaped another reward for moving overseas : a tax break , courtesy of the United States government .
In the name of boosting US business , the tax code offers a special benefit to companies that move jobs offshore , a gift also accepted by Massachusetts employers such as Stratus Computer Inc. of Marlborough ( 500 layoffs last year ) , Augat Inc. of Mansfield ( 260 layoffs ) and the Shrewsbury division of Quantum Corp. ( 85 layoffs ) , among others .
It is one of many tax breaks that ripple perversely through the economy - favoring multinationals over small firms , investors over average taxpayers and foreign workers over those at home .
The federal government gives up about $ 70 billion each year through corporate tax breaks , enough to cover the IRS bill for every Massachusetts resident two times over .
Corporate tax breaks carry a lower political profile than direct subsidies to businesses for programs such as the one that helps McDonald 's Corp. sell Chicken McNuggets overseas .
But they cost about as much .
For a nation trying to balance its budget and pay for social services , tax benefits to businesses are a gold mine .
`` The tax code is a major source of corporate welfare , '' says US Rep .
Lane Evans , an Illinois Democrat .
`` Not only that , but we are using our tax dollars in a way that hurts our own economy .
It drains our treasury .
It forces average Americans to bear a larger share of the tax burden . ''
The Clinton administration says that closing some tax breaks may force companies to raise prices and lose customers , and therefore pay less taxes .
`` There are two sides to every part of this , '' says Leslie Samuels , until recently the Treasury Department 's tax policy chief .
`` If you 're thinking that there 's hundreds of billions of dollars , it 's not there . ''
Republican lawmakers have actually moved to widen some tax breaks .
A 1993 law , for example , narrowed the provision that benefited Baxter International , Stratus and Augut , but a GOP bill scheduled for debate on the Senate floor today would fully restore the loophole .
Other lawmakers and analysts disagree with that approach .
At a time when Medicare , Medicaid and other social welfare programs are being curtailed , they say , many tax policies which explicitly benefit corporations cannot be justified .
These critics argue :
The US should not give tax breaks for breaking the law .
For example , after testing faulty medical products on unwitting hospital patients , C.R. Bard Inc. paid $ 61 million in penalties in 1993 .
But the pain was tempered by the tax code , which allowed Bard to take half the fine as a tax deduction .
Tax breaks to boost exports are not worth the cost .
Companies naturally will try to sell their products overseas , so export incentives worth at least $ 7 billion a year are a waste of money .
Too many companies pay no taxes at all .
Nearly 60 percent of US - controlled corporations and 74 percent of foreign firms doing business here paid no federal tax in 1991 , the last year figures were available .
Critics say the US is not tough enough on companies that use illegal accounting maneuvers to shift profits to low - tax nations .
The amount lost to the Treasury each year : as much as $ 40 billion over and above the $ 70 billion in legal tax breaks .
Congress must stop the bidding war among the states for jobs , in which companies win ever - greater tax breaks to relocate .
It should not let states use federal tax dollars when ``poaching '' jobs from other states .
Labor Secretary Robert Reich calls it ``one of the most egregious forms of corporate welfare . ''
Congress and the Clinton administration have cut some tax concessions to businesses .
They curtailed deductions for meals , sports tickets and country club dues , raising $ 3 billion a year in tax revenue .
They also banned write - offs for ``excessive '' executive salaries , those over $ 1 million , raising $ 70 million annually .
And they have worked out a deal - not yet final - to phase out a tax break for companies that build plants in Puerto Rico , which costs $ 2.6 billion a year in tax revenue .
But as a presidential candidate , Clinton promised more .
He vowed to make foreign companies , widely accused of underpaying US taxes , pay $ 45 billion more over four years .
Clinton has taken steps in this direction , but Treasury officials cannot show how much money has been gained .
Moreover , the president has done little to fulfill another promise in his 232 - page campaign platform , called ``Putting People First , '' to ``end tax breaks for American companies that shut down their plants here and ship American jobs overseas . ''
Incentive to leave A 33 - year - old father of two , Silva spent six years at the C.R. Bard plant in North Reading .
He assembled and tested infusion pumps , devices that allow patients to receive regular injections without a nurse or traditional needle .
In 1993 , the Bard unit was bought by Illinois - based Baxter .
`` They promised us the world .
Then they moved the plant to Singapore after telling us they would n't , '' says Silva of Nashua .
About 130 people lost their jobs .
`` It was quite the shock .
People were in tears that day . ''
One incentive for Baxter 's move , critics say , was a tax break known as the ``runaway plant loophole , '' which accounts for $ 1.7 billion each year in lost tax revenue .
Here 's how it works :
The US taxes the worldwide profits of American companies .
A million dollars earned in Ireland , for example , will be taxed at the US rate of 35 percent , minus the 10 percent tax the company must pay to the Irish government .
But Baxter , or any other company , is not required to pay the US tax bill unless it moves the money home to give to shareholders or to reinvest in the business here .
As long as the money remains overseas - invested in foreign plants or banks - Baxter will pay only a small tax to Singapore .
That is a total $ 191 million tax on its overseas profits over the years that the company has no intention of paying .
`` The tax code literally says , ` Move your plant overseas and we 'll give you a tax break , ''' says Sen. Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat .
The ``runaway plant loophole '' also has saved millions of dollars for Stratus , Quantum , Digital Equipment Corp. of Maynard and many others that have moved New England jobs overseas while deferring US taxes on overseas profits .
``Closing it would discourage further investment in growing our business , '' said Mark Fredrickson , a spokesman for EMC Corp. of Hopkinton , a computer equipment maker that has accumulated $ 388 million in untaxed overseas profits over the years .
`` It helps our profitability and helps secure the local jobs we have .
The bigger we become , the more people have to be employed here at corporate headquarters . ''
Many companies take advantage of two other tax breaks designed to encourage exports .
By creating a ``foreign sales corporation , '' which often exists only on paper , a firm can claim a tax exemption on some of its export sales .
For example , Zoom Telephonics Inc. of Mansfield said recently it lowered its tax rate by selling more products through its foreign sales corporation .
These tax rules , created in 1971 and refined in 1984 , cost the government $ 1.5 billion a year .
The US Treasury also forfeits $ 3.6 billion annually through the ``title passage loophole , '' as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has dubbed it , which allows companies to claim that some US sales were actually made on foreign soil .
Companies do this because they sometimes have foreign tax credits they cannot use unless they show more foreign income .
A break for lawbreakers
While the tax code causes pain for some US workers , it provides comfort to some companies that break the law .
Last year , for example , three former executives of C.R. Bard Inc. were convicted of conspiring to conceal flaws in medical catheters manufactured in Billerica and Haverhill .
Two deaths allegedly were linked to the catheters , and prosecutors said the faulty devices caused 21 emergency surgeries .
Bard's $ 61 million legal settlement with the government was the largest ever for violations of Food and Drug Administration rules .
But the tax code cushioned the New Jersey - based company .
Half of the settlement - $ 30.5 million - could be used as a tax write - off against earnings .
That was the amount Bard paid to settle civil charges .
The money was meant to reimburse the Medicare program for buying catheters that should not have been on the market .
`` When they earned the money they should not have earned from the catheters , they paid taxes on it .
So when they give up those earnings , they should get the taxes back , '' said Michael Loucks , the assistant US attorney who prosecuted Bard .
After agreeing last year to pay the second - largest amount ever in a health - care fraud case - $ 161 million - Caremark International Inc. plans to take a $ 110 million charge against earnings , on top of a write - off to cover its legal costs .
Tax law prevents companies from deducting criminal penalties , avoiding an incentive to commit criminal acts .
Loucks said Bard did not negotiate with the Justice Department over what portion of the settlement would be a civil penalty , and therefore tax - deductible .
But some companies try to .
``Part of the reason companies would rather do civil settlements is because they are deductible , '' he said .
Zero-tax accounting Some companies have gone beyond shielding profits from taxes .
By stretching or even breaking US accounting rules , they pay no tax at all .
Their goal is to shift profits out of the country into low - tax nations like Bermuda , Ireland or Honk Kong .
Their tool is the accounting ledger , and critics of the tax code say it is effective .
International Business Machines Corp. , for example , paid virtually no tax in 1987 , despite $ 25 billion in US sales .
Sen .
Kennedy says IBM shifted an undue amount of its worldwide research costs onto its US operation .
That raised its American expenses , he says , and lowered its profits .
IBM says its accounting practices are legal , but will not comment further .
Similarly , Nissan Motor Corp. of Japan overcharged its US subsidiary for cars , the IRS charged several years ago , lowering its US profits and tax bill .
Nissan agreed to pay the IRS $ 160 million , one of several settlements with the agency the automaker signed between 1987 and 1993 .
Both US and foreign companies cut their taxes by profit shifting , but many lawmakers and tax analysts believe the practice is particularly widespread among foreign companies .
More than 70 percent of foreign firms paid no tax each year between 1987 and 1991 , the IRS reports , compared to about 60 percent of US companies .
Clearly , some paid no tax because they did not make a profit , but many lawmakers believe others are illegally shifting profits overseas .
Estimates on the tax revenue loss range from $ 10 billion to $ 40 billion a year .
Treasury officials say the figure will decrease over time because of tighter regulations created under the Clinton administration .
Will the new rules raise the $ 45 billion that Clinton said he would draw from foreign companies over four years ?
`` It would be nice to say , ` Here 's what 's going to happen , ' but I do n't think anyone in the trenches can reliably say that , '' said Samuels , the former Treasury tax policy chief .
One group of lawmakers says the transfer - pricing system must be scrapped .
In its place , they propose a formula similar to what the states use now to determine what portion of a company 's profits can be taxed .
The formula bases the tax on what portion of a company 's sales , property and personnel are in each state .
The Treasury Department , under pressure from Sen. Dorgan , is holding a conference this year to consider how such a formula might be created .
A $ 143 million jolt Every year , the US government spends $ 143 million to help generate electricity and run recreation programs for Tennessee and six neighboring states .
Now 63 years old , the Tennessee Valley Authority keeps the region 's electricity rates low .
By contrast , electric rates in Massachusetts are high .
And that is a key reason Lexington - based Raytheon Co. last year threatened to take 15,000 jobs out of state unless it won $ 40 million in tax and electric rate relief .
Had it left , Raytheon 's likely new home would have been in Tennessee .
In other words , says US Rep. Martin T. Meehan , a Lowell Democrat , Washington collected tax dollars from Massachusetts , then sent them to Tennessee , effectively helping to lure Massachusetts jobs .
Now , Fidelity Investments of Boston and the mutual fund industry , as well as life insurance companies , are demanding similar tax relief .
Increasingly , other states find themselves being forced to offer tax breaks to businesses that threaten to leave town .
`` This is one of the most egregious forms of corporate welfare , because the company essentially holds the state up to ransom , '' Labor Secretary Reich says .
`` It 's bad , because it 's a zero -sum game .
No new jobs are created .
...
From the national standpoint , this is money that is subsidizing companies with no net benefit whatsoever . ''
Furthermore , tax breaks do n't always save jobs .
Raytheon this year is trying to buy out 4,400 workers whose jobs the tax relief intended to save .
In 1993 , Digital Equipment Corp. angered Boston officials when it closed its Roxbury factory and laid off 190 workers after taking $ 7 million from the city in financing , tax cuts and other subsidies .
Now , some are calling for the federal government to step in .
Last year , Massachusetts delegates to an annual small business conference at the White House urged the president to ban the use of federal money in interstate bidding wars .
Congress could tax businesses on the value of the incentives they receive from states , or it could deny federal funding to states that get into bidding wars .
It also could bar states from using federal grant money or government - backed loans in incentive packages .
Massachusetts at times has used federal dollars to lure businesses .
Springfield , for example , this year beat out sites in six other states to be the home of a new customer service center for First Notice Systems of Medford , which could employ as many as 900 people .
As an incentive , the city offered federal funds to train company workers .
It also borrowed money from the federal government and used the cash , in essence , to give First Notice a low - interest loan for building renovations .
Corporate darlings
Businesses like tax breaks because , unlike spending programs and direct subsidies , they are outside the federal budget and therefore not subject to annual review by Congress .
Between 1913 and the major tax overhaul of 1986 , Congress killed only 13 of the scores of tax breaks on the books , according to Congress ' watchdog agency , the General Accounting Office .
Moreover , they sometimes go to already prosperous industries .
The oil and energy industry gets $ 2.4 billion in tax breaks each year , while $ 1.4 billion goes to timber and natural resources companies , and billions more go to insurance , agriculture , real estate and other concerns .
Tax benefits are sometimes applied in unforseen ways .
A credit meant to boost research investment , for example , became the center of controversy recently as several defense companies sued the Internal Revenue Service for tax rebates on weapons programs that date to the early 1980s .
The IRS says the tax credits are not deserved , since the Pentagon paid for the weapons research and usually covers the costs even of failed weapons programs .
But the companies have won an early round in the courts , arguing that the Pentagon paid for the weapons , not the research that produced them .
The tax refunds could total billions of dollars .
Each tax break is a choice , favoring one group of taxpayers over another .
Export rules , for example , favor exporters over companies that sell in the US .
The ``runaway plant loophole '' favors companies that hire foreign workers over companies that strive for the ``Made in the USA '' label .
Most broadly , corporate tax breaks generally favor wealthy Americans over the less - well off .
Tax benefits are designed to help businesses create jobs , but when corporations win a tax break it is the owners of the company who gain most .
Last December , with Republicans and Democrats deadlocked over a plan to end a 21 - day shutdown of the federal government , 91 corporate chief executives signed a two - page newspaper advertisement that urged Congress to balance the budget .
`` Without a balanced budget , the party 's over .
No matter which party you 're in , '' the ad said .
Seven of the CEOs were from companies that take advantage of a major tax break for purchasing new equipment , which costs the US $ 26 billion a year .
Exxon saved $ 760 million because of the so - called accelerated depreciation rules , according to calculations by the Center for the Study of Responsive Law , a Washington - based Ralph Nader group .
Ford Motor Co. , Chrysler Corp. , DuPont and others that signed the ad saved hundreds of millions dollars more .
General Motors is a major recipient of federal technology grants .
Kodak claimed $ 37 million in export and manufacturing tax credits last year .
In 1994 , IBM paid no US taxes on $ 11 billion in profits it earned overseas , while the US Labor Department reported that 1,755 IBM jobs were moved abroad .
``How can you demand that the budget be balanced when you 're taking tax breaks like this ? '' asked Janice Shields , a former accounting professor now with the watchdog group .
`` These things save the companies from going into debt , but it 's causing the country to do that . ''
This story ran on page 1 of the Boston Globe on 07/08/96 .
Business ' clout keeps the government breaks coming By Aaron Zitner and Charles M. Sennott , Globe Staff , 07/09/96 WASHINGTON -
Two weeks after his party was swamped in the mid-term elections of 1994 , Robert B. Reich issued a simple dare .
You Republicans won control of Congress by attacking welfare , the US labor secretary asserted .
Why not cut " corporate welfare " and move business off the dole as well ?
But Reich 's own colleagues were uneasy with the challenge .
Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown quickly distanced themselves .
And President Clinton , while calling it an ``attractive idea , '' made it clear he had not endorsed cutbacks in benefits to business .
While Democratic party leaders cringed at Reich 's gambit and most Republicans dismissed it as liberal rhetoric , Reich got a warm phone call from a key GOP congressman : John R. Kasich of Ohio , chairman of the House Budget Committee .
The two men could not be more different - Reich , a classic liberal from Harvard University , and Kasich , the son of a mailman and a leading light in Speaker Newt Gingrich 's ``Republican revolution . '' `` You 're on to something , '' Kasich said , urging Reich to keep pushing the idea and promising to do his best to put corporate welfare on the Republican agenda as well .
It was a unique meeting of minds at opposite ends of the political spectrum to take on the labyrinth of subsidies and tax breaks for businesses that cost the government about $ 150 billion a year .
More lawmakers , buttressed by key Washington think tanks that provide the ideological underpinning for political action , later lined up against this underwriting of corporations .
But over the course of a year , the resolve to root out corporate welfare would dissipate .
First it would falter , and then it would sink amid parochial politics , big - money lobbying and a campaign finance system that together conspire to keep corporate welfare as constant as the tide .
By March of this year , after most of his subsidy cutbacks had been rejected in a brutal two - month budget negotiation , an exasperated Kasich said at a hearing : ``I think it is an absolute outrage that some of this crap is still in this budget , and it just infuriates me every day when I think about it . ''
By May , the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank which rode the crest of the bipartisan wave last year by challenging Congress to cut $ 85 billion in corporate welfare programs - declared the battle all but over in a report titled ``How Corporate Welfare Won . ''
The story of how Reich , Kasich and their allies lost the battle begins after the 1994 elections with both parties claiming they wanted to balance the federal budget .
It lingers into last winter , when snow blanketed Washington through December and January , and the government shut down twice over how to cut costs .
Within both parties , key figures like Reich , Kasich , Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts - even centrist Colin Powell - pointed again and again to corporate welfare .
They attacked the sugar and peanut price - support programs that raise food prices for consumers .
They attacked the Export Enhancement Program , which gives $ 800 million a year to giant agriculture firms to sell wheat and grains at a discount overseas .
While no two lists of targets were identical , nearly all cited the Market Promotion Program , which gives $ 100 million annually to Gallo , McDonald 's , Ocean Spray and other food companies for international advertising .
Moreover , the Republican plan for reining in Medicare and welfare gave lawmakers of both parties ammunition to argue that cutting corporate subsidies was only fair and moral .
For awhile , it seemed like deep cuts were inevitable .
But corporate welfare , it became clear , is not a partisan issue .
Rather , Republican is set against Republican , Democrat against Democrat when programs in a politician 's home state are threatened .
Not enough lawmakers were willing to vote against home - state businesses and jobs .
`` One person 's pork is another person 's prize , '' said Sen.
Fred Thompson , a Republican from Tennessee .
``No one wants to give up their prize if there is n't shared sacrifice . ''
An administration divided For Reich , the 50 - year - old longtime friend and economic adviser to Clinton , the corporate welfare fight began long before he joined the Cabinet .
As a lecturer at Harvard , he chastized policy makers for confusing aid to American workers with aid to American companies .
US firms were sending more jobs overseas , while foreign companies were creating jobs here .
`` Our primary concern should be the training and development of the American workforce , not the protection of the American - owned corporation , '' he wrote in 1990 .
Four years later , Reich replayed that theme with a twist .
Voters rebuked Clinton and the Democrats , he told an influential Democratic policy group just after the 1994 elections , because many Americans feared their paychecks were shrinking .
`` The middle class has become an anxious class , '' he said .
The solution : invest in jobs and training .
Give people the skills to move from welfare to work , as the Republican rhetoric argues .
Help them move from low - paying jobs to more lucrative ones .
How to pay for it ?
Cut corporate welfare .
Ask business , not just welfare recipients , to become more self - sufficient .
Reich 's theme struck a chord across the ideological spectrum .
Answering his challenge , the Cato Institute issued its report on the 125 corporate welfare subsidy programs worth $ 85 billion .
The Progressive Policy Institute , allied with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council , found $ 265 billion in savings over five years .
To the right , the Heritage Foundation came up with its own plan to eliminate , not just shave , unnecessary spending .
And to the left , the Ralph Nader group , Essential Information , identified 153 sources of subsidies as well as tax breaks costing $ 167 billion a year .
Vice President Al Gore weighed in with approval for Reich 's ideas .
But Treasury Secretary Bentsen , a Texan whose home - state oil and energy industries take millions of dollars each year in tax breaks , opposed cutbacks on business assistance .
And Robert E. Rubin , who replaced Bentsen in January 1995 , also was reluctant .
After fighting to shed the Democrats ' anti-business image , many in the party worried Reich would undo their work .
The gulf was between classic liberals and the more centrist , pro-business ``New Democrats . ''
Clinton initially wanted to make a strong statement on corporate welfare but backed away , an administration source said .
He eschewed the words ``corporate welfare '' in public , the source said , adding : `` He uses the phrase in private and Cabinet meetings , but the phrase is too combative for him . ''
Kasich , still boyish - looking at age 43 , was one of the populist upstarts who helped make Gingrich speaker of the House .
Now , with the Republican takeover of Congress , the six - term representative had been named chairman of the important Budget Committee .
It was no small task .
Kasich had to find $ 200 billion to pay for tax cuts in the ``Contract With America . ''
On top of that , he had to design a federal budget to eliminate the deficit by 2002 .
Corporate welfare seemed one place to start looking for money .
But there was little question Kasich was bound to clash with Ways and Means chairman Bill Archer .
As representative of a wealthy Texas district , Archer long had argued that tax breaks helped keep the nation and economy strong .
No tax break , he says , meets the definition of pork .
``Corporate welfare '' was not in Archer 's lexicon .
Kasich believed business subsidies and tax breaks were more than a source of savings .
If Republicans truly wanted to balance the budget , he argued , they had to do more than tap Medicaid , welfare and other social programs .
While some Democrats feared that attacking corporate welfare would hurt them politically , there were Republicans who worried that if business did not share the pain of budget cuts , voters would accuse them of unfairness .
Archer , on the other hand , argued that eliminating tax breaks amounted to a tax increase .
Supporting him were many Republicans who have backed big business , a longtime GOP constituency .
Republican showdown
The showdown came at a GOP retreat in May 1995 in Leesburg , Va .
It was the first time House Republicans saw Kasich 's plan to balance the budget .
Proposing ways to save money , Kasich said tax breaks for business ought to be cut or modified by $ 25 billion over seven years .
Kasich cited tax concessions to energy , timber and other interests that he said did not benefit the public .
Some were the very tax breaks Archer had championed .
Archer spoke against Kasich 's plan , and his argument that repealing such inducements would be , in effect , a tax increase for businesses was persuasive .
Two weeks later , when Kasich 's budget hit the House floor , corporate welfare savings were all but gone .
But that was not the end of the issue .
As Republicans moved further into details of how to balance the budget , it became harder to ignore the money that could be recouped from corporate tax breaks and subsidies .
Equally important was the GOP 's image .
Polls showed the public hated corporate welfare , said Frank Luntz , a Republican pollster .
They may even hate it more than social welfare , he said , adding : ``Republicans do n't want to appear to be in bed with big business . ''
In November , two Republicans brought the issue to the Senate .
McCain and Thompson proposed a ``dirty dozen '' list of programs to be eliminated .
From agriculture , they selected the Market Promotion Program .
From the defense budget , the B - 2 bomber and military export subsidies .
From transportation , they chose highway demonstration projects .
McCain and Thompson won support from conservative Republican Phil Gramm from Texas , along with Democrats Kennedy and John F. Kerry of Massachusetts , and Bill Bradley of New Jersey .
But they lost , 74 - 25 .
Voting to uphold the subsidies were such progressives as Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein , the California Democrats , whose state benefits from millions of dollars in subsidies to the Gallo and Wente Brothers wineries , Sunkist orange cooperative , almond growers and others .
As Republicans pushed for a balanced budget and limits on social service programs , the annual budget process continued long past its deadline .
By fall , the authority for most government agencies to spend money expired .
In November and December , the GOP and Clinton administration chose to let most of the government shut down because they could not agree on a budget .
Within the Democratic Party , meanwhile , debate continued over how much corporate welfare should be redirected to social programs and how much to deficit - cutting .
At times , Clinton professed great interest in corporate welfare .
On Dec. 16 , the first day of what would be a three - week government shutdown , he met with top advisers and Democratic congressional leaders at Blair House , the historic guest house steps from the White House .
Dressed in sweaters and clutching cups of hot coffee , they tried to develop a strategy to balance the budget .
Liberal standard - bearers , like Sen .
Kennedy , believed corporate welfare was the place to start .
He argued for a plan to save $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion by eliminating many tax breaks .
He gave them names like the ``runaway plant loophole , '' which he said encourages companies to send US jobs overseas , and the ``billionaires ' loophole , '' which allows people to renounce US citizenship as a tax ploy .
Clinton was interested .
At the end of the session , he buttonholed Kennedy and asked him to send details to the White House , a source at the meeting said .
But the next afternoon , as administration and congressional leaders met at the Capitol without the president , it was clear the White House had backtracked .
When Kennedy again argued to close tax breaks , aides to Secretary Rubin and Laura Tyson , the president 's chief economic adviser , were working the room , talking privately with lawmakers .
`` They were arguing , ` Do n't touch corporate welfare , ''' recalled one person who was there .
At one point Lawrence Summers , Rubin 's deputy secretary for tax policy , leaned over the table and argued against Kennedy 's plan to cut the ``runaway plant loophole , '' the ``title passage loophole ' ' that allows companies to shift profits overseas and a third tax break for exports .
Summers said those provisions helped the leading employers in their states .
According to several people at the meeting , Sen .
Boxer responded : `` We 've got to raise revenue and this is the way to do it .
If we can't abolish them , then we should at least change them or alter them . ''
Summers answered : ``Barbara , do you have any idea how Silicon Valley will react to this ? ''
In an interview , Kennedy accused Rubin and Tyson of intentionally obscuring the corporate welfare debate to make sure nothing gets done .
`` They do n't want to do it because they basically are a spokesman for many of these industries , '' he said .
``I would like Bob Rubin to tell me the best ones to cut .
I would like him to tell me , and tell the president , how to do it .
But he is representing a different kind of constituency .
He knows it .
I know it .
The president sort of knows it .
So that makes it a political issue . ''
In time , the Democrats did nudge Clinton .
After starting with a proposal last December to end $ 28 billion worth of tax breaks for businesses , the president later increased the number to $ 62 billion for the 1997 budget , which begins in October .
But the budget was equally noteworthy for what it allowed to survive including : sugar and peanut subsidies , tax breaks for the ethanol industry and the Advanced Technology program , which grants money to companies for research and development .
`` If the Congress ' performance was a disappointment , the Clinton administration 's was dismal , '' Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel of the Cato Institute wrote in May .
`` With few exceptions , the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress . ''
The sugar industry , which gave $ 5.5 million to federal campaigns in the last seven years , managed to kill a bipartisan attack on price supports mounted by Reps.
Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , and Dan Miller , a Republican from Florida .
And Congress , bowing to the wine industry , actually increased funding for the Market Promotion Program , which supports overseas advertising .
Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Illinois beat back an attempt to kill a tax break for ethanol , an alcohol - based fuel .
ADM controls about 80 percent of the ethanol market .
Killing the subsidy would save $ 3.6 billion over five years .
According to Common Cause , the government watchdog group , ADM gave more than $ 480,000 to the Democratic Party and more than $ 345,000 to the Republican Party in the 1994 elections , on top of donations to individual candidates .
The company and the family of its chairman have given more than $ 250,000 to former Sen .
Bob Dole 's campaign committees over the years .
ADM chairman Dwayne O. Andreas has raised money for Clinton as well .
Even Kennedy , who criticizes the subsidies to sugar and peanut farmers or federal support of giant power companies in the Southwest , speaks quite differently when it comes to programs that help high - tech companies in Massachusetts .
Virtually all of these so - called ``high - tech handout '' programs - the Advanced Technology Program , the Technology Reinvestment Project and the Small Business Innovative Research program - have been in the cross hairs of conservatives , especially Kasich and the Cato Institute .
`` These programs , are modest in size in comparison to the others , '' Kennedy said .
The campaign connection Overall , Robert J. Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute calculates Congress was ready to cut $ 300 billion from social programs like Head Start and welfare , but only $ 30 billion in corporate welfare .
Those cuts would have become law had Clinton not vetoed the Republicans ' budget for 1996 and general spending plans through 2002 .
Instead , the president and Republican leaders fought for so many months over the budget that corporate welfare cuts and other long - term spending decisions were put off until later this year .
``Each of these cuts is a knockdown , drag - out fight , '' Reich said in a recent interview .
`` Why ?
Because the issue of corporate welfare is intimately tied to campaign finance .
Why do we have so many targeted subsidies and tax breaks with no public justification or the thinnest justification ?
It 's because companies and industries have managed to effectively lobby for their little piece of public largesse .
Why have they been so effective ?
Because they support campaigns . ''
In short , many argue , Congress cannot cut subsidies and raise campaign funds at the same time .
And changes to the campaign finance system do not appear to be coming soon .
The Senate killed a campaign spending reform plan pushed , among others , by senators McCain and Thompson , who also targeted the ``dirty dozen '' corporate subsidies .
Recently McCain , Thompson , Kerry , Bradley , Kennedy and others have been pushing a new approach on corporate welfare : a bipartisan commission that would draw up a list of subsidy programs to cut .
After approval by the president , Congress would vote on the list - all or nothing .
The idea is patterned after the commission that chose what military bases to close , another politically sensitive problem that called for shared sacrifice .
`` I do n't know any other way that we can attack this issue , '' McCain said this year at a hearing on the proposal .
An independent commission ``would depoliticize the process , guarantee that the pain is shared , and might be the only realistic means of achieving a meaningful reform , which the public and our dire fiscal circumstances demand . ''
Picketers at the Port of Oakland prevent the unloading of goods from an Israeli ship on 20 June 2010 .
( Bill Hackwell )
ILWU
On 6 July , a group representing the Israeli consulate and Stand With Us attempted to pressure the ILWU Local 10 into withdrawing its protest of Israel ’s 31 May attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and its condemnation of the Gaza siege and wall in the West Bank .
The groups had asked to address the ILWU Local 10 ’s Executive Board at their regular meeting .
However , the local union members were not easily persuaded , and denied permission for the Israeli delegation to attend their meeting , according to a press release issued by Labor for Palestine ( US ) ( “ Oakland dockers stand firm as Israeli Consul seeks an audience , ” 7 July 2010 ) .
The local ’s rejection of the meeting follows a request sent by the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions ( PGFTU ) to the ILWU Local 10 Executive board , praising the union ’s historic action at the Port of Oakland on 20 June .
The Palestinian trade union leaders also expressed deep concern that the Israeli consulate would command a meeting with the union in an attempt to coerce members out of their political stance on Palestinian human rights .
“ Although we do not live in the United States , we find it highly unusual and somewhat uncustomary that a paid foreign representative of a racist and apartheid regime can demand and get a meeting with the executive board of a local union no less than the ILWU , ” stated the PGFTU .
“ We humbly ask of you to hold steadfast in the face of backlash and revenge against your union .
The call for a meeting with your union by a foreign paid emissary is intervening in the domestic affairs of local community grassroots action in the United States .
Israel , an apartheid state , maintaining an illegal war against our people , should not be given the platform at your union house .
That platform should be reserved for heroes who champion justice and equality for all .
Please ask Mr. Tor to end his government ’s criminal actions and answer for the 40,000 people Israel killed during the multiple invasions and occupations of Lebanon , the massacres of Deir Yassin , Qibya , Sabra and Shatila , Jenin and Gaza .
Like the Turkish nationals [ killed on 31 May ] , the fallen have names , lives and families and worked in the most destitute of conditions .
Our mission , like yours , is to bring dignity to our working people . ”

Abstract Background
The etiology of autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) is largely determined by different genetic factors of variable impact .
This genetic heterogeneity could be a factor to explain the clinical heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorders .
Here , a first attempt is made to assess whether genetically more homogeneous ASD groups are associated with decreased phenotypic heterogeneity with respect to their autistic symptom profile .
Methodology
The autistic phenotypes of ASD subjects with 22q11 deletion syndrome ( 22q11DS ) and ASD subjects with Klinefelter Syndrome ( KS ) were statistically compared to the symptom profile of a large ( genetically ) heterogeneous ASD sample .
Autism diagnostic interview - revised ( ADI - R ) variables were entered in different statistical analyses to assess differences in symptom homogeneity and the feasibility of discrimination of group - specific ASD - symptom profiles .
Principal Findings
The results showed substantially higher symptom homogeneity in both the genetic disorder ASD groups in comparison to the heterogeneous ASD sample .
In addition , a robust discrimination between 22q11 - ASD and KS - ASD and idiopathic ASD phenotypes was feasible on the basis of a reduced number of autistic scales and symptoms .
The lack of overlap in discriminating subscales and symptoms between KS - ASD and 22q11DS - ASD suggests that their autistic symptom profiles cluster around different points in the total diagnostic space of profiles present in the general ASD population .
Conclusion
The findings of the current study indicate that the clinical heterogeneity of ASDs may be reduced when subgroups based on a specific genotype are extracted from the idiopathic ASD population .
The current strategy involving the widely used ADI - R offers a relatively straightforward possibility for assessing genotype - phenotype ASD relationships .
Reverse phenotype strategies are becoming more feasible , given the accumulating evidence for the existence of genetic variants of large effect in a substantial proportion of the ASD population .

Introduction Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) delineate a group of behaviorally - defined disorders including autism , PDD - NOS , and Asperger syndrome .
Many efforts are being made to address the clinical heterogeneity of ASDs .
At the same time , the diversity of genetic findings in the past decade indicate that ASDs should also be considered genetically heterogeneous [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
This raises the question to what extent the clinical heterogeneity can be explained by the underlying genetic heterogeneity of ASDs .
In this study we will address this issue through the assessment of the homogeneity of the ASD phenotype in genetically more homogenous samples .
In addition to the growing number of genetic ASD susceptibility loci with small effect sizes , recent studies have described new “ causative ” genetic variants in ASDs that are assumed to have a large impact on ASDs [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
They are thought account for about 10 – 20 % of ASD cases [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
These risk variants are likely to show incomplete penetrance and imperfect segregation with disease as most variants have also been observed in non-autistic controls [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Furthermore , several ASD variants have been shown to cause brain disorders other than ASD , including schizophrenia , mental retardation and epilepsy [ 1 ] , [ 6 ] .
This combination of incomplete penetrance and pleiotropic phenotypes could indicate that these loci cause a global disruption in brain development , making it more vulnerable to develop a range of different brain disorders .
Efforts are required to distinguish distinct aspects of those brain disorders that are caused by these genetic variants with large effect , versus aspects that result from various other ( environmental and / or genetic ) hits .
A logical starting point would be to assess whether at all , ASD cases ascertained for a particular genetic variant display distinct autistic characteristics .
This model can be considered probable when cases carrying the same genetic variant are found to share particular ( combinations of ) symptoms in higher frequencies than most cases in the idiopathic ASD population .
The probability of genetic ASD subphenotypes can be illustrated by Rett syndrome ( RTT ) .
A more homogeneous profile of autistic symptoms together with non-autistic symptoms has led to the description of the RTT genetic subphenotype that is formally classified in the DSM - IV - TR as an ASD subtype .
RTT is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in girls during early childhood [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Mutations in MECP2 gene are found in more than 95 % of classic RTT cases [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
Patients with RTT appear to develop normally up to 6 – 18 months of age .
Deceleration of head growth is often the presenting symptom .
This is often accompanied by general growth retardation , weight loss , and a weak posture and ataxia [ 7 ] .
Social withdrawal and loss of language become apparent at early age .
Most patients progressively develop stereotypic hand wringing or washing movements .
Other frequent autistic features include expressionless face , hypersensitivity to sound , lack of eye - to - eye contact and unresponsiveness to social cues [ 8 ] .
This illustrates that both specific autistic and non-autistic features characterize RTT .
Importantly , the RTT autistic features are also present among the general population of autistic individuals though probably in a much lower frequency .
The modest recurrence of most identified large risk variants so far precludes the inclusion of adequate carrier numbers to evaluate the specificity of the autistic subphenotype per variant .
Each of these variants on its own represents only a small proportion ( at most 1 – 2 % ) of the ASD population [ 4 ] , [ 11 ] .
Genetic disorders such as RTT that are frequently associated with ASD have associated features such as congenital malformations or somatic disorders that enhance the chance of clinical detection .
Therefore , a focus on ASD subjects ascertained for particular a well defined genetic disorder enables the inclusion of larger numbers .
Importantly , similar to the newly discovered genetic variants of large effects , most genetic disorders are associated with ASD only in a fraction of affected subjects , thus the defining variants in these disorders also display incomplete penetrance .
This warrants a focus on subsets of individuals with a particular genetic disorder that are diagnosed with ASD which could possibly precipitate the impact of a particular variant on autistic symptomatology [ 1 ] .
As a proof of concept we studied the ASD phenotype of ASD subjects with 22q11 deletion syndrome ( 22q11DS ) and Klinefelter syndrome ( KS , 47 XXY ) .
22q11DS and KS subjects without an ASD classification were excluded .
22q11DS and KS are relatively frequent disorders affecting 1 –2,000 – 4,000 and 1–700 respectively [ 12 ] – [ 14 ] .
Both are clinically defined genetic disorders like RTT and increased rates of ASD have been described in both 22q11DS and KS subjects [ 15 ] – [ 17 ] .
The presence of both disorders has also previously been described among populations of subjects with ASD [ 18 ] – [ 20 ] .
The structure of the ASD phenotype associated with 22q11DS and KS was compared to a large a large genetically heterogeneous sample of ASD subjects in different statistical analyses involving standard autistic measurements .
The analyses aimed to assess differences in symptom homogeneity and the feasibility of differentiation of group - specific ASD - symptom profiles .
Discussion
Our results indicate that the clinical heterogeneity of ASDs might be reduced when subgroups based on a specific genotype are extracted from the overall genetically heterogeneous ASD population .
A substantially lower autistic symptom variance was shown in both the 22q11DS - ASD and KS - ASD samples in comparison to the heterogeneous ASD sample .
Further analysis revealed that the symptom profiles of the two studied genetic ASD disorders could be robustly discriminated from the heterogeneous ASD profiles through a limited number of autistic subscales and symptoms .
In our opinion , these results support the notion of the existence of genetic subphenotypes within the ASD population .
The lack of overlap in the discriminating ADI - R labels and items between KS - ASD and 22q11DS - ASD could indicate that both syndromes represent ASD profiles that cluster around different specific points in the total ASD diagnostic space , which was also suggested by the results of the three - group analysis .
It should be emphasized that genetic disorder ASD subphenotypes are expected to overlap with profiles present among heterogeneous samples , as all are diagnosed according to the same DSM - IV - TR / ADI -R criteria .
The premise of an overlap of ASD subphenotypes between carriers and non-carriers of large impact variants raises interesting questions .
It could be speculated that autistic symptom profiles out of the heterogeneous ASD population that overlap with symptom profiles related to specific genotypes can possibly point to convergent etiologies .
Several limitations should be addressed .
The data were gathered from different studies , however , all studies were performed by the authors of this paper , and the diagnostic instruments were identical between the studies .
The 22q11DS - ASD and KS - ASD subjects were not selected form an original ASD sample , but derived from psychiatric surveys among children with 22q11DS and KS samples .
It would have been preferable if all subjects had been recruited in the same way .
However , this would require unfeasibly large ASD samples to extract a sufficient number of 22q11 - DS and KS - ASD cases .
Although the ASD subjects with 22q11DS and KS and the heterogeneous ASD subjects fulfilled the same DSM - IV - TR clinical and ADI - R criteria , the average clinical threshold for suspecting ASD could have been different in the heterogeneous sample .
Therefore , ascertainment bias cannot be ruled out .
However , we did not aim to validate the association of 22q11DS and KS with ASD but rather investigated whether specific genotypes can confer specific autistic symptom profiles .
We do realize that reliability for the ADI - R is typically at the level of overall diagnosis , or subdomain area and that the ADI - R was not originally designed as a dimensional measure .
Nonetheless we found the largest contrast between the different groups at the level of individual symptom items , while the DA involving ADI - R label subscales also delivered better results than expected by chance .
The sample sizes in this study preclude conclusions towards the nature of the discrimination symptoms .
Similar assessments in other larger ASD cohorts are required to prove whether the current approach is feasible for “ reversed phenotype ” efforts .
Additional measures such as the Social Responsiveness Scale or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) can possibly aid to enhance specificity of phenotype descriptions [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
The current findings could suggest that the KS and 22q11 DS genotypes do not seem to merely augment heterogenic and complex genetic susceptibility , i.e. lower the ASD threshold in an aspecific way .
Rather , our results could suggest that the strong influence of a specific genetic variant leads to an ASD subphenotype that is relatively specific with an increased within - group symptom homogeneity in comparison to the heterogeneous ASD population .
Based upon these observations we hypothesize that the increased symptom homogeneity is mainly driven by the effect of one ( or limited ) genetic pathway (s ) .
In contrast , the phenotype observed in the general ASD population is most likely mediated by the interplay of various combinations of all culprit causative genetic pathways , and therefore associated with larger ASD symptom heterogeneity .
This consideration was emphasized in recent overview of advancements in genetic studies of complex traits :
“ For a substantial number of common diseases the newly identified pathways suggest that molecular subphenotypes may exist ; that is , although a number of different pathways might potentially be involved in the development of a particular disease when all cases are considered , in any individual with the disease only one or a subset of these pathways might be involved ” [ 23 ] .
Other ASD subphenotypes related to newly identified genetic variants ( e.g. 1q21 duplication or deletion , the 22q13.3 deletion and the duplication of the 15q11 –13 region ) may be identified when properly studied .
This could ultimately lead to a dissection of the ASD phenotype into a proportion of “ genetic subtypes ” , and a remaining group of ASD patients in whom the ASD phenotype is the resultant of a more complex interaction between common genetic variants and environmental factors .
In conclusion , the current findings support the possibility that reduced genetic heterogeneity can be associated with reduced ASD symptom heterogeneity .
The method of the current study using symptom variance and discrimination analysis involving the widely used ADI - R offers a relatively straightforward possibility for assessing genotype -ASD relationships .
The assessments aim to initiate further reverse phenotype strategies , especially given the accumulating evidence for the existence of genetic variants of large effect in a substantial proportion of the ASD population .
Methods Participants
The Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects had approved the research protocol .
Patient associations and centers for clinical genetics , and pediatrics were involved in recruiting the children for the original psychiatric surveys out of which the subjects for the present study were selected ( see below ) .
A newsletter presented on the web or in writing , had informed parents and children of the aim and methods of the study .
Parents and children of had to apply actively for participation in the study by contacting the research team .
Subsequently they were sent written information about the selection criteria and the implications of participation in the study .
They were invited for assessment if they met the inclusion criteria .
Written informed consent was obtained from participants ( if older than 12 years of age ) and their parents or guardians according to the declaration of Helsinki .
22q11 DS or KS subjects were selected for this study if they had been diagnosed with an ASD via previous surveys on general psychopathology on children with 22q11DS ( n = 90 ) and Klinefelter Syndrome ( KS ) sample ( n = 51 ) , all 47 , XXY none higher aneuploidies , no mosaics ) .
( See [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] for more extensive details on recruitment and further characteristics of the patient samples ) .
This survey had resulted in an ASD classification in 14 of the 51 KS boys ( 14/51 = 27 % ) and 39 of the 90 22q11 DS children ( 39/90 = 43 % ) .
The classification of an autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) was made on the basis of DSM - IV - TR standardized interviews and the Autism Diagnostic Interview ( ADI - R ) [ 24 ] .
Videotapes of all subjects and the DSM - IV - TR / ADI -R outcomes were discussed in a consensus meeting headed by the head of the department .
The consensus meeting served to control for procedural mistakes and to verify whether the classifications through the DSM - IV - TR and ADI -R interviews were in agreement with the clinical judgment .
All 22q11DS and KS subjects with an ASD met ADI -R thresholds and DSM - IV - TR criteria .
A genetically heterogeneous ASD sample was recruited as part of a genetic study of autism and from a clinical sample of patients referred to the department of child and adolescent psychiatry for diagnostic reasons .
Thus , these subjects were unascertained for their genotype and should therefore represent a reference sample of maximal genetic heterogeneity .
Inclusion criteria were : age four years or older , no severe medical or neurological illness , IQ > 40 .
The final sample consisted of 372 verbal subjects .
Study participants ranged in age from 4 to 20 years .
Similar to the ASD cases obtained from the 22q11 and XXYDS cohorts , all subjects out of the heterogeneous ASD sample had been evaluated in consensus meetings to confirm ASD diagnosis through the interviews and all subjects met ADI -R thresholds .
IQ had been assessed by means of the Dutch versions of the Wechsler scales ( WPSSI WISC III and WAIS ) [ 25 ] – [ 27 ] in the KS and 22q11 DS sample and in a significant part of the ASD heterogeneous group ( 65 % ) .
IQ scores of the heterogeneous ASD sample that could not be assessed with the Wechsler scales have been assessed with the RAVEN Progressive Matrices [ 28 ] the Mullen Scales of Early Learning [ 29 ] or the Snijders - Oomen non-verbal intelligence test - Revised [ 30 ] .
No difference in intelligence level between those with and those without ASDs had been found in both the 22q11DS and KS samples in the original psychiatric surveys ( see [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] ) .
Measurements ADI -R subscale and symptom variables were entered in the statistical analyses for phenotype comparisons .
The ADI–R is an established ‘ gold standard ’ in diagnostic / phenotypic evaluations of autism .
It is an extensive clinical interview administered to the parents .
The interview focuses on the three core or so called “ content ” domains of autism ( i.e. qualitative abnormalities in social interaction ( S ) , qualitative abnormalities in communication ( C ) and stereotyped and repetitive behaviors ( R ) [ 24 ] .
ADI - R items are coded for these domains and also for an “ age of onset ” domain .
A classification of an autism spectrum disorder is applied when scores in all domains are met or when scores are met in two core domains and meet criteria on the “ age of onset ” domain , but are one point away from meeting autism criteria in the remaining core domain .
Reliability of the ADI - R in a population with mild to moderate mental retardation has been established [ 31 ] .
The ADI - R may also be used to assess profiles of autistic symptomatology [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
The ADI–R algorithm is composed of 37 symptom “ items ” .
These items were originally selected as a minimum for optimal ASD classification [ 24 ] .
ADI - R labels consist of 2 to 5 items and are directly related to the DSM - IV - TR criteria of an Autistic Disorder .
As a result , 12 ADI - R labels are used .
Each ADI -R domain consists of 4 labels , eg S1 - 4 , C1 - 4 and R1 - 4 .
Items are coded as 0 ( ASD behavioural symptom specified not present ) , 1 ( specified behaviour not sufficient to code “ 2 ” ) or 2 ( specified ASD symptom present ) .
Maximum label scores thus range from 4 –10 .
An overview of the description of the ADI - R items , labels and the ADI -R domains of the algorithm is provided in Tables S1 and S2 .
Statistical analyses Symptom homogeneity was operationalized as the ( inverse of the ) mean number of ADI - R algorithm items within each ASD group on which the subjects scored clearly in the autistic range , i.e. ADI - R item score =
2 . Thus , per subject , the number of items with score = 2 were counted .
A lower number of ADI - R items that reached the autism criterion can be considered indicative of a relative reduction in symptom heterogeneity .
Differences between groups in number of ADI - R items on which the autism criterion was reached were analyzed by means of a univariate analysis of variance , with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons .
Discriminant analyses ( DA ) were performed to determine whether the genetic disorder ASD subsamples could be differentiated from the heterogeneous ASD sample on the basis of ADI -R variables .
The analyses addressed the question to what extent ADI -R label and / or ADI - R symptom item profiles could successfully discriminate 22q11DS or KS ASD profiles from the heterogeneous ASD sample profile ( i.e. , 22q11DS+ASD vs. heterogeneous ASD , and KS + ASD vs. heterogeneous ASD ) .
In addition , three group DAs were performed to explore the separation of the three groups by means of 2 discriminant functions .
For all discriminant analyses , stepwise Wilks ' lambda was used , with probability of F for entry and removal of variables set at 0.5 and 0.10 respectively .
For classification the within - group covariance matrices were used and prior probability was set to equal for all groups .

ADI -R items extracted in the 4 additional DAs , sorted by correspondence / item number .
To verify whether the stepwise analysis of the three groups DA did provide stable solution , the stepwise DA to separate the three groups has been repeated another four times , with half of the sample of subjects with heterogeneous ASD .
Thereto the sample was divided in four quarters , called Q1 to Q4 .
The DA has been performed with inclusion of the heterogeneous subsamples Q1+Q2 , Q3+Q4 , Q1+Q3 , and Q2 + Q4 .
The ‘ solutions ’ are compared with each other and with the result of the DA presented in the paper that included the total sample of subjects with heterogeneous ASD .
The comparison is focused on the number and type of items that are extracted .
Table S6 shows that the solutions are highly similar .
The number of items extracted varies between 10 and 15 .
There are 8 items that appear in each DA , there is 1 items that appears in 3 DAs , there are 7 items that appear in 2 DAs , there is 1 item appearing in only one DA .
Comparing the four solutions with the results of the original DA presented in the paper shows that all of the 12 items extracted in this DA , all show up in one or more one of the other DAs .
Eight items of the original DA show up in all other analyses , the other four items of the original DA appear in at least two of the other DAs .

Barack Obama described the Srebrenica massacre as " a stain on our collective conscience " as hundreds of victims of the 1995 atrocity were buried .
In a statement read for him in the Bosnian town , the US president admitted the failure of the international community to protect the enclave , and said those responsible must be pursued .
More than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb troops .
The massacre was the worst atrocity in Europe since the Second World War .
Hundreds of victims of the massacre were buried at a ceremony outside the town on Sunday .

In pictures : Srebrenica burials UK will seek Srebrenica ' justice '
The 775 coffins with the remains of newly identified victims from mass graves were laid to rest at the Potocari cemetery near Srebrenica .
European leaders and the presidents of all former Yugoslav republics who had gathered for the ceremony heard Mr Obama 's words that " there can be no lasting peace without justice " .
Mr Obama urged " the prosecution and arrest of those that carried out the genocide " , and added : " This includes Ratko Mladic who presided over the killings and remains at large . "
Serbian President Boris Tadic attended the ceremony , in what was seen as a significant gesture .
For years Belgrade denied the scale of the slaughter , but in March Serbia 's parliament passed a landmark resolution apologising for the massacre .
It said Belgrade should have done more to prevent the tragedy .
Mr Tadic repeated his government 's vow to track down the fugitive general .
Speaking on Sunday , he said : " As the president of Serbia I will not give up the search for remaining culprits , and by this I first of all mean for Ratko Mladic . "
The former Bosnian Serb general has been in hiding for almost 15 years and is believed to be in Serbia .
Segregated town
He has been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) for genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the grimmest episode in the break - up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
Srebrenica had been declared a UN safe zone , to which thousands of Bosnian Muslims ( Bosniaks ) had fled during the 1992 - 95 Bosnian war .
But the Bosnian Serb army easily overran the lightly - armed Dutch force there in July 1995 .
The massacre is the only episode of the conflict to have been deemed a genocide by the UN tribunal .
Thousands of people attended the ceremony at the Potocari cemetery - the biggest Srebrenica funeral so far .
New rows have been made for the burial of 775 victims , who will join nearly 4,000 already there .
Mourners mingled among the coffins , looking for the names of loved ones .
Bosnian Security Minister Sadik Ahmetovic told the crowd the international community should help bring fugitive Bosnian Serb wartime military commander Radko Mladic - " the man who brought us our suffering " - to justice .
Speaking at the commemoration , Bosnian Grand Mufti Mustafa Ceric called on European politicians to bring about the Bosnian Muslims ' desire to have a " state in Europe that will protect us from the next genocide " .
" Civilisation does not begin with the burial of a Bosniak .
Civilisation begins with a birth of a Bosniak [ not ] afraid of the next genocide . "

Hasan and Suhra Mahic , both in their 80s , were finally burying their sons Fuad and Suad .
" I would have preferred that all of us have been killed together , then we would not have had to live through this , " Hasan told the AFP news agency .
Ramiza Gurdic was burying her son Mehrudin , alongside her husband and another son already in the cemetery .
" How can you forget , how can you forgive ?

But many Serbs in the region reject the established narrative of July 1995 , the BBC's Mark Lowen in Srebrenica reports .
" The Serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " Mladen Grujicic , who works for a local association helping the families of Serb victims of the war , told the BBC .
" No Serbs contest that a crime happened in Srebrenica , but they 're insulted when the numbers are manipulated , " Mr Grujicic says , adding that Serb victims of the war have been forgotten .
Despite attempts to lay the past to rest , Srebrenica remains segregated 15 years after the tragic events , our correspondent says .
UK Prime Minister David Cameron said the atrocity was " a crime that shamed Europe " .
Dozens of nationalist protesters have confronted movie - goers in Tokyo amid anger about a documentary which chronicles the slaughter of dolphins in a western Japanese village .
A handful of Tokyo cinemas are screening the Oscar - winning documentary The Cove , which includes graphic footage of dolphins being herded into shallow water near the village of Taiji .
Some of the mammals are kept alive to be handed over to aquariums , while the rest are harpooned .
Many theatre operators decided not to screen the film amid the threat of protests from right - wing demonstrators , who accuse the filmmakers of being " anti-Japanese " and of poisoning Japanese minds .
But not everyone bowed to the threats .
Some have decided to confront a subject few in Japan know anything about .
" The killing and eating of dolphins is happening in this country , " movie - goer Tetsushi Matsuoka said .
" But most Japanese do n't know much about it .
This is why I 've come to see this film . "
While some like Mr Matsuoka came to see The Cove , others had come to stop movie - goers from watching it .
Several dozen nationalists waved banners and screamed through loudspeakers outside a theatre in the Tokyo district of Shibuya .
They were angry at what they saw as the latest example of Japan - bashing .
At one stage scuffles broke out and police moved in to keep protesters and movie - goers apart .
Holding a sign reading " Stop Racial Discrimination Against Japanese " demonstrator Nobuo Kikuchi took a shot at what he said was Australian hypocrisy .
" Australia kills 3 million kangaroos a year , but no - one does anything about that , " he said .
" What I want to know is why the Japanese have become a target ?
That needs to be debated internationally . "
But to others in Japan , the protesters are about stifling debate rather than promoting it .
" The very act of exerting this sort of pressure is intimidation , " movie - goer Masaki Iwaji said .
" This infringes on people 's freedom of expression .
It does n't matter what 's in the film . "
Whether it is a movie about a dolphin hunt or international criticism about Tokyo's so - called scientific whaling program , many protesters believe Japan is being assailed by the West and pressured to abandon what they see as their country 's traditions .
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell has confronted BNP leader Nick Griffin , calling him a " gutless coward " .
Mr. Griffin was emerging from BBC studios at Westminster when Mr. Tatchell approached him and asked him to apologise for what he called the BNP 's long history of anti-semitism , homophobia and anti-islamic views .
Two of Mr. Griffin 's entourage then grabbed and pushed Mr. Tatchell as the BNP leader left the building .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday expanded benefits for same - sex partners of federal employees , a move likely to be welcomed by gay rights activists who have questioned his commitment to their causes .
Obama said he had directed government agencies to offer a number of new benefits to the families of gay and lesbian federal employees , including family assistance services , hardship transfers and relocation expenses .
His directive builds on a move he made last year to offer healthcare benefits , sick leave and medical evacuation for same - sex partners of federal employees .
Obama said in a statement that while his directive was an “ important step on the path to equality , ” existing federal law prevented him from taking further action to provide same - sex domestic partners with the same benefits offered to heterosexual married couples .
He called on Congress to swiftly pass a measure that would address that discrepancy .
Gay rights activists , who were big supporters of Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign , have criticized him for not moving fast enough to repeal the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy that prevents gay men and women from serving openly in the military .
The " City - in - a - Box " and just - in - time private urbanism

Weatherhaven was founded , historian Robert Kronenburg explains in his book
The founders recognized the need for a dedicated approach to the provision of temporary shelter in remote places and developed a strategy to provide a complete service including design , manufacture , packaging , transportation , and erection of buildings , all of which would be created specifically to respond to the logistical problems of remote deployment in harsh environments .
For Weatherhaven , this includes the production of whole " Geological Survey Camps " and " mining villages , " among many other examples , almost all of which are capable of being rapidly deployed and air - delivered by crate .
It is Flatpak City : pop open the box and go .

" The first stage of the operation , " Kronenburg writes , referring to a specific example of their cities - on - demand , " was to establish a Weatherhaven crew shelter so that a construction team could prepare a temporary landing site for heavier aircraft . "
From that initial seed , a whole civilization - by - airfield could be grown — an instant city from the sky .

While writing a brief post for the CCA today about 19th - century " portable buildings " and their unexpected role in facilitating the European colonial project , I stumbled on the " portable camps " of Canadian shelter firm Weatherhaven Weatherhaven was founded , historian Robert Kronenburg explains in his book Portable Architecture , " in 1981 by the merging of two separate businesses , an expedition organizing team and a Vancouver - based construction company .
" For Weatherhaven , this includes the production of whole " Geological Survey Camps " and " mining villages , " among many other examples , almost all of which are capable of being rapidly deployed and air - delivered by crate .
It is Flatpak City : pop open the box and go .
" The first stage of the operation , " Kronenburg writes , referring to a specific example of their cities - on - demand , " was to establish a Weatherhaven crew shelter so that a construction team could prepare a temporary landing site for heavier aircraft . "
From that initial seed , a whole civilization - by - airfield could be grown — an instant city from the sky .
" A single crate was flown in by light aircraft and the building was assembled and in use within four hours .
"
The buildings themselves are neither architecturally nor materially interesting , Kronenburg adds , but they " are remarkable for their organizational and logistical approach .

Offloading a few of Sun's Project Blackbox units , seen above , in order to construct a privately chartered city - in - a - box , based around a remote airfield somewhere in the Canadian Arctic , is something as likely to be seen in a Roger Moore - era James Bond film as it is in the corporate spreadsheets of a firm like Rio Tinto ; but I 'm left dwelling on the question of where these sorts of settlements belong in architectural history .

But if architects have more to learn from the international warehousing strategies of Bechtel than they do from the Farnsworth House or the software packages of Patrik Schumacher , then what role might firms like Weatherhaven prove to have played in transforming how we understand the built environment ?
Put another way , should the COO of Weatherhaven be invited to contribute to 's next " Manifesto " issue ?
If so , what might architects and urban planners learn ?

NORMAN — Cleveland County prisoners wear jail - issue uniforms of hot pink shirts and yellow - and - white striped pants , which some say make them look more like clowns than criminals .
Sheriff 's officials say the outfits were chosen for security reasons .
" We want our inmates to be identifiable .
If one of them slips over the wall , we want to know about it right away , ” Undersheriff Rhett Burnett said .
Burnett said the county switched to the colorful new uniforms about 16 months ago .
The old orange uniforms were too similar to outfits anyone could buy at a uniform store and wear on the street , he said .
Attorney Fred Shaeffer said he thinks the outfits were selected to embarrass the people who wear them .
" There 's no doubt in my mind that the intent was to humiliate them .
" A lot of innocent people get arrested and go through that jail , and everyone is supposed to be presumed innocent until they are found guilty .
It 's bad enough to be arrested , but to then be humiliated by having to wear a costume like that is wrong , ” he said .
The fact that they 're garish is what Sheriff Joe Lester likes about them , Burnett said .
" He wanted something identifiable that could n't be duplicated , ” the undersheriff said .
Medical " scrub ” uniforms are similar to the orange outfits inmates used to wear , Burnett said .
" It 's become popular to wear those green or blue medical uniforms , and you can also buy similar orange ones .
Particularly , in Norman , orange is a popular color because it's one of Norman High School 's colors , ” Burnett said .
The uniforms were not selected to humiliate anyone , Burnett said .
" They 're pretty awful , but then the whole experience of getting arrested is pretty awful , ” said Connie Albritton of Big Red Bail Bonds .
Attorney Dave Stockwell said he does n't mind the outfits .
" Hey , you 're in jail .
That 's humiliating in itself .
And from what I 've been told , there were a couple of false sightings of prisoners on the street when we had the old uniforms .
With these , you better be wearing handcuffs if you 're walking down the street dressed like that , ” Stockwell said .
Welcome to part two of our feature looking at the saints and sinners of the MMA world .
In part 1 we looked at the heroic deeds of some of the sports good guys , so now it ’s time to shine the spotlight on some of mixed martial arts most notorious villains , and rest assured there ’s plenty of them .
MMA Villains :
Harold Howard :
Harold Howard can lay claim to being one of the UFC ’s first ever participants , competing all the way back at UFC 3 in September of 1994 .
Despite a 46 second KO victory in his first fight Howard proved not to be a breakout star for the promotion and retired from the sport two years later with a record of 2 - 3 .
Over a decade Howard ’s fifteen minutes of fame were long gone , and he has now making a living as a roofer while running a small self defense school in Niagra Falls .
In an interview with sherdog.com in February of 2009 he joked that his daughter was , “ studying to be a psychologist , so she can figure [ out ] what her father ’s problems are . ”
Whatever those problems were , they came to a head on the evening of December 22nd that year .
Staying at his sisters house in the Niagara Falls area Howard suddenly snapped and attacked his nephew with the claw end of a hammer , striking him multiple times .
When his sister tried to intervene Howard attacked her too .
Leaving them bloodied and beaten Howard then drove to his wife ’s house , attacking her car and unsuccessfully trying to force his way into the house .
Shouting , “ you ruined my life ! ” he then left in his pick - up truck where he then became engaged in a high - speed pursuit with the police .
The chase ended abruptly when Howard crashed his truck through the front doors of the Niagara FallsView Casino and was subsequently arrested .
At a subsequent trail in early 2010 Howard plead guilty to charges of aggravated assault , assault causing bodily harm , dangerous driving , failing to remain at the scene of an accident , mischief and breach of court order .
He was sentenced to five years in jail .

Joe Son
Howard is not the only early UFC fighter to have been in trouble with the law however .
Joe Son made his one and only octagon appearance at UFC 4 in December of 1994 , and it was a fight he ’d no doubt rather forget .
Fighting Keith Hackney , the 5ft 4 ″ Son had the misfortune of being caught in a choke submission while simultaneously being punched in the family jewels , which understandably forced him to tap .
Though Son ’s MMA career ended with a record of 0 - 4 , he went on to land the role of ‘ Random Task ’ , a parody of James Bond villain ‘ Oddjob ’ , in the original Austin Powers movie .
His fame was short - lived but years later he would hit the headlines around the world for all the wrong reasons as the seedy details of his own real - life criminal past emerged .
In October of 2008 Son was arrested in California for vandalism .
It was a seemingly innocuous charge , but remarkably after providing a DNA sample he was then linked to a gang rape dating back to nearly 20 years before .
A shocking story then emerged of how Son and another man had forced a woman into the back of a car at gunpoint on Christmas Eve of 1990 before raping , sodomizing and orally penetrating her multiple times while threatening to kill her .
Amongst well over a dozen charges was one accusing him of , “ sexual penetration by foreign object by force ” .
The foreign object was a gun .
Son was charged and if proven guilty faced the prospect of a 275 year sentence for his crimes .
The last that was heard from him he was still in jail with a $ 1 million bail .
Additionally some MMA fans now like to think that Keith Hackney was doing God ’s work when he punched Son in the balls back at UFC 3 .

Charles ‘ Krazy Horse ’ Bennett
Charles Bennett has been competing in MMA competition for over a decade , compiling a record of 23 - 17 - 2 along the way and fighting for promotions like PRIDE , EliteXC and King Of The Cage .
Never has a nickname been as apt as Bennett ’s ‘ Crazy Horse ’ moniker , both in and out of the ring .
Throughout his career he ’s been well known for his mischievous and often entertaining antics during fights .
Whether it ’s acting up for the camera , making fun of his opponents , sitting on top of the ropes while the bouts in progress or doing backflips off of the cage after winning , Bennett often appears more like a one man circus act than an MMA fighter .
Crazy Horse ’s wild ways have often got him into trouble outside of the cage however as evidenced by a criminal record as long as your arm .
In 2000 Bennett was convicted of dealing crack cocaine in Florida .
It ’s just one in the region of 30 charges leveled against him over the years in the state for an assortment of crimes ranging from grand theft , burglary and multiple drug charges to battery upon a pregnant woman , kidnapping and tampering with a witness .
The latest of Bennett ’s ever expanding list of indiscretions occurred in January of 2010 when he got into a dispute with another member of the gym he was training at , Tyler East .
After an argument Crazy Horse left the building only to return minutes later wielding a metal pipe which he used to attack East ’s knees , elbows and ribs .
Bennett has since been charged with aggravated battery and assault with a deadly weapon .

Viacheslav Datsik
If you look up ‘ criminally insane ’ in the dictionary you may well find a picture of Viacheslav Datsik , arguably the most unhinged man to ever compete in the sport .
The Russian fighter put together a woeful MMA record of 4 - 9 between 1999 - 2003 , though he does have a claim to fame in that he knocked out future UFC heavyweight champion Andrei Alrovski in his first fight .
Datsik once stated that he , “ wanted to fight and die in the ring , ” and he certainly did his best to live up to that wish .
His bizarre antics in the cage included opting to use only headbutts in one fight , repeatedly stamping on the groin of another opponent and refusing to stop , attacking a referee during a bout at a charity event , letting his opponents take free punches at him , and using wild , unorthadox techniques like flying somersault kicks that invariably failed to reach their intended target .
Datsik ’s out of control behavior extended beyond just the cage however .
In 2006 he was arrested for committing a series of armed robberies at mobile phone shops in and around St. Petersburg over a six month period , stealing in the region of 5 million rubles ( Aprox $ 164,000 ) .
He later admitted to specifically targeting “ non Russian ” shop owners during his crime spree .
Apparently the erratic behavior that had made him something of a cult figure on the MMA scene was n’t just for show as the Russian justice system eventually ruled Datsik mentally unaccountable for his actions and committed him to a closed psychiatric ward where it ’s believed he remains to this day .

Aleksander Emelianenko
Another Russian fighter Aleksander Emelianenko is perhaps best known as being the younger brother of MMA superstar Fedor Emelianenko , but he does hold a solid 17 - 3 record of his own fighting for PRIDE and M - 1 amongst other promotions .
It ’s hard to avoid mentioning his criminal past given that his body is covered in tattoos that refer to his time spent in a Russian jail .
The full details of the crime remain a mystery but it is known that Emelianenko was sentenced to five years for armed robbery as a juvenile .
This is depicted by two tattoos on his body , one being a pirate ( criminal code for armed robbery ) and the other being a cathedral with five domes on his shoulder , each representing a year in jail .
The extent of Aleksander ’s crimes beyond this are unclear , though his brother Fedor said in a 2008 interview that there were , “ many episodes ” and that “ prison really made its imprint .
His outlook on life has changed , and it seems , not in a good way . ”
Rumors persist that he has links to the Russian criminal underworld , perhaps fueled by the fact that he had two stars on his shoulders which is widely recognized in Russia to indicate a career criminal .
It should however be noted that he has now covered over those tattoos .
There are also question marks over a spiders web tattoo on his shoulder which is the only one the fighter has not explained the meaning of publicly .
In Russia such a tattoo often depicts a drug addiction , though it can have other meanings .
Rumors have also arisen in recent years that Aleksander has Hepatitis B , buth he denies that is the case .

War Machine
In 2008 TUF season 6 and UFC competitor Jon Koppenhaver legally changed his name to War Machine , but the warning signs that he was a volatile character were apparent long before that .
His parents divorced when he was just eight and five years later he witnessed the death of his father due to a heart attack .
Moving back in with his mum caused further problems given that she and his step - dad were drug addicts .
Later a spell in The Citadel military school ended prematurely when he was expelled due to poor behavior .
As the years passed he started to get in trouble on a more regular basis .
In 2007 he was found guilty of felony assault after getting involved in a fight outside a Las Vegas club in which he choked a man unconscious and left him with multiple facial fractures .
He was lucky to be spared a prison sentence but he failed to turn over a new leaf .
In February of 2009 he was arrested fighting security guards at a Las Vegas club he was working in part - time as a waiter .
Later that year he announced that he was to work in the porn industry .
It was to be a short - lived venture however as weeks later in November of ’09 he was alleged to have assaulted his porn star girlfriend Alanah Rae at an industry party , and then attacked as many as half a dozen other party - goers including his agent .
In February of 2010 in a bar in San Diego War Machine became agitated and swept multiple bottles and glasses off the bar , injuring a nearby female bartender , before shoving the owner as he left .
A month later he found himself in trouble at another bar , getting into a brawl that spilled out into a neighboring car park .
During the fight War Machine fought with several men including a security guard who described him as , “ beyond aggressive … crazy almost ” .
War Machine ’s out - of - control behavior had finally caught up with him .
He was arrested for the two incidents and after CCTV evidence was shown he was sent to jail for a year for two counts of felony assault while under probation .
His sentence began earlier this month .

Jeremy Jackson
During his MMA career Jeremy Jackson compiled a record of 10 - 5 .
He had two brief spells in the UFC , most notably appearing in The Ultimate Fighter Season 4 .
He did n’t last long on the show however after being ejected for breaking the rules by leaving the TUF house to see a woman he had met earlier the same day .
Like fellow TUF competitor Jon Koppenhaver , Jackson had a troubled past , and was believed to have attempted to commit suicide three times during his youth .
In later years he turned to alcohol after the death of his brother which only made matters worse , and by the time he was due to appear on the TUF show he was essentially homeless and had resorted to sleeping in his car .
After being thrown off the show Jackson was given a second chance by the UFC and appeared on the season finale , but lost and was subsequently cut from the promotion in November of 2006 .
Still battling his demons , little was heard from him after that until May of 2008 when Jackson suddenly hit the headlines after being charged with raping a woman .
A string of charges were made against Jackson , including forcible rape , kidnapping , burglary , assault with a firearm , dissuading a witness by threat of force , criminal threats and sexual assault .
Since he was arrested Jackson has remained in Ventura County jail on $ 1 million bail .
His hearing is expected to take place on August 24th , 2010 .

Ryan Gracie
The Gracie family is famous for their fighting skills inside the cage , but Ryan Gracie , the ‘ bad boy ’ of the clan , will be best remembered for his exploits outside of the cage .
In October 2000 a rivalry with fellow fighter Wallid Ismail boiled over at a club in Sao Paulo .
The two had clashed on two separate occasions the year before , including once at a local gym where Gracie had allegedly threatened him with a gun .
On this occasion however Gracie was drunk at a fashion show after - party when the two spotted each other .
Gracie jumped Ismail from behind , but the fight ended with Gracie being choked unconscious .
In February of 2001 Gracie was involved in an altercation at a party in Rio which saw him beat up a man and stab another .
At the time it was reported that he was in jail accused of attempted murder but he was later released .
Four years later he found himself in hospital after accidentally shooting himself in the leg .
According to his father he was close to death due to a loss of blood , but after a blood transfusion he made a full recovery .
On December 14th , 2007 Gracie ’s years of living on the edge finally took their toll .
Fueled by a mixture of alcohol , marijuana and cocaine he left his house and soon car - jacked a Toyota Corolla which he then crashed into a concrete barrier .
Gracie , who was armed with a kitchen knife then fled the scene and attempted to steal a moped , threatening to kill the courier riding it .
As he prepared to make his getaway other couriers surrounded and attacked him , ultimately leading to Gracie being arrested and taken to jail .
There was more drama to come though as the next morning Gracie was found dead in his jail cell .
An autopsy later revealed that the combination of illegal drugs together with medication he was given by doctors after being detained to calm him down had formed a lethal cocktail which took his life .

Justin Levens
Justin Leven ’s MMA career started promisingly , going 7 - 0 in regional promotions during 2004 - 2005 .
By 2006 he had fought his way into the UFC , but left just months later after back - to - back defeats .
He rebounded with two wins , but In 2007 his career hit rock bottom , going 0 - 5 during that period .
According to friends of the fighter Levens struggled to cope with the downward spiral in his career and concerns over his future prospects having been a fighter all his life .
The cracks started to show in 2008 when Levens , now 28 , was suspended from competing for six months after testing positive for pain killers .
Further warning signs emerged in December of that year police were called twice to the home the fighter shared with his wife , including once for a suspected drug overdose .
On the 17th of December Leven ’s mother - in - law became suspicious after not hearing from her daughter for the best part of a week .
Upon entered their home she discovered Leven ’s and his wife shot dead in their bedroom in what police would describe as a murder - suicide .
An autopsy later revealed that the two had died days earlier with Leven ’s wife having been shot in the heart and Levens in the head .
The gun was found lying next to the fighter , and various pain killers and anti-depressants were discovered at their residence .

Jarrod Wyatt :
The horrific nature of Jarrod Wyatt crime has ensured that he has quickly become one of MMA ’s most notorious criminals in the mainstream media .
It should be stressed however that his link to the sport is tenuous given that he has just one fight on his record , a win in January of 2010 at a local show in Oregon .
On March 21st of this year a small group of friends including Wyatt drank hallucinogenic mushroom tea after returning home from a night out .
Soon afterwards
Wyatt began acting particularly strangely at which point one of his friends Justin Davis decided to leave .
Returning hours later Davis was confronted with a scene straight out of a horror movie .
In the living room Wyatt stood naked and blood - soaked over the body of his friend Taylor Powell .
Fleeing the scene Davis phoned the police who returned to discover a grizzly scene .
It ’s believed a fight had broken out in the kitchen after Wyatt became convinced 21 year - old Powell was the devil .
Though the details are hazy it ’s known that Powell was severely beaten before having an 18 - inch hole cut in his chest .
Wyatt removed Powell ’s tongue and pulled out Powell ’s still beating heart and threw it into the fire .
He is also believed to have cooked several of his organs on a wooden stove .
By the time police arrived most of the victim ’s face had also been removed .
Speaking to the police at the time Wyatt told them , “ Satan was in that dude , ” and asked them if they , “ were God , or if we were God coming to save him . ”
Wyatt has since been charged with first degree murder , aggravated mayhem and also torture given that Powell was believed to be alive until his heart was removed .

Lee Murray
No discussion on MMA ’s most notorious villains could be complete without the now infamous tale of UK fighter Lee Murray ’s life of crime .
A respected middleweight fighter with an 8 - 2 - 1 ( 1nc ) record , including a win over Jorge Rivera in his one and only appearance in the UFC , Murray gained notoriety for his love of fighting outside of the confines of a cage .
Amongst his most infamous street fighting incidents is one with Tito Ortiz in the alleyway of a London nightclub after the UFC ’s first ever UK event in July of 2002 .
According to Matt Hughes who was present , Murray knocked Ortiz out with a flurry of punches , sending him face first into the concrete followed up by several stomps to his head .
Several years later in September of 2005 another fight outside a nightclub in London almost cost Murray his life .
After becoming involved in an altercation with several other men Murray was stabbed in the head and the heart .
His surgeon later reported that Murray died on the operating table three times that night .
Remarkably he was resuscitated and made a full recovery .
Murray later revealed that he had also been in hospital the week before after being stabbed twice outside the same club .
Murray had become a cult figure in MMA circles for his street - fighting stories but what happened next would make him infamous around the globe .
On the 21st of February , 2006 a Securitas depot in London , England was robbed with what police described as “ military precision by a gang of professional robbers . ”
The thief ’s made off with over 50 million pounds ( $ 90 million ) , making it the largest ever cash robbery in UK history .
Three months later Lee Murray was arrested in Morocco where he had suddenly began enjoying a lavish lifestyle including buying an expensive villa , sports cars , hard drugs and plastic surgery for his girlfriends .
It soon emerged that Murray was believed to be the mastermind behind the robbery .
Murray would spend four years in jail waiting for his trial before finally being convicted of the crime in Morocco and handed a ten year sentence in June of 2010 .
His story has been widely reported around the world on TV and in print , while a movie about his life and role in the heist is currently being planned .

Want to know what happens to your clothes after you give them to the dry cleaner ?
Do they actually stay dry ?
When you wash clothes at home in the washing machine , water is the solvent used to do the cleaning .
Many types of fabric , however , do not handle water very well .
For example , wool and water just do n't mix .
There are also many types of stains that water is not particularly good at removing .
In dry cleaning , a petroleum solvent is used instead of water .
It is " dry " only in the sense that it is not wet with water .
In the early days of dry cleaning , this solvent was often kerosene or gasoline .
Today the industry uses a solvent called perchloroethylene almost universally .
Advertisement
Advertisement
The clothes are washed in this solvent , and then the solvent is recovered in an extractor so it can be reused ( and so that it does not evaporate into the air and cause pollution ) .
Once the clothes are cleaned , they are pressed so they look like new .
There is a fair amount of controversy around perchloroethylene and its health effects at the moment .
Several of the links on the next page talk about the problems it can create .
Some dry cleaners are now using CO2 .
One depressing aspect of the economic crisis is that public outrage has been channeled into symbolic displays of populist outrage against CEOs rather than into intelligent public action to prevent the recurrence of disasters .
The response to the Deepwater Horizon spill fits the pattern .
The outrage du jour is that BP CEO Tony Hayward has taken a break from overseeing efforts to contain an oil spill to take in a yacht race .
I fail to understand the controversy .
Does anybody assert that Hayward needs to be working seven days a week , every week ?
I doubt his role is actually so indispensable .
So then is the outrage that , in his free time , he is indulging in the sort of activity available only to very wealthy men ?
I also fail to see how the crisis should force Hayward to pretend not to be rich .
Nobody really wants to make the case that Hayward can never relax , or that he can't spend his own money as he sees fit when he does relax .
So instead the " controversy " is that it creates an appearance of a controversy .
It 's a fully postmodern scandal .
Here is every portion of the AP story on Hayward 's yachting that comes close to explaining why this is a problem :
BP chief executive Tony Hayward , often criticized for being tone - deaf to U.S. concerns about the worst oil spill in American history , took time off Saturday to attend a glitzy yacht race off England 's Isle of Wight .
...
That is likely to be a hard sell in Gulf states struggling to deal with the up to 120 million gallons of oil that have escaped from a blown - out undersea well .
...
British environmental groups immediately slammed Hayward 's outing .
Charlie Kronick of Greenpeace said Hayward was " rubbing salt into the wounds " of Gulf residents whose livelihoods have been wrecked by the disaster .
" Clearly it is incredibly insulting for him to be sailing in the Isle of Wight , " he said .
Hugh Walding , the coordinator of the Isle of Wight Friends of the Earth , said Hayward 's choice of venue was sure to arouse anger .
" I 'm sure that this will be seen as yet another public relations disaster , " Walding said .
All these phrases -- tone deaf , hard sell , public relations disaster -- are fundamentally a dodge .
Nobody can make the case that Hayward has done anything wrong here , so instead they make the case that other people will believe that Hayward has done something wrong .
Kevin Gray , a priest at Sacred Heart Church in Waterbury , Connecticut , is expected to turn himself in after being charged with siphoning $ 1.3 million from church coffers to pay for his secret gay lifestyle .
After a lengthy investigation , the authorities have charged Gray with first - degree larceny , which could carry a 20 - year sentence if he 's eventually convicted .
Apparently for the past seven years Gray has been spending church money to fund trips to New York and pay for sessions with male escorts , and he also racked up $ 200,000 in restaurant bills including a large tab at Tavern on the Green .
No word on how much he spent on tickets to Madonna concerts , rare vintage copies of Playbill , body glitter , and vodka sodas on Fire Island .
But while it 's a terrible thing he 's been bilking money from his congregation ( and also lied and told his congregation that he had cancer ) , at least there 's one priest behind bars who is n't in trouble for touching his parishioners .
Child ’s play ( Image : Balkanpix.com / Rex Features )
BUILDING artificial tissue could become child ’s play , if Lego - like blocks made of human cells can be assembled into working organs .
So far the blocks have been used to build a variety of living 3D shapes that have never before been created on a cell - by - cell basis , such as tubes and solid spheres .
The hope is that the bricks will be used to construct artificial tissues for human implantation .
Javier Fernandez and Ali Khademhosseini at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built the “ human Lego ” by dipping cells cultured from liver tumours into a polymer called …
If the tests of the 91 banks are credible , they would separate the minority of sick banks from the healthy majority .
Banks would be more willing to lend to each other .
And the solid banks could sell bonds to raise money that they could in turn lend to businesses and consumers , promoting economic growth .
“ Without a solid financial sector , I do n’t think we will have any kind of sustainable recovery , ” said Diego Iscaro , senior economist in London at IHS Global Insight , a market research firm .
“ If we do n’t have full transparency , it ’s going to be an opportunity missed . ”
Analysts say that some banks should fail the stress tests , though they disagree on how many .
In a study issued Tuesday , the Japanese bank Nomura said 16 European banks were likely to need more capital in order to be adequately insulated against economic and market shocks .
The weaker institutions included several Greek and Italian banks , as well as Deutsche Postbank .
A Nomura analyst , Jon Peace , cautioned that the banks ’ criteria might not be the same as those being used by regulators and so they did not predict the results of the official stress tests .
A study by Credit Suisse found that all but two Greek banks would have enough capital .
Credit Suisse and Nomura looked only at publicly traded banks in detail , not at public - sector institutions like the German landesbanks or Spain ’s savings banks , known as cajas — both of which are considered vulnerable by many analysts .
Europe ’s public - sector banks could require € 90 billion in additional capital , Credit Suisse estimated .
The cajas spearheaded lending to the Spanish construction sector , and suffered when it collapsed .
In many cases , the cajas have not been able to respond effectively , because they have been held hostage to the interests of the politicians who control them .
Many of the landesbanks , which have close links to state governments , invested in derivatives tied to the U.S. real estate market or other toxic assets .
Talk about the value and importance of local , sustainable food sources has been rampant the past couple years .
Movies have been filmed , books have been written and immeasurable oxygen has been sucked from the atmosphere in discussing the subject .
But Bruce Edwards , director of the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma 's Urban Harvest program , is doing more than talking ; he 's putting it into practice to feed the hungry and activate the community into not taking the practices of our ancestors for granted .
" The food bank looks at it this way :
If people can help themselves and be able to grow their own food , they 're more sustainable , they wo n't depend upon the system , and they will have less need for the services that we provide , ” Edwards said .
Urban Harvest provides free seeds , plants , education and other assistance for more than 40 community gardens across the state .
" The food dollar is n't stretching as far as it used to , ” Edwards said .
" There 's also a new awakening of people wanting more nutritious food , knowing where their food comes from . ”
The program began about a decade ago and has grown into a working ecosystem where you 'll find an orchard , vegetables , hoop house , compost heaps , organic fertilizer and even a fish farm .
" Our tilapia tank holds up to 800 , ” Edwards said .
" That 's not enough to be a major source for a restaurant , but it shows what can be accomplished .
" The majority of tilapia we eat are imported from China .
If I can raise this many tilapia here , imagine what a farmer could do . ”
And if Oklahoma farmers can raise enough tilapia to keep local restaurants and markets supplied , then our reliance on imported fish is eliminated .
Less importing means money stays within the Oklahoma economy and a smaller carbon footprint .
" We saved about $ 14,000 last year through the Urban Harvest program , ” Edwards said .
" The Food Bank estimates that for every dollar raised ( or saved ) , we feed seven people .
You do the math . ”
So , raising fresh and delicious produce made 98,000 meals .
Not bad .
Compost is created onsite from food waste .
Workers open expired canned goods and spoiled foods and mix them with straw , wood chips and dry leaves .
Empty cans are pressed and recycled .
A tilapia tank is part of an aquaponic system in which the fish provide primary nutrients to feed plants growing in the system .
The fish grow and mature to about a pound and a half and are suitable to eat in about 10 months .
The waste produced by the tilapia funnels into a long , rectangular tank topped with bottomless cups .
Seedlings go into the cups to feed on the tilapia - enriched water to develop their roots before being transplanted into the earth .
The water , meanwhile , filters back into the tilapia tank from which it came .
Across the walk is a three - tiered tank , the bottom acting as sort of an incubator for newborn tilapia .
The water circulates into various other water - and soil - based growing beds , helping the fruit or vegetable of the season get a healthy start .
" We supply microgreens to a lot of the chefs around town , ” Edwards said .
During my visit , I was able to sample fresh young strawberries , arugula and sorrel , among other things .
The strawberries were plump , though still a little tart as it's a tad early in the season .
I 've always been a fan of arugula , but after sampling the arugula right off the plant — which can be done because no chemical pesticides are used — my confidence was shaken .
This arugula had a deep , rich flavor .
Suddenly , I understood why Peter Cottontail was so willing to put his neck on the line in Mr. McGregor 's garden .
Biting into the sorrel was like biting into a green apple carpaccio dressed with a splash of lemon .
In a hoop house toward the back of the lot , a single bunny named Harry Hopper has a single job : snack .
Nature takes its course from there , and Harry 's waste feeds into boxes of soil , where young earthworms await the manna .
The worms bask in the bunny waste , feeding and creating their own waste to pass to the soil where they reside .
The soil is fed into a device that divides the worms from the soil they 've enriched , which is just the stuff one needs to not only grow hearty fruits and vegetables but enrich the soil it joins .
The earthworms go back into the soil boxes to start the process over .
" We sell this soil for folks to use as a natural fertilizer , ” Edwards said .
" The worms create microbes that replenish the soil .
Chemical fertilizers feed the plants but not the soil .
If you do n't feed the soil , it more or less dies and wo n't sustain any growth . ”
Soil is n't all the program offers .
Organic gardening classes are held in the spring and offer help to anyone wanting to start a community garden .
Because it 's a nonprofit organization , The Urban Harvest needs support .
Most charities have had to resort to offering chances to win prizes to get folks to donate money or volunteer time .
The Urban Harvest offers something much more valuable : knowledge .
" There are people who do n't know how to plant a vegetable in the ground the way their grandparents did , and that to me is just sad , ” Edwards said .
An American soldier suspected of leaking video footage of a US Apache helicopter strike in Baghdad that killed two employees of the Reuters news agency has been charged , the military said on Tuesday .
Private First Class Bradley E. Manning , held in a military jail in Kuwait since last month in connection with the July 2007 attack , faces two charges of misconduct , said a statement released by the US army in Baghdad .
ADVERTISEMENT
The first charge , is for violating army regulations by “ transferring classified data onto his personal computer and adding unauthorised software to a classified computer system , ” the statement said .
WikiLeaks , a whistleblowing website , released in April the video that showed the Reuters employees being gunned down by the US army helicopter three years ago .
An article at Boing Boing adds ,
Earlier today , Boing Boing reported news that the U.S. has filed formal charges against Pfc. Bradley Manning , the 22 - year - old Army Intelligence Specialist who is believed to have leaked damning classified data to Wikileaks .
The “ charge sheet ” published on Boing Boing specified 8 federal criminal violations , including one identified as a violation of the Espionage Act .
I spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Eric Bloom of the U.S. Army ’s Public Affairs Office for more .
The Army wo n’t confirm that Manning leaked anything to Wikileaks , or that he obtained and transmitted “ 260,000 State department cables , ” the specific number widely reportedÃ¢â‚¬â€  but the Army charge sheet released today does say the 22 - year - old engaged in “ conduct being prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces , ” which threatened to “ bring discredit upon the armed forces . ”
Boing Boing / Xeni Jardin :
What are the maximum penalties in Manning ’s case , based on the charges filed today ?
Do any of these charges carry the possibility of capital punishment ?
U.S. Army / Ltc. Eric Bloom :
No , I do n’t think we ’re talking about the death penalty .
We have calculated the maximum possible number of years based on these charges to be 52 years .
RAW STORY reported last month , “ Manning reportedly told authorities that he ’d leaked reams of State Department communiques . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â the 22 - year - old Army specialist wrote of the cables , according to a story published at Wired.com .
Wikileaks responded to Manning ’s claim on Twitter , saying that reports that Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Regardless ,
Shenon says that US government officials believe Assange is in possession of at least some secret State Department cables .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It looks like theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re playing some sort of semantic games , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â one US official purportedly told Shenon .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ They may not have 260,000 cables , but theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve probably got enough cables to make trouble .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
It ’s unclear what US authorities could do to prevent the secretive Wikileaks founder from publishing classified US documents , since the website is based on servers in Sweden , a country that has traditionally looked favorably on whistleblower claims .

A temporary retaurant by London firm Carmody Groarke has opened on the roof of a construction site overlooking the 2012 Olympic Park .
The structure is made of scaffolding and boards borrowed from the construction site , covered in recyclable plastic sheeting .
Located on top of the 35 metre - high Westfield Stratford City development , the pavilion is called Studio East and houses Studio East Dining by Bistrotheque .
It remains in place until 4 July .
More information in our earlier story .
Photographs are by Luke Hayes .
Here 's some further information from the architects :
From 16 June 2010 , for a 3 week period , just 2000 guests will get to visit Carmody Groarke 's striking pop -up pavilion as it hosts Studio East Dining by Bistrotheque .
Built within a live construction site , 35 m atop Westfield Stratford City development , the pavilion provides the first views across London 's Olympic Stadium , and Zaha Hadid 's 2012 Aquatics Centre , forming a commanding presence on London 's skyline .
A fast build with a life span of just 3 weeks , the primary structure , weighing 70 tons , is constructed from hired materials borrowed from the existing construction site , including : 2000 scaffolding boards , 3500 scaffolding poles , and reclaimed timber , used to create the walls and floors of the 800 square metre dining space .
The cladding material which encases the roof , is a semi- translucent membrane , using industrial grade heat retractable polyethylene which is 100 % recycled after use ; as with the other materials , all will be returned to the site afterwards and recycled without any waste .
By night , the whole structure will glow , forming shadows and silhouettes of the events held within , creating a compelling jewel on London 's skyline at sunset .
" When Westfield approached us to do something on the roof of their still - being - built Stratford City development , we instinctively felt Carmody Groarke would be the obvious people to partner with , and that the structure should be built from everyday materials found around the site , be very design led and to match up to the stunning views , making it truly iconic .
This is the Rolls Royce of Pop - Ups . " Pablo Flack , Co-Owner , Bistrotheque

MAYBE STEVE KING SHOULD MEET MORE PEOPLE ….
Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) ran into a little trouble two weeks ago , effectively accusing President Obama of racism .
This week , King returned to the House floor to once again share some thoughts on race , in particular his outrage over the creation of an Office of Women and Minority Inclusion as part of the Wall Street reform initiative .
“ I ’ve stood up and defended equal opportunity , and my voting record in this Congress is more consistent with equal opportunity than anyone I know — certainly anyone on that side of the aisle , because they vote for preferences . [ … ]
“ Martin Luther King never asked for this .
I ’ve read almost every one of his speeches and many of his writings .
I can think of nothing in his writings and his speeches that I disagree with .
He stuck to American principles .
But this Congress under Pelosi leadership , this president , has not stuck to American principles . ”
First , if the ridiculous congressman could resist the urge to speak for Martin Luther King , I know I ’m not the only one who ’d appreciate it .
Second , for all of Steve King ’s boasts about standing up as a champion of “ equal opportunity , ” his record suggests otherwise .
As Matt Finkelstein explained , “ In 2006 , he opposed the renewal of the Voting Rights Act .
Last year , he voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and claimed gay marriage is a ‘ socialist concept . ’
More recently , he ’s advocated for Arizona ’s anti-immigration law by suggesting that police officers can identify illegal immigrants by their shoes and grooming . ”
And third , if King does n’t know anyone who cherishes equal opportunity more than he does , the GOP lawmaker really needs to get out more .
As Adam Serwer recently explained , “ This is , of course , the same Steve King who has defended the Confederate flag , advocated for racial profiling , referred to the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses as ‘ separatist groups , ’ and said that people in the Middle East would be ‘ dancing in the streets ’ if Obama was elected because of his middle name .
He was also the only — repeat — only congressman to vote against recognizing the contributions of slaves in building the U.S. Capitol , where King now spends his time spewing this kind of nonsense . ”
July 14 , 2010 – Dr. Anklesnap
Word on the street is that Kobe Bryant has set up a meeting with his former rival Raja Bell to try and persuade the veteran guard to join the LA Lakers for next season .
Even though Derek Fisher has just resigned with the Lakers , Kobe realizes that the Lakers do n’t have a lot of veteran depth in the backcourt and Bell would be a very valuable addition come playoff time .
A meeting between Bryant and Bell , two formerly bitter rivals , was reported Tuesday by ESPN.com , which cited an unnamed source close to the situation .
Bell is traveling to Los Angeles to attend the ESPYs and will meet with Bryant today .
The Lakers are over the salary cap for next season and have only $ 1.8 million of the mid-level exception remaining to offer to Bell after signing Steve Blake to a four - season , $ 16 million contract last week .
If he signs , Bell , 33 , would join Bryant , Fisher , Blake and Sasha Vujacic in a backcourt that would be far more experienced than the one that helped the Lakers win the past two NBA titles , a scary prospect for league rivals .
Bell ’s signing also would mean Shannon Brown has played his last game with the Lakers .
Brown opted out of the final year of his contract before the July 1 deadline and became an unrestricted free agent .

( CNN ) --
At least 230 people were killed and 190 injured when an oil tanker flipped over and exploded in the Democratic Republic of Congo , a government spokesman said Saturday .
While the spokesman , Mende Omalanga , said five of the dead were United Nations peacekeepers , an official with the U.N. mission in the capital of Kinshasa contradicted the report .
" No U.N. members were killed " in the explosion , said Madnodje Mounoubai .
The tanker flipped over Friday afternoon , said Omalanga , the country 's minister of communications .
It was attempting to overtake a bus in Sange , in South Kivu province , on the country 's eastern border .
When oil began to spill from the overturned tanker , local residents attempted to collect the oil .
One was smoking a cigarette , causing the tanker to explode , Omalanga said .
The largest group of victims had been sitting in a bar near the accident site watching the World Cup match between the Netherlands and Brazil , he said .
Some of the injured were being treated locally in surrounding villages , but most were sent to the nearby town of Uvira , Omalanga said .
The tanker is owned by a company called GINKI , and the driver managed to escape the fire , the U.N. mission said .
CNN 's Andreena Narayan , Kathryn Tancos and David McKenzie contributed to this report .
Two recent New York Times articles try mightily to elicit sympathy for borrowers whose bad financial decisions turned out badly .
" Your Money " columnist Ron Lieber asks us to feel the pain of Cortney Munna , a 26 - year - old NYU graduate who owes $ 100,000 for " an interdisciplinary degree in religious and women 's studies " that is not quite as lucrative as she expected .
Munna " makes $ 22 an hour working for a photographer " in San Francisco ( one of the most expensive cities in the country ) and dreads the thought of " slaving away to pay for an education I got for four years and would happily give back , " which she says " feels wrong to me . "
To his credit , Lieber assigns some responsibility for this state of affairs to Munna and her mother , who says :
All I could see was college , and a good college and how proud I was of her .
All we needed to do was get this education and get the good job .
This is the thing that eats away at me , the naïveté on my part .
But Lieber also wants to blame Citibank ( featured in a photo accompanying the column ) for " handing over $ 40,000 to an undergraduate who had already amassed debt well into the five figures . "
That may turn out to have been a bad business decision , but is it a bank 's job to tell a loan applicant what her priorities should be ?
Citibank made it possible for Munna to realize her dream of attending the college of her choice instead of various less expensive options , and Lieber is saying , in effect , that it should have told her to aim lower .
Likewise , he faults NYU 's financial aid office for not giving Munna better advice , which would have meant suggesting that she attend a different , cheaper school .
Not only is it unrealistic to expect a college to send away a student who is ready to pay full tuition , but at the time Munna and her mother probably would have resented the suggestion .
While Munna is paying the price for her financial folly , the borrowers featured in a story on the front page of Monday 's Times have decided that gradually paying off one 's debts is for suckers .
Alex Pemberton and Susan Reboyras are taking advantage of the long delay between foreclosure and eviction in Florida to live " rent free " in St. Petersburg while spending the money that would have gone toward their mortgage on steak dinners , casino trips , and excursions in their " gas- guzzling airboat . "
According to the Times , this couple represents a trend :
A growing number of the people whose homes are in foreclosure are refusing to slink away in shame .
They are fashioning a sort of homemade mortgage modification , one that brings their payments all the way down to zero .
They use the money they save to get back on their feet or just get by .
" Instead of the house dragging us down , it 's become a life raft , " says Pemberton .
" It 's really been a blessing . "
He and his wife rationalize defaulting on the debt by citing the mortgage company 's stupidity in lending them money ( emphasis added ) :
" We could pay the mortgage company way more than the house is worth and starve to death , " said Mr. Pemberton , 43 .
" Or we could pay ourselves so our business could sustain us and people who work for us over a long period of time .
It may sound very horrible , but it comes down to a self - preservation thing . "
They used the $ 1,837 a month that they were not paying their lender to publicize A Plus Restorations [ a business that restores pest - plagued attics ] , first with print ads , then local television .
Word apparently got around , because the business is recovering .
The couple owe $ 280,000 on the house , where they live with Ms. Reboyras 's two daughters , their two dogs and a very round pet raccoon named Roxanne .
The house is worth less than half that amount — which they say would be their starting point in future negotiations with their lender .
" If they took the house from us , that 's all they would end up getting for it anyway , " said Ms. Reboyras , 46 .
One reason the house is worth so much less than the debt is because of the real estate crash .
But the couple also refinanced at the height of the market , taking out cash to buy a truck they used as a contest prize for their hired animal trappers .
It was a stupid move by their lender , according to Mr. Pemberton .
" They went outside their own guidelines on debt to income , " he said .
" And when they did , they put themselves in jeopardy . "
That 's one way of looking at it .

Image caption Nigeria is a crude oil producer and exporter , but must import refined fuel
Nigeria 's state oil firm is insolvent , unable to pay debts of $ 5 bn ( £ 3.3bn ) , a government minister has said .
Junior Finance Minister Remi Babalola said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation had asked for help to cover its debts and fund its operations .
But the NNPC denied the claim and said the government was not paying its own debts to the firm .
The company controls more than half of oil assets in Nigeria - one of the world 's biggest exporters .
" NNPC is insolvent as current liabilities exceeded current assets by 754bn naira ( $ 5 bn ; £ 3.3 bn ) , " Mr Babalola said at a government finance meeting .
He said the NNPC owed about $ 3bn ( £ 2 bn ) to Nigeria 's Federation Account , which distributes oil money to varying levels of the country 's government .
Oil accounts for about 85 % of Nigeria 's government revenues .
Subsidised petrol
The NNPC rejected Mr Babalola 's claim and said it was able to meet its financial obligations .
" We can not be classified as insolvent when we have healthy cash flow and we can pay for our crude and product import obligations , " said NNPC spokesman Levi Ajuonuma .
NIGERIA'S CHEAP PETROL
Price capped at 65 naira ( $ 0.44 ; £ 0.29 ) a litre
Subsidy costs $ 4bn ( £ 2.6 bn ) a year
He said the Nigerian government owed the company more than $ 7bn ( £ 4.6 bn ) in subsidies " which if reimbursed would enable the NNPC to offset the ... debt being owed the Federation Account Allocation Committee " .
The NNPC is plagued by mismanagement and corruption , says the BBC's Caroline Duffield in Lagos .
Although Nigeria is a major crude oil producer , it must buy almost all the petroleum products it uses on the international market because its own refineries are insufficient and dilapidated .
The NNPC buys refined petrol at international prices and sells it on to local marketeers at a big discount because Nigerians see cheap petrol as their birthright , says our correspondent .
The cost of capping petrol prices at just 65 naira ( $ 0.44 ; £ 0.29 ) a litre is reportedly at least $ 4bn ( £ 2.6 bn ) a year .
Correspondents say the subsidy also fuels smuggling and corruption .
Previous attempts to increase petrol prices have led to massive strikes and a government U - turn .
In May , China agreed a $ 23 bn ( £ 15 bn ) deal to build four new oil refineries in Nigeria .
President Goodluck Jonathan has promised to tackle corruption in the oil industry .
He has sacked some officials from the NNPC and ordered an audit of the firm 's accounts .
There is also legislation currently before the parliament which would bring sweeping reforms to Nigeria 's oil and gas industry .
Very nice .
Was pleased to see this when I checked the site after awhile .
I got the genuine suede leather elbow patches and my wife thinks they are really neat .
Pattern is great and people who do n't know the series would think it 's just a very nice jacket .

A US investor with a history of picking market bubbles says it is a near certainty that Australia 's home prices will fall .
Jeremy Grantham created a stir last month by claiming there was a bubble in the Australian housing market which would inevitably fall , and reiterated his view overnight , while looking for more price falls in the US and UK .
'' Further … decline in house prices in the US is probably more than a 50 - 50 bet , and in the UK and Australia is nearly certain , '' said Mr Grantham , chief investment strategist of Boston - based fund manager GMO , in his quarterly note to investors .
Mr Grantham said economic growth in Australia , along with Canada , looked '' okay ' ' but both economies were propped up '' by raw materials and , so far , un - popped housing bubbles " .
Historical data on 34 housing bubbles compiled by GMO show that all but two returned to their earlier trend .
The two exceptions are Australia and the UK , where home prices are climbing again after falls around the time of the global financial crisis .
There was some other news Tuesday about climate and energy .
Some of it came from the scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration :
The combined global land and ocean surface temperature was the warmest on record for May , March - May ( Northern Hemisphere spring - Southern Hemisphere autumn ) , and the period January - May according to NOAA .
Worldwide average land surface temperature for May and March - May was the warmest on record while the global ocean surface temperatures for both May and March - May were second warmest on record , behind 1998 .
The monthly analysis from NOAA ’s National Climatic Data Center , which is based on records going back to 1880 , is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides government , business and community leaders so they can make informed decisions .
And there was this continuing graph from the scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center , showing the continuing collapse of Arctic sea ice , continuing an Arctic ice loss that scientists say " appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years . "
We can debate the politics , but the science is not debatable .
Perhaps the politics would be less debatable if we paid more attention to the science .
If we want to move the public and the Senate , we need to talk more about the science .
That should not be debatable .
Top Ten TV Moms .
( Now with 50 % more Marion Ross ! )
Mother ’s
Day is nearly upon us , blog world .
For most of us , that means last minute shopping for flowers , cards , chocolates , wine , or whatever gift you ( and I ’m speaking to primarily the male audience out there ) think constitutes an acceptable gift for a woman .
And not just any woman , either – the woman .
The most important woman you ’ll ever know – at least until you get married and your allegiances shift , whether you want them to or not .
Anyways , for those of you who are curious ( all four and a half of you ) , ol ’
Lu is indeed still single ( at least pretend to be shocked ) so my mother ( also known as The Greatest Mother in the World , for those keeping score ) is the most important woman in my life , and I ’m not ashamed to admit that .
( Though future name calling in my comments section may very well change that ) .
Regardless , this post is not about my mom , but rather it ’s about a few moms who might be just a teensy bit more well known in larger circles .
That ’s right , bloggers .
In honor of Sunday ’s Day of Mothers , I present the Top Ten Best TV Moms !
( Keep in mind , these are my own personal choices – should I miss one , feel free to let me know in the comment section .
But keep it polite , jerks ! )
Ten. Jill Taylor .
( Patricia Richardson , Home Improvement ) .
Jill Taylor from Home Improvement seems as good a place as any to start , as she adequately defines the main theme of the list .
In creating a list of television ’s top moms , I was tempted to add in such fan favorites as Seinfeld ’s Estelle Costanza or Estelle Getty ’s wise - cracking mom from The Golden Girls .
However , I decided to take a more grounded approach to the list , and present ten of TV ’s more realistic and down - to - earth moms .
Not only would you like to be raised by these women , but you could honestly see yourself being raised by them .
In fact , if you ’re lucky ( as I am ) , many of these mothers will directly reflect your own .
Back on track : Jill is that all around , down - to - earth , wholesome mom .
Juggling three kids ( four , if you count Tim Allen ) and a husband ( the aforementioned fourth kid ) is never easy , but Jill always manged it without any complaints , and usually with a wry comment to throw into the mix now and then .
Nine . Beulah Carey .
( Marion Ross , The Drew Carey Show ) .
Marion Ross is on this list twice .
There .
Just getting that out there , so you can be ready for her when she pops up again .
Not a lotta folks seem to remember ( or ever really watched ) The Drew Carey Show , but it was always a personal favorite of mine .
This was mostly due to the hilarious antics of Drew ’s closest friends , the drunken duo of Lewis and Oswald ( played to creepy and clueless perfection by Ryan Stiles and Diedrich Bader ) and the foppish antics of Drew ’s boss , Nigel Wick ( played by the always delightful – and foppish – Craig Ferguson ) .
Drew ’s adorable parents also made their mark , though , in the episodes that featured them .
Beulah was an old fashioned , caring mother , who put up with her sons no matter what new weirdness they would thrust upon her – Drew ’s crappy job and poor luck with woman , and his brother ’s cross - dressing and odd choice in women being the main weirdness .
And Marion Ross played her to absolute perfection , achieving a very nice balance between old fashioned mom and a new wavey “ the hell with it , they ’re my kids ” attitude .
Eight .
Lorelai Gilmore .
( Lauren Graham , Gilmore Girls ) .
Sure , Lorelai Gilmore was a little more than selfish .
And sure , she saw her daughter as more of a “ best friend that has to hang around with me , at least until she ’s eighteen no matter what . ”
Still , Lorelai always managed to do what ’s right by her daughter , and on her own no less .
Despite having wealthy parents of her own , Lorelai chose to find her own way , and raise her daughter Rory by her own personal standards , allowing her to thrive on her own .
Also , she was smokin’ hot .
Seven .
Danny Tanner .
( Bob Saget , Full House ) .
Let ’s face it .
John Stamos ’ Uncle Jesse was clearly the man around the house , and Dave Coulier ’s Uncle Joey was clearly the weird , borderline creepy uncle around the house .
So the mom role fell squarely on Danny Tanner ’s shoulders .
The fact that he was the children ’s biological father notwithstanding , just look at that argyle cardigan .
Total .
Mom .
Six .
Marion Cunningham .
( Marion Ross , Happy Days ) .
I warned you .
Few moms were as utterly momish as Happy Days Mrs. C. Not content to simply raise her own kids right , Mrs. Cunningham would take in whatever ragtag group of 1950 ’s weirdos her son Richie would drag home on a nightly basis – including Henry Winkler .
Sure , she had another kid that mysteriously disappeared somehow , never to be seen or mentioned again , but whatever .
She definitely made up for it by raising the rest of the Happy Days gang .
Five .
Marge Simpson . ( Julie Kavner , The Simpsons ) .
In the pantheon of “ families no normal person could ever deal with , ” the Simpsons reign supreme .
Saddled with a mischievous son ( and not adorable Dennis the Menace slingshotting butterflies mischief either , but a far more terrifying kind ) , a super intelligent daughter , and an oafish , boorish , bumbling husband ( who also sees his fair share of terrifying mischief ) , Marge Simpson nevertheless manages to rise above it all to be the perfect mother and wife that she is .
Always calm , collected , and ready to back her shitshow of a family no matter what horrors they ’ve caused , Marge is the epitome of the caring , non-judgemental mother .
The baby is pretty normal , though .
Four .
Vivian Banks .
( Janet Hubert - Whitten , Daphne Maxwell Reid , The Fresh Prince of Bel Air ) .
The only thing greater than Vivian Banks is her husband , Judge Phillip Banks .
But this article is n’t about father ’s , it ’s about mother ’s ; so scratch that , and come back on Father ’s Day .
Vivian is a loving woman , and , at the beginning of the series , the only thing standing in the way of Phillip severely beating the crap out of his wacky nephew , the aforementioned “ Fresh Prince ” ( Will Smith ) .
The main theme running through these moms seems to be patience , and Vivian had it in spades .
Her son was a dork , her daughter was a ditz , and her other daughter was a pointless character that got progressively hotter throughout the series duration .
But she endured it all , as well as that wacky “ Fresh Prince ” and stuck up for her children , her nephew , and her husband at every possible opportunity .
Also , there was two of them for some reason .
Neither actress was ever heard from again , after this series ended .
Three .
Kitty Forman .
( Debra Jo Rupp , That 70’s Show . )
Kitty was just an out and out DELIGHT .
From her odd laugh to her ability to keep her ass - kicking husband Red in check , Kitty is a fairly recent , but still important , addition to the TV moms Hall of Fame .
Like Mrs. Cunningham and Vivian Banks , Kitty was n’t just a good mom to her kids ( a stoner and a whore , for those paying attention ) , but also to any other momless child that would wander into her house ( usually also stoned ) .
She ’d always accept them , take care of them , and laugh off whatever reasonable , but dickish , comment her husband might make about the situation .
Also , there ’s a good chance that Kitty ’s good naturedness was due to a drinking problem , but since her alcohol intake was played for laughs , and never for anything more serious , we were totally okay with it .
Two .
Roseanne Connor .
( Roseanne , Roseanne ) .
Roseanne is probably the most realistic mom on this list ; a blue collared mom , with a blue collared husband , who were constantly struggling to make ends meet and get ahead in the world – but never at the expense of her children ’s health or well being .
And her kids always got their fair share of valuable lessons out of her as well – albeit through some pretty unorthodox and bizarre methods .
Still , Roseanne was the woman to have at your side during an argument or a fight – she was n’t one to back down or sacrifice her children ’s happiness for anyone , whether she was right or they were .
All good qualities in a mom .
Also , this show is pretty much the only thing Roseanne Barr / Arnold / Gosselin / Woods ever did that was actually any good .
So there ’s that .
One. Clair Huxtable .
( Phylicia Rashad , The Cosby Show ) .
I was going to write up a nice entry on why Clair Huxtable tops this list .
But then I stumbled across this video of Sean SB Butler singing his song , “ I ’m Looking For a Clair Huxtable ” and felt that it adequately described everything I was going to say , only better .
And set to a nice beat .
Enjoy !
I love you , Clair Huxtable .
Also you , mom .
Happy Mother ’s Day !
Israel was today deporting the last of nearly 700 activists detained in Monday 's raid on an aid flotilla bound for Gaza .
Officials said the decision to release , and not to prosecute , any of the activists despite suspicions they were sent to attack Israeli forces , was an attempt to limit damage to Israel 's relations with Turkey .
Officials had earlier said they were considering prosecuting about 50 people believed to be involved in violence .
Israel has come under international condemnation after its commandos stormed a six - ship aid flotilla on Monday in international waters , setting off clashes that killed nine activists and wounded dozens .
The activists were trying to break the three - year - old Israeli and Egyptian naval blockade of Gaza .
Turkish and Greek activists were to fly home on special planes sent by their respective governments , while others from the nearly 20 nations represented on the ships were travelling home on commercial flights .
The commando raid has seriously strained ties between Israel and Turkey .
Turkey withdrew its ambassador , scrapped military exercises with Israel and demanded a UN security council meeting to discuss the attack .
Hundreds of Turks protested against Israel 's commando raid for a third day today , and Israeli diplomats received orders to leave from the Israeli government .
The Turkish parliament in Ankara , meanwhile , held a heated debate on whether to impose military and economic sanctions on Israel .
In a statement approved by a show of hands , Turkish politicians said Israel must formally apologise for the raid , pay compensation to the victims and bring those responsible to justice .
" This attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law , " deputy parliament speaker Guldal Mumcu said , reading out the declaration .
" Turkey should seek justice against Israel through national and international legal authorities .
The parliament expects the Turkish government to revise the political , military and economic relations with Israel , and to take effective measures . "
Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Israel agreed not to charge the activists after Turkey applied diplomatic pressure .
" We have clearly stated that we would review our ties with Israel if all Turks were not released by the end of the day , " Davutoglu told a news conference .
" No one has the right to try people who were kidnapped in international waters . "
Davutoglu also called for an international commission to investigate the nine deaths in the Israeli commando raid and said two seriously injured Turks would remain in Israeli hospitals with a Turkish doctor .
More than 120 activists from a dozen Muslim nations without diplomatic relations with Israel were deported to Jordan before sunrise .
Elsewhere , Egypt today eased its blockade of Gaza after the assault and about 300 Palestinians entered through Gaza 's main gateway at the newly opened crossing in the border town of Rafah .
A smaller number entered Gaza from Egypt and humanitarian aid also came in including blankets , tents and 13 power generators donated by Russia and Oman .
Gaza has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas militants seized power in a violent takeover of the seaside strip in 2007 .
Egypt 's opening of the border was believed to be temporary , although the government did not say how long it would last .
In Ankara , Turkey 's interior minister , Besir Atalay , said Turkey had increased security to protect its Jewish minority as well as Israel 's diplomatic missions .
He said security provisions were intensified at 20 points in Istanbul .
The city has several synagogues and Jewish centers that serve 23,000 people .
" Our Jewish citizens are not foreigners here .
They make up an essential part of our community .
We have lived together for centuries , and we will continue to do so , " Davutoglu said .
In the past , there have been occasional attacks on Turkey 's Jewish community .
In 2003 , al - Qaida - linked suicide bombers attacked the British consulate , a British bank and two Jewish synagogues in Istanbul , killing 58 people .
In 1986 , gunmen killed 22 people in an attack on Istanbul 's Neve Shalom synagogue .
Most of Turkey 's Jews are descendants of people expelled from Spain in 1492 for refusing to convert to Christianity , and were welcomed by Ottoman Sultan Beyazit .
Other Jews found refuge in Turkey after fleeing Nazi persecution during World War II .
Jim Seip holds a plaque commemorating his sister , Margaret Seip , who was killed in 1943 during a crash in a UC - 78 Bobcat while on a training flight .
Seip said of his sister ???s recent recognition from the Air Force , " I ??? m glad she ???s getting the recognition just because she ???s such a great gal .
I loved her . "

Eleven more days and Margaret Seip would have gotten her wings .
Her family says Seip was n't even supposed to be aboard the UC - 78 Bobcat that day in August 1943 , but they learned later that she had volunteered to replace a pilot at the last minute .
The Wauwatosa woman was with another student and their instructor when their plane 's tail broke off at 10,000 feet and they spiraled into the Texas dirt , killing all three .
Seip , 27 , had earned her private pilot 's license three years earlier , was one of the first women to join the Wisconsin Civil Air Patrol and taught instrument flying to military pilots .
She jumped at the chance to join the Women Airforce Service Pilots , known as WASP .
The United States was embroiled in a two - front war , and the women played a critical supporting role .
But they were not considered part of the military ; their families could not hang gold star flags when they died and no American flag covered their coffins .
More than six decades after she died serving her country , Margaret Seip will be recognized Thursday at a graveside memorial service with full military honors .
" It 's a shame this was n't done a long time ago , " said Tammy Schroeder , an Air Force veteran who spearheaded the effort for memorial services for Seip and other WASP pilots killed in the line of duty .
" These women are my heroes . "
Seip was among the 38 WASPs killed in plane crashes .
She 's the only WASP casualty from Wisconsin .
A Wauwatosa High School graduate , she earned a degree in English at Lawrence College in Appleton and traveled through Europe with two friends , keeping a diary her younger brother , Jim , still keeps in a box along with photos , yearbooks and other mementos of his sister .
Jim Seip , 90 , remembers going to what 's now called Timmerman Airport with his sister , whom he called Maggie , and their older brother , John , when they were kids and watching the airplanes take off and land .
Their aunt paid for a plane ride for the children , and Jim Seip vividly recalls the pilot flying them over their home at 71st and Wells and dipping the wings .
Hooked on flying , Jim and Maggie later earned their pilot 's licenses at the same time .
Jim Seip , three years younger than his sister , was in Georgia training to fly B - 17s when a chaplain told him the terrible news .
" It was an awful shock , " he recalled Monday afternoon at his Helenville home .
" She was my father 's favorite .
When I got home he was still crying . "
After graduating from college , Margaret Seip worked at Chapman 's department store on Wisconsin Ave. before earning her pilot 's license and traveling to Binghamton , N.Y. , to attend Link Trainer school so she could train students on the flight simulator .
Margaret Seip loved to play golf and swim and was active in Girl Scouts .
" She was real easy to get along with .
She had a lot of friends , " said Jim Seip , who keeps a plaque on his living room wall of his sister in her flight suit .
Jim Seip 's son , also named Jim Seip , earned his pilot 's license 25 years ago at the age of 40 .
While visiting EAA AirVenture a decade ago , Jim 's son stopped at the tent dedicated to WASP history and introduced himself to the pilots who were then in their 70s and 80s .
Some remembered his aunt , and one of them pulled him aside and said , " I want to tell you what happened .
Maggie was in the office that day and answered a long - distance phone call , " Jim recalled .
" She jumped into a Jeep and drove out to the airfield .
The engines were running and the pilot had gotten a call from her husband so Maggie said she 'd fly . "
The plane she perished in was nicknamed the " Bamboo Bomber " because its wings and tail were made from wood .
More than 4,500 twin-engine UC - 78 Bobcats were manufactured during World War II and were used as a transition trainer so pilots could learn to use multi-engine aircraft before moving to bigger bombers or heavy transports , said Bill Fischer , executive director of EAA Warbirds of America .
With a critical shortage of qualified aviators , WASPs ferried thousands of planes from factories to the coasts for eventual use in combat .
They also towed training targets and worked as test pilots .
Their role was to free up as many male pilots as possible for overseas duty .
An attempt to make WASP part of the military was defeated in Congress in 1944 , which meant the women did not qualify for veterans ' benefits or honors .
The unit was quietly disbanded at the end of the war .
Not until 1977 were WASPs officially recognized as veterans ; last year they were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal .
Of the approximately 1,000 WASP pilots , about 300 are still living .
" They flew 60 million air miles in every type of aircraft the Army Air Force had - from the fastest to the heaviest , they flew it and they proved that women could do it , " said Schroeder , Minnesota AMVETS Department chaplain .
Schroeder has campaigned for memorial services for several of the 38 WASPs killed in the line of duty and contacted Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs officials to arrange Seip 's service .
At noon Thursday at Seip 's grave at Forest Home Cemetery , an Air Force honor guard will unfold and fold an American flag to present to her brother .
An American Legion post rifle detail will fire a salute .
Taps will be played .
And Margaret Seip will finally be recognized for her sacrifice .
Memorial service
The graveside memorial service for Margaret Seip , who died in a plane crash while training for the Women Airforce Service Pilots , will be held at noon Thursday at Forest Home Cemetery , 2405 W. Forest Home Ave. , Milwaukee .
After discovering video games , I did n't really keep up with my old friend Nerf .
But last night I got to shoot ( and get shot by ) the Stampede , a new , fully automatic Nerf rifle with a tripod and replaceable magazines .
What !?
Advertisement
Just like robots and movie violence and Halloween costumes , Nerf guns are getting more realistic with each passing year .
The N - Strike Stampede Blaster , the first fully automatic dart clip Nerf weapon , is the most realistic to date .
Maybe not realistic in the sense that it looks just like some real gun that any military uses , but real in the sense that it looks like the yellow version of something that could fire bullets and fatally wound someone .
The Stampede has a detachable shield to protect you from enemy darts , an extendable tripod for prone Nerfage , and a general badass look that will make you feel like you 're a Halo soldier whose gun happens to be canary yellow .
Advertisement
The upside of it being a toy and not a real crazy ass rifle is that it comes with a toy price tag : the Stampede will retail for $ 50 when it 's available September 9 .
The event also had a nice retrospective of Nerf products from a simpler time .
A few observations : was Nerf really the first indoor ball ?
Next are you going to try to tell me outdoor ball was only invented in like the 50s ?
And why is a brain - shaped football better than a regular football ?

Perhaps most disquietingly , why do I distinctly remember the Nerf swords being the incentive for me to master potty training , if they came out in 1998 , when I was 11 years old ?

There ’s a handy 3rd party module called pyPdf out there that you can use to merge PDFs documents together , rotate pages , split and crop pages , and decrypt / encrypt PDF documents .
In this article , we ’ll take a look at a few of these functions and then create a simple GUI with wxPython that will allow us to merge a couple of PDFs .
A pyPdf Tour
To get the most out of pyPdf , you need to learn its two major functions : PdfFileReader and PdfFileWriter .
They are the ones that I use the most .
Let ’s take a look at what they can do :
# Merge two PDFs from py Pdf import PdfFileReader , PdfFileWriter output = PdfFileWriter ( ) pdfOne = PdfFileReader ( file ( " some\path\to\a \PDf " , " rb " ) ) pdfTwo = PdfFileReader ( file ( " some\other\path\to\a\PDf " , " rb " ) ) output.addPage(pdfOne.getPage(0 ) ) output.addPage(pdfTwo.getPage(0 ) ) outputStream = file ( r" output.pdf " , " wb " ) output.write(outputStream ) outputStream.close ( )
The code above will open two PDFs , take the first page from each and create a third PDF by joining those two pages .
Note that the pages are zero - based , so zero is page one , one is page two , etc .
I use this sort of script to extract one or more pages from a PDF or to join a series of PDFs together .
For example , sometimes my users will receive a bunch of scanned documents where each page of the document ends up in a separate PDF .
They need all the single pages joined into one PDF and pyPdf allows me to do this very simply .
There are n’t many applications for the rotating functions that pyPdf gives me in my day - to - day experience , but maybe you have lots of users that scan documents in landscape rather than portrait and you end up needing to do a lot of turning .
Fortunately , this is pretty painless :
from pyPdf import PdfFileWriter , PdfFileReader output = PdfFileWriter ( ) input1 = PdfFileReader( file ( " document1.pdf " , " rb " ) ) output.addPage(input1.getPage(1).rotateClockwise(90 ) ) # output.addPage(input1.getPage(2).rotateCounterClockwise( 90 ) ) outputStream = file ( " output.pdf " , " wb " ) output.write(outputStream ) outputStream.close ( )
The code above is just taken from the pyPdf documentation and shortened for this example .
As you can see , the method to call is rotateClockwise or rotateCounterClockwise .
Make sure you pass the method the number of degrees to turn the page as well .
Now let ’s see what information we can pull from the PDF about itself :
>>> from py Pdf import PdfFileReader >>> p = r'E:\My Documents \My Dropbox\ebooks\helloWorld book.pdf ' >>> pdf = PdfFileReader ( file ( p , 'rb ' ) ) >>> pdf.documentInfo {' / CreationDate ' : u'D:20090323080712 Z ' , '/ Author ' : u' Warren Sande ' , '/ Producer ' : u'Acrobat Distiller 8.0.0 ( Windows ) ' , '/ Creator ' : u' FrameMaker 8.0 ' , '/ ModDate ' : u" D:20090401124817-04'00 ' " , '/ Title ' : u' Hello World !'} >>> pdf.getNumPages ( ) 432 >>> info = pdf.getDocumentInfo( ) >>> info.author u'Warren Sande ' >>> info.creator u'FrameMaker 8.0 ' >>> info.producer u'Acrobat Distiller 8.0.0 ( Windows ) ' >>> info.title u'Hello World !'
As you can see , we can gather quite a bit of useful data using pyPdf .
Now let ’s create a simple GUI to make merging two PDFs easier !
Creating a wxPython PDF Merger Application
I came up with this script yesterday .
It uses Tim Golden ’s winshell module to give me easy access to the user ’s desktop on Windows .
If you ’re on Linux or Mac , then you ’ll want to change this part of the code for your platform .
I wanted to use wxPython ’s StandardPaths module , but it did n’t have a function for getting the desktop that I could see .
Anyway , enough talk .
Let ’s look at some code !

The MyFileDropTarget class is used to enable drag - and - drop functionality on the first two text controls .
If the user wants , they may drag a PDF onto one of those text controls and the path will magically get inserted .
Otherwise , they can use the Browse button ( s ) to find the PDF ( s ) of their choice .
Once they have their PDFs chosen , they need to enter the name of the output PDF , which goes in the third text control .
You do n’t even need to append the “ .pdf ” extension since this application will do it for you .
The last step is to press the “ Join PDFs ” button .
This will add the second PDF to the end of the first , then display a dialog if it was created successfully .
For this to function correctly , we need to loop over all the pages of each PDF and add them to the output in order .
It would be fun to enhance this application with some kind of drag - and - drop interface where the user could see the PDF pages and rearrange them by dragging them around .
Or just being able to specify a few pages from each PDF to add rather than joining them in their entirety .
I ’ll leave those as exercises for the reader though .
I hope you found this article interesting and that it will spark your creative juices .
If you write something cool with these ideas , be sure to post a comment so I can see it !
Israel nears a $ 3 billion deal for the F - 35 plane that would give it a significant military advantage , a US official says .
Video : F - 35 in flight .
Israel is nearing a $ 3 billion deal for 19 advanced F - 35 warplanes that would give it a significant military advantage , Pentagon Defense Security Cooperation Agency , Vice Admiral Jeffrey Wieringa , told Reuters .
" The ball is in their court .
I am waiting for them to make a decision any day , " he added .
Lockheed Martin , the plane ’s manufacturer , has not commented on the status of the deal , but Lockheed is known to be anxious over sales because of European countries ’ reviews of spending programs .
Wieringa added that the Obama administration and the Pentagon view Israel ’s buying the F - 35 as “ part and parcel " of American security policies .
Lockheed Martin has promoted the F - 35 Lightning II stealth fighter as the centerpiece for 21st century global security while strengthening international political and industrial partnerships .
The fighter plane combines advanced stealth with fighter speed and agility , fully fused sensor information , network - enabled operations and advanced sustainment .
One of the sticking points in the purchase by Israel has been its desire to incorporate Israeli systems in the plane .
Weiringa did not disclose what specific radars and other equipment would be included with the F - 35 fighters for Israel , but sources reported that Israel is satisfied with the technology in the final agreement .
Bruce Katz received his Ph.D. in artificial intelligence from University of Illinois .
He is a frequent lecturer in artificial intelligence at the University of Sussex in the U.K and serves as adjunct professor in of Computer Engineering at Drexel University in Philadelphia .
Dr. Katz is the accomplished author of Neuroengineering the Future , Digital Design , as well as many prestigious journal articles .
Katz believes we are on the cusp of a broad neuro - revolution , one that will radically reshape our views of perception , cognition , emotion and even personal identity .
Neuroengineering is rapidly advancing from perceptual aids such as cochlear implants to devices that will enhance and speed up thought .
Ultimately , he says , this may free the mind from its bound state in the body to a platform independent existence .
h+ :
What trends do you see in cognitive enhancement modalities and therapies ( drugs , supplements , music , meditation , entrainment , AI and so forth ) ?
BRUCE KATZ :
There are two primary types of cognitive enhancement — enhancement of intelligence and enhancement of creative faculties .
Even though creativity is often considered a quasi-mystical process , it may surprise some that we are actually closer to enhancing this aspect of cognition than pure intelligence .
The reason is that intelligence is an unwieldy collection of processes , and creativity is more akin to a state , so it may very well be possible to produce higher levels of creative insight for a fixed level of intelligence before we are able to make people smarter in general .
There appear to be three main neurophysiological ingredients that influence the creative process
These are 1 ) relatively low levels of cortical arousal ; 2 ) a relatively flat associative gradient ; 3 ) a judicious amount of noise in the cognitive system .
[ Editor ’s note : A person with a high associative gradient is able to make a few common associations with a stimulus word such as “ flight , ” whereas those with a flat gradient are able to make many associations with the stimulus word .
Creative people have been found to have fairly flat gradients , and uncreative people have much steeper gradients . ]
All three ingredients conspire to encourage the conditions whereby cognition runs outside of its normal attractors , and produces new and potentially valuable insights .
Solving compound remote associate ( CRA ) problems illustrates how these factors work .
In a CRA problem , the task is to find a word that is related to three items .
For example , given “ fountain ” , “ baking ” , and “ pop ” the solution would be “ soda . ”
The reason CRA problems are difficult , and why creative insight helps , is that the mind tends to fixate on the stronger associates of the priming words ( for example , “ music ” for “ pop ” ) , which in turn inhibits the desired solution .
What are the implications of this for artificially enhancing insight ?
First , any technique that quiets the mind is likely to have beneficial effects .
These include traditional meditative techniques , but possibly also more brute - force technologies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) .
Low frequency pulses ( below 1 Hz ) enable inhibitory processes , and TMS applied in this manner to the frontal cortices could produce the desired result .
Second , the inhibition of the more literal and less associative left hemisphere through similar means could also produce good results .
In fact , EEG studies of people solving CRA problems with insight have shown an increase in gamma activity ( possibly indicative of conceptual binding activity ) in the right but not the left hemisphere just prior to solution .
Finally , the application of noise to the brain , either non-invasively , through TMS , or eventually through direct stimulation may encourage it to be more “ playful ” and to escape its normal ruts .
In the not too distant future , we may not have to rely on nature to produce the one - in - a- million combination [ of a high IQ and creative insight ] , and be able to produce it at will on many if not all neural substrates .
h+ :
What are some of the issues ( legal , societal , ethical ) that you anticipate for such technology ?
BK : My own opinion is that — except in the case of minors — we must let an informed public make their own choices .
Any government - mandated set of rules will be imperfect , and in any case will deviate from the needs and desires of its individual citizens .
What we in the neuroengineering community should be pushing for is a comprehensive freedom of thought initiative , ideally enshrined as a constitutional amendment rather than as a set of clumsy laws .
And we should be doing so sooner rather than later , before individual technologies come online , and before we allow the “ tyranny of the majority ” to control a right that ought to trump all other rights .
h+ :
What is your vision for the future of cognitive enhancement and neurotechnology in the next 20 years ?
BK : Ultimately , we want to be free of the limitations of the human brain .
There are just too many inherent difficulties in its kludgy design — provided by evolution — to make it worthwhile to continue along this path .
As I describe in my book , Neuroengineering the Future , these kludges include :
Short - term memory limitations ( typically seven plus or minus 2 items ) ,
Significant long - term memory limitations ( the brain can only hold about as much as a PC hard disk circa 1990 ) ,
Strong limitations on processing speed ( although the brain is a highly parallel system , each neuron is a very slow processor ) ,
Bounds on rationality ( we are less than fully impartial processors , sometimes significantly so ) ,
Bounds on creativity ( most people go through their entire lives without making a significant creative contribution to humanity ) , and perhaps most significantly …
Bounds on the number of concepts that can be entertained in consciousness at once ( some estimate that the bottleneck of consciousness restricts us to one plus or minus zero items ! ) .
Ultimately , we want to be free of the limitations of the human brain .
There are just too many inherent difficulties in its kludgy design …
The alternative is to free the mind from limitations of the brain by the addition of prosthetic devices and ultimately uploading it into digital form .
While it is unlikely either of these ( and especially the latter ) will occur in the next few decades , this remains the ultimate goal of enhancement .
Both processing speed and memory will be the most immediate beneficiaries of such developments , but the truly significant gains will involve the types of processing that will be possible .
Freeing the mind from this limited , albeit remarkable , organ will allow us to manipulate thought directly , and this will produce the most gains in intelligence , creativity , and in achieving harmony with other sentient beings and the universe as a whole .

IT WAS a rally like no other .
On the back of a flatbed truck , the country 's richest woman bellowed into a megaphone , imploring one of the best - dressed assemblies of protesters to gather in Perth to vent their anger on Kevin Rudd .
Gina Rinehart did n't so much deliver a speech as lead a very repetitive chant , imploring the crowd of 2000 to tell '' jittery Labor MPs in marginal seats '' to AXE THE TAX on miners ' super profits .
She followed another prominent member on Australia 's rich list , Andrew Forrest , who declared that the hopes and dreams of thousands - or was it millions ?
- hinged on whether they could force the Prime Minister to back down .
Most of the protesters worked in the industry and held neatly printed placards handed to them on arrival .
But there were others , too , including retirees worried about their superannuation and budding landlords like distinctively dressed accountant Vak Kyriacou .
But Italy , perhaps because its overall debt level was already so high and its population was older , pursued a policy of greater fiscal rectitude than its neighbors and avoided a real estate bubble .
And Mr. Hugh ’s main policy proposal — that Germany leave the euro , which would almost immediately push the value of the currency down sharply , improving competitiveness for the weaker countries that remained behind — reads better as a provocative blog post than as a practical solution .
Still , the sudden vulnerability of the euro zone and the search far and wide for answers by policy makers , investors and economists have caused his once obscure ramblings to go viral .
“ He is an information channel that I value a lot , ” said Brad DeLong , an economist at the University of California , Berkeley , who was a United States Treasury official in the administration of President Bill Clinton and a prominent blogger in his own right .
Mr. Hugh has also attracted a cult following among financial analysts .
“ Edward was writing very clearly about the imbalances in Europe and the likelihood of a crisis long before it was even on the radar screen of economists or analysts , ” said Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception , a London research firm that caters to hedge funds and wealthy investors .
“ He is a thinking machine . ”
At the same time , Mr. Hugh is determined to resist some of the newfound temptations that have lately come his way .
He said he had turned down lucrative offers from hedge funds to provide exclusive research because he did not want his views monopolized by any one entity — although he said he was considering an offer to join the stable of contributors who work for Mr. Roubini .
And when the Milken Institute — financed by Michael Milken , a felon who managed to hang on to a fortune even after having to pay a $ 550 million fine for his actions during the junk - bond boom of the 1980s — paid him $ 3,000 for a short report he did in a day on Eastern Europe , Mr. Hugh gave the money to a friend who was having trouble paying her mortgage , he said .
Overview
An overwhelming proportion of Americans are familiar with Twitter , the online information - sharing network .
Perhaps more surprisingly , a large majority also knows that children who are born to illegal immigrants in the United States are automatically U.S. citizens .
Yet the public continues to struggle in identifying political figures , foreign leaders and even knowing facts about key government policies .
Only about a third of Americans ( 34 % ) know that the government ’s bailout of banks and financial institutions was enacted under the Bush administration .
Nearly half ( 47 % ) incorrectly say that the Troubled Asset Relief Program – widely known as TARP – was signed into law by President Obama .
Even fewer ( 28 % ) are able to identify John Roberts as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court .
And just 19 % know that David Cameron is the new prime minister of Great Britain .
The Pew Research Center ’s latest News IQ Quiz , conducted July 1 - 5 among 1,007 adults reached on cell phones and landlines , finds that both young people and older people have a basic awareness of Twitter : 85 % know that it is an online information - sharing service .
And while young people fare particularly poorly on political knowledge , people younger than 30 are as likely as older Americans to know the host country of this year ’s World Cup and that children born to illegal immigrants in the United States are automatically citizens .
The survey included 11 multiple choice questions about people , events and issues in the news .
Respondents answered an average of 5.8 questions correctly .
A large majority of Americans ( 73 % ) know that Congress did pass a major health care reform bill this year .
Though health care dominated the public ’s news interest most weeks during the lengthy debate over the legislation , 14 % say Congress did not pass health care legislation this year and 13 % do not know .
Pew Research Center News Interest
Index surveys found few people were following the World Cup very closely ; however , 63 % know that the soccer tournament was held in South Africa .
A majority ( 55 % ) also is able to identify Gen. David Petraeus as the top military commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
In August 2007 , fewer ( 39 % ) knew that Petraeus then led U.S. forces in Iraq .
The public ’s awareness of the current unemployment rate has changed little over the past year .
In the new survey , 54 % say the rate is about 10 % ; about a quarter of Americans ( 26 % ) estimate the rate higher ( at 15 % or 20 % ) while just 3 % say it is lower ( at 5 % ) .
Since early May , the public has closely tracked news about the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico .
About half ( 51 % ) know that the damaged well is about 5,000 feet underwater .
Almost half ( 46 % ) correctly choose Greece when asked which European country recently received a major bailout from the European Union .
Small percentages ( 13 % ) choose an incorrect option , and 41 % say they do not know .
Most Know Petraeus ’s New Post
A majority of the public ( 55 % ) knows that Gen. David Petraeus is the current U.S. military commander in Afghanistan .
The general has been a prominent figure in the news recently since President Obama nominated him to replace Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , who resigned because of controversial comments he and aides made in a magazine article .
Still , a total of 46 % either do not know ( 35 % ) the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan or answered incorrectly ( 11 % ) .
Petraeus was less well - known in August 2007 when he was the top commander of U.S. forces in Iraq .
Shortly before he testified before a congressional panel about the U.S. troop surge then underway in Iraq , 39 % correctly named Petraeus as the general in charge of that war effort ; 61 % did not know ( 40 % ) or answered incorrectly ( 21 % ) .
Majorities of Republicans ( 58 % ) , Democrats ( 55 % ) and independents ( 53 % ) know that Petraeus has taken over the top post in Afghanistan .
Men are more likely than women to know this ( 60 % vs. 49 % ) .
And while older people generally do better than younger people on knowledge surveys , the difference is striking on this question : 69 % of those 50 and older know the top commander in Afghanistan is Petraeus , compared with just 29 % of those younger than 30 .
Few Know Roberts is Chief Justice
Fewer than three - in - ten ( 28 % ) correctly identified Roberts as the chief justice of the Supreme Court .
More than half ( 53 % ) do not know , while small percentages choose other options : former Justice Thurgood Marshall ( 8 % ) , former Justice John Paul Stevens ( 6 % ) and Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid ( 4 % ) .
In November 1986 , 43 % correctly identified William Rehnquist as the chief justice , though 29 % chose his predecessor , Warren Burger .
Though Rehnquist was new to the chief justice post at that time , he had served on the court since 1972 .
Among partisans , 23 % of Republicans , 27 % of Democrats and 34 % of independents correctly identify Roberts as the chief justice .
Young People Generally Less Knowledgeable
Young people , typically less attentive to news about domestic and international issues than older Americans , are also often less knowledgeable on these subjects .
Aside from the wide age gap over knowing the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , young people also are far less likely than older Americans to know the current unemployment rate and the depth of the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico .
Six - in - ten of those 50 and older know that the current unemployment rate is close to 10 % , compared with 36 % of those younger than 30 .
And only about a third of those under 30 ( 34 % ) know that the well leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico is at a depth of 5,000 feet ; 56 % of those 50 and older know this .
On several questions , however , younger people are as well or better informed than are older Americans .
For example , 79 % of those younger than 30 and an equal share of those 50 and older know that citizenship is automatically granted to the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States .
Not surprisingly , young people are more likely to know that Twitter is an on - line information sharing network ; 95 % of those 18 - 29 know this , but so does a large majority of those 50 and older : 76 % .
Men also score better on a number of questions than women .
For example , 64 % of men know that the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is at about 5,000 feet underwater , compared with 38 % of women .
Men also are more likely to know correctly that Greece is the European nation that recently received bailout help from the European Union ( 55 % vs. 37 % ) .
Little Partisan Gap in Political Knowledge
In previous knowledge quizzes , Republicans often were better informed than Democrats .
In the current quiz , however , Democrats are at least as knowledgeable as Republicans on every question except the depth of the Gulf oil leak ( 53 % of Republicans , 42 % of Democrats ) .
Notably , just 36 % of Republicans , 35 % of independents and 34 % of Democrats know that the government bailout of banks and financial institutions was signed into law by former President Bush .
Democrats ( 46 % ) are just as likely as Republicans ( 50 % ) or independents ( 44 % ) to incorrectly say the legislation was enacted after Obama became president .
There also is no difference among partisans in the percentages who correctly say that Congress passed health care reform legislation this year ( 73 % of Republicans , 74 % of Democrats and independents )
.
The Public ’s Average News IQ
The Pew Research Center News IQ Quiz summarizes public knowledge by combining answers to all 11 questions into a single scale ranging from zero ( none correct ) to 11 ( all correct ) .
Respondents receive one point on the scale for each correct answer .
In the July News IQ Quiz , Americans answered an average of 5.8 , or about half , of the questions correctly .
On the extremes , just 5 % of the public answered all questions correctly , while the same percentage answered one or none of them right .
As with past knowledge tests , the scores of various demographic groups vary widely and familiar patterns emerge .
Men did better than women on many of the questions ; men on average answered 6.4 questions correctly , compared with 5.2 correct answers for women .
College graduates outperformed those with no college experience on nearly every question in the survey .
Those with college degrees answered an average of 7.5 questions correctly , while those with a high school degree or less education averaged 4.5 correct answers out of 11 .
Older Americans did better than young people on the quiz .
Respondents 50 and older answered , on average , 6.1 questions correctly , while those under the age of 30 averaged 5.0 correct answers .
Those between 30 and 49 answered 6.0 questions correctly on average .
Republicans and Democrats both answered an average of 5.7 questions correctly , while independents answered 6.2 items correctly on average .
If you once tell a lie , the truth is ever after your enemy .
I have discussed the notion that lies are contagious .
If you pick up a pebble from the driveway , and tell a geologist that you found it on a beach — well , do you know what a geologist knows about rocks ?
I do n’t .
But I can suspect that a water - worn pebble would n’t look like a droplet of frozen lava from a volcanic eruption .
Do you know where the pebble in your driveway really came from ?
Things bear the marks of their places in a lawful universe ; in that web , a lie is out of place .
1
What sounds like an arbitrary truth to one mind — one that could easily be replaced by a plausible lie — might be nailed down by a dozen linkages to the eyes of greater knowledge .
To a creationist , the idea that life was shaped by “ intelligent design ” instead of “ natural selection ” might sound like a sports team to cheer for .
To a biologist , plausibly arguing that an organism was intelligently designed would require lying about almost every facet of the organism .
To plausibly argue that “ humans ” were intelligently designed , you ’d have to lie about the design of the human retina , the architecture of the human brain , the proteins bound together by weak van der Waals forces instead of strong covalent bonds . . .
Or you could just lie about evolutionary theory , which is the path taken by most creationists .
Instead of lying about the connected nodes in the network , they lie about the general laws governing the links .
And then to cover that up , they lie about the rules of science — like what it means to call something a “ theory , ” or what it means for a scientist to say that they are not absolutely certain .
So they pass from lying about specific facts , to lying about general laws , to lying about the rules of reasoning .
To lie about whether humans evolved , you must lie about evolution ; and then you have to lie about the rules of science that constrain our understanding of evolution .
But how else ?
Just as a human would be out of place in a community of actually intelligently designed life forms , and you have to lie about the rules of evolution to make it appear otherwise , so too beliefs about creationism are themselves out of place in science — you would n’t find them in a well - ordered mind any more than you ’d find palm trees growing on a glacier .
And so you have to disrupt the barriers that would forbid them .
Which brings us to the case of self - deception .
A single lie you tell yourself may seem plausible enough , when you do n’t know any of the rules governing thoughts , or even that there are rules ; and the choice seems as arbitrary as choosing a flavor of ice cream , as isolated as a pebble on the shore . . .
. . . but then someone calls you on your belief , using the rules of reasoning that they ’ve learned .
They say , “ Where ’s your evidence ? ”
And you say , “ What ?
Why do I need evidence ? ”
So they say , “ In general , beliefs require evidence . ”
This argument , clearly , is a soldier fighting on the other side , which you must defeat .
So you say : “ I disagree !
Not all beliefs require evidence .
In particular , beliefs about dragons do n’t require evidence .
When it comes to dragons , you ’re allowed to believe anything you like .
So I do n’t need evidence to believe there ’s a dragon in my garage . ”
And the one says , “ Eh ?
You ca n’t just exclude dragons like that .
There ’s a reason for the rule that beliefs require evidence .
To draw a correct map of the city , you have to walk through the streets and make lines on paper that correspond to what you see .
That ’s not an arbitrary legal requirement — if you sit in your living room and draw lines on the paper at random , the map ’s going to be wrong .
With extremely high probability .
That ’s as true of a map of a dragon as it is of anything . ”
So now this , the explanation of why beliefs require evidence , is also an opposing soldier .
So you say : “ Wrong with extremely high probability ?
Then there ’s still a chance , right ?
I do n’t have to believe if it ’s not absolutely certain . ”
Or maybe you even begin to suspect , yourself , that “ beliefs require evidence . ”
But this threatens a lie you hold precious ; so you reject the dawn inside you , push the Sun back under the horizon .
Or you ’ve previously heard the proverb “ beliefs require evidence , ” and it sounded wise enough , and you endorsed it in public .
But it never quite occurred to you , until someone else brought it to your attention , that this proverb could apply to your belief that there ’s a dragon in your garage .
So you think fast and say , “ The dragon is in a separate magisterium . ”
Having false beliefs is n’t a good thing , but it does n’t have to be permanently crippling — if , when you discover your mistake , you get over it .
The dangerous thing is to have a false belief that you believe should be protected as a belief — a belief - in - belief , whether or not accompanied by actual belief .
A single Lie That Must Be Protected can block someone ’s progress into advanced rationality .
No , it ’s not harmless fun .
Just as the world itself is more tangled by far than it appears on the surface , so too there are stricter rules of reasoning , constraining belief more strongly , than the untrained would suspect .
The world is woven tightly , governed by general laws , and so are rational beliefs .
Think of what it would take to deny evolution or heliocentrism — all the connected truths and governing laws you would n’t be allowed to know .
Then you can imagine how a single act of self - deception can block off the whole meta level of truth - seeking , once your mind begins to be threatened by seeing the connections .
Forbidding all the intermediate and higher levels of the rationalist ’s Art. Creating , in its stead , a vast complex of anti-law , rules of anti-thought , general justifications for believing the untrue .
Steven Kaas said , “ Promoting less than maximally accurate beliefs is an act of sabotage .
Do n’t do it to anyone unless you ’d also slash their tires . ”
Giving someone a false belief to protect — convincing them that the belief itself must be defended from any thought that seems to threaten it — well , you should n’t do that to someone unless you ’d also give them a frontal lobotomy .
Once you tell a lie , the truth is your enemy ; and every truth connected to that truth , and every ally of truth in general ; all of these you must oppose , to protect the lie .
Whether you ’re lying to others , or to yourself .
You have to deny that beliefs require evidence , and then you have to deny that maps should reflect territories , and then you have to deny that truth is a good thing . . .
Thus comes into being the Dark Side .
I worry that people are n’t aware of it , or are n’t sufficiently wary — that as we wander through our human world , we can expect to encounter systematically bad epistemology .
The “ how to think ” memes floating around , the cached thoughts of Deep Wisdom — some of it will be good advice devised by rationalists .
But other notions were invented to protect a lie or self - deception : spawned from the Dark Side .
“ Everyone has a right to their own opinion . ”
When you think about it , where was that proverb generated ?
Is it something that someone would say in the course of protecting a truth , or in the course of protecting from the truth ?
But people do n’t perk up and say , “ Aha !
I sense the presence of the Dark Side ! ”
As far as I can tell , it ’s not widely realized that the Dark Side is out there .
But how else ?
Whether you ’re deceiving others , or just yourself , the Lie That Must Be Protected will propagate recursively through the network of empirical causality , and the network of general empirical rules , and the rules of reasoning themselves , and the understanding behind those rules .
If there is good epistemology in the world , and also lies or self - deceptions that people are trying to protect , then there will come into existence bad epistemology to counter the good .
We could hardly expect , in this world , to find the Light Side without the Dark Side ; there is the Sun , and that which shrinks away and generates a cloaking Shadow .
Mind you , these are not necessarily evil people .
The vast majority who go about repeating the Deep Wisdom are more duped than duplicitous , more self - deceived than deceiving .
I think .
And it ’s surely not my intent to offer you a Fully General Counterargument , so that whenever someone offers you some epistemology you do n’t like , you say : “ Oh , someone on the Dark Side made that up . ”
It ’s one of the rules of the Light Side that you have to refute the proposition for itself , not by accusing its inventor of bad intentions .
But the Dark Side is out there .
Fear is the path that leads to it , and one betrayal can turn you .
Not all who wear robes are either Jedi or fakes ; there are also the Sith Lords , masters and unwitting apprentices .
Be warned ; be wary .
As for listing common memes that were spawned by the Dark Side — not random false beliefs , mind you , but bad epistemology , the Generic Defenses of Fail — well , would you care to take a stab at it , dear readers ?
Last weekend was “ Doors Open ” in Ottawa , a yearly event during which a number of places open their doors to the public .
Not only admission is free , but you get the chance to peek into a number of interesting places which are not usually open to the general public .
Being my usual curious self , I decided to go visit the Ottawa Paramedic Headquarter in Walkley .
As much as I like architecture and old buildings , which is what a lot of people come to see during this event , I was more interested in getting an insider peek into the day of the paramedics .
Like most people , I occasionally see them racing on the freeway , or I hear the sound of the ambulance siren in the distance and know something is going on — that ’s about it .
The paramedic headquarter was built in 2005 .
This is where all the staff reports before being dispatched .
A huge indoors garage is home to what seemed dozens of vehicles , from bicycles ( to access crowded places easily ) to huge trailers which carry tons of supplies in case of a major emergency .
Several rooms stock the supplies : stretchers and little bags , full of drugs and medical supplies .
They are all checked daily and repackaged as needed , and then sealed .
The building also has a cleaning station for vehicles , which are all disinfected and checked for damages before being parked again .
Upstairs in the buildings are the staff gym and physiotherapy center ( apparently , this job is hard on the body ! ) and the emergency control room .
Everything looked so organized and “ under control ” — I actually found that very comforting .
And the paramedics seemed to be a dedicated team !

From the Senate delay case files
By Dylan Matthews
The Senate 's inability to get anything done has been highlighted so often with big , visible fights -- climate change , nominations , unemployment insurance , etc. -- that it 's easy to forget that plenty of other issues are getting neglected along the way .
I spent much of the day yesterday at the Campus Progress National Conference , and the best speech by far was from Kevin Sanchez , a former gang member who spoke in favor of the Youth Promise Act , which provides funding for juvenile delinquency intervention and prevention programs in inner cities .
This is the sort of bill that Congress should be able to get passed easily .
It focuses on evaluating programs for effectiveness and scaling up existing programs that have worked , including ones that have shown dramatic reductions in gang membership and related violence ; you can read a PDF summary from the Children 's Defense Fund , which is a big backer , here .
It has 234 co-sponsors in the House , enough to pass on the floor , and with Olympia Snowe co-sponsoring the Senate version , passage should be possible if Senate Democrats keep it together and especially if Mitch McConnell decides it would be unseemly to filibuster a bill combating youth violence .
Some conservatives are opposed , but the best the Heritage Foundation could offer was a bit of hand - wringing verging on self - parody about how the act goes against the spirit of federalism .
But it does n't appear likely the bill will come to a vote in either chamber this session .
I 'm hoping activists fighting for it will prove me wrong on that , but with jobs legislation , climate change , the Disclose Act and immigration reform all ahead of it on the docket , it 's hard to see how either chamber has time .
They would , if the Senate operated at a pace befitting a modern legislature , but it does n't , and so inner cities will likely go another few years without funding to keep kids out of gangs .
Rhetoric about the Senate 's role as a cooling saucer gets a lot less romantic when you consider what 's being cooled .

It seems like we 've been talking about external graphics cards forever , but how many do you recall that look quite as raw and ready as this ?
The Graphics Upgrade Solution , set for a full unveiling at Computex , is MSI 's latest answer to the eternal problem that is gaming on the move .
Serving as a conduit -- via its own PCI Express interface and the oft - neglected ExpressCard slot -- between desktop GPUs and laptops , the GUS comes with its own power brick that can support cards with up to an 84W TDP .
That , together with the limited bandwidth on offer , makes the ATI Radeon HD 5670 bundle pretty much the top of the GUS pile , but at somewhere around $ 229 that does n't look like a terrible deal at all .
Alternatively , you can buy the bare unit for around $ 100 and make use of some old GPU to give a little extra pep to your laptop .
It 's all good .
The blowhard Maricopa County Sherrif Joe Arpaio has threatened to jail protestors of Arizona 's immigration law .
Here he is with ABC's George Stephanopoulos , via Crooks and Liars .
" It appears that there are groups , individuals that are gearing up for some civil disobedience if this law does take effect , " Stephanopoulos noted Wednesday .
" Are you prepared for that ?
What are you going to do about it ? "
" Yeah , " replied Arpaio .
" I 'm ready for it .
I hear a rumor they want to block my jails .
So , if they want to block the jails , they can have a little trip in the jail . "
" So , we 're not going to put up with any civil disobedience just because they want to show -- give a message through the media about this situation that is occurring here in Arizona . "

The author writes :
This is a combination of the first Garfield strip , and the first two pages of the Manga , What 's Michael ? by Makoto Kobayashi .
Very telling , especially since What 's Michael ? is often referred to as the Japanese Garfield .
If the images do n't look familiar , it 's because it 's one of several stories that were left out when Dark Horse picked up the license .
I was only aware of it because an earlier English publication showed it .
Unfortunately , I can't remember who published it , save that it had an introduction by Cat Yronwode .
AnimeNewsNetwork and even Wikipedia have no clues as to who published What 's Michael ?
first , but there is some information here .
Original Garfield strip : 1978-06-19 ( Obviously ! )

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German student created a major traffic jam in Bavaria after making a rude gesture at a group of Hell ’s Angels motorcycle gang members , hurling a puppy at them and then escaping on a stolen bulldozer .
German police said on Monday that after making his getaway from the Hell ’s Angels club , the 26 - year - old dumped the bulldozer , causing a 5 km ( 3 miles ) traffic jam near the southern town of Allershausen , local police said .
He then fled to his home nearby where he was apprehended by the police .
“ What motivated him to throw a puppy at the Hell ’s Angels is currently unclear , ” said a spokesman for local police , adding that the student had lately been suffering from depression .
The puppy was now in safe hands , the spokesman added .
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The hunt for information on a suspected mistress exposed a love affair between two Cleveland cops and sent one to jail for illegally obtaining records from a police database .
Officers Samuel Feldman and Andrea Viccaro , partners on the job , decided to look into what they believed was an affair that Viccaro 's husband was having .
Turns out , Viccaro 's husband was not being unfaithful .
It is Feldman and Viccaro who are an item .
The officers each received 10 - day suspensions last month because Feldman accessed confidential information from the database on a woman they spotted with Viccaro 's husband .
Information from police databases is to be used only for law enforcement purposes .
Before the suspensions , Feldman and Viccaro each pleaded no contest to charges of unauthorized use of property in Cleveland Municipal Court .
Viccaro received a suspended 30 - day jail sentence .
A judge sentenced Feldman to 120 days in jail but suspended 116 days .
He served the four days in the city workhouse .
The criminal investigation of their actions started after a woman -- a State Highway Patrol trooper at the Ashland County post -- suspected someone found confidential information about her from a police database .
Cleveland released the investigative file this week .
Police records from the Internal Affairs Unit and sources tell the following story :
Feldman , 41 , and Viccaro , 35 , knew nothing about the suspected other woman -- except that Viccaro heard her husband , Stephen Halabica , talking to a woman on the phone .
The patrol officers essentially transformed themselves into undercover detectives the next day as each took personal time off , and teamed to follow Halabica from his Cleveland home to Brunswick .
They saw him invite a woman into his pickup truck at a restaurant parking lot , then followed as Halabica drove to downtown Cleveland .
The tail ended when they lost the truck in traffic .
Feldman took Viccaro home , but returned to Brunswick to get the license plate of the woman 's Chevy Malibu that was still in the restaurant lot .
Feldman plugged the license plate into a police database and conducted 13 searches on his personal computer .
He printed pictures of the woman and gave the material to Viccaro .
Armed with the information , Viccaro confronted her husband about his date with a blonde woman named " Penelope . "
Viccaro told her husband she had spotted the two on downtown surveillance cameras .
But the story confused Halabica .
He knew the woman only as " Penny . "
Halabica called Penny Beaty and asked about the name Penelope .
Beaty demanded to know how Halabica knew the name .
She said Penelope is only listed on her driver 's license and on certain records .
Halabica told Beaty that his wife had mentioned it .
Halabica and Beaty suspected that Viccaro or Feldman had followed them and had run the license plate through a database .
Beaty filed a complaint with Cleveland investigators .
" I was shocked that he asked me that because I do n't go by that name , " Beaty told investigators .
" When Steve told me about this conversation with Andrea , I immediately knew that she had to have run the plates of my car . "
The Internal Affairs reports say Beaty and Halabica were not lovers .
They met through a mutual friend .
Beaty did n't know the Cleveland area , and Halabica volunteered to drive her downtown for a comedy show .
During early interviews with investigators , Viccaro and Feldman said they wanted the information on the Malibu because Viccaro had noticed a suspicious car on her street and feared for her family 's safety .
Feldman told investigators he believed he was acting properly by looking out for his partner .
" I acknowledge that I should have informed a supervisor before I took any action .
We were n't trying to discover the identity of his girlfriend , if he had one , " the Internal Affairs report quoted Feldman .
Viccaro 's statement said , " I regret that I did n't go to a supervisor first , but at the time we acted in a manner that we thought was for law enforcement purposes . "
Internal Affairs did n't buy it .
Neither officer mentioned the suspicious vehicle until they needed an excuse for running the plate , said a report written by Sgt. Charles DePenti .
" The suspicious vehicle was clearly a ruse to conceal the true nature of the [ computer ] queries completed by Feldman , " DePenti wrote .
After the investigation began , Feldman filed for divorce from his wife .
Viccaro and Feldman joined the Cleveland force in October 2006 .
Eventually , during the internal investigation , they acknowledged they were romantically involved .
The two met while attending the Cleveland police academy .
They became partners in the 3rd Police District .
They now work out of the 4th District .
Feldman had worked more than seven years with the Columbus Police Department and the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation .
Feldman and Viccaro pleaded no contest in their January Municipal Court appearance in front of Judge Michael Ryan .
He found them guilty , and also ordered them to complete an ethics class and serve probation for one year .
He banned them from being partners again .
Police spokesman Sgt. Sammy Morris said police take oaths to uphold the laws and must follow a code of ethics .
" They messed up , " he said .
Neither Feldman nor Viccaro could be reached for comment .

Filmed through water , a silica microdisk embedded with a gold , gammadion - shaped light mill nanomotor rotates in one direction under illumination from laser light at 810 nanometers wavelength .
When the wavelength is switched to 1,715 nanometers , the rotational direction is reversed .
Torque is produced when the laser light frequencies resonate with the frequencie of the metal ’s plasmons .
( Movie courtesy of Zhang group )
While those wonderful light sabers in the Star Wars films remain the figment of George Lucas ’ fertile imagination , light mills – rotary motors driven by light – that can power objects thousands of times greater in size are now fact .
Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California ( UC ) Berkeley have created the first nano - sized light mill motor whose rotational speed and direction can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the incident light waves .
It may not help conquer the Dark Side , but this new light mill does open the door to a broad range of valuable applications , including a new generation of nanoelectromechanical systems ( NEMS ) , nanoscale solar light harvesters , and bots that can perform in vivo manipulations of DNA and other biological molecules .
“ We have demonstrated a plasmonic motor only 100 nanometers in size that when illuminated with linearly polarized light can generate a torque sufficient to drive a micrometre - sized silica disk 4,000 times larger in volume , ” says Xiang Zhang , a principal investigator with Berkeley Lab ’s Materials Sciences Division and director of the Center for Scalable and Integrated NanoManufacturing ( SINAM ) , a UC Berkeley Nano - scale Science and Engineering Center , who led this research .
“ In addition to easily being able to control the rotational speed and direction of this motor , we can create coherent arrays of such motors , which results in greater torque and faster rotation of the microdisk . ”
The success of this new light mill stems from the fact that the force exerted on matter by light can be enhanced in a metallic nanostructure when the frequencies of the incident light waves are resonant with the metal ’s plasmons – surface waves that roll through a metal ’s conduction electrons .
Zhang and his colleagues fashioned a gammadion - shaped light mill type of nanomotor out of gold that was structurally designed to maximize the interactions between light and matter .
The metamaterial - style structure also induced orbital angular momentum on the light that in turn imposed a torque on the nanomotor .
“ The planar gammadion gold structures can be viewed as a combination of four small LC - circuits for which the resonant frequencies are determined by the geometry and dielectric properties of the metal , ” says Zhang .
“ The imposed torque results solely from the gammadion structure ’s symmetry and interaction with all incident light , including light which does n’t carry angular momentum .
Essentially we use design to encode angular momentum in the structure itself .
Since the angular momentum of the light need not be pre-determined , the illuminating source can be a simple linearly polarized plane - wave or Gaussian beam . ”
The results of this research are reported in the journal Nature Nanotechnology in a paper titled , “ Light - driven nanoscale plasmonic motors . ”
Co-authoring the paper with Zhang were Ming Liu , Thomas Zentgraf , Yongmin Liu and Guy Bartal .
It has long been known that the photons in a beam of light carry both linear and angular momentum that can be transferred to a material object .
Optical tweezers and traps , for example , are based on the direct transfer of linear momentum .
In 1936 , Princeton physicist Richard Beth demonstrated that angular momentum – in either its spin or orbital form – when altered by the scattering or absorption of light can produce a mechanical torque on an object .
Previous attempts to harness this transfer of angular momentum for a rotary motor have been hampered by the weakness of the interaction between photons and matter .
“ The typical motors had to be at least micrometres or even millimeters in size in order to generate a sufficient amount of torque , ” says lead author Ming Liu , a PhD student in Zhang ’s group .
“ We ’ve shown that in a nanostructure like our gammadion gold light mill , torque is greatly enhanced by the coupling of the incident light to plasmonic waves .
The power density of our motors is very high .
As a bonus , the rotational direction is controllable , a counterintuitive fact based on what we learn from wind mills . ”
The directional change , Liu explains , is made possible by the support of the four - armed gammadion structure for two major resonance modes – a wavelength of 810 nanometers , and a wavelength of 1,700 nanometers .
When illuminated with a linearly polarized Gaussian beam of laser light at the shorter wavelength , the plasmonic motor rotated counterclockwise at a rate of 0.3 Hertz .
When illuminated with a similar laser beam but at the larger wavelength , the nanomotor rotated at the same rate of speed but in a clockwise direction .
“ When multiple motors are integrated into one silica microdisk , the torques applied on the disk from the individual motors accumulate and the overall torque is increased , ” Liu says .
“ For example , a silica disk embedded with four plasmonic nanomotors attains the same rotation speed with only half of the laser power applied as a disk embedded with a single motor . ”
The nanoscale size of this new light mill makes it ideal for powering NEMS , where the premium is on size rather than efficiency .
Generating relatively powerful torque in a nanosized light mill also has numerous potential biological applications , including the controlled unwinding and rewinding of the DNA double helix .
When these light mill motors are structurally optimized for efficiency , they could be useful for harvesting solar energy in nanoscopic systems .
“ By designing multiple motors to work at different resonance frequencies and in a single direction , we could acquire torque from the broad range of wavelengths available in sunlight , ” Liu says .

Last week , I got this question via email from a ComicsAlliance reader :
Beyond Method Man's opus to the Riddler , I had largely disregarded the music surrounding Batman .
This last week introduced me not only to the Batman Musical episode of Batman Beyond , but a Justice League episode where he belts out " Am I Blue ? "
Are there other musical moments of the Caped Crusader 's which I should experience ?
Eli
Originally , I 'd planned to answer that as part of my weekly " Ask Chris " column , but as tends to happen when I write about Batman , it got a little bit out of hand , so I 'm tackling it now .
And the answer is ... well , yes and no .
As should probably be expected from the fact that comics are something you read rather than hear , Batman does n't get to sing too often , and Kevin Conroy 's rendition of " Am I Blue ? " is the only example of the Dark Knight himself singing that I 'm aware of .
But there are plenty of noteworthy songs about Batman .
Unsurprisingly , the majority of Batman - related songs hit during the late ' 60s at the height of the Adam West / Burt Ward TV show .
The show 's impact on American pop culture was absolutely phenomenal , and the music of the time reflects that -- largely , I assume , because the show itself featured acts like Paul Revere and the Raiders .
There were dozens of songs released throughout the show 's run ( as seen on this handy list from 60 sGarageBands.com ) ranging from covers of Neil Hefti's theme song to more esoteric offerings like Seeds of Euphoria 's " Let 's Send Batman to Viet Nam . "
There were even entire bands that took their cue from the show , including these guys , The Batmen ...
... who combined masks , capes , and a glittered - out kick to become the coolest dudes you will see today , as well as The Gotham City Crime Fighters , who would evolve into funk / soul supergroup Tower of Power :
Even with all that , though , some of the weirdest stuff came through more - or - less official channels , starting with the 1966 album " Jan and Dean Meet Batman . "
Even with all that , though , some of the weirdest stuff came through more - or - less official channels , starting with the 1966 album Jan and Dean -- not to be confused with Chad and Jeremy , the British folk duo who appeared in an episode of the show where their voices were stolen by Catwoman -- were a duo at the forefront of surf rock who hit big with " Dead Man 's Curve , " " The Little Old Lady From Pasadena " and " Surf City . "
They were also apparently fans of the show , which led them to create a truly bizarre concept album that was half songs about Batman and half scripted skits ( including a pretty offensive Yellow Peril caricature villain ) about they themselves becoming " Captain Jan and Dean , the Boy Blunder . "
It 's their song about Batman , though , that stands as the gem of the album
If there 's anything that justifies humanity 's desire to create art more than the surf - rock falsetto singing of " Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot / so my disguise must be able / to strike terror into their hearts , " then I have n't heard it .
The entire album 's about that weird ( or weirder ) , but what 's interesting about it is that towards the end , it gets to the point where it becomes clear that this entire project was less about recording an album and more about just goofing off with your friends and making bad jokes about Batman .
It is , in essence , the world 's first comic book podcast .
Even stranger than that , though , was a single released around the same time ( June , 1966 ) called " The Boy Wonder Sessions . "
As you might expect from the title , this not only focused on Robin , but featured Burt Ward doing the vocals .
That 's not the weird part .
The weird part is that the song was written and arranged by legendary rocker Frank Zappa , whose debut album with the Mothers of Invention dropped the same month .
Zappa also arranged the B - Side , " Orange Coloured Sky " ( written by Milton DeLugg , the musical director of the Gong Show who also wrote the amazing theme to " Santa Claus Conquers the Martians " ) .
It also has the distinction of being one of the worst - sung songs I have ever heard in my life , to the point where I honestly can't tell if it 's meant to be bad .
Ward was hardly the only one who did a song based on his " Batman " character , though :
When I was a kid , I had an album that ( in addition to the Jan and Dean track about the Joker ) featured a track with Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and a pretty great song about the Riddler written by Mel Torme and performed by Frank Gorshin , complete with manic laughter .
My absolute favorite piece of Bat - Music of the era , though , was " Miranda . "
Not only did Adam West himself sing this song ( and its amazing , non-copyright - infringing references to " Bruce " and " Boy Genius " ) for the album , he also reportedly performed it live in full costume on occasion during public appearances as Batman , and if I ever get a time machine , that 's the first thing I 'm hitting up .
The most interesting thing about this song , however , is how it went down behind the scenes : According to the liner notes on the album I had -- " Batmania " --
West was in the hospital with the flu and doped up on medicine when he signed the contract to do it after his agent brought it in and barely remembered doing so after .
If memory serves , he pointed out that he was an actor not a singer , but they convinced him to do it anyway , and all things considered , it turned out pretty well .
Better than " Orange Coloured Skies , " anyway .
After the end of the show , songs about Batman more or less faded away , though there was a brief spike in 1989 when the Tim Burton " Batman " movie hit and spawned Prince 's truly amazing " Batdance " -- and two comics about Prince from DC 's short - lived Piranha Press imprint where Prince referred to himself as Batman in scripts by future " Justice League " writer Dwayne McDuffie .
Batman was never really gone from the world of music , though , and one of the best songs about Batman is actually pretty recent : " Batman ( You 're The Sex ) " by the all - girl Canadian rock band The Stolen Minks , off their 2006 album " Family Boycott " :
The song was written by former band member / current comics blogger Rachelle Goguen ( of Living Between Wednesdays ) who sings and plays keyboards , and in addition to being a pretty solid rock song , it reads like one of her " Rating the Super - Hunks " columns set to music , and that is rad .
If only for the fact that It contains the line " he knows every martial art that exists / he 's a crime - fightin ' ass - kickin ' scientist , " it 's my all - time favorite song about Batman .
Until I get my hands on a copy of " Let 's Send Batman to Viet Nam , " that is .

ON THE RISE ON THE RISE
The number of soldiers forced to leave the Army solely because of a mental disorder has increased by 64 % from 2005 to 2009 and accounts for one in nine medical discharges , according to Army statistics .
Last year , 1,224 soldiers with a mental illness , such as post - traumatic stress disorder , received a medical discharge .
That was an increase from 745 soldiers in 2005 or about 7 % of medical discharges that year , according to personnel statistics provided to USA TODAY .
The trend matches other recent indicators that show a growing emotional toll on a military that has been fighting for seven years in Iraq and nine years in Afghanistan , the Army and veterans advocates say .

" These numbers really just validate the mental health communities ' concern about multiple deployments , " says Adrian Atizado , who specializes in health issues as assistant national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans .
" Mind and body are both taking a beating . "
Soldiers discharged for having both a mental and a physical disability increased 174 % during the past five years from 1,397 in 2005 to 3,831 in 2009 , according to the statistics .
Army Lt. Col. Rebecca Porter , an Army behavioral health official , says research shows " a clear relationship between multiple deployments and increased symptoms of anxiety , depression and PTSD . "
Aggressive efforts to identify and treat mental illnesses by medical officials , Porter says , are also why more soldiers are being discharged .
But veterans groups argue that the failure of early detection and treatment allow mental illnesses to fester into problems so severe that a soldier must be discharged from the service .
" The military is excellent at treating visible wounds , " says Joe Davis , a spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars .
" The military and entire medical community at large still have a long way to go to effectively and reliably screen and treat wounds to the head and mind .
Before discharging troops for behavioral reasons , it is absolutely imperative that commanders first ask ' What caused this ? ' " A Pentagon analysis in May reported that in 2009 , for the first time in 15 years , mental health disorders caused more hospitalizations among U.S. troops than any other medical condition , including battle wounds .

( CNN ) -- A " tense calm " prevailed Friday evening in Panama 's Bocas del Toro province , one day after violent confrontations between striking banana plantation workers and federal troops left one protester dead and more than 100 people injured , the president 's spokeswoman told CNN .
But despite the relative calm , authorities still will impose a curfew Friday at 9 p.m. for the second night in a row , spokeswoman Judy Meana said .
Protesters burned down a bank and sacked several businesses Thursday night and authorities want to avoid that from happening again , Meana said .
The demonstrations broke out Thursday over a new government measure to limit the right of workers to protest and strike .
Passions had already been inflamed because the workers from the Bocas Fruit Company had not been paid in two weeks , Meana said .
Efforts to secure a peace settlement continued into Friday evening , with presidential chief of staff Jimmy Papadimitriu meeting with the protesting workers and company representatives , Meana said .
Meana confirmed one protester had died but said the cause remained unknown .
Labor leader Rafael Chavarria disputed the government version , saying four people were killed , CNN affiliate Telemetro TV reported Friday .
The confrontations left 105 people wounded , 35 of whom were transferred to hospitals in the capital , Panama City , due to the seriousness of their injuries , Meana said .
Bocas del Toro is about 300 miles ( 500 km ) from Panama City .
Authorities arrested 80 protesters , Meana said , noting that number could increase .
Protesters , in turn , abducted four police officers and were still holding them Friday evening , the spokeswoman said .
The violence seemed to abate Friday when the two sides sat down to talk .
Streets had remained blocked earlier Friday in the coastal city of Changuinola , near the border with Costa Rica , but those blockades had been removed by Friday night , Meana said .
The bridge over the Changuinola River also had been blocked , CNN affiliate TVN said .
Supermarkets were closed and residents were shopping at small neighborhood grocery stores , which were running out of food , TVN said .
The workers went on strike July 2 and have paralyzed much of the city with roadblocks and other measures .
The strike began , Meana said , because 5,000 workers at the Bocas Fruit Company had not been paid for two weeks .
The government , she said , is working to have the employees paid .
" The ministry of labor is going to apply sanctions against the company , " Meana said .
According to some news accounts , Thursday 's confrontations started when government troops moved in to clear roadblocks .
Video from Thursday 's demonstrations shows crowds of protesters hurling rocks at troops and clouds of tear gas rising from the streets .
A video broadcast on TVN shows a few protesters crouched behind a barricade made mostly of wooden pallets while eight helmet - clad soldiers holding see - through shields stand about 100 feet way .
The protesters are armed with sticks , rocks and Molotov cocktails , news reports said .
Presidential envoy Papadimitriu arrived in Bocas del Toro on Thursday and asked for calm and dialogue .
" Let 's leave the rocks , the weapons , " he was quoted as saying on the president 's Web page .
" We should sit down and reach a solution because this is not helping Bocas del Toro or the nation . "
Bocas del Toro , a popular seaside tourist destination , also is home to numerous banana plantations .
CNN 's Arthur Brice contributed to this report .

Study : Women less likely to keep cars clean
A British study indicates that women are marginally less likely to regularly wash their cars than men are .
A British study , the results of which were released this morning , suggests that more than half of all women go at least six months between washing their cars .
The study , conducted by Autoquake , found that about 56 percent of the United Kingdom women surveyed let their cars go unwashed for more than six months .
By comparison , 44 percent of the men surveyed were willing to go that long between washings .
The survey of over 1,000 U.K. drivers found that just 34 percent of all drivers washed their cars inside and out every six months , while only 13 percent do a full inside and outside wash once a year .
On the bright side , just 4 percent of those surveyed claim that they never wash their vehicles .
Women - at 5 percent - were slightly more likely to never wash their cars than men - at 3 percent .

Alright .
This post , we ’re going to take a look at how to put together some actual spells from the ground up .
The requests for spells came from you folks out there , but I ’m not going to work out all of them , only a few examples to show the thought processes involved .
If you ’re looking for a long , detailed list of possible spells , you ’re not going to get it here ; in my opinion , having a list like that undercuts one of the great things about playing a spellcaster in the game , which is the ability to use your powers creatively and come up with spells on the fly .
This post is focused on the sorts of things you need to take into account when creating a spell , and only secondarily is it intended to offer a little inspiration to the magically inclined out there * .
I ’m going to be using Harry ’s stats from Our World as the basis for the math in this post .
You can find his write - up on p136 , if you want to follow along at home .
Let ’s get started .
Get Away From Me !
In a couple of places in the book , Harry blasts a foe with an evocation that catapults them away from him , giving him time to run away or deal with something else .
Now , as with any evocation , there are lots of different ways to apply the various elements to produce the effect ; air and spirit are the most obvious , but a mystic wave of water or a blast of expanding air from a sudden heat source or the gravity of the target shifting 90 degrees would also all work .
For our purposes , let ’s go with spirit , in the guise of pure force slamming into the target and sending it flying .
Once we ’ve chosen the effect , we have to pick what mechanics we ’re going to use to model it .
For this effect , it ’s a little tough , because there are no rules for using evocation for movement – Harry points out that movement via evocation would be a wild , uncontrolled , unsafe thing .
Because we ’re applying this to an enemy , though , we do n’t mind those problems so much .
The obvious option is to model it as a maneuver , applying the Aspect Knocked Sprawling or something like that *.
If the point of the spell is to move the target one or more zones away from you while applying the Aspect , I ’d say that it would take extra power to do that .
And there we have the mechanic .
Next , we need to determine power requirements .
Assuming a standard mortal as a target , that ’s going to take 3 shifts of power to apply the maneuver .
However , if we also want to move the target one or more zones away , that ’ll take a little more power – I ’d say 1 per zone , plus another 1 for every level of barrier between zones that the target needs to move through .
So , Harry , with a Superb ( +5 ) Conviction , can call up 5 shifts of power for only a 1 - stress hit .
That ’s enough to toss a normal target 2 zones away if there ’s nothing in the way .
If there ’s a barrier : 1 fence in the way , the target ’s only going 1 zone away .
And a barrier : 2 wall means the target ’s not going anywhere .
Let ’s keep it at 5 shifts for our calculations .
So , 5 shifts is easy to call up , with only a 1 - stress price tag .
But it ’s still more power than Harry can readily control with his Good ( +3 ) Discipline and his focus item ( his staff ) .
He ’ll need to roll at least a + 1 on the dice to keep from having to worry about backlash and fallout , which he should be able to do 38.3 % of the time .
Assuming success , the target should probably get a chance to oppose with either an Athletics roll ( to dodge ) or Might roll ( to tough it out and not be moved ) .
Final version of the spell looks like this :
Knockback Type : Spirit ( force ) evocation , offensive maneuver Power : Varies ; typical is 5 shifts – 3 for effect plus 2 for distance Control : Roll Discipline plus appropriate specializations and focus items .
Duration : One action Opposed by : Target ’s Athletics or Might Effect :
If the spell hits , the target has Knocked Sprawling temporary Aspect applied , and is thrown one zone away from the caster for every extra extra shift of power .
Barriers between zones reduce the distance by their barrier value : i.e. , the shifts of power must overcome the barrier value to move the target through the barrier .
Notes :
GMs may wish to apply some damage to a target passing through – or failing to pass through – a solid barrier .
Feather Fall
A quick , simple spell to keep you from getting hurt when you fall .
This is a little more challenging than the above spell , partially because of the way falling works in DFRPG .
See , when you fall , you take a hit equal to 5 stress for every 10 full feet you fall , and most protections just do n’t work against it .
You need either supernatural toughness or a shielding spell specifically constructed to absorb falling damage .
Given the speed at which things fall , even evocation may not be fast enough to save you *.
Let ’s look at two different ways to save yourself from falling damage : through evocation and through thaumaturgy .
Evocation
For this , we ’re going to want to set up a block , obviously , focused on absorbing falling impact .
The obvious element for this one is air , though earth comes a close second , by lessening gravity and softening the surface .
But let ’s go with spirit , because Harry ’s better at it – forming a cushion of force for him to land on .
For every shift of power we channel into the spell , it ’s going to offset one shift of stress from the fall .
This means that the amount of power we want is going to vary depending on how far we ’re falling .
For simplicity ’s sake , let ’s go with 5 shifts , so that we take no damage from a 10 - foot fall , and only 5 shifts from a 20 - foot fall ; enough to be useful , but still practical to deal with in an evocation situation .
So , simple .
Pull in five shifts of power , and roll to control .
5 shifts is easy for Harry to call up with his Superb ( +5 ) Conviction , requiring only a 1 - stress hit on his Mental track * .
With his Good ( +3 ) Discipline and his shield bracelet focus item , he ’s effectively got a Great ( +4 ) Discipline , so he needs to roll a + 1 or better to soak up the 5 stress , which is again a 38.3 % chance for him .
Because he probably really needs this to work , let ’s hope he ’s got a Fate Point to spend .
Final version of the spell :
Featherbed Type : Spirit ( force ) evocation , defensive block Power : Varies ; typical is 5 shifts – enough to offset 10 feet of falling distance Control : Roll Discipline plus appropriate specializations and focus items .
Duration : One action Effect :
This spell reduces the number of shifts of damage taken from falling by the number of shifts of power in the spell .
Thaumaturgy
Thaumaturgy is far too slow to be of use when you get tossed off the side of a building , but if you know you ’re going to be facing down a feathered serpent on top of the Chrysler Building , you might want to consider a little preparation for the ( hopefully ) unlikely event that you ’re going to plummet to your doom .
Now , the rules do n’t explicitly talk about this sort of contingent spell , but the way wards work and can trigger magic shows the basic process .
What we ’re really doing here is designing a low - powered ward that is activated by falling a certain distance and , when activated , unleashes a stored evocation to cushion our fall .
So , for base complexity , we ’re talking about a single shift for the basic ward that we need to trigger the evocation – wards release stored spells when they fail , so we want this one to fail pretty quickly .
Add 2 more shifts for the conditional trigger , and then as much power as you want in the final protection – let ’s say 10 shifts , giving us a free 20 - foot fall .
Total complexity of 13 .
Now , Harry ’s got a Lore of Good ( +3 ) , so he needs to make up 10 shifts in order to be able to cast this spell .
So , how about he researches the basics in his library ( Lore : Basic Ritual Research ) , gets Bob to check his calculations ( Rapport : Bob ’s Input ) , tracks down where to find a peregrine falcon nest ( Investigation : Bird ’s Nest ) , sneaks past building security to get to the roof where the falcons are nesting ( Stealth : Through the Perimeter ) , and climbs out on the ledge of the building where the birds nest to snag some feathers ( Athletics : Flight Feathers ) .
That gives him an extra 10 shifts , so he can now cast the spell * .
Finally , Harry needs to pull in 13 shifts of power to make this work .
Given his Good ( +3 ) Discipline and lack of bonuses to thaumaturgic control of this type ( his specialty is Divination ) , he ’s probably safest going 1 shift at a time , which means it ’s going to take 13 rounds for him to actually cast the spell .
But this is the sort of thing where you usually do n’t have a lot of time pressure , so that ’s okay .
Harry needs to roll a - 2 or better on each of the rolls to successfully cast the spell .
That means he ’s got a 6.2 % chance of blowing any of rolls , which is as safe as he can possibly make it .
Once cast , the ward is going to last until the next sunrise , unless it ’s triggered .
When triggered , it lets go with a 10 - shift block against falling damage .
Final version of the spell :
Mystic Parachute Type : Thaumaturgy , wards Complexity : Varies , 13 is typical – 1 for the ward , 2 for the trigger condition , 10 for the defensive block Duration : Usually , until sunrise Effect :
Once cast , this ward is triggered whenever the recipient of the spell falls 10 feet or more .
When triggered , the ward creates a 10 - shift defensive block against the falling impact .
Variations :
This model can be used to create all sorts of triggered spell effects .
Psychometry
The primary tool for practitioners to get magical information is The Sight , but it ’s got a few risks .
First , you ’ve got to worry about the stress from whatever you see , and second , you ’ve got to figure out the meaning of the stuff you see .
It ’s a powerful , flexible tool , but it does n’t always fit the situation , especially if you ’re not dealing with magical stuff .
For psychometry of mundane objects or people , The Sight is not the best choice .
Let ’s look at a specific application of psychometry – Harry needs to find out who left a footprint in his backyard .
Obviously , this is going to be a thaumaturgic ritual* , and Harry ’s got a pretty good symbolic link , which is the footprint itself .
He needs to decide how he ’s going to use his magic to get the information he wants : he could trace a link from the footprint to the shoe , or call up the spirits of the grass for a description , or any one of a number of things .
Harry ’s a bit of a traditionalist , though , so he opts for looking into the past to see an image of the person who made the footprint .
If Harry were using mundane means , he ’d find the person who made the footprint using Investigation : taking a picture and maybe a cast of the print , comparing it to shoe types to find the brand and noting anything odd about the tread or wear pattern , finding out where the shoe is sold , sifting through customer lists , etc .
Doable , but difficult .
Let ’s set the difficulty at Superb .
The difficulty of the skill check is what sets the complexity of the ritual , so we ’ve got a ritual of complexity 5 right here .
Harry ’s Lore is Good ( +3 ) , so he needs to make up two shifts in order to cast this spell .
He spends a little time examining the rest of his yard looking for other footprints , to give himself a larger sample size for the ritual ( Alertness : Multiple Prints ) , and then he ’s ready to cast the spell .
He needs to call 5 shifts of power , and he ’s got a Control of Good ( +3 ) .
He ’s also got a specialty in Control ( Divination +1 ) , so he ’s effectively got a discipline of Great ( +4 ) for this ritual .
If he goes 1 shift at a time , he ’s going to take 5 rounds to cast the ritual , and need to roll - 3 or higher on each roll ; that means he has a 1.2 % chance of failing any given roll .
Should be easy for him .
Final version of the spell :
Psycometric Retrocognition Type : Thaumaturgy , divination Complexity : Varies , 5 is typical Duration : One scene Effect :
This spell allows the caster to see an image of a person linked to an item .
The person must be important to the item in some way : the current owner , the creator , the last person to touch it , the person who broke it , etc .
Up , Up , and Away !
In the Dresdenverse , spellcasters usually do n’t try flying spells , and there ’s a paragraph at the bottom of p282 of Your Story that explains why * .
It ’s a matter of control – just because you have the ability to fly does n’t mean you have the expertise to safely move through the air .
And given the penalty for falling from any sort of height , there ’s a real danger inherent to slipping the surly bonds of earth .
That said , building a flying spell is pretty simple , if the GM is going to allow it .
Personally , I would let someone get away with it if he or she built the character to show that he or she had spent time mastering the intricacies of aerial movement .
Here , I ’m thinking a minimum of a stunt to reflect the ability to use Athletics for flying , and preferably both the stunt and an Aspect to show the time and effort expended in gaining this off - beat skill trapping .
The guideline for gaining new powers by using magic are laid out in the sidebar of p283 of Your Story : what you need to do is transform yourself into a form with the new powers .
You need shifts of complexity equal the amount necessary to kill a target , plus you need to spend Fate Points to gain the temporary powers .
So , let ’s say Harry wants to be able to fly , binding the winds to hold him aloft and move him around , and his benevolent GM has okayed the attempt .
In my mind , though it ’s not listed anywhere in the rules that I can find , transforming a willing target should be easier than an unwilling one , so for purposes of this spell , Harry has to meet a complexity equal to all his possible consequences plus 1 , but does n’t need to overcome his Stress Track ( because he just decides to take all consequences rather than Stress ) , and his defense rating is locked at Mediocre ( +0 ) ( because he ’s not trying to resist the spell or defend against it in any way ) .
This sets the base complexity for the spell at 21 : 2 for his minor consequence , 4 for his moderate consequence , 6 for his severe consequence , 8 for his extreme consequence , and 1 to take him out .
The taken out effect becomes gaining the ability to fly .
Duration becomes very important for a spell like this .
I ’d start the default duration at a single scene* ( 15 minutes or so ) , so if Harry wants to be able to fly for longer than that , he needs to boost the complexity as well .
Let ’s say he needs to be able to fly for a day .
That increases the complexity by 5 , stepping him up the duration ladder from 15 minutes to a day .
Total complexity comes out at 26 .
In addition to this complexity , Harry has to pay Fate Points for the power , in essence temporarily lowering his Refresh to buy the power for the duration of the spell .
While there is no Flight power , there is Wings , which is a - 1 power .
That ’s close enough for our purposes , so Harry needs to pay a Fate Point for the power .
If he needed to fly super - fast , he ’d have to pay the Fate Point for Wings , plus another 2 , 4 , or 6 for the desired level of speed power .
But let ’s keep it just to flying .
Now , Harry ’s got a Lore of Good ( +3 ) .
That means he needs to make up a whopping 23 - shift deficit to be able to cast this spell , and he needs to have at least a single Fate Point left at the end to pay for the Wings * .
For convenience , let ’s say he goes through the same routine he did for the Magic Parachute spell above , giving him +10 .
After that , he buys some special incense for the ritual ( Resources : Ritual Incense ) , gets Listens - To - Wind to bless his falcon feathers ( Contacts : Shaman ’s Blessing ) , does a little research into the wind patterns over the city to find the optimal place to get the attention of wind spirits ( Scholarship : Air - Flow Map ) , fasts for a day to purify himself ( Endurance : Ritual Purification ) , spends an hour conducting a centering meditation ( Discipline : Focused Mind ) , and then drives out to where he ’s going to cast the spell and scares off the muggers in the park so he can work uninterrupted ( Intimidation : Quiet Workspace ) .
That bumps him up to a total of + 24 , so he ’s set to cast the spell .
Dealing with so much magic , there ’s a real potential that , if things go badly , Harry ’s going to be in a world of hurt , so he ’s going to go slowly with the actual casting , drawing one shift of power at a time .
With his Good ( +3 ) Discipline , that means that he needs to roll - 2 or better on each of his 26 (! ) rolls to get the power he needs and take to the air .
He ’s only got a 6.2 % chance of blowing any single roll , but with the large number of rolls , he ’s got about a 16.8 % chance of succeeding on all 26 rolls without needing to spend a Fate Point or take some backlash * .
Not an easy spell .
Final version of the spell :
Rite of Icarus Type : Thaumaturgy , transformation Complexity : 26 ; can vary depending on duration Duration : One day Effect :
When the caster completes this ritual , he or she must pay one Fate Point .
The caster then gains the ability to fly , as per the Wings supernatural power , for one day .
Unless the caster has some training in moving aerially ( reflected by an Aspect and / or stunt ) , the caster ’s Athletics is considered Terrible ( - 2 ) for purposes of moving by way of flight .
Variations :
This model can be used to gain any reasonable power , subject to GM approval .
Fate Point cost is equal to the refresh cost of the power acquired .
There you have five examples of building spells .
The mechanics get to be second nature pretty quickly once you get your head around a couple of basic concepts , so do n’t let it overwhelm you .
Come up with a couple of prebuilt spells that your character knows and you can see coming in handy during play , and work out all the math before hand to help speed things up during play , and you ’ll soon start to see the way things fit together .
Once that happens , building spells on the fly gets much easier and faster .
Next up in the Magic in DFRPG series is Math and Miscellany , where I ’m going to talk about how to work out bonuses from focus items and specialties , as well as some of the corner - cases of the magic rules : things like The Sight , Soulgazes , Potions , and so on .
* What I ’m really saying is , “ Come up with your own spells .
It ’s more fun for you , and you ’ll like them better . ”
Back
* As an alternative , use it as an attack , and ask the GM to make any consequence inflicted reflect the idea that the spell knocked the target back .
Back
* At least , not without the expenditure of Fate Points and a kindly GM … Back
* And let ’s be honest :
If we ’re falling off something tall enough to hurt us , we ’re in the kind of situation where we need to be monitoring our stress tracks carefully .
Back
* Plus , the player has come up with an interesting little story about how the spell is cast .
The story of the spell , remember .
Back
* Though I ’d be willing to rethink that if someone came up with a convincing – and cool – enough justification for using evocation .
Back
* In my mind , this is false .
I think a lot of spellcasters try flying spells ; they just give up on them real quick when they see the problems involved .
Back
* Though I ’d vary this based on circumstances , the intent of the character , and the needs of the story .
Back
* Or accept a compel to be named at a later time by the GM – a compel that he can’t refuse , no matter how many Fate Points he ’s got .
Back
* By contrast , having a Discipline of Great ( +4 ) would mean that he ’d have a 72.2 % chance of making the rolls .
Huge difference !

A new unstable version of GIMP has just been released and features layer groups , rich text formatting and more long anticipated features .
Read on !
It 's been almost a year since the previous unstable version of GIMP which is quite atypical for the project .
There 's a lot of changes , just listing all of them would take half of the review below .
So let 's focus on the changes that matter most .
Here they are :
optional single window mode ( beta ) ;
layer groups ;
locking layers , channels and masks ;
rich text formatting ;
improved painting dynamics ;
tools presets ;
OpenRaster support ;
new brushes ;
simple user interface language toggle .
Got interested ?
Download source code or a Windows build and play along !
Single window mode and related changes
Initially it was n't planned to introduce single window mode before v2.10 .
At Libre Graphics Meeting 2009 Peter Sikking , usability architect who has been working with the GIMP team since 2006 , provided only an outlook at possible new interface , there even was no functional specification at the time .
However Martin Nordholts figured out he was brave enough to give it a push and started working on single window mode in late September .
Few months later most of the code was in place , the rest was tweaking this and that , and now first results are available to you .
Here is an example of what it looks like :
Well , as you can see , it 's pretty much like a web browser right now : all images are in tabs , all dockable dialogs are docked to the only window .
You can navigate between images by clicking on thumbnails or using the common Ctrl + PgUp / PgDown key combination .
As mentioned above , the new mode is optional , so if you are a hardcore tiling window managers fan , just do n't use the switcher in the Windows menu .
Besides in the current version GIMP loads in multiple window mode anyway due to some unfinished code .
This will be addressed in further unstable releases .
The new mode resulted in a number of changes and cleanups here , there and everywhere .
First of all , dialogs now can be docked vertically as well .
That is , you can now dock tools options dialog to the right from tools toolbar , like on screenshot below , or give the Layers dialog its well deserved full vertical space when working on a complex project .
Another new feature is dragging contents of one image into another as a layer .
Just pick thumbnail of an image in the tab caption , drag it to another image 's caption , wait for the other image to open , drag further onto the image and drop it there .
Contents of the first image will be flattened to a single layer ( or , rather , a buffer ) and placed above all layers .
There is also a new handy menu item in the Windows menu : :
Apparently not everyone knows that one could use Tab to temporarily hide all docked dialogs .
This feature has been available since forever , but now it 's finally visible .
Tabs in the docked dialogs also could n't avoid changes .
They now have an automatic mode for captions .
It works like this : if there is a free space to the right from group of tabs , GIMP will try to find a tab with an automatic caption and add text to the right of the icon to fill the empty space :
Apart from that a whole bunch of cosmetic changes was applied to GIMP : a new icon for Desaturation tool to make it different from Gradient Fill tool , an updated ps-menurc file that contains hotkeys from Photoshop CS4 and so on and so forth .
Layer groups
Being able to group layers is quite important when you work on complex projects , hence it is a quite popular among web designers , for instance .
This feature also was n't initially planned for 2.8 either , but then Mitch Natterer just went ahead and did it .
Let 's just use the previous image as an example ( I should have used masks there really , but I was lazy ) :
The button that creates a layer group is next to the right from New Layer button .
By default a new layer group is created above currently selected layer .
To move an existing layer into a group just drag and drop it over there .
That 's it .
There is no limit to how many groups you can nest , so you can go wild :
For consistence sake border of a layer group has a cyan line around it on the canvas , and the place to the left from layer group 's caption in Layers dialog contains a thumbnail of group 's projection ( flattened representation ) , so when you collapse the group 's tree you still have an idea what 's inside and you can toggle visibility of the whole group on and off .
Locking content from changes
The work on layer groups resulted in implementation of yet another feature users had been asking for — locking pixel data from accidental changes .
Until now you could only lock alpha channel , but now you can protect actual pixels .
For that just click the brush button above list of layers :
When you switch to a layer with locked pixels , every painting , color or transformation tool 's cursor contains a " forbidden " icon :
Same thing is implemented for channels and paths .
Of course , it wo n't protect data from applying filters .
Rich text formatting
I do n't think much has to be said here .
Just look at what you can do inside one text layer now :
The look of the text options toolbar on canvas will definitely change in the future .
Most work was done by Mitch Natterer again .
Another developer , Barak Itkin , is planning to implement inline text color change in the coming versions .
In the future other tools will also have their basic options rendered on canvas .
There is a dedicated Google Summer of Code project for that this year .
Better painting dynamics
One of last year 's GSoC projects was advanced brush dynamics .
The student was mentored by Alexia Death who is in charge for all things painting in the GIMP project .
She spent some time polishing the student 's code and then merged it into main development branch .
The user interface was developed with assistance from Peter Sikking .
The changes are rather radical : the events - settings matrix is removed from every brush based tool and now is available as part of a dynamics preset .
There is a number of default presets for brush dynamics available in a new dialog .
Here is what it all looks like :
That is : you create a new brush dynamics preset , define options , give the preset a name and , if you wish , tag the newly created brush dynamic .
The dynamic presets are preserved across sessions .
As you can see , the matrix is now four times as large as in stable version ( 2.6.x ) .
Besides for each mapping of event to a brush parameter you can define a response curve .
For that choose a brush setting from combobox under dynamic 's name , click below to choose type of event and edit the curve .
New brushes
There is a plan to refresh GIMP assets in upcoming stable v2.8 , because really the old default pack of brushes and patterns looks prehistoric .
However , as Peter Sikking said , every proposed new brush , pattern and gradient will have to prove its usefulness for default bundle .
Right now there are four new acrylic brushes available in v2.7.1 .
These brushes ( on illustration above ) were created by Johannes Engelhardt .
More changes are coming .
Tools presets
Saving and loading tools presets is one of the features that have been available in GIMP for ages but has never been used much .
I have a suspicion that it 's because the user interface for that was barely usable : either you had to go through several levels of menus , or you had to use toolbar button that a lot of people disable to save screen space .
Besides the presets were available just for a current tool .
So if you wanted to switch from a brush to a particular pencil , you had to choose Pencil tool first , and then choose a preset .
The new implementation is a bit like in Photoshop : there is a common list of all presets , but the difference is that this list is in its own dockable dialog ..
A new preset is created from a current tool with all its current options , some of which you can override in a dialog that presents itself when you click a button to create a new preset :
To switch from one preset to another all you have to do is just click it .
OpenRaster support
OpenRaster file format project was started back in 2006 to make multilayer project data transferable between applications .
Thus far it is supported by GIMP , Krita , MyPaint and upcoming versions of Pinta and Nathive .
Importing and exporting of ORA files in GIMP was implemented by MyPaint superhero Jon Nordby .
Layer groups are not supported yet , but straightforward multilayer projects get transferred just fine .
The work on the file format 's specification is not completed yet , so there are some changes coming anyway .
Simple UI language toggle
Switching user interface language in GIMP has been giving willies to users ever since the project was started .
First of all , not everyone likes localized user interfaces .
I tend to blame Adobe and Corel for not bothering to provide as many localizations as possible which consequently led to a ) books on their software mentioning just English UI and b ) pirated , hacked localizations of very poor quality .
Now a whole generation of designers and photographers thinks that English UI the Right Thing and localized user interface is Evil and Not Professional .
Apart from that some users have specific demands , like running GIMP in one language , while system 's locale has some second language and the user him -/ herself has some third native language .
So starting with this version GIMP has a very simple interface language switcher in the Interface tab of Preferences dialog .
GIMP will still try to use language defined in system 's locale settings by default , but now you can override that .
After switching language you will have to restart GIMP .
Any other changes ?
The full list of changes is available here .
What 's next
Around this January Martin Nordholts decided to try estimating date of 2.8 release .
He cooked up a list of features that are likely to go into this version and judging by experience figured out how much time each feature would need to be implemented .
As a result release candidate of v2.8 is currently expected by the end of this year .
Apart from features that have already been started or even completed you might expect things like clipping / masking for layer groups , exporting to PDF , streamlined color management and improved assets management .
Bear in mind , however , that some features like vector layers have already been ditched from v2.8 plan .
As for 2.10 , the plans for this version are not set in stone .
It is known that it will feature GSoC projects of this year ( cage transform tool , more tools having options rendered on canvas ) and is likely to feature unified transform tool for which a functional specification is already written by Peter Sikking .
Full GEGL integration is unlikely to enter 2.10 , if the current state of affairs does n't change to the better .
With 3.5 active developers around ( rather 2.5 , for last couple of months ) there is very little place for miracles .
I feel there is a need to elaborate here a little to avoid confusions .
There are things the team aspires to do and there is reality in which achieving the goals is several years of hard work ahead .
GEGL project already has a history of initial developers burnt out and quitting .
You need several active contributors working in team to tame the beast .
The way I see it , getting new contributors involved is difficult when GIMP looks like a dinosaur winking back at you and grinning .
An application has to look smart to attract interested developers .
Therefore implementing a better user interface instead of starting work on GEGL integration right now is a good idea .
You do n't have to agree with me here , of course .
If you are developer who is interested in helping the team , but specifically interested in GEGL integration , you do n't have to wait few years to get started .
There is a number of changes that will be required to make this change happen anyway :
porting more file format loaders and savers to GEGL ;
porting existing GIMP filters to GEGL operations ;
implement support for 64 bit per color channel precision .
So you are not a developer and still want to help the team ?
This is perfectly fine .
As mentioned before , GIMP 2.8 is coming with new assets , so you could create good brushes and patterns that will be generic enough for a wide audience .
A dedicated announcement on that will be sent out soon .
You can also work on the default set of tutorials at gimp.org that currently look aging .
Remember : GIMP is a community project .
The more community is interested in its evolution instead of using pirated Adobe Photoshop , the faster GIMP evolves .

A lot of luxury homes have such memorable designs that everybody dream of live there and get inspiration for their own homes from them .
This house designed by Dane Design Australia is a perfect example of such design .
Located on a large site it consists of several separated pavilions focused on ten acres of deep clear water .
The zen - like design is chosen in order to make the home feel and function like a resort .
It has garden courts , gymnasium , spa and pool like every other resort .
Public and private spaces are separated by open and closed breezeways .
All pavilions are done in rich natural materials .

Image caption Abu Hamza : Fought long battle
The European Court of Human Rights has ordered a halt to the extradition to the US on terror charges of radical cleric Abu Hamza al - Masri .
Abu Hamza , jailed in the UK for soliciting to murder and racial hatred , and three other British men complained about the length of sentence they may face if convicted in the US .
Their cases will be delayed for further submissions to the Strasbourg court .
The Home Office said that the men would remain in custody .
The US has sought to extradite Abu Hamza , the former head of Finsbury Park mosque in north London , since 2004 , saying that he had attempted to set up a terrorism training camp in Oregon .
US ACCUSATIONS Abu Hamza : Hostage taking and attempts to set up terror training camp
Haroon Aswat : Alleged co-conspirator on training camp
Babar Ahmad : Supporting Taliban and targeting US Navy ships , fund - raising through extremist websites
Syed Ahsan : Alleged co-conspirator Hamza and suspects : Key allegations
The three other men facing extradition are Babar Ahmad , Syed Ahsan and Haroon Rashid Aswat .
Mr Ahmad and Mr Ahsan were allegedly involved in raising funds for exremists .
Mr Aswat is accused in relation to the alleged terror camp .
In each case , the US has indicated that the men face very long sentences in a " supermax " prison in Colorado .
The four applicants argued that the length of sentences they faced and the conditions of the prison , ADX Florence , breached their human rights .
The European Court said judges wanted to see more detailed arguments on the prison conditions and the effect of the length of sentences .
In the case of Abu Hamza , the court said he had no case against the conditions at the prison because he would spend only a brief spell there because of his disabilities .
Abu Hamza lost his hands in an explosion in Afghanistan and is partially blind .
Image caption Babar Ahmad was arrested in 2004
The other men could face a form of solitary confinement that some critics have dubbed prolonged psychological torture .
The court said there should be further legal argument on whether life without parole at the prison would breach the suspects ' human rights .
Two British courts have already approved the extraditions .
Abu Hamza has served half of his seven - year sentence and is now being held under extradition law .
The UK government must submit further arguments to the court by 2 September about why it should be allowed to extradite the four .
In a press statement , Strasboug said : " The court considered that there was no reason to believe that the US government would breach the terms of its diplomatic assurances [ not to designate the men enemy combatants ] .
" Nor did it consider that any of the applicants ' claims in respect of their trials in the US Federal Courts … would amount to a flagrant denial of justice .
Accordingly , those parts of the applicants ' complaints were declared inadmissible . "
But it said that the arguments over the length of the sentences that the men could face " raised serious questions " .
Abu Hamza , Mr Ahmad and Mr Ahsan face life sentences and US prosecutors have said that Abu Hamza could be jailed for 100 years .
Mr Aswat faces a maximum of 50 years .
UK Home Secretary Theresa May said : " " We note that the European Court of Human Rights has decided that all the applications are partly admissible .
We await the court 's judgement on the case .
In the meantime these individuals will remain in custody . "
A spokesman for Mr Ahmad said he was " very pleased " with the delay and that lawyers for the suspect were pressing the new government to allow him to be tried in the UK .
Prime Minister Julia Gillard says she respects the church and other religious groups in the wake of comments from a Catholic archbishop suggesting Christians might not vote for her .
Perth Archbishop Barry Hickey said Ms Gillard 's atheism could influence Christian voters not to vote Labor at the election on August 21 .
" While there is no indication that the present Prime Minister will undermine the special privileges that churches enjoy , some wonder what the future will bring , " Archbishop Hickey told The West Australian .
" Many Christians are concerned that someone who does not believe in God may not endorse the Christian traditions of respect for human life , for the sanctity of marriage and the independence of churches , church schools and church social welfare agencies . "

UPDATE : I just got a call from the CEO ’s executive team , and the full check is being overnighted !
Thank you to everyone that helped . 😀
Anyone that knows me personally or professionally knows that in January our house burned down .
Many of you know that we ’ve had problems getting our house replaced as well .
Oddly , while it would seem obvious to blame the insurance company , in this case Auto Owners ( our home owners insurance company , I know , funny name for homeowners ) has been amazing .
Our problems have been with Chase Manhattan .
Let me tell you a story about why there is n’t a house in this photo …
How Insurance Claims On House Fires Work
This process was n’t something I ever considered before , but it turns out it ’s a bit complicated if there is a mortgage on the house that burned .
It is a 4 step process :
The insurance company gets an appraisal of the structure , based on its value just before it actually burned .
This is for the dwelling only , not the property , etc .
The insurance company cuts a check for that amount to the homeowner AND the mortgage company .
The homeowner endorses the check , and sends it to the mortgage company for them to cash and send back to the homeowner to pay the contractor .
In our case , thanks to the crappy housing market , our dwelling appraised for a whopping $ 65,500 .
Once the house is set , the insurance company cuts another check to the homeowner and mortgage company for the difference in the original check and the actual cost of the house .
This is what “ replacement insurance ” on the dwelling means .
I endorse that check , send it to the mortgage company , and they cash and send it back made out to me and the contractor doing the work .
Yes , it ’s complicated , but legally that ’s what needs to happen .
The problem is that Chase wo n’t release all of the first check to me .
Since our house is a modular house , it ’s complete when delivered .
In fact , my house has been completed for weeks now , and is sitting in a warehouse in Indiana .
It ca n’t be delivered until the contractor has the cash to pay for it .
This might seem hinky .
The manufacturer needing COD for a house ?
But as it turns out , this is the norm .
Once the house they built is on private property , they have no legal right to it .
So , they insist on getting paid , especially since their job IS done .
The problem is that Chase is keeping back half of the first check .
This means the contractor ( the middleman between me and the housing manufacturer ) is expected to pay over $ 100,000 for a house while only being given roughly $ 44,000 .
( See , there was a $ 12,000 deposit the insurance company paid , plus that first half of the check already sent to the mortgage company ) .
If people were actually buying houses , the contractor might have enough capital to fund the house while Chase Manhattan dragged their heels .
Sadly , no one is buying .
No one is building .
In fact , here in Michigan , people are moving away because there are no jobs .
So that ’s what puts us in the current pickle .
Without the second half of the first check , which Chase Manhattan is holding ( and collecting interest on , I ’m sure ) , we are unable to get a house placed on the foundation .
check , which Chase Manhattan is holding ( and collecting interest on , I ’m sure ) , we are unable to get a house placed on the foundation .
Without an inspection of the house ON THE FOUDATION , Chase will not release the second check .
See the problem ?
Why Chase Manhattan Sucks Like The Tootsie Roll Center of the Galaxy
That was weeks ago .
No , really .
I ’ve been dealing with Chase Manhattan since mid-June trying to figure out a solution to the problem .
After hours of phone calls , and supervisors of supervisors , I finally got them to agree to investigate a deviation for us .
Mind you , for the past month I ’ve been faxing information they requested , getting paperwork notarized ( and re-notarized , do n’t ask ) , having my insurance company send explanation letters on company letterhead , etc , etc , etc .
Every step takes 48 - 72 hours .
Send a fax ?
It ’s not official for 48 - 72 hours .
Want a call back ?
48 - 72 hours .
Waiting for a decision ?
48 - 72 hours .
So now , I ’ve reached what seems like the end of my ability .
I ’ve been the patient customer , holding for literally hours .
I ’ve been the irate customer , immediately demanding to speak to supervisors by name .
I ’ve been the annoying customer , and when given a direct line , left multiple messages .
It never does any good .
At all .
Here is what I ’m hoping : That you might help .
Lord knows you ’ve all helped my family before .
I ’m only asking here for publicity .
If you know someone at Chase , please send them to my blog .
If you are on Twitter , please tweet a link if you ’re OK with that sort of thing .
If you work at Chase , by all means , PLEASE email me .
If you are Jamie Dimon , dude , you should know how poorly your company treats its customers .
Here is a list of email addresses .
I ’m sure they ’re not all valid , I just came up with them based on the standard structure for Chase email addresses .
They are the names of the company board members , CEO , and some of the managers I ’ve spoken with inside Chase .
I ’m not asking you to email bomb these folks , but feel free to add any addresses in the comments so I can email them as well :
List deleted , since they ’ve finally done the right thing !
My house is done .
It ’s been done for weeks .
It would be really nice if the next 48 - 72 hours actually accomplished something .
You have my thanks .
Al Neuharth President Obama has made one right decision on Afghanistan .
This week , he fired Gen. Stanley McChrystal , whose own frustrations about the likelihood of losing the war caused him to sound off sarcastically about the top civilian advisers or decision - makers .
Now Obama has a chance to make a second sound call : Bring all our troops home from Afghanistan sooner rather than later .
Most of us across the USA agree that the Afghanistan war was necessary when President George W. Bush went after Osama bin Laden and his gang following 9/11 .
But most of us now think Afghanistan has been an unnecessary war since that gang escaped to Pakistan .
Obama inherited the Afghanistan war .
But he made the mistake of escalating it rather than ending it .
His goal is not to catch bin Laden or his gang .
It is to try to make Afghanistan a new nation .
If he were a student of history , he would know better .
Past efforts : • Great Britain tried to help govern Afghanistan with three wars between 1839 and 1919 .
It failed each time and lost more than 28,000 lives .
• Russia ( then the USSR ) left after nine unsuccessful years in Afghanistan in the 1980s , with approximately 14,000 Soviet soldiers killed .
We 've been there nearly nine years and have lost the lives of 1,039 servicemen and women .
Obama did n't recognize that Gen. McChrystal 's crusty comments were based on his frustrations of the hopeless nation - building effort .
He has a chance to recover by admitting that our presence in Afghanistan is a shameful waste of lives and money .
If Obama does n't get it and get us out , he 'll likely lose his 2012 re-election bid .
Too bad for a guy with so much promise .

Over bingo .
Alabama Rep. Mary Moore , a Democrat from Birmingham , was in such a twisty - tie over this week 's gambling task force raid on Greenetrack that on Thursday she let us in on a secret .
She 's been studying the law , she said , to see what it would take for Greene County to secede from the state of Alabama .
I thought she was kidding .
I thought she was blowing more hot air into the scorching Eutaw haze .
I went back to make sure , to ask her ...
Are you serious ?
Yep , she said .
She 's eyeing , for her potential new state , the entire 7th Congressional District , which runs from Birmingham southwest to the Missisippi line , and includes much of Birmingham and the University of Alabama .
" It includes the majority of Alabama 's black counties , " she said .
" Alabama has done nothing for us . "
Moore was mad Thursday , speaking to an even madder crowd along with other members of the Legislative Black Caucus .
The more folks spoke , the madder they got .
In the space of an hour Gov. Bob Riley was decried as a terrorist and a criminal ; a liar , racist and hypocrite ; a scoundrel ; a lame duck trying to pay off debts ; a wet nurse to Mississippi casinos ; a Grinch out to steal the Fourth of July ; and my personal favorite -- " a mean , lowdown raccoon . "
Like I said , they 're mad .
It 's easy , outside the wasteland that is Alabama 's Black Belt , to laugh at the rhetoric , to wonder when bingo became a civil rights issue worthy of a " We Shall Overcome " soundtrack .
It 's easy to laugh , but it is not funny .
For while the words are sharp , they dull the point of the protest .
In the end they only obscure the real suffering that will take place if Greenetrack closes .
Because Greenetrack is pretty much all there is in Greene County .
It employs almost 400 , and funds schools and police , 911 service and the nursing home .
It gives scholarships for any Greene County kid who makes it to college , and provides insurance and opportunity .
It is easy to feel the pain of people like Latoya Pelt , a Greentrack cashier .
She just bought her first house .
She fears she 'll lose it .
Riley 's task force types dismiss the sob stories .
They say the economics are sad , but are not the issue .
The law is the law , after all , and you would n't let a county run a dope ring just because it makes money .
But that 's hard for Greene County to understand .
The Legislature did pass a constitutional amendment allowing county residents to vote on electronic charity bingo , and voters said yes .
The Alabama Supreme Court later issued guidelines for electronic bingo machines .
The way the task force interprets those guidelines , machines at Greenetrack are illegal and therefore ... something like dope .
And thus the anger .
Greene County thought it played by the rules , even if it did not .
People want to know ...
Why now ?
And what next ?
There 's no good answer .
So when they hear Riley called a terrorist , they cheer .
When Moore talks of secession , they listen .
Even if it is like listening to the wind .
I asked Moore , by the way , what she would name her new state .
" Seven , " she said , after the district that spawned it .
I 've got a better one , though :
" 777 . "

GRENOBLE , France ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Veteran US singer Al Jarreau was in a stable but “ worrying ” condition in a French hospital on Friday after falling ill just before he was due to go on stage , health officials said .
Jarreau — whose jazz , pop and soul songs have won him seven Grammy awards — was about to begin a festival concert late Thursday in the Alpine town of Barcelonette when he was taken ill with an unduly rapid heart beat .

The 70 - year - old was treated on the spot for a couple of hours but was later flown by helicopter to a hospital intensive care unit in nearby Gap where he was admitted with breathing and heart problems , hospital staff said .
The hospital said he was in a “ critical ” condition when he arrived but on Friday Pierre - Yvan Simonoviez told reporters that “ his condition stabilised by late morning but remains worrying given that he is still in intensive care ” .
“ He is conscious , awake but tired , ” he said , adding that the singer would remain in the Gap hospital until Sunday at the earliest .
He said the singer ’s age and the demands of his current tour had likely contributed to his malaise .
Jarreau ’s French trip was part of a tour scheduled to take him to Germany , Austria and Azerbaijan , and he was due to give concerts in the United States and Japan in the coming months , according to his website .
The Milwaukee - born singer ’s lengthy career has encompassed many musical styles .
He has won Grammy Awards in the genres of jazz , pop and rhythm and blues and released more than 20 albums between 1975 and 2009 .

Jarreau ’s affable ever - smiling personality and range of musical styles have made him popular with a wide audience all around the world .
As a teenager he started singing in Milwaukee bars .
After a degree in social sciences from the University of Iowa , he headed west , where he soon teamed up with the Brazilian guitarist Julio Martinez , and started playing in a club in Sausalito , near San Francisco .

Jarreau made his big breakthrough in Los Angeles in 1975 , when he was invited to perform at the Hollywood Troubadour Club .
His debut album , “ We Got By ” , came in the same year ; it was to prove an international hit .
In 1977 he went on a world tour and released his third disc , “ Look to the Rainbow ” .

By 1981 Jarreau had become a household name , and his album “ Breakin ’ Away ” with its hit song “ We ’re in this love together ” made it into the US top 10 , winning him two Grammys , for jazz and pop vocals .
His music had by then evolved towards pop , including the improvisational singing style known as scat .
The 1990s saw more hit albums : “ Heaven and Earth ” in 1992 , which added R and B to the list of his Grammy awards , and then “ Tenderness ” in 1994 .

The following YouTube video is a live Al Jarreau performance from 1993 , and he is performing “ Teach Me Tonight , ” with entertainer Lionel Ritchie playing the saxaphone .
As I said in a previous entry I came across KnJ by reading a site that called it the worst anime of 2000 .
I 've since finished watching the anime and read the manga to this date .
When searching I 've also come across discussion and reviews of KnJ .
However many of them have been of very poor quality .
The other thing that draws me to do this is the controversy that surrounds this anime .
Controversy is a type of conflict and from conflict is the source of all drama .
If I was more post modern I would be critiquing the controversy itself as a text but that would be silly .
Instead I 'm going to critique the reviews instead , at least they have some form of concrete instantiation .
So I should start at the beginning the first review I read , toonzone .
net 's " Toons of the 2000s anime we hope never come to America " .
The article does n't so much review as a commentary on KnJ 's reputation .
Given the lack of direct comment on the anime itself it makes me wonder if the author watched the show or just depended on secondary sources .
Toonzone 's central thesis is that lolicon element is " exploitative and pervasive " .
Does this charge stand up to scrutiny .
First we must define what we mean by exploitative .
I would say an element is exploitative if it exists purely there to shock , arose or otherwise stimulate the audience rather then tell a story , or when the story becomes a fig - leaf for the element .
For example the pantlessness in strike witches is exploitative as it contributes little to the plot and is just there to entertain fans of girls panties .
On the other hand Haruhi molesting Mikuru Asahina is n't exploitative as it demonstrates Haruhi 's disregard for personal space and conventional morality .
So does the lolicon serve the story or is it the other way around ?
The first clue on which way this falls is be looking at the demographics for the show on youtube , as well as males 18 - 24 and males 45 - 85 ; KnJ is popular with girls 13 - 17 .
Now unless Japanese high schools are overflowing with lolicon lesbians there must be some element other then the lolicon that they are enjoying .
Now as a 30 something year old male from Australia knowing what a 13 year old girl enjoys is n't something I 'm able to do .
Furthermore I 'm not going to seek out a young fan and start a conversation with them on this topic , such an act would most likely risk me getting arrested .
My interpretation is that in Kodomo no Jikan the lolicon elements and the fan service comes naturally from the story .
Rin is a prematurely sexualized girl and the plot is in part Aoki attempting to find thecause of Rin 's behaviour and deal with her emotional problems .
The first season 's arc ends with Rin shaking Aoik 's hand and saying to herself that for the time being that this is enough for her .
As to the pervasiveness of the lolicon content , the quantity of it varies from episode to episode for example episodes six and twelve have very little lolicon fan service .
If its sole reason for existence was fan service then the last episode of the season , the climax episode would be chock full of it but the reverse happens .
Onto the youtube reviewers .
Let discount Middle of the Oreo 's first review which was his first and more or less a gag reaction vid then a real review .
To be honest his second review is n't much better its sort of a vague rambling description of the characters .
Short Fat Otaku 's review .
Now he admits that he only watched the first episode and the first is one of the weakest episodes of the anime .
From it he seriously misreads the character of Aoki calling him a pedophile and speculating that later on in the story he will try to maintain a romantic relationship with Rin .
The problem with this interpretation is that regardless of Kuro 's accusations to the contrary Aoki has no romantic or sexual desires for Rin .
Even in the first episode , the first thing Aoki says after thenotorious changing room scene is " They do n't have anything worth looking at anyway " he simply does n't find flat chested prepubescent girls sexually desirable .
Much of the humour derives from Rin 's attempts to seduce the unwilling teacher and much of the drama derives from his efforts to find the cause of Rin 's behaviour .
If Aoki does love Rin its familial love rather then erotic love .
But SFO does pick up on of the central themes of the anime , Aoki 's inability to relate to Rin and the other students in his class .
To quote the anime .
Rin : I hurt Reiji ... Aoki : KokonoeRin : Reiji already had a scar ... in spite of that I want to returnto school but Reiji can't be left alone .
Aoki : I understand .
No ... I do n't understand , I only had myself .
I lived in a normal house and grew up normally .
Really its so normal its boring .
That 's why I do n't know muchabout Kokonoe , not much about about Usa , not much about KagamiNot much about the entire class but I want to be able tounderstand them .
But as I got to know you more the less Iwish to give up .
You taught me how little I know .
Given that part of his role as a teacher is to relate to his students and help them this bothers him greatly .
Aoki is continuously trying different approaches to bridge this gap .
While things may be a matter of differing interpretations influenced by short fat only watching the first ep his section on Kagami is just plain factually incorrect .
"
Why the fuck is the third girl [ Kuro Kagami ] an out and outcarpet muncher .
I have nothing against gays and lesbians .
Butis sexual orientation something that ( a ) completely determined atnine and ( b ) your willing to act on so decisively at such ayoung age .
" As I pointed out in http://qtplatypus.livejournal.com/14247.html a significant number ( 11 % ) of lesbians who realize there orientation in grade school [ 1 ] .
I hope you will forgive me for dipping into the vocabulary of queer theory but there is a clear heteronormative bias in Short Fat Okatu 's writing .
He questions Kuro 's same sex orientation but not Rin or Mimi 's opposite sex orientation .
SFO must be taken to task also for his calling Kuro " carpet muncher " he conflates behaviour and orientation .
That is lesbians are not lesbians because they lick another womans genitals , they are lesbians because they love women .
By using the term " Carpet muncher " one supports the inaccurate characterization that homosexuality is all about sex .
Actually the manga and anime treat Kuro with a seriousness I 've never seen anime treat GLBT youth .
Unlike for example Card Captura Sakura 's Tomoyo Daidouji or Magical Lyrical Nanoha 's leads not only is the lesbianism a part of the text rather then the subtext but in the fact that Kuro gets a coming out scene in the Ni Gakki OVA .
Kuro : I really like this kid .
I 've liked this kid since the first grade .
Shiro :
Is that so .
Shiro ( thinking ) : Kids these days are maturing so quickly .
Kuro :
This kid ... she 's a girl .
Shiro : Hea ?
Kuro :
Even though we are friends I really want to kiss her and stuff .
When we hold hands my heart races .
Shiro - chan , what do you think ?
Shiro ( thinking ) : OK , let 's see that child psych class I took in collage said something about this .
They saidthat at a young age , same - sex attractions are often transitory .
Shiro :
Do not worry .
Kuro : ( Happy gasping sound ) Shiro :
If you do n't think about it , you 'll turn out normal by the time you grow up .
Kuro :
What do you mean " normal " ?
What 's so strange about me ?
Am I not normal ?
Just forget it .
Forget that we ever spoke !
Interestingly the Japanese perspective on schoolgirl lesbians and SFO 's western perspective can be contrasted in that scene .
In mainstream western thought homosexuality is viewed as sexual thing a thing within the adult domain however in Japanese thought lesbianism between young girls is considered an emotional thing something that one grows out of as one becomes an adult .
The final point I wish to make about SFO 's review is that he strips away the context to make a point that if the context was present would undermine his point .
For example he shows a scene where Rin isdropping her panties in the presence of Aoki while with a mouth full of moral indignation he yells " Oh my GOD ! " .
However if he allowed the scene to speak for itself why Rin was acting as she was would have been revealed .
The scene in question starts with Aoki and Rin discussing how Rin had harassed her previous teacher until he had a mental breakdown and quit .
After Rin states that she feels no guilt for doing this , that her action was justified because the teacher had emotionally abused Mimi Aoki responds that he will need to discuss it with her parents .
It is at this point Rin drops her panties and delivers the line " If I screamed ' HELP ' what to you think would happen ? " .
In context this scene is n't a girl meaningless act of fan - service .
Its a girl blackmailing her teacher so that he does n't call her parents .
Now a legitimate critique of the work could challenge the effectiveness of this scenes execution , the necessity of using the camera angle used and if it works from the perspective of the narrative .
But to simply cherry pick the scene , strip it of all context is at best misleading and worst an act of intellectualdishonesty .
In contrast Vixen 's review of Kodomo No Jikan speaks of her professionalism .
She watched the entire anime and gave a commentary based on its actual strengths and weaknesses .
Even her rant aboutlolicon and pedophilia which seems mandatory for these reviews had a degree of nuance .
There are a few points I did wish to draw her up on .
I was going to rant about how vixen reifies between real little girls and fake little girls but that ended up in the previous rant so read that .
The other point I wished to address was vixen 's statement that Aoki would n't of had certain " reactions " if his thoughts where pure .
Those reactions are governed by the autotomic nervous system rather then the conscious mind ; sometimes it just takes friction to activate it .
As Vixen correctly points out we do n't see Kuro 's mother in the first season , but she has a brief appearance in the OVA I mentioned above .
She 's some form of professional who is rarely at home and takes littleinterest in raising her only child .
Also I do found it interesting that Vixen is the only one who did n't criticise Mimi for the size of her breasts .
Vixen 's review was concise , accurate and informative , a rare gem among otherwise impoverished field .
Doing this little exercise thought me much .
Though I suspect I learned more about myself and the process of reviewing rather then about what I reviewed .
To do a review properly even the half ass effort I made here requires a thorough examination of the source material .
Also I learned allot doing the background research much I did n't even get to use .
I just hope that my readers enjoyed this half as much as I did in preparing it .
Though I suspect that my motivations for such a strident defence of this anime is because the author has managed to create in me sympathy for Rin and seeing attacks on her motivates me to attempt to defendher .
Pulling that off is a pretty big accomplishment .

Beer .
It 's what 's for breakfast .
We know what some of you are thinking .
Beer for breakfast , Who does that ?
But the true advocate of craft beer knows there is nothing quite like waking up on a Sunday morning , making scrambled eggs and bacon and cracking open 22 ounces of your favorite brew .
Whether you call it an eye - opener , hair - of - the - dog or a drinking problem , check out our list of beers to grab the night before to compliment your biscuits and gravy in the morning .
1. Founder 's Brewing Co. KSB ( Kentucky Breakfast Stout ) 11.20 % ABV
If you can get your hands on a bottle of this , consider yourself lucky .

Founder 's took an imperial stout and loaded it up with coffee , chocolate and vanilla and then hid it away in bourbon barrels , resulting in an easy to drink black beer with a coffee kick .
2. Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar 6.20 % ABV
If you crave something sweet for breakfast , give this one a try -- a strong brown ale that is n't joking around when it comes to flavor .
A strong hazelnut with just a dash of hops makes this beer a perfect match for pancakes .
3. Bells Expedition Stout 10.50ABV
This Russian Imperial
Stout is a high alcohol beer that does n't try to hide it .
As thick and black as tar , with a dark roast coffee flavor , only the truly daring would try and get more then one of these down before noon .
Definitely a beer for sipping .
4. Lost Coast Brewery Tangerine Wheat 5.00 % ABV

This candy - scented wheat beer is crisp , clean and refreshing .
Try mixing it with orange juice for a beer mimosa .
5. Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast 7.50 % ABV
In the tradition of good breakfast beers , Mikkeller put together this easy drinking coffee stout .
Unlike the KSB , Beer Geek Breakfast has a bit of an earthy flavor -- notably more hops and less of a coffee taste , but still enough flavor to replace your morning cup of joe .
6. Kona Brewing Pipeline Porter 5.3 % ABV
This is a great morning - time beer for a hot summer day .
It still retains all the flavor of a coffee beer , but this porter is much lighter then its imperial stout cousins .
Made with freshly roasted 100 % Kona coffee .
7. Dogfish Head Black & Blue 10 % ABV
If any beer should come with a warning , it 's this one .
Bursting with the taste of fresh blueberries but without the artificial taste of most fruit beers , this beer is so easy to drink you do n't realize its high alcohol content until it 's too late .
We recommend you pair it with a plate of French toast with powered sugar on top .
8. Left Hand Brewery Juju Ginger Ale 4 % ABV
Ginger beer is n't for everyone , but if you 're a fan , this is one of the best out there .
Lighter in ginger taste then most true ginger ales , this is a great beer for mornings when you actually have to be somewhere and cannot commit to a 12 % beer .
9. Michelada or " Red Beer "
The Michelada is your best bet when you are in desperate need of a little hair - of - the - dog .
Think of it as the Bloody Mary of the beer world .
Start with a salt rimmed chilled pint glass , add your favorite Mexican beer and top it off with a healthy dose of Bloody Mary mix or tomato juice .
All the benefits of a Bloody Mary without the vodka .
Yum !
10 . Bacon Beer
OK , we 'll be honest :
This is a fantasy beer .
We have heard tales of such a beer existing but of course it was at a brewery in Washington .
We have also heard that a German beer called Rauchbier has a smoked taste to it that somewhat resembles bacon .
One day we hope to taste the perfect bacon beer but until we learn to brew our own we 'll just keep dreaming .
You 've come to the right place .

KHARTOUM ( Reuters ) - A total of 221 people died in tribal fighting and other violence in Sudan ’s Darfur in June , peacekeepers said on Sunday , as the region ’s two main rebel groups continued to shun peace talks .
Violence has spiked in the arid western territory since the insurgent Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) suspended its participation in negotiations in Qatar in early May .
The fighting , which first surged in 2003 when mostly non- Arab rebels took up arms demanding more autonomy , has persisted in the face of a series of failed ceasefires and diplomatic pressure from Washington and other powers .
“ After assessing security reports for the past month , UNAMID estimates the number of fatalities due to armed conflict and criminality in Darfur in June to be 221 , ” the joint U.N. / African Union UNAMID peacekeeping force said in a statement .
Recent death tolls have been much higher than last year -- UNAMID recorded 67 violent deaths in October and 16 in June 2009 .
In August last year , departing UNAMID commander Martin Luther Agwai said the region was no longer in a state of war .
The recent surge has been fueled by an increase in clashes between rebels and government troops , together with tribal tensions not directly linked with the conflict .
Nearly 140 of the June deaths were caused by long - running feuds between the rival Arab Rizeigat and Misseriya groups , UNAMID said .
However , tribal fighting had dwindled after leaders of the two groups signed a treaty at the end of June .
The rebel Sudan Liberation Army , which started the Darfur revolt with JEM in 2003 , is demanding the return of security in the region before talks and has also reported clashes with Sudan ’s army in recent weeks .
Its Paris - based leader Abdel Wahed Mohamed al - Nur said last week he had been holding consultations with Qatari officials but would still not go to the talks in the capital Doha because of the worsening security situation .
The Sudanese government is negotiating with the Liberation and Justice Movement ( LJM ) , an umbrella group of small factions dismissed as largely bogus by the JEM .
May was Darfur ’s bloodiest month in more than two years with UNAMID reporting nearly 600 deaths in rebel and tribal fighting .
Observers say the recent death tolls are still dwarfed by the early days of conflict in 2003 and 2004 , when the government launched a counter - insurgency campaign that Washington and some activists call genocide .
Khartoum dismisses the accusation .
Official estimates of the total death count range from 300,000 , according to U.N. humanitarian chief John Holmes , to 10,000 according to the Sudanese government .
Both figures date back to mid-2008 .
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir to face charges of ordering atrocities in the region .

When developing the original Ogg backend for Firefox we had to integrate and use a number of C libraries .
Over the months after landing a number of bugs were raised for various issues in the backend .
A fair number of these were the result of common coding errors .
Things like not checking return values of the C API calls and not releasing resources correctly .
This was internal to the third party libraries we used as well as in our own code .
This has made me interested in looking at programming languges that make these sorts of errors easier to find .
I 've previously written about ATS , a programming language with dependent and linear types .
With ATS you can use C code directly and annotate the code with types to make some usage errors detectable at compile time .
Some papers that cover this usage of ATS are :
In this post I look at ways of using a C library from ATS that shows dealing with static checking of return values and resource releasing .
I start from a simple wrapper and then explore how I can use ATS to make usage of the API safer from common programmer errors .
The library I 'm using to do this is libcurl .
A simple usage of libcurl to retrieve the HTML from a URL and print it to stdout is ( simple . c ) :
#include < curl / curl.h > int main ( void ) { CURL * curl ; CURLcode res ; curl = curl_easy_init( ) ; curl_easy_setopt(curl , CURLOPT_URL , " bluishcoder.co.nz " ) ; res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ; curl_easy_cleanup( curl ) ; return 0 ; }
This can be compiled and run with :
$ gcc -o simple simple .c `curl - config -- libs` $ ./ simple ...
Ensuring release of resources
My first attempt at translating this into ATS is in simple1.dats ( pretty - printed version ) :
%{^ #include < curl / curl.h > %} absviewtype CURLptr ( l:addr ) // CURL * abst@ype CURLoption = $ extype " CURLoption " macdef CURLOPT_URL = $ extval ( CURLoption , " CURLOPT_URL " ) extern fun curl_easy_init ( ) : [ l:addr ] CURLptr l = " #curl_easy_init " extern fun curl_easy_setopt {l : addr} {p: type} ( handle : !CURLptr l , option : CURLoption , parameter : p ) : int = " #curl_easy_setopt " extern fun curl_easy_perform {l:addr} ( handle : !CURLptr l ) : int = " #curl_easy_perform " extern fun curl_easy_cleanup {l:addr} ( handle : CURLptr l ) : void = " #curl_easy_cleanup " implement main ( ) = let val curl = curl_easy_init( ) ; val res = curl_easy_setopt(curl , CURLOPT_URL , " www.bluishcoder.co.nz " ) ; val res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ; val ( ) = curl_easy_cleanup( curl ) ; in ( ) end ;
The ' main ' function looks very much like the C code .
The definitions before that make the libcurl C functions , types and enums available to ATS .
To compile and run this code :
$ atscc -o simple1 simple1.dats `curl - config -- libs` $ ./ simple1 ..
The libcurl type CURLoption is a C enum .
To wrap this in ATS I use $ extype to refer to the C name directly :
abst@ype CURLoption = $ extype " CURLoption "
I only reference one value of these types .
That is CURLOPT_URL and again I reference the C value directly .
Since this is a value rather than a type I use $ extval :
macdef CURLOPT_URL = $ extval ( CURLoption , " CURLOPT_URL " )
The CURL type is an abstract type in C - we do n't care what it is actually composed of .
A CURL object is always refered to via a pointer .
This is modeled in ATS with :
absviewtype CURLptr ( l:addr ) // CURL *
Think of ' CURLptr ' as being ' a reference to a CURL object ' .
It 's basically a C ' CURL *' .
The definition above states that a CURLptr is an object of type ' CURLptr ' located at a memory address 'l ' .
The C definition of curl_easy_init looks like :
CURL * curl_easy_init( void ) ;
The ATS definition is :
extern fun curl_easy_init ( ) : [ l:addr ] CURLptr l = " #curl_easy_init "
The ' extern ' at the beginning and the ' # curl_easy_init ' at the end means that the implementation of this function is a C function called ' curl_easy_init ' in an external library .
The ' [ l : addr ] ' following the function name gives the type of the 'l ' used in the return type - that being a pointer .
The return type is ' CURLptr l' which I described previously .
The function returns a CURLptr object located at pointer address 'l ' .
The C definition of curl_easy_setopt looks like :
CURLcode curl_easy_setopt( CURL
*curl , CURLoption option , ... ) ;
It is a C function that takes a variable number of arguments .
For this example I 'm only using one additional parameter so I cheat and declare it in ATS as accepting one .
I 'll cover how to do variable argument functions later .
The ATS definition is :
extern fun curl_easy_setopt {l : addr} {p: type} ( handle : !CURLptr l , option : CURLoption , parameter : p ) : int = " #curl_easy_setopt "
The function takes three arguments and returns one .
The arguments it takes are :
a '! CURLptr l ' .
As described before this is a CURLptr object located at address 'l ' .
The '!' means curl_easy_setopt does not consume the object - we can continue to use it later .
The 'l ' is declared to be of type ' addr ' earlier in the definition using {l : addr} .
a ' CURLoption '
a parameter value of type ' p ' .
This is of type ' type ' ( from the {p:type} earlier in the definition ) .
This is the type of all ATS objects that fit in a machine word ( pointers , integers , etc ) .
The remaining two CURL functions used in the example are variants of these .
The main difference is in the ATS definition of ' curl_easy_cleanup ' :
extern fun curl_easy_cleanup {l:addr} ( handle : CURLptr l ) : void = " #curl_easy_cleanup "
Here the ' handle ' parameter is a ' CURLptr l ' .
There is no '!' before it .
This means the function consumes the argument and it cannot be used after this call .
The type ' CURLptr l ' is a linear type .
It must be destroyed at some point in the program and once destroyed it can not be re-used .
By defining ' curl_easy_cleanup ' in this way we enforce a contract which states that the programmer must call this function if they have a live ' CURLptr l' object .
You can see this in practice if you remove the cleanup call and try to compile .
A compile error will result .
A compile error will also occur if you try to use the curl handle after the cleanup call .
Because of the usage of the linear type we 're already safe from one class of common programmer error .
That of not calling cleanup functions for allocated objects .
Handling NULL pointers
There is a bug lurking in this version ( and the C program ) .
' curl_easy_init ' can return NULL and if it does you should not call any other curl functions .
Using ATS we can define things in such a way that it is a requirement to check for NULL to successfully compile .
A modified version of the example with the changes to support this is in simple2.dats ( pretty - printed version ) .
In this version we expand on the type CURLptr by adding two typedefs .
One for pointers which can be NULL ( CURLptr0 ) and one for pointers which cannot be NULL ( CURLptr1 ) :
absviewtype CURLptr ( l:addr ) // CURL * viewtypedef CURLptr0 = [ l : addr | l >= null ]
CURLptr l viewtypedef CURLptr1 = [ l : addr | l > null ]
CURLptr l
The definitions of the Curl functions that are used are changed to use these types in the appropriate places :
extern fun curl_easy_init ( ) : CURLptr0 = " #curl_easy_init " extern fun curl_easy_setopt {p : type} ( handle : !CURLptr1 , option : CURLoption , parameter : p ) : int = " #curl_easy_setopt " extern fun curl_easy_perform ( handle : !CURLptr1 ) : int = " #curl_easy_perform " extern fun curl_easy_cleanup ( handle : CURLptr1 ) : void = " #curl_easy_cleanup "
' curl_easy_init ' is changed to return a CURLptr0 since it can return NULL .
The other functions use CURLptr1 to signify they must not be NULL .
Now if we keep the ' main ' function as before without checking the result of ' curl_easy_init ' we get a compile time error saying the type of the ' curl ' variable does not match that required by ' curl_easy_opt ' .
The fix is to add a check for NULL :
implement main ( ) = let val curl = curl_easy_init( ) ; val ( ) = assert_errmsg ( CURLptr_isnot_null curl , " curl_easy_init failed " ) ; val res = curl_easy_setopt(curl , CURLOPT_URL , " www.bluishcoder.co.nz " ) ; val res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ; val ( ) = curl_easy_cleanup( curl ) ; in ( ) end ;
The compiler knows that after the assert check that ' curl ' must not be NULL .
This allows the remaining parts of the program to typecheck .
Enforce checking of return values
Another common error is that of not checking the return values of C api calls for errors .
This proved to be an issue in the first versions of the Firefox Ogg video backend where return values were not checked in some of the third party libraries we were using .
Types can be defined in ATS to give compile time errors if return values are not checked for errors .
' curl_easy_setopt ' and ' curl_easy_perform ' both return a value indicating success or failure .
A non-zero value indicates an error .
See simple3.dats ( pretty - printed version ) for the changes required to enforce checking of the values .
The definition of ' curl_easy_setopt ' has changed to :
extern fun curl_easy_setopt {p:type} ( handle : !CURLptr1 >> opt( CURLptr1 , err == 0 ) , option : CURLoption , parameter : p ) : # [ err:int ] int err = " #curl_easy_setopt "
The same change was made to ' curl_easy_perform ' .
The parameter ' handle ' has changed to have a type of '! CURLptr1 >> opt( CURLptr1 , err == 0 ) '.
The type definition before the ' >>' is what the function accepts as input .
After the ' >>' is the type of the parameter after the function returns .
This says that after the function returns the type of ' handle ' is a ' CURLptr1 ' if ' err ' is zero. ' err ' is defined later in the definition as an integer .
This forces calling code to check the return value to see if it is zero .
That code can then continue to use the CURLptr1 type by extracting it from the ' opt ' .
This is the adjusted ' main ' function showing how this works :
implement main ( ) = let val curl = curl_easy_init( ) ; val ( ) = assert_errmsg ( CURLptr_isnot_null curl , " curl_easy_init failed " ) ; val res = curl_easy_setopt(curl , CURLOPT_URL , " www.bluishcoder.co.nz " ) ; val ( ) = assert_errmsg ( res = 0 , " curl_easy_setopt failed " ) ; prval ( ) = opt_unsome ( curl ) ; val res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ; val ( ) = assert_errmsg ( res = 0 , " curl_easy_perform failed " ) ; prval ( ) = opt_unsome ( curl ) ; val ( ) = curl_easy_cleanup( curl ) ; in ( ) end ;
Notice the assertion check for the return value of the functions .
This is followed by an ' opt_unsome ' call to ' un - opt ' the type and continue using it as a ' CURLptr1 ' .
If either the assert check , or the ' opt_unsome ' is commented out the code wo n't compile .
If the assert check is done for a value other than zero it wo n't compile .
The code could also check the result using an ' if ' statement - I use assert here for brevity .
If you buy an iPhone 4 or 3GS from Apple in the US or another country where the iPhone is only available on a single mobile network , that iPhone will only work with the carrier in question .
But if you buy one directly from Apple in France , Canada , or the UK ( at unsubsidized prices ) , it will work with any compatible network worldwide .
Unlike in the US , where " iPhone requires a two - year AT&T wireless service contract , " iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 buyers in the UK and France can get an unlocked iPhone directly from Apple itself .
They can then sign up with any carrier that offers a compatible contract .
But that 's not all .
The UK Apple Store page reads as such :
It works internationally .
Because this iPhone is SIM - free , you can purchase a micro-SIM or SIM card and service from a local carrier at your destination .
Or check with your home carrier regarding international roaming charges .
The French and Canadian stores have text to the same effect ; if you buy an iPhone from Apple in Britain , France , or Canada , you can use it with compatible mobile networks anywhere in the world .
This makes it possible to change mobile operators within the country or use a local one while traveling , avoiding hefty international roaming charges .
This freedom does come with a price , though : in the UK , the flagship 32 GB iPhone 4 costs no less than £ 599 , the 16GB version £ 499 , and the 8GB iPhone 3GS £ 419 .
In France , the prices are €739 , €629 , and €519 , respectively .
This is roughly $ 885 , $ 737 , and $ 619 for the UK iPhones and $ 907 , $ 772 , and $ 637 for the French ones — including VAT / sales tax .
In Canada , there are no prices listed yet , but : " iPhone may also be available at a reduced initial price with a contract directly from your wireless carrier . "
Buying an unlocked iPhone directly from Apple may or may not make sense : the phone is much more expensive , but it may be possible to get a cheaper plan .
In the past , of course , mobile operators have been very successful at selling " cheap " subsidized phones with expensive plans .
Orange in the UK , for instance , offers a range including one for £ 35 per month , which reduces the price of the 32 GB iPhone 4 to £ 219 with a two - year contract .
This plan comes with 600 minutes and " unlimited " mobile browsing — limited to 750 MB per month .
It 's also possible to get a SIM - only plan for £ 20 with 500 minutes and 500MB .
With the two - year contract , the total costs add up to £ 1,059 , while two years worth of the SIM - only plan and the unsubsidized 32 GB iPhone 4 add up to £ 1,079 .
But with the SIM - only plan you get to change plans when cheaper ones become available — even from another mobile operator .
For those of us who reside in countries where Apple still has an exclusive deal with a single mobile operator , ordering from Apple in Canada , France , or Britain is n't going to work : " Orders placed through this Apple Online Store can be shipped only within the country of purchase . "
Then again , that 's why we have eBay .
Updated 07/16 to include Motorola 's statement .
Many Android fans arelining up to get Motorola 's latest phone , the Droid X , which hit retail shelves Thursday morning .
But the phone has raised the hackles of some Android geeks .
Motorola has reportedly made it difficult for hackers to mod the Droid X by using a bootloader and chip combination that could potentially brick the phone if it is broken .
But contrary to speculation by some hackers , the phone wo n't " self - destruct " or " brick " if it is hacked , says Motorola .
The bootloader is the software component that loads the operating system in a gadget .
Android hackers say Motorola 's move has made it extremely difficult , if not impossible , to load custom versions of Android on the Droid X .
" Motorola wants to keep people from modding their devices , " says Ryan Mills , an Android modder and blogger .
" I do n't know if they are just afraid for security purposes , or they just want to stay proprietary . "
However , not everyone agrees that the Droid X will be un -hackable – and it's impossible to confirm at this point , because almost no one has yet attempted the mod .
" The Droid X and a majority of Android consumer devices on the market today have a secured bootloader , " a Motorola spokeswoman confirmed to Wired.com .
" Motorola 's primary focus is the security of our end users and protection of their data , while also meeting carrier , partner and legal requirements , " says the spokeswoman .
Verizon declined to comment .
The questions around the ability to hack the Droid X have stirred up a debate about how much a handset maker can control Android , which otherwise touts itself as an open source operating system .
Android 's ability to be hacked and modded is one of the major draws of the OS .
Handset makers and wireless carriers decide which operating system can run on a phone and customers usually have no choice in the matter .
In the case of Android , hackers have created their own versions of the read - only memory , or ROM , on their cellphones , which holds the firmware .
These custom ROMs can be loaded on an Android device to unlock features in a process known as " flashing . "
That means devices that run the custom ROMs can boast features that the handset manufacturer or carrier may not have otherwise included .
DIYers have gone so far as to buy phones running Windows Mobile OS and replace it with Android .
In case of the Droid X , the phone 's processor includes a feature invented by IBM called eFuse .
IBM 's eFuse , which is baked into the chips , gives manufacturers the ability to make changes to information on a chip that would otherwise be " hard coded . "
It also helps manage power and memory in the device .
Commenter p3 Droid on the MyDroidWorld forum speculates that the eFuse technology looks for information from the bootloader associated with the device .
If it does n't get that , the eFuse trips the boot up process , leading to a potential bricking of the phone .
" The bootloader in the Droid X is signed with the recovery and the kernel for the device , " explains Steven Bird , who has created custom ROMs for other devices .
"
If those do n't correspond it wo n't work .
It 's not any sort of self - destruct in there . "
Rumors about eFuse 's self - destruct mode are greatly exaggerated , says the Motorola spokeswoman .
" The technology is not loaded with the purpose of preventing a consumer device from functioning , but rather ensuring for the user that the device only runs on updated and tested versions of software , " she says .
" If a device attempts to boot with unapproved software , it will go into recovery mode , and can re-boot once approved software is re-installed .
Checking for a valid software configuration is a common practice within the industry to protect the user against potential malicious software threats . "
The Droid X is not the only Motorola phone to have this technology , he says .
Bird says that many of Motorola 's phones including the Droid , Droid X and Milestone all have chips that integrate the eFuse technology .
" HTC has a similar technology with the Incredible that made it very difficult to write custom ROMs for it , " says Bird .
" It just means it takes longer to mod the device . "
But at this point , almost all of this talk around the Droid X is " conjecture , " says Steve Kondik , aka Cyanogen , an Android hacker who runs the highly popular Cyanogen Mod community .
" From what I have gathered , no one has really tested anything to see if it is true , " he says .
" One person who has tried to modify the bootloader says the system broke but we know nothing about how the mod was done and if it was done right . "
Kondik says the first step will be to root – the Android equivalent of jailbreaking – the device .
From there , building custom ROMs for the Droid X may be difficult but it can be done , he says .
But it may not be enough to soothe modders like Mills .
Mills and a few other Android developers are questioning if Motorola should be part of Android 's Open Handset Alliance if it does n't really want its phones to be toyed with .

Rooting your Android device is much like jailbreaking an iPhone .
Once rooted , you can make your phone run faster , tether it to your computer , tweak hidden settings to your liking , and more .
Here 's how to do it on your Motorola Droid .

Rooting essentially means giving yourself root permissions on your phone .
It 's the equivalent of running programs as administrators in Windows , or running a command with " sudo " in Linux .
There are a number of great reasons to root your Android phone , highest among them being speed ( through custom ROMs and through overclocking ) , tethering , and installing apps and widgets from other builds .

Sure , all Android users are looking forward to a big performance boost and tethering features in Android 2.2 Froyo , but that does n't mean rooting will become obsolete .
In my opinion , it 's the little things that make it .
There are tweaked versions of the Android OS out there , also known as custom ROMs , which fix some small annoyances with the stock version of the OS .
For example , some ROMs turn the " sound off " slide on the lock screen to a " vibrate only " slider , or allow the phone to go into landscape mode just by turning it on its side .
If you 're unhappy with the way Android looks , you 've also got a large number of custom themes you can install , not to mention the numerous other Android marketplace apps that require root access .

This particular guide is for the Motorola Droid , which is still the most popular Android device at the moment .
The rooting process is going to be different for every phone , so you 'll have to look up specific instructions if you do n't have the Droid .
They should n't be too hard to find — we've already posted about the Nexus One .
The second half of the guide , on installing your ROM installer / backup utility , ROM Manager , should be compatible with a few other Android phones ( such as the Dream , Sapphire , and Nexus One , to name a few ) , but not all of them .
If you are n't sure whether your device is supported , run a quick search on the available ROMs for your device and see if ROM Manager has them in its database .

One warning :
The first step , downgrading your phone from 2.1 to 2.0 , can be dangerous .
If any part of this process has the ability to brick your phone , it 's this step .
I can say that I have done this to two Droids without any phones getting bricked , but as always , your mileage may vary .
Know that the software is a little bit finicky , and sometimes fails at re-flashing the stock ROM .
If it does , you can just run it again to make it work .
I had to run it three times on my friend 's Droid before it flashed , and at one point in the middle his phone was stuck on the bootloader .
If this happens to you , do n't panic .
We just ran through the process a third time and everything succeeded .
If you are not comfortable doing this , then do n't do it — again , I have had great results ( despite finicky software ) , and so have many other people , but your mileage may vary .
You have been warned .

What You 'll Need
An Android - based phone , specifically the Motorola Droid .
Like I said , certain parts of the process may be similar for other phones , but this how - to is specific to the Motorola Droid , so your mileage will vary if you have something different .

A Windows machine .
Unfortunately , we will be using Motorola 's tool to re-flash Android 2.0.1 onto your phone , which is a Windows - only tool .
So if you are n't running Windows already , power up Boot Camp or find a friend with a Windows machine that you can borrow .
XP , Vista , and 7 should all be fine .

Step 1 : Downgrade Your Phone to 2.0
Android 2.1 has not yet been rooted , so the only way to root your phone is to have 2.0 or 2.0.1 ( although most custom ROMs contain 2.1's features , so fret not ) .
Unfortunately , this means you need to flash your phone back to the stock ROM with Verizon 's RSD Lite tool .
You will lose all your applications and settings doing so , so be ready .
You wo n't lose anything on your SD card , though , nor will you have to re-purchase applications .
The Android market remembers what you 've bought and will let you re-download any of them for free .
Once you 've said goodbye to all your settings , download our Lifehacker Droid Rooting Pack via BitTorrent ( and please seed it for others ! ) .
This contains all the files you 'll need .
You can alternatively get the files for this step on this page ( which also has a nice video tutorial of this first step ) .
Advertisement
Update :
As it turns out , there is a way to root your phone running 2.1 .
However , you still have to use RSD Lite , and all your data will still be wiped .
You can follow those instructions if you so choose ( though I have n't tested them myself ) , but as far as I can tell there are no real benefits to doing it one way over the other .
Sorry about any confusion or misinformation .
Advertisement
First , install the Motorola USB drivers ( either 32 - bit or 64 - bit , depending on your system ) and RSD Lite .
Note that you 'll need previously mentioned 7 - Zip installed to extract the RSD Lite files .
Connect your phone to your PC via USB and turn it off .
Boot it back up while holding up on the D - pad to access your phone 's bootloader , shown above .
If it says everything is OK and that you 're connected via USB , start up RSD Lite as an Administrator ( by right clicking on it ) .
All you need to do is open up the .sbf file you just downloaded , and hit the start button .
Let it run and do n't touch anything !
Get up and make some tea or something ; you do n't want to interrupt this process .

Click on the image for a closer look .
Here 's the finicky part .
You 'll be able to watch the progress of each step in the right hand column of RSD Lite , and when it 's done it should say " completed " and reboot your phone into the stock ROM .
However , note that a lot of times it will run the last step to 99 % and say it failed ( or just hang at 99 % ) .
If your phone reboots into the stock ROM , it 's safe to unplug your phone and move on .
However , if RSD Lite says it failed and your phone still shows the bootloader screen , you need to run the process again , so hit the start button again and let it roll .
Mine worked fine the first time through ( though it hung at 99 % ) , and my friend 's took three tries before the ROM flashed and the phone rebooted itself .
Like I said , it 's finicky , and kind of nerve wracking , but keep calm and carry on .
Run it until it works and you should be fine .
Once it 's up and running , re-activate your phone and go through the process of setting up your Google accounts and such , and move on to the next step .

Step 2 : Root Your Phone
Connect your phone to your computer , and this time mount it as a drive ( by dragging down the notifications bar and hitting the " select to copy files to / from your computer " option ) .
In the second folder of the aforementioned torrent , you 'll find a file called update .zip ( you can also get it here ) .
Drag it to the root of your SD card , and then reboot your phone into recovery mode by holding the " x " key on the keyboard as it starts up .
When you see the screen below , hold the volume up button and then press the camera button .
Advertisement
Use the D - pad to navigate the menu and select items .
Choose the option to apply sdcard:update.zip .
When it 's finished , select the reboot option and let your phone start back up .
You wo n't notice anything different , but you will have root permissions .
Move on to the next step to put them to use .

Step 3 : Install Custom ROMs for Your Device
Now that you 're rooted and ready to go , it 's time to put a custom ROM on your device .
Search the Android Market for " ROM Manager " and install it .
There are two versions , a free version and a premium one ( for $ 5 ) .
The free version will take you pretty far , but if you want access to more ROMs and themes , you 'll want the premium version .
For the purpose of this tutorial , we 'll only use options available to users of the free version , since that 's where the best goodies are anyway .
Advertisement
The first thing you have to do after starting up ROM Manager is flash ClockworkMod Recovery , which will be your best friend for backing up and restoring your phone as you add new things to it .
Click the Flash ClockworkMod Recovery button ( it 's the first thing you 'll see when you first launch Rom Manager ) and confirm your phone model .
You 'll see a progress bar at the top of the screen , and you 'll get a notification when it 's finished .
Once it 's been flashed , go back to ROM Manager and hit the " Download ROM " button .
Advertisement
Whether you 're running the free or premium version , the ROMs in the " free " section are probably the best to go with , unless you know you want a certain , more obscure ROM .
Previously mentioned CyanogenMod is my ROM of choice , as it seems to have the most features and most support from the rest of the community as far as add - on compatibility goes .
However , Bugless Beast is very stable and provides a super easy , one - step install process , so if you do n't need all the bells and whistles , that would also be a good choice .
If you want to get the experimental 2.2 Froyo build , click on Stock Images and find it on that list .
Advertisement
Once you click on the ROM you want , you 'll probably be presented with a few screens containing add - ons that you can download and install with it .
As far as Cyanogen Mod goes , you 'll definitely want the " Google Apps " add - on ( which contains Google 's proprietary apps like Gmail , GTalk , and the Market ) .
If you 're downloading Bugless Beast , you 'll get to choose your overclocking kernel and theme at this time ( see below for more notes on overclocking kernels ) .
Your Droid will begin downloading the ROM and its add - ons , and you can check the progress by dragging down the notification bar at the top .
Once it 's done , you 'll be prompted with a pre-installation notification , shown below .
Check both of these options .
This will ensure that your current ROM is backed up in case anything goes wrong , and that the ROM installs correctly .
Hit OK and let the phone reboot and do its thing .
Advertisement
If you 're installing CyanogenMod , you 'll have to go back to ROM Manager after your ROM is installed to get overclocking kernels .
From the main ROM Manager page , hit your menu button and go to Settings .
Enable advanced mode and return to the main page .
Go back to Download ROM , click on CyanogenMod , and then click on bekit Kernels .
Advertisement
You have quite a few choices ; the number of slots determine how many presets you have to choose from , the speed is the max speed to which you can overclock your processor , and the voltage decides how much power ( and thus battery life ) it draws .
On the Droid , I 've found that the 7 - slot , 1GHz low voltage kernel works quite well .
Higher speeds might require more voltage , so be sure to do some research on your phone and what kernels will and wo n't work smoothly .
Note that when you install add - ons , you do n't need to select " wipe data and cache " — you only need this when flashing a full ROM .
You will still want to create another backup , though , just in case things go wrong .
You can always delete old backups from your SD card if you start to run out of space .
Advertisement
Also note that if you want themes for CyanogenMod , you 'll have to get the premium version of ROM Manager , and pick your themes from the premium category under Download ROM .
Flash them and other add - ons the same way you did the kernel .
From here on out , the world is your oyster .
Now that you have root permissions , be sure to go to the Market and download the " wireless tethering " app for tethering and SetCPU for overclocking , as well as any of the other apps you need to restore from your old set - up .
The nice thing about ROM Manager , too , is that you can restore Clockwork Mod backups at any time just by going to the bottom of the main ROM Manager page and hitting " Manage and Restore Backups " — so do n't be afraid to experiment with different ROMs and compatible add - ons .
If you do n't like them , you can always restore to an old backup and have all your settings and apps perfectly preserved .
Good luck , and be sure to share your experiences , expertise , and favorite ROMs and add - ons in the comments below .
The British Foreign Office has issued a travel advisory recommending that its citizens not take part in flotillas trying to break the Gaza blockade , something Israel is lobbying other countries to do as well .
The travel advisory for “ Israel and the Occupied Territories ” that wasplaced on the Foreign Office ’s Web site soon after the May 31 flotillaraid reads that “ participating in a convoy of this kind brings a realrisk of injury or death .
We strongly advise against anyone attemptingto break the naval blockade in this way . ”
The advisory also reads , “ Weadvise against all travel to Gaza ( including the waters off Gaza ) .
” One Israeli Foreign Ministry official said that statements such asthese were significant because they make it clear that the governmentsthat issue the advisories view the attempt to break the blockade asnegative , and hint that those who insist on taking part in theflotillas should not later come to their home governments looking forsupport .
I begin with a question to which I have no answer .
Why do so many people hate the British ?
I say " British " , but what they actually hate is England , and the English .
The frequent interchanging of ' England ' and ' Britain ' has caused a common confusion of meaning .
The ' Oxford History of England ' is in fact a history of Britain : the common German term for Britain is England , and many people use the terms Britain and England interchangeably .
When Barack Obama announced , through teeth so clenched that it was as if he had found one of Osama bin Laden 's pubic hairs lodged there , that he was going to make " British Petroleum " pay for the damage done to Gulf , he emphasised the term " British " , almost as a secret code word for ' bad ' within the American lexicon .
Actually , the name of the company is actually not " British Petroleum " , but BP .
And " British " in Obama - speak did n't mean the Scottish or the Welsh .
It meant England .
And universally , it really is okay to disparage England in a way that is permitted of no other country .
The Americans have no more faithful ally in the world than Britain .
Hundreds of British soldiers have died in British wars of choice alongside the Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Yet President Obama could nonetheless spontaneously evince a disdain for Britain that he never would for France or Germany or Italy -- though he may look in vain for comparably vigorous military allies from those countries .
Why do people despise the English ?
The British Empire ?
But that 's been dead for generations .
And was it worse than any other empire ?
You can cite British atrocities after the Indian Mutiny -- but they were -- ( to put it mildly ) no worse than the German massacres after the Herrera risings in what is now Namibia , or the routine chopping - off of hands in the Belgian Congo , or the murderous raids into the Algerian hinterland by the French Foreign Legion .
The Russians gave us the word ' pogrom ' , yet US Jews , who are largely descended from those who fled those pogroms , do not hate Russia the way that they seem to hate Britain ( and which is perhaps one reason why the nastiest , most sadistic Hollywood villains are usually English ) .
Moreover , how was it possible that Noraid was allowed to flourish in the US , when the IRA 's only foreign state - friend was Libya -- which was a sworn enemy of the US ?
And Britain was the only country that allowed its airbases to be used by the US for raids on Libya , which caused Gadaffi to arm the IRA .
Yet the US still allowed Noraid to collect money to bomb Britain .
The term ' West Brit ' is a term of semi-racist abuse that is still culturally acceptable in Ireland .
Merely to invoke the English - origins of someone you dislike is usually a sufficient argument unto itself .
When Theo Dorgan was reviewing my anthology of columns , ' More Myers ' , on RTE television , he sneered that I and my opinions were a typical product of a minor English public school .
It is neither here nor there that I do not regard myself as British ( but will never deny my ' Britishness ' ) .
The real point is that he would have not used such disdainful generalisations about a Nigerian or German or a Jew or a Palestinian , or that they would even have been broadcast .
Yes , yes , yes , we all know about the Famine , the Penal Days and the Black and Tans .
But in France , Germany and Italy they do n't , yet the ' Brits ' seem nearly to be as unpopular there as here .
When I was stopped in France for driving my hire - car with its lights on in daytime , I was presumed to be English and was curtly told that the penalty would be an instant fine of € 50 : identification please .
I produced my passport .
The war was instantly over : indeed , Monsieur Le Flic nearly French - kissed me .
" Vous êtes Irlandais !!
Vous êtes bienevues ! "
Why ?
What has Ireland ever done for France ?
To be sure , any Frenchman can cite the many occasions when les rosbifs were a trifle de trop , from the massacre of captured French knights at Agincourt to the sinking of the French navy at Oran .
But were these events worse than 1914 - 18 , or 1939 - 45 ?
Now , the general loathing of the Brits would be thoroughly deserved if it was based on their unspeakable films : Stephen Bloody Fry in ' Five Twee Cliches , One Lovely Gay Couple , and A Stiff Upper Lip ' .
But I do n't think it 's that .
So , was it that 70 years ago this summer , the British decided to fight on , come hell or high water , until Europe was free , creating an unpayable ( and therefore intolerable ) debt ?
Or is it that the British attitude towards the EU is simply too arrogant for mainland Europhiles to stomach ?
Maybe .
But none of this explains why this summer , whoever England play in the World Cup , even a Khmer Rouge / SS / Janjaweed Cannibal XI , most neutrals will be cheering for the opposition .
And you probably will , too .
Yet you also know that England is where many ' Irish ' footballers are born , and where virtually all Irish footballers make their careers .
It 's odd , yet it 's true : universally , the English are just about everyone 's official non-friend .

Helvetica is a widely used sans serif typeface that has been popular in publishing since the 1960s .
Commonly used alternatives to Helvetica include Arial and Swiss .
Many other typefaces come close , and some are better matches than others , but if you are going for a certain look with a little bit of variation , the long list of Helvetica - like typefaces offers an embarrassment of riches .
What Is Helvetica Font ?
Helvetica is a trademarked typeface .
It comes loaded on most Macs and in Adobe applications .
The Helvetica font is sold by Monotype Imaging , which holds the license on the full Helvetica family of typefaces .
Helvetica is not included as a default font on Windows computers .
Many typefaces look like Helvetica that may already exist in your computer 's font collection .
Unless you know the look - alikes ' names , though , those alternative typefaces can be difficult to find .
When you find them , you 'll be surprised at how similar they looked when compared with Helvetica .

If you do n't already have any fonts that are similar to Helvetica , some free downloads can stand in for this classic sans serif typeface .
Coolvetica by Ray Larabie is a Helvetica - like typeface with a few nuances .
Alte Haas Grotesk comes in regular and bold versions .
It is in the neo - grotesque style with a Helvetica look .
Lowvetica , inspired by Helvetica , is shorter and squatter and , as it says in its description , " eliminates all highs and lows . "
Fun Facts About Helvetica
The typeface was originally named Neue Haas Grotesk .
It was soon licensed by Linotype and renamed Helvetica , evoking the Latin adjective for Switzerland , Helvetia .
Linotype was later acquired by Monotype Imaging .
A feature - length film directed by Gary Hustwit was released in 2007 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the typeface 's introduction in 1957 .
What 's So Special About Helvetica ?
The Helvetica typeface was developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface designers Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann .
It is a neo -grotesque or realist design , deriving from the influential 19th - century typeface Akzidenz - Grotesk and other German and Swiss designs .
Helvetica is a neutral typeface that has great clarity and no intrinsic meaning in its form , so it can be used in a variety of situations .
It is clean and legible .
Helvetica became a hallmark of the international typographic style that emerged from the work of Swiss designers in the 1950s and 60s and became one of the most popular typefaces of the 20th century .
Like a nonexplosive RDD , unless a dirty bomb contains a large amount of very strong radioactive material , the effects of the device are not likely to be immediate and dramatic .
In fact , the explosive effect of the RDD is likely to kill more people than the device 's radiological effect .
This need for a large quantity of a radioisotope not only creates the challenge of obtaining that much radioactive material , it also means that such a device would be large and unwieldy — and therefore difficult to smuggle into a target such as a subway or stadium .
In practical terms , a dirty bomb can produce a wide range of effects depending on the size of the improvised explosive device ( IED ) and the amount and type of radioactive material involved .
( Powdered radioisotopes are easier to disperse than materials in solid form . )
Environmental factors such as terrain , weather conditions and population density would also play an important role in determining the effects of such a device .
Significantly , while the radiological effects of a dirty bomb may not be instantly lethal , the radiological impact of an RDD will in all likelihood affect an area larger than the killing radius of the IED itself , and will persist for far longer .
The explosion from a conventional IED is over in an instant , but radiation released by a RDD can persist for decades unless the area is decontaminated .
While the radiation level may not be strong enough to affect people exposed briefly in the initial explosion , the radiation will persist in the contaminated area , and the cumulative effects of such radiation could prove very hazardous .
( Here again , the area contaminated and the ease of decontamination will depend on the type and quantity of the radioactive material used .
Materials in a fine powdered form are easier to disperse and harder to clean up than solid blocks of material . )
In either case , it will be necessary to evacuate people from the contaminated area , and people will need to stay out of the area until it can be decontaminated , a process that could prove lengthy and expensive .
Therefore , while a dirty bomb is not truly a WMD like a nuclear device , we frequently refer to them as " weapons of mass dislocation " because they may temporarily render contaminated areas uninhabitable .
The expense of decontaminating a large , densely populated area , such as a section of London or Washington , is potentially quite high .
This cost would also make a dirty bomb a type of economic weapon .
The world has not yet witnessed a successful dirty bomb attack by a terrorist or militant group .
That does not necessarily mean that militant groups have not been interested in radiological weapons , however .
Chechen militants have perhaps been the most active in the realm of radioactive materials .
In November 1995 , Chechen militants under the command of Shamil Basayev placed a small quantity of cesium - 137 in Moscow 's Izmailovsky Park .
Rather than disperse the material , however , the Chechens used the material as a psychological weapon by directing a TV news crew to the location and thus creating a media storm and fostering public fear .
The material in this incident was thought to have been obtained from a nuclear waste or isotope storage facility in the Chechen capital of Grozny .
In December 1998 , the pro-Russian Chechen Security Service announced it had found a dirty bomb consisting of a land mine combined with radioactive materials next to a railway line frequently used to transport Russian troops .
It is believed that Chechen militants planted the device .
In September 1999 , two Chechen militants who attempted to steal highly radioactive materials from a chemical plant in Grozny were incapacitated after carrying the container for only a few minutes each ; one reportedly died .
This highlights another difficulty with producing a really effective dirty bomb :
The strongest radioactive material is dangerous to handle , and even a suicide operative might not be able to move and employ it before being overtaken by its effects .
Still , none of these Chechen incidents really provided a very good example of what a dirty bomb detonation would actually look like .
To do this , we need to look at incidents where radiological isotopes were dispersed by accident .
In 1987 , in Goiania , Brazil , a tiny radiotherapy capsule of cesium chloride salt was accidentally broken open after being salvaged from a radiation therapy machine left at an abandoned health care facility .
Over the course of 15 days , the capsule containing the radioisotope was handled by a number of people who were fascinated by the faint blue glow it gave off .
Some victims reportedly even smeared the substance on their bodies .
The radiation was then dispersed by these people to various parts of the surrounding neighborhood , and some of it was even taken to nearby towns .
In all , more than 1,000 people were contaminated during the incident and some 244 were found to have significant radioactive material in or on their bodies .
Still , only four people died from the incident , and most of those who died had sustained exposure to the contamination .
In addition to the human toll , the cleanup operation in Goiania cost more than $ 100 million , as many houses had to be razed and substantial quantities of contaminated soil had to be removed from the area .
In a more recent case involving a scrap dealer , this time in a slum outside New Delhi , India , eight people were admitted to the hospital because of radiation exposure after a scrap dealer dismantled an object containing cobalt - 60 .
The material apparently arrived at a scrap shop March 12 , and the owner of the shop was admitted to the hospital April 4 suffering from radiation - poisoning symptoms ( again another case involving prolonged exposure to a radiation source ) .
The radiation source was found at the scrap yard April 5 and identified as cobalt - 60 .
Indian authorities hauled away eight piles of contaminated scrap .
The cleanup operation was easier in the Indian incident , since the radioactive material was in metallic form and found in larger pieces rather than in powdered form seen in the cesium in Goiania .
Intriguingly , a nearby scrap shop also was found to be contaminated April 16 , but it appears from initial reports that the second site was contaminated by a second radioactive source that contained a weaker form of cobalt - 60 .
Though we are watching for additional details on this case , so far , despite the long - term exposure to a potent radioactive source , no deaths have been reported .
At the other end of the spectrum from the Goiania and New Delhi accidents is the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in northern Ukraine , when a 1 - gigawatt power reactor exploded .
It is estimated that more than one hundred times the radiation of the Hiroshima bomb was released during the accident — the equivalent of 50 million to 250 million grams of radium .
More than 40 different radioisotopes were released , and there was a measurable rise in cesium - 137 levels across the entire European continent .
No RDD could ever aspire to anything close to such an effect .
Chernobyl wrought untold suffering , and estimates suggest that it may ultimately contribute to the deaths of 9,000 people .
But many of those affected by the radiation are still alive more than 20 years after the accident .
While Stratfor by no means seeks to downplay the tragic human or environmental consequences of this disaster , the incident is instructive when contemplating the potential effects of a dirty bomb attack .
In spite of the incredible amounts of radioactive material released at Chernobyl , only 31 people died in the explosion and immediate aftermath .
Today , 5.5 million people live in the contaminated zone — many within or near the specified EU dosage limits for people living near operational nuclear power plants .
It is this type of historical example that causes us to be so skeptical regarding claims that a small dirty bomb will cause hundreds or even thousands of deaths .
Instead , the most strategic consequences of this sort of destruction are economic .
By some estimates , the Chernobyl disaster will ultimately cost well in excess of $ 100 billion .
Again , in our opinion , a dirty bomb should be considered a weapon of disruption — one that will cause economic loss , but would not cause mass casualties or any real mass destruction .
Analytically , based upon the ease of manufacture and the historical interest by militants in dirty bombs — which ironically may in part be due to the way the RDD threat has been hyped — it is only a matter of time before militants successfully employ one .
Since the contamination created by such a device can be long - lasting , more rational international actors probably would prefer to detonate such a device against a target outside their own country .
In other words , they would lean toward attacking a target within the United States or United Kingdom rather than the U.S. or British embassies in their home country .
And since it is not likely to produce mass casualties , a dirty bomb attack would likely be directed against a highly symbolic target — such as one representing the economy or government — and designed to cause the maximum amount of disruption at the target site .
Therefore , it is not out of the question to imagine such an attack aimed at a target such as Wall Street or the Pentagon .
The device would not destroy these sites , but would limit access to them for as long as it took to decontaminate them .
As noted above , we believe it is possible that the panic caused by a dirty bomb attack could well kill more people than the device itself .
People who understand the capabilities and limitations of dirty bombs are less likely to panic than those who do not , which is the reason for this analysis .
Another important way to help avoid panic is to carefully think about such an incident in advance and to put in place a carefully crafted contingency plan for your family and business .
Contingency plans are especially important for those who work in proximity to a potential dirty bomb target .
But they are useful in any disaster , whether natural or man-made , and something that should be practiced by all families and businesses .
Such knowledge and planning provide people with the ability to conduct an orderly and methodical evacuation of the affected area .
This allows them to minimize their exposure to radioactivity while also minimizing their risk of injury or death due to mass hysteria .
For while a dirty bomb attack could well be messy and disruptive , it does not have to be deadly .
'' The time for double standards that allow Islamists to behave aggressively toward us while they demand our weakness and submission is over .

Extra points for fake populism , and following Palin 's despicable lead .
The Palin - led tone of the GOP is increasingly , well there 's no other word for it , neo - fascist .
As if it is now un-American to support freedom of religion - especially near a site destroyed by those who oppose it .
Palin sees a mosque as a stab in the heart of America .
I see it as a sign of America 's endurance as a place where freedom of religion is sacrosanct , and where we make distinctions between genuine believers and those who distort and pervert faith for political and murderous ends .
I see the Cordoba project as the best response to Bin Laden 's evil that a true democracy can muster .

After I posted the amazing picture of the Shuttle launch and the F - 15E fighter jet last week , I got a nice email from Peter Hugosson - Miller , an avid skydiver .
He and some friends went jumping over Florida one day a few years back ... in fact , it was on April 24 , 1990 .
If that date sounds familiar , then maybe the picture he sent me will jog your memory :
In the foreground are Peter and his jump - buddies , and in the background is
the Space Shuttle Discovery launching the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit !
How freaking cool is that ?
The picture was taken by Van Wideman , and just slays me .
I remember what I was doing on that very day -- getting ready to start my PhD work using that telescope , an adventure that would last for ten years .
At the time , though , it sure felt like jumping out of an airplane ...
The final launch of Discovery is scheduled for September 16 , 2010 .

Hermeneutics
One of the most puzzling features of the current unstoppable wave of political punditry that is flooding all channels and outlets at the moment ( including this one of course ) is the peculiar propensity of commentators to feel qualified to extrapolate from the election results the Manifest Will of Britain .
“ The people have voted for change ” , “ The people have told Gordon Brown that he has got to go ” , “ The people are saying that they do n’t really trust any one party ” , “ The people have said that they want Parliament reformed , the tea room in the House of Commons redecorated , new carpeting in the women ’s lavatory of the House of Lords and a vegetarian option in the canteen . ”
What fevered branch of electoral hermeneutics allows any such interpretations on the basis of the summing of millions of individual ’s single votes I cannot imagine .
It is possible that people do want real change , but a single cross next to a single name is no way to deduce it .
PR
We only get one vote , one cross to put next to one name .
If you put your cross next to Victoria Tory ’s name you declare that want her to be your MP , representing you constituency , although it is perhaps also permissible to assume that you are up for her party and her party ’s leader winning an overall majority in the Commons in Westminster as well .
If the cross is next to Fabian Labour ’s name or Libby Dem ’s one might be justified in assuming the same there too .
There really is almost nothing more nuanced or sophisticated that one can infer from our recent general election except to say that that of the 68 % who voted there were n’t enough who wanted Conservatives to win to allow Cameron to claim first prize , and even fewer who wanted to vote for candidates from the other parties .
One could deduce a huge amount more if voters were allowed to express their preferences in an intelligent way that reflected how they really feel and think .
The Electoral Reform Society is a good place to go for information as to how precisely such a form of voting could be implemented , as it is all round much of the civilised world .
My friends at Vote For A Change have also been campaigning for the same thing .
Proportional Representation is the prize that many of us hope this “ confusing ” election will deliver .
But there is an obstacle .
An obstacle so huge that I can not see it being overcome .
The Sitch
Here is the situation as I read it .
David Cameron ’s Conservative Party elders and backbenchers will never allow him to seal a pact with Clegg that guarantees electoral reform in the shape of proportional representation .
Nick Clegg ’s Liberal Democrat Party elders and backbenchers will never allow him to seal a pact with Cameron that that does not guarantee electoral reform in the shape of proportional representation .
Cameron will spring an obvious trap by saying , “ We ’ll see .
We ’ll look into it .
You can have concessions on schools and hospitals . ”
Children who want an ice cream know that when their parents say “ We ’ll see , but you can have a banana ” it means no ice cream .
The Lib Dem and PR pressure groups are perfectly aware of that too .
Any talk of “ an independent enquiry … a Royal Commission … a committee to look into it ” will be treated for what it is .
Fudge .
Stalemate
It comes down to this : the Conservatives believe that under a PR system they will never achieve full supremacy in the country again .
This would mark a sharp reverse in their ambitions .
Their manifesto commitment to a 10 % reduction in MPs and a consequent redraft of constituency borders would necessarily gerrymander massively in their interest , all but guaranteeing Tory power for the foreseeable future .
The idea that they will for one moment countenance PR reform that will see them reduced , as they would interpret it , to the role of Euro - style hedgers , compromisers and pragmatic consensus inclusionists is more than a bitter pill , it is a suicide pill and Cameron knows that he could never induce the party to swallow it .
There can therefore be only two outcomes .
Either Clegg blinks and accepts a “ We ’ll see , dear ” fudge which would cause outrage in his party and his own political death or Cameron refuses the deal , demands a new general election and watches grandly , nobly and in a “ statesmanlike manner ” from the sidelines as Labour attempts to cobble together something with both the Lib Dems and the requisite number of independents and nationalists required to form a majority who could push through an Emergency Budget .
Cameron would calculate that the press and public might well see him as the iron man of principal , with the most votes and the most ‘ authority ’ .
Clegg would be painted as an opportunistic spoiler : after all his party actually lost ground in the election .
Brown , if he stayed , would continue to be portrayed as forlorn , desperate , blundering , out of touch , cynical , greedy , lame and fatally wounded .
The media would , I think , successfully raise Cameron and the Conservatives in public estimation : “ What principle !
What courage !
They were not squalid smoke - filled room negotiators , they did n’t strike ugly deals behind closed doors … they deserve the chance to run a stable administration without all this sordid horse - trading .
They made handsome and significant concessions on issues that really matter , hospitals and schools , yet instead of seizing this historic opportunity to do something for the country the Lib - Dems insisted , at this time of economic crisis , to fuss about cosmetic changes to the constitution that no decent Englishman understands anyway … nasty European nonsense .
Now we see Clegg for what he really is … ”
You can write the Telegraph and Mail leaders for yourselves .
They will argue furthermore that if the Lib Dems and reformers get their way , then the kind of deal - making , compromise and gridlock that we are seeing now will become the norm after every general election and that , they will declare , is no way to run a whelk stall .
A Prophecy
Within three months I imagine that any Lib Dem / Labour / Others coalition will fall , a General Election will be called , the Lib Dem vote will be decimated , the Conservatives brought to full power and Electoral / Constitutional Reform will be nothing but a wistful memory as those of us with distaste for conservatism hunker down for the duration .
Demos , riots , overturned cars in the streets , many more homeless , infrastructure decay , a rise in crimes against the person and property , a happy time perhaps for the City and the secure middle classes , a dreadful time for the vulnerable , the disabled , the physically and mentally ill , the homeless and the poor .
I remember the main feeling induced by living under Thatcher was shame .
It was shaming to live in a country that could be so proudly , gloatingly unkind , so vulgar , shabby and ungracious in its attitudes to the outsider , the weak and the destitute .
Goodness knows the Labour administration has been very , very far from perfect , but I think we will only appreciate the unheralded and uncelebrated good it did when the props it built up for the poor , the disabled and the disadvantaged have been kicked away .
Reform
This is the first occasion in my lifetime when true electoral and constitutional reform has seemed a possibility .
We could , if Clegg keeps his nerve , guarantee a political system in which yoyo - ing between right and left ends and with it all the vindictive , ideological revenges and pendulum overcompensations wrought by the major parties each time they return to office .
We could have a proper second chamber that is more than a clique of rubber - stamping apparatchiks .
An Upper House should be composed of those who think long term .
The Commons might vote to put up some smart wallpaper and do some attractive repainting , but the Upper House must be there to look at the damp coursing and the structure , to eliminate the ravages of short - termism .
We could also conceive a constitution into whose genetic code a profound and thoughtful understanding of the competing demands of privacy and openness is written – for that surely is the issue in citizenship and government which will most demand attention over the next fifty years ?
Nobody intelligent or competent appears to be looking at these questions .
The Digital Economy Bill shows how pitiful is the politicians ’ understanding of the changes that are coming our way .
I want to write soon about Digital Inclusion , which I hope will become a great cause to which some of you might ally yourselves .
These and many other issues are structural , deep and important yet consistently ignored by mainstream media : it is to a properly constituted Upper House that one looks for that kind of vital strategic planning .
Of course such root and branch reform in governmental structures and electoral methods would require proper debate which would take up parliamentary time and a great deal of ( no doubt necessary ) public consultation .
Working parties , fact - finding missions , amendments , variations , filibusters and vacillations will make it intensely difficult even to make the issue one for referendum .
The Conservatives would throw all impediments that could be found in the path of reform at the best of times , the current economic crisis can so easily be used as an excuse to do nothing constitutional .
It is hard to be optimistic , even thought there are clear arguments for a simple implementation of the Australian system of preferential voting , also known as Instant Run-Off , that would hardly need a referendum or two years of committee .
Australia has had their system since 1918 and it has worked well — infinitely better than ours has .
But if there is one thing the British are good at it is shaking their heads and saying that a thing ca n’t be done .
They forget that political will and commitment can make any problem disappear .
Depression and War have proved that there is nothing we can’t do properly , amicably and promptly if we set out minds to it .
But history has also shown us that our civil servants and politicians can outdo builders when it comes to sucking in breath , shaking their heads and saying that they ca n’t get the parts and that frankly it just ca n’t be done .
There are many golden prizes that might be extracted from the strange situation we are witnessing in and around Westminster at the moment .
I am pessimistic only because I can see how from the Tory point of view there is a case for the legitimacy of a conservative administration and why they will never concede on PR and because I can see how easy it is for them to scupper any chances of it while yet looking reasonable and magnanimous and authentic and responsible .
The gamble of staying aloof and making sure another election comes along soon must seem a small one to them .

A fair voting system is not in Tory interests , and it is a fundamental of conservative politics that everyone should act in their own interests .
Only the twittering classes and high - moral - ground hugging smug media liberal wankers like me would vote or act otherwise .
Therefore the Tories will never budge , a consensus will not be built and Clegg ’s brief moment in the limelight will be over and he and his party will be a forgotten blip as we return to the same old dance of death while the world changes ineradicably around us .
Britain will be shown to be incapable of evolving in its own interests as a nation , as a smart , adaptable , imaginative and diverse community of people who can respond to a changing world .
Where once we were in the vanguard ( rarely first , but usually early and sound ) in areas like universal suffrage , the abolition of slavery and child labour , the institution of votes for women and many other important freedoms and civilised reforms , the unsuitability of our political machinery for the modern world will mean that we will soon be seen as a haggard oldie in a broken down jalopy coughing and shaking our fist at the fast electric cars that zoom past us on the highway .
What a pity , what a terrible pity .
So …
If what I prognosticate comes to pass and a second general election is called ( and it most certainly wo n’t because I ’m crap at this kind of prophecy ) – then I think those of us that really care about the kind of change I ’ve alluded to will have to mass together and demand it with every democratically viable tool at our disposal .
We will have to stop the media from shifting the rhetorical ground and erecting Cameron as some kind of hero of the people .
Because believe me that is what they and their PR people will do .
It is hard to see how Clegg and whoever leads the Labour Party ( Alan Johnson or David Milliband , one assumes ) in three months time will be able to counter such tactics .
It ’s fun now to see the manoeuvrings and courtship dances but it will soon enough become boring , then irritating and finally enraging .
The victims of our displeasure are more likely to be the Lib Dems than any other party , which is why I fear they may swallow their pride , lose their moment , accept the ‘ We ’ll see ’ and end up with lots of fudge and bananas and no ice cream .

Big Oil spent millions of dollars to sweep — and keep — George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in the White House .
And it got its money ’s worth .
The new administration and its staunchly pro-oil congressional allies returned the favor by enacting one of the most pro-oil , anti-environment pieces of legislation in history : the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — itself based on the recommendations of Cheney ’s secret energy policy task force .
The Bush - Cheney administration ’s cozy relationship with Big Oil , however , goes much deeper than one law .
A closer look at the culture of deregulation , self - regulation , and corruption ushered in on Cheney ’s watch further underscores why the BP oil catastrophe should forever be remembered as Cheney ’s Katrina .
The poster child for Bush - Cheney crony capitalism
The mention of Halliburton likely summons for most Americans memories of the Bush administration ’s infamous no -bid Iraq war contracts — and Halliburton ’s subsequent efforts to defraud taxpayers and its fatal negligence in facilities it constructed for our troops .
Halliburton ’s main business , however , is providing services to major oil companies such as its potentially faulty cementing job on BP ’s blown out well .
The company had an unprecedented opportunity to engage in self - dealing and create a regulatory climate favorable to its business interests when Cheney , Halliburton ’s former CEO , was ensconced in the White House and still effectively on its payroll .
The Energy Policy
Act of 2005 has come to be known as the “ Dick Cheney energy bill , ” but there ’s one provision that is so closely identified with the former vice president that it has become known as the “ Cheney loophole . ”
The provision in question , Section 322 , exempted hydraulic fracturing , a drilling process invented by Halliburton commonly known as “ fracking , ” from the Safe Drinking Water Act .
The use of hydraulic fracturing has opened up vast new reserves of domestic natural gas from Texas to Wyoming to Pennsylvania , but serious environmental concerns about the process have been raised following numerous cases of groundwater contamination after nearby drilling .
The exemption has placed the burden to rein in drillers largely on state regulators that are often unable or simply unwilling to police the thousands of wells that have been drilled in recent years .
Cheney not only offered permanent regulatory relief and rolled back existing environmental laws to help the oil industry .
This particular example also demonstrates the administration ’s willingness to distort science to benefit Big Oil and others .
A 2004 Environmental Protection Agency study declared that fracking posed no significant threat to drinking water , thus paving the way for Congress to pass the Cheney loophole .
The integrity of the 2004 study has been called into serious question , and a broad new Obama EPA study on the practice is raising the ire of the oil and gas industry .
The one exception to the Cheney loophole was a ban on injecting diesel fuel into wells .
Yet a recent House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation revealed that the drilling companies violated this single restriction with impunity during the Bush - Cheney years .
And oil and gas interests have launched a public relations and lobbying campaign to prevent Congress from closing the Cheney loophole or imposing other regulations .
There have been two serious accidents involving onshore natural gas wells in the past week alone .
A Pennsylvania well had a blowout and one in West Virginia exploded .
Categorically excluding oversight
One of the 2005 Energy Policy
Act provisions that is most directly related to the BP oil catastrophe is Section 390 , which dramatically expanded the circumstances under which new drilling permits could be approved without further environmental reviews or assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act .
Many appear to have been approved based almost completely on responses to yes or no questions on pro forma checklists .
The Minerals Management Service approved BP ’s blown out Mississippi Canyon 252 well using just such a “ categorical exclusion . ”
BP was even lobbying to further expand use of such exemptions just 11 days before Deepwater Horizon exploded .
And expanding the use of such exclusions for onshore drilling is potentially devastating for some areas of the Intermountain West .
A 2009 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that the Bureau of Land Management , the agency responsible for issuing drilling permits on federal lands , engaged in widespread abuse of categorical exclusions during the final two years of the Bush - Cheney administration .
The report stated that the use of so - called “ Section 390 categorical exclusions ” created by the 2005 energy bill was “ frequently out of compliance with both the law and BLM ’s guidance . ”
The GAO report found that the BLM approved nearly 6,100 permits from 2006 to 2008 using the new exemptions carved out by Cheney and his congressional allies .
Field offices in Wyoming approved 2,462 such permits .
In fact , the Pinedale , Wyoming BLM office alone granted an extraordinary 1,498 permits using Section 390 exclusions .
This is more drilling permits than there were residents of the town in 2000 — 1412 .
Ground level ozone levels , largely related to the drilling boom in the area , measured in the tiny central Wyoming town have at times exceeded those of downtown Los Angeles .
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar luckily announced onshore drilling reforms in January 2010 designed to end the abuse of Cheney exclusions on public lands .
But dramatic budget cuts and a lack of resources meanwhile prompted the BLM to briefly impose a moratorium on all new solar energy permits in 2008 .
The moratorium , which some argued would ’ve killed the nascent solar industry , was eventually lifted after a massive outcry by industry officials , congressional leaders , and environmentalists .
A mile high at the Minerals Management Service
The culture of corruption and ethical lapses across the entire Bush - Cheney Department of the Interior is well documented .
But the Minerals Management Service appears to have experienced a particularly stunning depth and breadth of corruption and simple incompetence .
GAO reports have documented almost unbelievable allegations of drug use and improper relationships , payments , and gifts between Bush - Cheney - era MMS employees and the oil and gas industry that they were charged with overseeing .
The most recent GAO report , detailing problems in the Lake Charles , Louisiana office of the MMS , notes that the report ’s findings were turned over the U.S. attorney for the western district of Louisiana in October 2009 and that the office declined to prosecute any of those involved in what would plainly appear to be numerous violations of the law .
The U.S. attorney for the western district of Louisiana from October 2001 to January 2010 was Donald Washington .
His official Department of Justice biography noted that he had practiced “ toxic tort litigation , ” “ held a variety of positions with Conoco Inc from 1982 - 1996 , ” and “ served as Chief Counsel for Conoco ’s Gulf of Mexico Division until his departure from Conoco in 1996 . ”
Washington has since returned to private practice in Lafayette , Louisiana , where he may again find himself involved in the ongoing catastrophe .
The press release touting his hire at the firm Jones & Walker notes that he “ will focus on complex civil litigation , federal and state criminal investigations , regulatory enforcement actions , and internal investigations and compliance programs in such industries as health care , maritime , and energy . ”
Catastrophic cronyism
The so - called environmental assessments that laid the foundation for approving permits without further review were fatally flawed under the Bush - Cheney years — in addition to violating both the spirit and the letter of the law .
The last meaningful environmental review of any kind standing between BP and drilling at the Mississippi Canyon 252 site should have been the October 2007 Minerals Management Service environmental assessment of the “ Proposed Gulf of Mexico OCS Oil and Gas Lease Sale 206 . ”
But just six words — splashed in bold capital letters across the top of the report ’s first page — paved the way for what is now the worst environmental calamity in the history of the United States : FINDING OF NO NEW SIGNIFICANT IMPACT .
The assessment points out that Hurricanes Rita and Katrina rendered beaches and marshes more vulnerable to spills , but it still concluded that the potential for a damaging spill as a result of leasing the 5,569 drilling blocks contained in proposed sale 206 was basically nil :
Concerns were raised related to …the potential effects of oil spills on tourism , emergency response capabilities , spill prevention … accidental discharges from both deepwater blowouts and pipeline ruptures …
The fate and behavior of oil spills , availability and adequacy of oil - spill containment and cleanup technologies , oil - spill cleanup strategies , impacts of various oil - spill cleanup methods , effects of weathering on oil spills , toxicological effects of fresh and weathered oil , air pollution associated with spilled oil , and short - term and long - term impacts of oil on wetlands …
Offshore oil spills resulting from proposed Lease Sale 206 are not expected to damage significantly any wetlands along the Gulf Coast .
The assessment also includes one passage that reads like something of a death certificate for the gulf ’s coastal communities :
Accidental events associated with proposed Lease Sale 206 such as oil or chemical spills , blowouts , and vessel collisions would have no effects on the demographic characteristics of the Gulf coastal communities …
As inland marshes and barrier islands erode or subside , without effective restoration efforts , the population in coastal communities in southern Louisiana is expected to shift to the more northern portions of the parishes and cause increasing populations in urban and suburban areas and declining populations in rural coastal areas .
Given that they appear to have considered the decline of the Gulf Coast ’s communities a foregone conclusion , it ’s perhaps unsurprising that Bush - Cheney administration officials exercised so little care in attempting to prevent an accident like the catastrophe now unfolding .
Cheney ’s direct role in this situation of regulatory capture and failure could not be clearer .
Randall Luthi signed the so - called environmental review for the proposed lease sale 206 .
He is a longtime Cheney insider who was installed as director of the Minerals Management Service in 2007 .
Luthi , who was once Cheney ’s intern , went on to hold various positions in several Republican administrations before returning to his native Wyoming .
Luthi is currently the president of the National Ocean Industries Association , whose stated mission is “ to secure reliable access and a fair regulatory and economic environment for the companies that develop the nation ’s valuable offshore energy resources in an environmentally responsible manner . ”
Just yesterday , he called on the Obama administration to lift new restrictions on drilling in the gulf , even in face of the ever - growing economic and environmental disaster that he had a direct role in allowing to happen .
The Bush - Cheney administration made an unprecedented effort from beginning to end to rewrite our nation ’s laws and rules to benefit their allies in the oil industry .
They installed incompetent or corrupt cronies in important regulatory and oversight positions .
And what they could not achieve legally , the administration pursued by other means .
Eight years of Bush and Cheney created an insidious , pervasive rot throughout the government — a rot so severe that it prevented the government from carrying out its most basic functions and , as we have now seen , could not be easily undone by a new administration .
The pro-oil , anti-regulatory culture , agenda , and ideology relentlessly advanced by Cheney and others in the Bush administration unquestionably led to the catastrophe that now threatens to destroy the environment and economy of America ’s Gulf Coast — Cheney ’s Katrina .

The chief executives at Atlantic Richfield Co. , the oil company once based in Los Angeles , ran their international empire from some of the most regal corporate offices ever created in Southern California .
With Arco ’s 20 - foot ceilings , dark wood paneling and private rooftop helipad , “ this was corporate America as people thought of it , ” said Kent Handleman of Thomas Properties Group Inc. , the building ’s landlord .
That was then .
Nowadays , the landlord can’t find a renter for the space ’s 1970s - era sumptuousness .
There are also plenty of other catbird seats for choosy chief executives to pick from .
Penthouse office floors with drop - dead views are vacant in some of the best office buildings in Los Angeles County , a sign of the troubled economic times and the gulf between what landlords think their top - shelf product is worth and what tenants are willing to pay .
Some of these standoffs between prospective landlords and would - be tenants have been going on for years , with no sign of abating .
In the most extreme case , the top two floors of a premier Westwood high - rise have been empty since the building was completed in 1989 .
A survey by real estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle found a score of tall buildings downtown and on the Westside where the penthouses are vacant .
In several of these buildings , the floors just below are also empty .
For instance , the two uppermost ( 23rd and 24th ) floors of a high - rise at 10960 Wilshire Blvd.
last occupied by Sony Entertainment are connected by a grand curved staircase , said real estate broker Hunt Barnett , who is trying to find tenants for the space .
If you rent all 50,000 square feet , the landlord will even put the name of your company in big letters on top of the building .
The space is not ostentatious , Barnett says , but it has been empty for a year and a half .
The landlord wants $ 3.95 a square foot per month for the top floors , compared with $ 2.95 for space on lower levels .
At Center West , the Westwood high - rise completed in 1989 , landlord Kambiz Hekmat wants $ 6.50 a square foot for the 23rd and 24th floors , 35 % more than the rent for the floors below , according to real estate data provider CoStar Group Inc .
So far he ’s had no takers .
Owners expect their loftiest offices to fetch premium prices because the views are great and , after all , who does n’t want to be top dog ?
Penthouse - level executives interviewed by The Times in the 1980s explained that it was important to keep up appearances .
“ People expect the top person to have the top office , ” said Joseph J. Pinola , then - chairman and chief executive of First Interstate Bancorp , who had the highest perch in the city — 59 floors up — during the ‘ 80s .
“ It ’s protocol . ”
Pinola divulged that he , of course , was too busy to look out the window .
When a new skyscraper 13 stories higher went up nearby in 1989 , however , Pinola moved his headquarters and snagged the penthouse at what became First Interstate World Center , retaining his celestial bragging rights .
( Real estate investment firm CommonWealth Partners rents the top floor of offices today in the 72 - story skyscraper now known as U.S. Bank Tower . )
A real estate broker at the time speculated that skyscrapers reflected a primal militaristic impulse .
“ It ’s important to build your victorious camp on the top of the hill , ” the broker said .
“ Being up high is an extension of men wanting to be big and strong and over 6 feet tall . ”
Like the three - piece suit and other signs of corporate power from the Reagan era , the giant imposing office has gone out of style .
Companies ’ priorities have changed since those years , said Whitley Collins , regional manager of Jones Lang LaSalle .
Setting up shop in the penthouse is “ a bad statement for companies to make ” in this ailing economy , Collins said .
“ The last thing you want to do is go over the top on your space .
You want to appear fiscally responsible . ”
Collins predicted that most of the penthouse offices empty now will still be empty in a year or two .
“ If the economy takes off , maybe someone will reach for a top floor , ” he said .
“ But it ’s not going to happen unless they get a discount . ”
But landlords , who have been quite willing to bargain lately on most of their empty space , seem determined to wait for tenants who will pay full freight to be on top .
Thomas Properties is in no rush to rent the old Arco space or the former Bank of America Corp.
executive offices on the top floor of the matching tower next door , empty since 2004 .
On the top floor of what was then the best skyscraper in the city , Arco bosses set themselves up in palatial quarters that still command awe more than a decade after the company was purchased by British Petroleum , known these days as BP , and cleared out .
There are only seven offices on the 51st floor of what is now the City National Tower on Flower Street , each with its own marble bathroom and shower .
Law firms on lower floors easily fit 50 offices for attorneys in the same amount of space .
Part of the reason the space has n’t been rented may be that the landlord wants to preserve the historic opulence of Arco ’s vision and would discourage new occupants from making alterations .
“ The space deserves a very special tenant , ” Thomas Properties Group President James A. Thomas said of the Arco headquarters .
In the meantime , at least , the Arco space is available for filming movies , television shows and commercials .
Set designers for “ The Deep End , ” a short - lived ABC series about young lawyers , recently painted some walls darker to make the offices even more imposing .
It can also be rented for events .
Collins ’ company had a sales meeting in the office of former Arco Chairman Lodwrick Cook , who added a fireplace to the capacious room after he took charge in 1986 .
“ We had 67 people in chairs in there , ” Collins said .
Such offices “ scream excess , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t get away with that anymore . ”
Landlords , though , are betting that you still can .
The owners of AT&T Tower in downtown Los Angeles closed the restaurant on top in 2007 and turned it into two floors of brightly lighted glassed - in offices .
They ’re dramatic but have no tenants yet .
In Beverly Hills , there is a secluded 10th - floor penthouse near Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive last rented by Guess Inc. co-founder Georges Marciano .
The designer of upscale jeans installed marble floor tiles , coffered ceilings and a gourmet kitchen .
“ Anything beyond a microwave is unusual in an office , ” said broker Barnett of L.A. Realty Partners , who is trying to find a tenant for the 4,100 - square - foot lair atop 9465 Wilshire Blvd .
The shades and blinds in Marciano ’s old office open and close by remote control .
Just off the office is a secluded , mirrored room that connects to a plush bathroom with a bidet and a shower stall large enough for two .
Other tenants in the building completed in 1963 include director Ron Howard ’s Imagine Entertainment .
A new penthouse tenant could banish the fashion - mogul vibe , but prospective tenants , including Dodgers owner Frank McCourt , have looked it over and passed for more than a year now , Barnett said .
Another empty penthouse office formerly occupied by a high - profile executive is at 6420 Wilshire Blvd. , the former headquarters of Petersen Publishing , which made millions producing magazines such as “ Hot Rod , ” “ Guns & Ammo ” and “ Teen . ”
Founder Robert E. Petersen , for whom the Petersen Automotive Museum is named , ran his empire from the 20th floor of the building for about 15 years , said broker Joel Frank of First Property Realty Corp .
Petersen had the world ’s foremost collection of Gatling guns , a collection of bullets and had “ shot everything that had legs on this planet except for a few species , ” Frank said .
The animal trophies are long gone and the space has mostly been cleared out to make way for a new tenant .
The space has been empty for years .
At an asking price of $ 3 a square foot , it might be the cheapest penthouse on the market .
“ You can see from the San Gabriels to the Pacific Ocean , ” Frank said .
“ And the anchor tenant can get signage on top . ”

No Buddhist who understands the Buddha 's teaching thinks that other religions are wrong .
No -one who has made a genuine effort to examine other religions with an open mind could think like that either .
The first thing you notice when you study the different religions is just how much they have in common .
All religions acknowledge that man 's present state is unsatisfactory .
All believe that a change of attitude and behaviour is needed if man 's situation is to improve .
All teach an ethics that includes love , kindness , patience , generosity and social responsibility and all accept the existence of some form of Absolute .
They use different languages , different names and different symbols to describe and explain these things ; and it is only when they narrow - mindedly cling to their one way of seeing things that religious tolerance , pride and self - righteousness arise .
Image caption Radar imaging shows the outlines of the ancient city 's streets and houses
An ancient Egyptian city believed to be Avaris , the capital of the Hyksos people who ruled 3,500 years ago , has been located by radar , Egypt 's culture ministry says .
A team of Austrian archaeologists used radar imaging to find the underground outlines of the city in the Nile Delta , a now densely populated area .
The Hyksos were foreign occupiers from Asia who ruled Egypt for a century .
Avaris was their summer capital , near what is now the town of Tal al - Dabaa .
The radar images show the outlines of streets and houses underneath the green farm fields and modern towns in Egypt 's Delta .
Egyptian antiquities chief Zahi Hawass said in a statement that the area could be part of Avaris , the summer capital of the Hyksos who ruled Egypt from 1664 - 1569 BC , during the 15th Dynasty .
" The pictures taken using radar [ imaging ] show an underground city complete with streets , houses and tombs which gives a general overview of the urban planning of the city , " Dr Hawass said in a statement .
Irene Mueller , who heads the Austrian team , said the main purpose of the project had been to determine how far the underground city extended .
" The aim of the geophysical survey was to identify the size of the ancient city and the mission managed to identify a large number of houses and streets and a port inside the city , " she said .
" The mission also identified one of the Nile river tributaries that passed through the city , as well as two islands , " she was quoted as saying in the statement .

The new Spider - Man game from developer Beenoz and publisher Activision puts you in the role of four different Spider - Men from different times and dimensions , all with their own looks and moves .
If you are not a comic fan , you probably are n’t familiar with the concept of multiple universes ( weirdo ) .
In the Marvel Universe , there are multiple dimensions , each with their own history .
Usually the characters are the same people just in different situations , but not always .
The names might be the same , but in some cases that is as far as the similarities go .
In the game Spider - Man : Shattered Dimensions , you play as four different versions of Spider - Man .
The game begins when a mystical artifact called the Tablet of Order and Chaos is broken into four pieces and spread over four dimensions , causing problems with all of reality .
When a sorcerer tells Spider - Man of the situation , Spider - Man then is forced to get help from other versions of himself to find and reunite the pieces of the tablet .
You play as four unique versions of Spider - Man , each with their own style of play , move - set , and graphical look .
The plot carries through all four dimensions , but the main plot becomes a backdrop to the setting and ongoing stories of each of the main characters , as they go about their own lives and adventures .
The first Spider - Man you play as is the Amazing Spider - Man from the Marvel Universe that we all know , called Earth - 616 .
This Spider - Man wears the iconic red and blue outfit , and plays in a style you might consider more traditional for Spider - Man with a heavy emphasis on acrobatics , melee attacks , and several webbing based movements .
Each of the Spider - Men ’s dimensions will have a graphical look that is specific to them , and the Amazing Spider - Man ’s look is based on the comic book , with bright colors and a cell - shaded style that is fitting for a comic book .
The second Spider - Man is Spider - Man Noir , from Earth - 7207 - a Spider - Man set in depression - era 1930s New York .
This Spider - Man ’s style is more based on stealth .
He uses sneak attacks and fights like a brawler when caught , before retreating to the shadows .
The look is darker and grainier in fitting with the noir tradition , and the colors play a huge part in the levels .
When Spider - Man is in the shadows , the world is slightly more monochrome , but when he is seen , the colors take on an extremely bright look to signify that you are exposed .
This Spider - Man is based on the ongoing Marvel Noir series .
The third Spider - Man is a fan favorite , Spider - Man 2099 from Earth - 928 .
This Spider - Man is not actually Peter Parker , but rather Miguel O’Hara , a geneticist that gained spider abilities from a gene splicing mishap .
The character comes from the short lived Marvel 2099 series that gained a huge cult following but was ultimately ended due to budgetary concerns and shakeups at Marvel .
This version of Spider - Man is much more sci- fi based than the others , and the setting and look match that feel .
Set in the police - state city of Nuevo York , Spider - Man 2099 has several similar , but different abilities from the other Spider - Men .
While he lacks “ spider - sense ” , his vision is especially acute and allows the gamer to see targets and obstacles coming up , his outfit also allows his a slight gliding ability , and he has talons on each finger .
The look is more high tech , and the levels seem to move faster .
The fourth dimension has not yet been announced , but speculation has ranged from a symbiotic Spider - Man similar to Venom , to Spider - Man : India , to Zombie Spider - Man .
We ’ll have to wait until ComicCon to find out for sure .
From what was debuted at E3 , the detail in the game is incredible , and the graphics have been heavily emphasized - especially the lighting effects that looked unreal in Nuevo York , and became part of the gameplay for Spider - Man Noir .
While each character might have their own moves and styles , the core mechanics seems to move in a similar fashion for each - which is a good thing .
The character animations also look spot-on , which is a must for any Spider - Man game that will rely on acrobatic and unusual movements .
Beenox are planning on at least 12 hours of gameplay , with three levels available for each version of Spider - Man and each level taking at least an hour .
There are also several unlockables , as well as exclusives skins , like Cosmic Spider - Man that is available as a pre-order reward from Game Spot , and Iron Spider - Man , available when you order through Amazon .
Expect to hear more about this game as its September 7 release date nears .

Louise has straight , auburn hair and , judging by the only photograph I have of her , she 's in her 30s .
She works in recruitment .
I also know which train station she uses regularly , what supermarket she shopped at last night and where she met her friends for a meal in her home town last week .
At this moment , she is somewhere inside the pub in front of me meeting with colleagues after work .
Louise is a complete stranger .
Until 10 minutes ago when I discovered she was located within a mile of me , I did n't even know of her existence .
But equipped only with a smartphone and an increasingly popular social networking application called Foursquare , I have located her to within just a few square metres , accessed her Twitter account and conducted multiple cross-referenced Google searches using the personal details I have already managed to accrue about her from her online presence .
In the short time it has taken me to walk to this pub in central London , I probably know more about her than if I 'd spent an hour talking to her face - to - face .
She does n't know it yet , but Louise is about to meet her new digital stalker .
Foursquare is the latest social networking tool to generate online buzz .
The story has become very familiar in recent years : a bright young thing develops an internet app that connects people and allows them instantly to communicate with each other ; within months , a million or more people around the planet are using it ; investors queue up expressing an interest and speculation begins about how much Google , Yahoo ! , Apple or Microsoft is willing to throw down to snap it up .
( To date , the speculative figure in the media has reached $ 100 m . )
Twitter , Facebook , MySpace and Bebo have all come before it , but Foursquare promises something new .
After a decade of false dawns for the industry , it leads the way in a wave of new " geolocative " social networking tools .
Unofficially , at least , 2010 has been labelled by many within the technology world as the " year of location " .
In addition to offering the communal connectivity of Twitter and Facebook , Foursquare also uses your smartphone 's global positioning system ( GPS ) to broadcast your precise location to your " friends " and , should you so wish , to the wider world .
Users are encouraged to " check in " on their phone whenever they arrive at a point of interest – a shop , a cafe , a museum , a nightclub , an office – so that fellow users know where they are .
A great way supposedly to see if any of your friends are around and about .
Glance down at your phone and – as I did with Louise – see the names of all the other users around you within a mile or so and , crucially , exactly where they are and which fellow users they are with .
( I was drawn to Louise because she was in a cluster of Foursquare users – albeit still rare , even somewhere such as London – and she was the user allowing a stranger such as myself access to the most personal information – photograph , full name , Twitter feed etc. )
Visit somewhere a lot and you can even vie with other users to become its virtual " mayor " .
If you feel so inclined , you can also leave a tip or review in the digital ether – " hey , order the bacon burger , it 's great ! " – so others following can benefit from your experience .
Foursquare is now being widely touted as the app which will , after years of anticipation and prediction , mark the beginning of " life as a game " computing .
Whatever you do , wherever you go , you will be scoring points , earning " medals " , and be in , at the very least , social competition with other users around you .
What the ultimate prize is , no one is yet quite sure , but some companies have been quick to realise the potential of this technology with Starbucks , Debenhams and others offering loyal customers who frequently check in to their stores rewards such as a free cup of coffee .
Imagine a supermarket loyalty reward card synced with Twitter , Amazon reviews and GPS technology and you have some idea of Foursquare 's potency .
But with such power comes responsibility and there are growing concerns that Foursquare is proving to be a " stalker 's dream " .
Sure , you might earn yourself a " free " decaf latte when you check in five times at a coffee shop , but at what price to your privacy ?
Last month , a coding expert called Jesper Andersen managed to capture the details of 875,000 check-ins in San Francisco – currently , the global hotspot of Foursquare use – over a three - week period after noticing a privacy glitch in the " who was here " function which allowed him to monitor who had been checking - in to any location , regardless of the users ' privacy settings .
" I 'm trying to be white - hat [ computing slang for a ' good guy ' ] , " Andersen told Wired.com .
" It definitely felt icky at times . "
He had asked users he knew to confirm his findings .
" Some were grossed out by it , and a couple of people stopped using Foursquare .
One had a stalker and got creeped out by it . "
Privacy advocates fear that Foursquare , along with other geolocation apps such as Gowalla and Google Latitude , are vulnerable to " data scraping " , namely , the sophisticated trawling and monitoring of user activity in an effort to build a rich database of personal information .
The big worry , say critics , is who might get to make use of this information .
Pick your paranoia .
Someone with criminal intent , such as a burglar , identity thief or stalker ?
Governments , the security services or police ?
Terrorists ?
Or a corporation looking to target its products at you with incredible precision ?
Compounding the threat is that " friends " are much more readily accumulated in the online world of social networking compared to who we might choose to accept as friends in our " real life " .
Accept a friend request in Foursquare without due care and you are potentially opening up your personal diary to a complete stranger .
Jason Stamper , editor of Computer Business Review , has criticised Foursquare for what he says is its lax attitude to privacy protection , describing the potential risks as " terrifying " .
Stamper 's principal criticism is that Foursquare 's default position on privacy is that users must " opt- out " if they do n't want any of their location - based details broadcast to friends and the wider world .
Of course , Foursquare would be rendered virtually useless as a tool if a user did this so there is typically always some form of data exposure occurring when someone uses Foursquare .
As has been repeatedly shown before with Facebook , the risks will often boil down to whether you really know who your " friends " are .
" Many of these companies , such as Foursquare , are only paying lip service to privacy concerns , " says Stamper .
" Their motivation is growth .
They need a critical mass of users to make their service more useful so they have to leave their doors open as much as possible .
" Privacy seems to be very low down their priorities .
In theory , if every user knows the risks , this is fine .
But they just do n't .
It 's being targeted at 18 to 25 - year - olds .
Facebook was forced in the end to change its default privacy settings due to public concerns .
Foursquare should do the same .
Some people are even checking in when they 're at home .
Think of the implications .
It 's crazy . "
The potential for someone to " layer " data about you is also a key concern , says Stamper .
" Someone using Foursquare can accumulate a very detailed map of your habits when added to what they already know about you via Facebook , Twitter etc .
Simon Davies , the director of Privacy International , a London - based " watchdog on surveillance and privacy invasions by governments and corporations " , shares similar fears about the direction this technology is taking society .
" It 's very difficult to extract yourself from it all once you 're in .
And crossing the line into live feeds of locative information is a deeply worrying step forward .
Technologically , it 's not a huge step , but , socially , it is huge .
The big moral questions are being left to the app developers to answer at the moment .
This is irresponsible .
Users are being socially engineered into allowing this level of privacy invasion through the over - hyping of the benefits . "
Holding the smartphone in my palm with a full - screen picture of Louise on display , I enter .
Inside , a football match is showing on various screens , pints of ale and chilled lager are being pulled , and huddles of friends are bent over tables laughing and in conversation .
But after several sweeps of the pub I can see no sign of Louise , or anyone even vaguely matching her picture .
So I check her Twitter feed again and see she 's just tweeted that she 's at a recruitment networking event .
I ask at the bar if there 's a function room .
" Yes , downstairs . "
Besides the gents , a glass - panelled door reveals a private room heaving with people in tight groups clutching glasses of wine .
On a wall behind them , a large projector screen is displaying a " Twitterwall " , a way of showing to an audience a feed of any particular Twitter hashtag , in this case , the name of the networking event .
So I go back up to the bar , set up a Twitter account under a pseudonym on my phone , and – not wishing to freak Louise out – send a public message using the event 's hashtag to the Twitterwall that I wish to talk to any of the Foursquare users I can see on my phone who are currently in the pub .
A five - minute wait and a further tweet later , Louise – sensibly accompanied by a male colleague – walks up to the bar area where I 'm waiting and asks if I 'm the person trying to make contact .
It 's probably with a sense of relief that she discovers that I'm " only " a journalist investigating Foursquare .
So why does she use it ?
" My job in recruitment means that I try to stay at the forefront of technologies such as Twitter and Facebook , " she says .
" I 'm just messing about with it really .
To be honest , I could n't see at first the obvious uses of Foursquare . "
I then tell her the sort of information I have already managed to deduce about her life simply by using my phone .
I show her that I have her own photo on my phone .
She admits it 's a " little unnerving , to say the least " .
" I thought I was being very careful with what I was posting , " she says .
" I never thought I was revealing personal information .
I only use my maiden name when using social networking apps .
And I never check in when at my kids ' school or at home .
But , as you 've shown , I can't see who 's following me on Twitter .
If I was going out for an evening with my girlfriends again , I do n't think I would now share it with the world via Foursquare . "
( Louise 's setting on Foursquare automatically tweets her location whenever she checks into a location , which was how I could tell via her Twitter feed , without being her Foursquare " friend " , where she had been in recent days in such detail . )
Will she continue to use Foursquare , or at least tighten up her privacy settings ?
" It 's just early adopters at the moment , but I can see it having excellent uses for business , particularly in my line of work .
Recruitment is a form of stalking , I suppose .
But I can now see the negative implications of Foursquare in the real world .
" Checking in at home is really stupid .
But people can still give away clues via Twitter , as I 've obviously been doing .
I suppose the benefit of checking in is to create a relationship , or say to people that you 've gone somewhere interesting .
It 's all part of social competitiveness , I suppose .
It has become a habit for so many of us . "
Since Andersen exposed Foursquare 's privacy lapses so effectively last month , the company has made some minor alterations to how user check - in information is revealed to the public .
( In March , Foursquare set up its " celebrity mode " with MTV and VH1 so that users could follow celebrity users , albeit with limited , controlled information about their location . )
But a user 's location can still be automatically broadcast via their Twitter feed .
Critics point out that a warning of the risks should be prominently displayed to users when they set up their accounts , and they are asked if they wish to link with their Twitter and Facebook accounts .
" We 're continually looking for ways to improve the sharing options that we provide , " responds a Foursquare spokeswoman .
" For example , we recently updated our user - settings page to create more opt - out options related to sharing user data .
We are working on a number of additional changes to give users more sharing options and further clarify the implications of sharing information via Foursquare .
We encourage all of our users to check their privacy settings regularly to ensure that they 're comfortable with the amount of information that they 're sharing . "
The spokeswoman adds : " The majority of our sharing settings are opt - in – users need to actively accept friend requests to be directly connected with others , and users also need to opt into broadcasting their check-ins to their Facebook and Twitter accounts at each check - in , assuming they 've decided to link their Facebook and Twitter accounts to their Foursquare account . "
Ten days ago Foursquare reached the two - million - users landmark , just three months after it had reached the one - million mark .
A week earlier , the company received $ 20 m in venture capital from a who 's who of Silicon Valley luminaries .
It appears the trajectory for Foursquare is only upwards .
But as the critical mass of Foursquare users swells and intensifies over the coming months and years , the concerns over privacy are likely to magnify .
In June , Webroot , a Denver - based internet security firm , surveyed 1,645 users of " geo-location - ready mobile devices " , including 624 in the UK : 29 % said they shared their location with people other than their friends ; 31 % said they accepted a friend request from a stranger ; and , yet , 55 % still said they were worried about their loss of privacy .
" The issue with location - based information is that it exposes another layer of personal information that , frankly , we have n't had to think much about : our exact physical location at anytime , anywhere , " explained the creators of PleaseRobMe.com , a website set up to expose how vulnerable Twitter users can be when displaying location - based messages , earlier this year .
" If you 're comfortable being a human homing beacon , that 's fine , we just want you to be fully aware of what that means and the potential risks it might involve . "
Sharron
Angle is at it again , running away from reporters and still not ready for prime time .
Run , Sharron , run !
How is this woman going to survive a debate if she can't handle taking reporters ' questions at her own press conference ?
GOP Senate candidate Angle avoids press at own event :
U.S. Senate candidate Sharron
Angle invited local media to attend a press event in Reno Wednesday morning , but when members of the media tried to ask the candidate questions she did n't answer .
At the event this morning Angle signed a pledge to repeal the estate tax - or " death tax " - if she 's elected , made a few brief statements and walked away with several members of the local media in tow .
News 4 Reporter Karen Griffin was one of the reporters trying to ask Angle questions and she actually ignored the questions , looked straight ahead and kept walking .
News 4 arrived at this morning 's event early to make sure we could talk with Angle .
News 4 listened to the press conference and when it ended , Angle simply walked away .
One of the questions was a request for a response to Rep.
Dean Heller 's , R - Nev. , comment that he made the night before on a political talk show about her comments about the unemployed .
Following this morning 's event , Reporter Karen Griffin contacted University of Nevada , Reno Political Science Professor Eric Herzik to see if there 's any benefit for a candidate avoiding the media as Sharron Angle has .
Here 's what he had to say :
" This is part of the skill of the candidate .
If you 're given a question you do n't like , answer the question you want to answer .
Turn the question around .
And she 's not doing that .
Turning her back and walking away from a camera is a pretty damning visual image for a candidate . "
To be fair News 4 emailed Angle 's campaign following the press event to see if she would answer the question we asked , and to see where she had to be after the event .
News 4 has not heard from the Angle campaign .
News 4 received some negative feedback on this story ; people asking why we were late to this event , and why we did n't ask our questions during the press event , and why this is a news story .
There were no opportunities for questions during the event , that 's why we asked for Angle to answer questions as soon as the event ended .

As recently as June 10 , London - based J.P. Morgan analyst Fred Lucas told clients that BP ( NYSE : BP ) is a screaming buy .
But current " back of napkins " estimates employed by JPM and others to determine the scale and cost of the disaster are far too low , in my opinion .
Given what we 've learned in the last month , I suspect that even current " high - end " estimates will look optimistic in hindsight .
My own estimates are much higher than everything else I 've seen .
Of course , my numbers are really just guesses , like everyone elses .
Naturally , I think my numbers are more accurate .
With that out of the way , here is my analysis of the worst - case scenario for BP and the Gulf of Mexico .
J.P. Morgan 's BP analyst is one of the few to venture a guess as to how much oil ( total ) will be leaked into the Gulf .
So I applaud Mr. Lucas for putting the opinion out there , even though I disagree with his current conclusion .
The WSJ reports that the Mr. Lucas ' " worse - case " estimate is 1.9 million barrels leaked into the Gulf , all told .
( So does " worse - case " mean worse than the current estimates , or a worst - possible scenario ?
Could be a typo , could be legalese . )
With official barrel - per-day ( BPD ) rising from 0 bpd initially , to 1,000 , to 5,000 , to 12,000 , to 19,000 , to 30,000 , all the way to the latest official estimate of 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day , it seems unwise to assume the trend of increasing estimates will end at any given time ( it should be noted that quotes from the JPM buy rec are from a June 10 interview in the WSJ ) .
My current worst - case scenario : 20 million barrels leaked into the Gulf , and $ 560 billion in damages .
Let me explain how I arrived at that number .
Update :
As I was writing this piece , the official FRTG estimate jumped from 20,000 - 40,000 to 35,000 - 60,000 .
The group in charge of official estimates , the Flow Rate Technical Group or FRTG , has been hesitant to give exact numbers and opinions of all scientists involved .
( update above ) .
I spoke with NOAA officials yesterday , and they would not comment on whether the previous 20 k to 40 k range was actually the low end of a broader range , rather than a median or consensus estimate .
They did mention a new official estimate was out soon , but referred all questions on flow rates to the USGS and FRTG .
0 to 60,000 BPD , Will It Stop Here ?
As far back as May 21st , a NYT editorial by independent experts said 100,000 bpd is certainly not out of the question .
So it seems logical to include those numbers in a worst - case analysis .
Let 's run a few scenarios using different inputs for barrels / day ( BPD ) and number of days until the leak stops .
Note : 35,000 represents the low range of the latest official estimate .
Total barrels leaked will depend on future revisions of how much oil has leaked out over time , as the flow varies .
BPD Days Total Barrels Leaked
35,000 56 ( today ) 1.96 million 35,000 100 3.5 million
60,000 200 12 million 100,000 200 20 million
Worst - Case Cost Estimates for BP , Based on Valdez Costs
Keep in mind that the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled a relatively small 250,000 barrels of oil into Prince William Sound .
That disaster cost Exxon around $ 7 billion , adjusted for inflation .
The Gulf disaster could end up being 10 - 80 x larger than Valdez in terms of barrels spilled , based on the scenarios outlined in the table above .
That would mean 2.5 - 20 millon barrels spilled close to the Mississipi Delta .
It 's an area which is arguably more important , by an order of magnitude , than Prince William Sound , where the Exxon Valdez ran aground .
Thinking about the long - term environmental damage is overwhelming .
To summarize :
My total economic damage estimate range , based on the Exxon Valdez model multiplied by how much larger this spill / leak , is $ 70 - $ 560 billion .
Relief Wells
The original effort to stop the main wellhead gusher appears to have been abandoned .
The focus is now on capturing as much of the leak as possible until a " bottom kill " using relief wells can be attemped .
In his analysis , J.P. Morgan 's Mr. Lucas also assumes that relief wells will succeed by July 4th .
Everyone wants these wells to work , but it seems reckless to use July 4 as the base assumption for analysis , especially when you call it worse - case .
Most analysts do not expect relief wells to succeed until August at earliest , with Business Week reporting that efforts could take until Christmas .
We have no idea how much oil is leaking into the Gulf right now .
Even after the recent revisions , those estimates could go higher .
One big reason for this uncertainty is that current estimates are all based on flow rate from the main leak (s ) .
Oil Leaking from the Seafloor ?
Some evidence is emerging that oil is now leaking directly from the seafloor , not just from the broken wellhead .
Consider this video shot from an ROV on the seafloor , reportedly shot from one of two ROVs from the Viking Poseidon .
Keith Olbermann of MSNBC reported on the possibility of oil leaking from the sea floor on his show , which aired June 8th .
It 's not a happy situation .
I do n't want the Gulf to suffer or BP to go under .
I bought BP shares on May 4th , stopping out for an 8 % loss a few days later .
So I understand the temptation to value - shop .
But facts have emerged over the last month that dramatically change the situation , as I explained here on June 1st .
Unless we start preparing for a true worst case scenario , we will not be ready for the economic , environmental , and financial impacts it could bring .
Note : I am currently short BP and own puts , so please assume this analysis is biased .
I do not think it is , but welcome refutations and / or corrections .
One might consider the possibility that Wall Street firms who count BP as a client may be unintentionally biased , as well .
Do your own research , this is not investment advice .
It is the solely the opinion of the author .

Xinjiang requires officials to be bilingual ( Xinhua )
Updated : 2010-05-01 13:43
URUMUQI - Candidates for government jobs in Xinjiang must be able to communicate in both Chinese and the local language , regional authorities said Friday .
From 2010 , all candidates for government jobs must be bilingual , according to the regulation adopted by the regional government Tuesday , Kang Tingfeng , a spokesman for Xinjiang 's human resources department , said .
The regulation will enable officials to better serve the people , encourage the learning of languages and promote exchange between people of different ethnic groups , he said .
Ethnic
Han candidates will have to be able to talk with ethnic minorities in the ethnic minorities ' language .
Similarly , ethnic minority candidates must be able to read and write simple Chinese .
A candidate who passes the job test and interview but who fails to meet the language requirements will be required to attend a 3 - month language training program , the regulations say .
After the training , the candidate 's language abilities will be tested again .
If the candidate fails the test again , he / she will be given another opportunity to study in the following year 's training program .
If the candidate fails the test a third time , his / her job application will be rejected .
The regional government is also urging officials , especially grassroots officials , to become bilingual .
Government employees hired in the past two years are required to join language training programs .
Bilingual skills have been a prerequisite for government jobs in the Xinjiang cities of Kashgar and Hotan for years .
The regulation is significant in Xinjiang , where more than 12 million of its 20 - million population speak 13 ethnic languages , said Ma Pinyan , a scholar with Xinjiang 's Academy of Social Sciences .
A huge agenda of global issues was crammed into four days of ' secret ' meetings by a mysterious group of power brokers .
But who elected them and why are we paying for them ?
Weary and bramble - scratched , elated by the press coverage , and sick of riot vans and lukewarm Spanish omelette baguettes , we return from Bilderberg 2010 with the following thoughts uppermost in our tired mind :
• ' Global cooling ' is on the cards
Check out the agenda for Bilderberg 2010 : " Financial reform , security , cyber technology , energy , Pakistan , Afghanistan , world food problem , global cooling , social networking , medical science , EU - US relations . "
That list is a window into your future .
Do n't think for one minute that it is n't .
And do n't ignore it , because it is n't ignoring you .
I love how " social networking " must fry the Bilderbergian mind .
On the one hand , as Zuckerberg of Facebook says , privacy is no longer a social norm so it 's okay to milk the networking sites for information , social trends and dissident thinking ; however , you can't stop the people from arranging a meet - up to discuss internet censorship or the rights and wrongs of " global cooling " .
Speaking of which , Bill Gates ( Bilderberg 2010 ) is funding " cloud whitening " technology ; trials start soon .
Global dimming is n't just something that happens every time Big Brother starts .
On the basis of this agenda , I think we can expect a lot of statements about cutting - edge cloud - technology trials in the next 12 months .
If it works in Dubai , it can work in Britain too ...
• You can't keep a good story down
If I had to pick the point when Bilderberg finally broke through into mainstream news , it would be when the BBC News Blog published a round - up of Bilderberg reports .
Twelve months ago , this would have been barely conceivable .
This year , Kissinger must be spitting chips .
• People love their ' leaders '
I know this sounds peculiar , or at least it does to me , but this year 's Bilderbloggings have quite commonly been met with outrage at the idea that we should submit Bilderberg to greater scrutiny .
You hear people talk about the delegates at Bilderberg as their " leaders " , and you see the delegates mythologised as the greatest and the best – whose benign Olympian machinations should progress untroubled by the interference of public and press .
" Leaders " like the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell , and the chairman of Kissinger Associates Inc .
I 'm baffled to the point of punching tree trunks to witness the determination of some folk to throw themselves in front of these heads of corporations and presidents of banks and to wave their arms protectively , yelping : " Leave them alone !
Let them strategise for the good of the world in peace !
How could they possibly have a frank discussion with our politicians if we were privy to it ?
Stop this unseemly prying ! " I mean , seriously .
The day that Marcus Agius , chairman of Barclays , strategises for my good is the day he repays me the hundreds of pounds of bank charges he 's been levying on me since my schooldays .
The day that Peter Voser , CEO of Royal Dutch Shell , sits around a table with the express concern of making the world a better , more beautiful place for all of us , is the day that my arse grows teeth and eats my hat .
Do this :
Look at the list of participants and ask yourself one simple question : what 's their bottom line ?
• I'm on a list
One afternoon , towards the end of the conference , my wife and I chanced upon some of the Bilderberg organisers out on a two - limo trip to the seafront .
We recognised them from our stay at the hotel before the conference began .
We went up and asked them if they could confirm the names of British delegates attending this year 's meeting .
In horror , they jackknifed from the promenade , back into their limos , one of them cackling weirdly and holding her handbag to her face .
Another snatched a camera from the footwell , and started snapping my face as I snapped hers .
You can see me give the thumbs - up in the photo .
So , if I was n't before , I 'm now on Bilderberg 's least wanted list .
What a bore .
Bilderberg snaps back : my face is on its way to Leiden HQ .

Maybe they 'll write me nice letter , asking me to cease and desist .
Or maybe ... maybe it 's best I state now , for the record : I 'm not a communist , a fascist , a racist or a petty thief .
I did n't steal that laptop , I did n't photograph those children , I do n't mutilate horses .
I did n't sleep with that prostitute .
I do n't believe in UFOs .
I do n't have sketchbooks filled with drawings of the Houses of Parliament on fire .
I do n't hate progress .
I am not possessed of vile feelings towards the Dutch , the Spanish , the Jews , the Mormons , the Welsh , or anyone on earth except Peruvian folk musicians .
I 'm not into S&M .
I 've never paid anyone to hose me with custard , or tread on my testicles in six - inch heels .
I do n't spend Friday nights in a gimp suit .
I 'm not an adult baby .
I * did * make a porn film once , but it was n't a very good one .
Too much plot .
I 'm not manically depressed , delusional , bitter towards the world , a brooding failure , a collector of SS regalia , obsessed with one particular local weather reporter , or suicidal .
I did n't raise my voice .
The steps of the police station were n't slippy .
I do n't want to kill bankers or string up politicians .
I do n't want to overthrow the government .
I would n't mind if there were fewer talent shows on TV , but it 's nothing that 's likely to spill over into bloodshed .
I 'm not wearing a bra .
I have n't had sex with a turkey .
• People are n't angry enough
There were 130 people up the hill , chugging sangria and strategising .
And down at the foot of the hill , on the other side of the riot vans , about 130 people with flags and cameras .
My God , that 's depressing .
In a world that , by any estimation , is a hard , gruelling , unfair place to billions of humans , in which assets are being grabbed , wealth is being relentlessly centralised ( the Bilderbank , Goldman Sachs , has just notched up its best ever quarter , in which George Osborne so kindly lets us choose our own " austerity measures " – in such a distressingly cocked - up world , 130 of us made it all the way to the Spanish seaside to say : " Maybe what you 're strategising up there is n't working out for the best . "
Perhaps there would have been more , but people have got other things on their mind : they 're behind on their mortgage payments , saving up for a wedding , saving up for a divorce , saving up for a holiday that does n't involve being detained by policemen , disenchanted by CamCleggian sameness , hotly engaged in local politics , knackered , sick , drunk , or Spelbound ( in the Britain 's Got Talent sense of the word ) .
They 're furious enough that Robert Green let that goal in , never mind anything else .
Where 's the headspace to be concerned about Bilderberg ?
Bertrand Russell saw it coming .
He saw a world in which " any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible " .
I 'm surprised you 've even got time in your day to have scrolled this far down .
• One person can make a difference
Last year , I wrote about my visit to Vouliagmeni to see what Bilderberg was all about .
It was n't a happy trip .
But in my final piece I asked people to come along in 2010 and help sprinkle the " slug " of Bilderberg with the " salt " of publicity .
About 10 or so people took me up on this .
Of these 10 , one was " Quierosaber " , the brave fellow who crawled into the hills before sunrise , with leaves wrapped around his head , and took photos of the delegates ( see our Spot the Delegate quiz , and our Bilderberg 2010 Power Gallery ) .
In one of his photos appeared Gordon Campbell , the premier of British Columbia .
The Canadian press started asking questions , and discovered that he'd paid for his plane ticket to Bilderberg using public money .
Sure , Campbell was on the quietly published list of attendees , but the difference between a list of names and a photo is incalculable .
So there we have it : accountability , transparency , and none of it possible without people like Quierosaber packing a knapsack at 4 am , wrapping laurel leaves round a borrowed camera and hiding under brambles .
• There 's an awful lot of unelected ' advising ' in the world
One of the participants snapped by Quierosaber is the glacial senior fellow of the Hudson Institute , Marie - Josée Kravis , ( wife of Henry Kravis , head of private equity megafirm KKR ) .
The tax - exempt Hudson Institute is a US " thinktank " which has a clearly stated aim : " We seek to guide global leaders in government and business . "
It 's funded by good and wise people like Monsanto , DuPont , Pfizer , McDonald's , General Atomics , IBM , Proctor & Gamble , and Conrad Black ( Bilderberg attendee and currently guest of Florida correctional institution ) .
The Hudson Institute was set up by the Rand Corporation ( which had previously been set up by the Douglas Aircraft Company to advise the US military ) .
In a nutshell , that 's who Marie - Josée Kravis works for , and that 's who George Osborne spent Bilderberg 2006 , 2007 , 2008 and 2009 listening to .
In the words of Aretha Franklin : who 's zoomin ' who ?
And who the hell asked these foundations for their guidance in the first place ?
Stop issuing reports !
Stop thinktanking !
Stop presenting " well - timed recommendations to leaders in government " .
Mind your own unelected business for a change .
And pay some tax while you 're about it .
• There 's still no answer to the big question
I 'd like to quote the prime minister , David Cameron ( Bilderberg , 2008 ) : " Greater transparency is at the heart of our shared commitment to enable the public to hold politicians and public bodies to account …
It 's your money , your government , you should know what 's going on .
So we 're going to rip off that cloak of secrecy and extend transparency as far and as wide as possible . "
In the spirit of secret cloaks being ripped away , it seems reasonable to ask : does the secretive " private meeting " of Bilderberg , which takes " one - third " of its participants " from government and politics " , have any effect at all on our domestic and international policies ?
Does this fantastically media - shy group that has our brand new lord chancellor , Kenneth Clarke QC MP , on its inner steering committee , does this four - day conference , with its agenda and its lanyards and its side - meeting seminar rooms , does it serve to influence the way our country is run ?
Or is that a bit like asking : Does Amy Winehouse like a drink ?
Explicitly top of Bilderberg 's agenda this year is " financial reform " .
Present at this year 's conference : Paul Volcker , chairman of Obama 's economic recovery advisory board .
Just after Bilderberg , Obama warns of massive layoffs of teachers , police and firefighters .
Also present was Portugal 's finance minster , Fernando Teixeira dos Santos .
Portugal has just voted through an emergency package of tax hikes and public spending cuts .
Was any of this discussed in the financial reform sessions ?
If not , what was discussed ?
If Bilderberg does n't influence public policy , then why is it four days long , and why does it spend € 10 m protecting the sanctity of its discussions ?
Why hold it at all ?
What a waste of busy people 's time !
And if it does influence public policy , then by what twisted logic is public money being spent keeping it secret ?
And why , in this publicly protected secrecy , should Klaus Kleinfeld ( disgraced former CEO of Siemens AG ) and Dieter Zetsche ( the chairman of Mercedes - Benz ) , and James A Johnson ( board member of Goldman Sachs , member of the trilateral commission , member of the Council on Foreign Relations ) , have the ear of our politicians ?
Cameron wants us to have the answers to these questions .
As he says : " It 's your money , your government , you should know what 's going on . "
So we ask : How much British public money has been used to police Bilderberg ?
Who 's putting the request in to MI5 ?
Who 's paying for the watermelons ?
Does the Bilderberg Group have an accounts book ?
Could we see it ?
Could someone ask Ken Clarke for a copy ?
Is n't it about time the Daily Telegraph got involved ?
Are taxpayers paying for the riot vans ?
Or are corporations hiring police forces as private armies to stand guard over a private meeting ?
These questions are exactly as stupid and exactly as important as asking whether Sir Peter Viggers bought his own duck house .
These are questions about political process that deserve simple and straightforward answers , not the scorn of idiots for asking them .
• It takes longer to get from Sitges to Santander than you might think
I missed the ferry home .
And not even by a whisker .
I was a good 100 km out in my estimate .
There was shouting and recrimination on a rain - sodden Basque motorway .
I can't believe I did n't do what the VP of Fiat did and come by private jet .
• There are only 358 shopping days till Bilderberg 2011
Maybe you think there 's nothing to worry about here .
Maybe you think Bilderberg is n't a public - private travesty of secrecy and lies .
Maybe you see nothing odd in Tony Blair ( Bilderberg 1993 ) lying to parliament about going .
Maybe you think this is how " important stuff " gets done , how geopolitics should be conducted .
Maybe you think it 's okay that a representative of the Hudson Institute , which campaigns against organic food and is funded by Monsanto , should be locked in a conference centre for four days discussing the " world food problem " with Joaquín Almunia , the EU commissioner for competition .
Marching off into the sunset : but they 'll be back again for Bilderberg 2011 .

Maybe you look at the world and think it 'll all be okay tomorrow because , for you at least , it 's sort of okay today .
Maybe you see " social networking " and " cyber technology " on Bilderberg 's agenda and you are n't concerned .
Maybe you do n't think Peter Mandelson 's rushed - through digital economy bill had anything to do with his attendance at Bilderberg 2009 .
Maybe you do n't see an irony in the individual getting screwed and screwed again by the same corporations and bailed - out banks who are so forthcoming with their advice for our politicians .
Maybe you do n't feel like you 're getting shafted .
Or maybe you 've just got numb .
There are plenty of other things to worry about in the world .
Serious things , like health and poverty and terrorism .
And anyway , the people up the hill in Bilderberg will sort it out for us .
They 're clever people .
They 're experts .
They just spent four days talking about " medical science " and the " world food problem " .
They 're on it .
We can relax .
Or maybe you think it would a good thing to keep the Bilderball rolling .
The massively increased coverage of this year 's Bilderberg did n't just " happen " .
People made it happen .
People emailed photos to press agencies , rang up friends who worked for newspapers , gave interviews to camera crews , and a local lawyer whose wife was giving birth to twins gave pro bono advice over the phone .
So here 's an idea : maybe you were given a telephoto lens three Christmases ago and you 've never had cause to use it .
Maybe you 're not sure we should start bombing Iran just yet .
Maybe you 're a fan of " greater transparency " , and fancy taking Cameron up on his pledge " to enable the public to hold politicians and public bodies to account " .
Maybe you 'd like to meet some of the sharp , savvy , committed , interested people I 've met this last week .
Maybe you 'd like to be one of them .
Borrow a tent , set up a YouTube channel , start saving now for the flight .

Let 's add a zero to the end of 130 .
And let 's put an end to the lunatic , inappropriate , expensive and undemocratic secrecy of Bilderberg .
Matt Stone has explained why Matt Damon 's puppet looks ' retarded ' in Team America : World Police .
The South Park co-creator said that Damon puppet ended up looking as it did just because it came out of the oven that way , which was nothing like it was supposed to look like .
Stone insists that the strange - looking doll is nothing personal against Damon himself .
IMDB quotes Stone as saying : " When we looked at the plans for his head he looked good , but when we came out of the oven he just looked retarded .
I think it was well thought out .
Honestly , I think Matt Damon is one of the better actors around .
I think he 's a pretty great actor .
He 's pretty talented .
And for no real reason , he is retarded in this movie . "

According to a Federal law , lesbians , gays , bisexuals , and transgenders ( LGBTs ) are not protected against workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the private sector .
The proposed bill of Employment Non-Discrimination
Act or ENDA , would put an end to this and provide everyone in the country with equal employment rights , regardless of sexual orientation .
This law has been pushed in every single session in Congress since 1994 .
After 19 long years of fighting , it has been repeatedly denied due to certain hate - groups and religious groups that think making employment equal will lead to a slew of gay marriage in their neighborhood , leading ( inevitably ) to certain apocalypse .
ENDA would be a start , but it does not apply to small businesses , religious organizations or the military ( more on this later ) , and does not require that domestic partner benefits be provided to the same - sex partners of employees .
However , there ’s still hope in the following states which currently prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in BOTH public and private sectors , but federally it will be an uphill struggle .
They are : California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , District of Colombia , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont , Washington , and Wisconsin .
The LGBT fight for justice is seeing a dim light at the end of the of the tunnel , as more than half of the U.S. currently battles to see LGBTs as human beings who also have rights .
LGBTs continue to put extra effort into bringing this issue to justice .
They ’ve found that if LGBTs currently reside in states that do not protect them from workplace discrimination , they can still be protected by city and county ordinances , but the biggest step forward would still be ENDA .

Crunch has long been a hot - button topic in the industry , becoming of the most sensitive quality of life issues for game developers .
This year for the first time , Game Developer Research asked developers to quantify how much time they spend on crunch , in terms of both weeks per year and hours per week .
On average , according to research made available exclusively to GSW sister site Gamasutra , developers said they work 39.7 hours per week when not in crunch , putting game developer working hours right in line with the widespread 40 - hour standard .
Of course , that changes when crunch time is in effect .
During those periods , developers said they spent 55.3 hours per week at work during crunch time , an increase of 15.6 hours per week .
That 55.3 - hour week is equivalent to roughly a seven - day calendar week of eight - hour days , or a five - day business week of 11 - hour days .
Furthermore , developers said they spend 13.2 weeks per year , on average , in crunch mode , out of a standard 52 - week calendar year .
That means that , on average , developers are working the equivalent of about five extra eight - hour , five - day work weeks per year as a result of crunch -- meaning the average game developer 's year is effectively comprised of 57 work weeks rather than 52 .
GSW sister division Game Developer Research recently published top - level highlights from the salary study , including news of an overall 4 percent drop in mainstream game industry salaries to $ 75,573 .
Since then , it has publicly released earnings data on indie developers and contractors , developer opinions on the state of the industry , and data on developer ages and experience levels .
The full Game Developer Salary Survey 2005 - 2010 is now available for purchase from the official Game Developer Research site .
( The sample for the data contained in this excerpt was a group of 2,630 game developers across all disciplines and demographics . )
San Francisco moved a step closer Tuesday to becoming the first city in the nation to require that retailers post in their stores notices on the level of radiation emitted by the cell phones they offer .
The Board of Supervisors voted 10 - 1 to give preliminary approval to the proposal .
Final approval is expected next week .
Supervisor Sean Elsbernd was the lone vote in opposition .
Mayor Gavin Newsom , an early proponent of the legislation , plans to sign it into law when it reaches his desk .
Cast by backers as a pro-consumer measure , the ordinance would not ban the sale of certain cell phones but would require retailers to provide the " specific absorption rate " - a measurement of radiation registered with the Federal Communications Commission - next to phones displayed in their shops .
Consumers also would be notified about where they can get more educational materials .
" This is about helping people make informed choices , " said Supervisor Sophie Maxwell , chief sponsor of the legislation .
But a trade group for the cell phone industry said the law could lead to confusion .
" Rather than inform , the ordinance will potentially mislead consumers with point - of - sale requirements suggesting that some phones are ' safer ' than others , based on radio frequency emissions , " John Walls , vice president of public affairs for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association , said after the vote .
" In fact , all phones sold legally in the U.S. must comply with the Federal Communication Commission 's safety standards for ( radio frequency ) emissions . "
The FCC has adopted limits for safe exposure to radiation .
The measurement shows the amount of radio frequency energy people absorb in their bodies when talking on a cell phone .
The potential long - term health impacts of cell phone use , particularly on the brain , is still a matter of scientific debate .
A similar right - to - know measure , carried by state Sen. Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , died in the Legislature this year amid heavy lobbying by the cell phone industry .
Small business advocates in San Francisco also lobbied against the local labeling law , saying they did n't have an appetite for more government mandates , particularly in this tough economic climate .
" This is not about discouraging people from using their cell phones , " said Newsom spokesman Tony Winnicker .
" This is a modest and commonsense measure to provide greater transparency and information to consumers . "
The posting requirements would be phased in , beginning in February .
Violators would face fines of up to $ 300 .
City officials still need to educate retailers and figure out how the law would be enforced , when and if it is finally adopted .
Hundreds of stores in San Francisco sell cell phones .
Renee Sharp , director of the California office of the Environmental Working Group , a national nonprofit research and advocacy group , lauded San Francisco for its " leadership in protecting the public 's health and right to know , and we hope it 's the beginning of a movement that wo n't stop until everybody shopping for a phone has easy access to this information . "
Oilers defence prospect Martin Marincin
Kristans Pelss
Two Edmonton Oilers prospects recently drafted in last week 's 2010 NHL Entry Draft were taken among the top 19 picks in the Canadian Hockey League Import Draft on Tuesday morning .
Martin Marincin , drafted in the second round , 45th overall , by the Oilers was taken first overall among all CHL clubs by the Prince George Cougars .
The Edmonton Oil Kings then took Kristians Pelss , drafted by Edmonton in the seventh round , 181st overall , with the 19th selection .
Marincin , a 6 ’ 4 ” , 187 pound product of Kosice , Slovakia , was selected by the Edmonton Oilers in the second round , 46overall , in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft .
This past season , Marincin had two goals and four assists for six points in 35 games for his junior club team in Slovakia , while posting 71 penalty minutes .
Marincin represented Slovakia at the 2010 World Junior Hockey Championship in Saskatchewan , collecting two assists in six games .
Marincin also played at the 2010 World Under - 18 Championship in Belarus , where he scored two goals and added one assist in six games and had 14 penalty minutes .
Marincin served as captain of Slovakia ’s under - 18 squad .
The left - handed shooting blue - liner also played internationally for Slovakia at the 2009 World Under - 18 Championship in Fargo , North Dakota and at the World Under - 17 Challenge in Port Alberni , BC .
“ We ’ve had a chance to see Martin play a few times and we are confident he will be a strong addition to an emerging defence corps , ” said Prince George Cougars General Manager Dallas Thompson .
“ We had a chance to meet with Martin at the NHL Draft and found he ’s not only a solid player , but a great young man , as well . ”
Kristians Pelss , a forward from Latvia , spent last season playing for Dynamo Jr. “ I saw him in Belarus , he ’s a little unknown here , but he ’s a very explosive player ” said Edmonton Oil Kings General Manager Bob Green of the 5 ’ 11 ’’ forward .
“ He ’s a strong player with a good shot , who likes to shoot and can score . ”

No I am not surprised at all .
Remember , Aoki 's fighting style is very risky to begin with and also , this is not to protect him or anything , but his strategy is not suitable for today 's five - minute rounds and the 10 - point must scoring system .
His fight style is suitable for an unlimited time bout where judges score the entire bout ( as in PRIDE or DREAM ) , not by rounds .
His fight style is to look for that one or two opportunities to submit the opponent just like Royce Gracie did when he fought Kimo in the primitive era of MMA .
In that fight Royce got beat up but yet won the fight with an armbar .
I mean , if you want to be really ultimate about it , Aoki 's fight style is suitable for fighting in an open field with no judges .
Fighters fight till one of them submits or gets knocked out kinda thing .
He would be suitable for fighting in a place like Ganryu Island where Misashi Miyamoto faced Kojiro Sasaki .
But we all know this is a modern era of MMA .
So I am not surprised that Aoki got dominated because he has never really kept up with what has been taking place in the North America for the past ten years or so .
Aoki was n't fighting under the same scoring system as everyone else here in the States .
Not only the scoring system but he had never even fought in the cage .
I mean , my god , Strikeforce does n't even allow elbow shots to the head .
If this was in the UFC , he may have ended up being very bloody .
Its obvious fighters here in the States know that if the opponent pulls guard , then take him to the cage , close the distance and drop punches and elbows .
Aoki never had to deal with that when he was fighting in a ring .
Also in today 's MMA , striking skills , especially boxing skills , are an absolute must .
I know Aoki has been training Muay Thai but he has almost no punching skills , and that is a big chunk out your game .
Without having an effective striking it 's almost impossible to close in on a fighter the caliber of Gilbert Melendez .
Aoki implied after the fight that because of his loss Japanese MMA is inferior to American MMA .
Japan is now just a " MMA colony " of America .
What did you think about that ?
You know , I 've had dinner with Aoki so I know him and I think he is a good guy but I am going to say something very critical because I like the guy .
Who the hell do you think you are ?
Really , who said that you are the representative of Japan ?
While he was taking a safe path , the guys like Yushin Okami , Ryo Chonan , Akihiro Gono , Yoshiro Maeda , Kuniyoshi Hironaka , Keitaro Nakamura , Dokonjonosuke Mishima , Mitsuhiro Miura , Yoshiyuki Yoshida , Kazuhiro Nakamura , Takeya Mizugaki and recently Takanori Gomi , and of course , many others , bravely stepped up and went to the real " Major League " called the UFC / WEC .
Sure only few of them are still surviving in there but these guys are the fighters that carried the Japanese flag on their shoulders .
All Aoki did was , walked on a safe , glorious path created by DREAM and fought in Strikeforce , which is not necessarily the certified " Major League " of MMA .
He is not walking on the tough road .
Its like while Ichiro and Matusi are playing in the MLB , he was making a special appearance in some Canadian or Carribean baseball league .
So for him to say Japan has become a MMA colony of the States just because he got beat by Melendez is a big insult to guys like Okami , Mizugaki and Yoshida who are still fighting and winning enough to stay in the big leagues .
So what needs to change about Japanese MMA to allow more Japanese fighters to survive in the West ?
The skill level of fighters , the training environment and even the respect MMA fighters get from the general public right now in North America is way ahead of Japan .
I think overall effort is lacking .
The promoter is not putting enough effort to promote shows .
For example , there is not enough emphasis on getting sponsors and TV deals from overseas .
I think fighters and gyms are not putting in enough effort to learn new training methods .
There should be more fighters going to the states for training , and more trainers should be coming to the States to see and learn what the other MMA fighters and trainers are doing .
Also , Japanese fighters should also put in a little more effort to learn about training , dieting , nutrition and everything else necessary for MMA .
I think fighters and gyms should be more keen on bringing in their own sponsors .
All of these things would ultimately bring more business to the world of the Japanese MMA but I do n't see that happening .
It has been the same for the last ten years or so .
What do you think can bring about these changes needed in Japan ?
Unless going digital in 2012 makes a big difference in the Japanese TV market , Japanese MMA would never ever going to beat Zuffa because there is no such a thing as a big PPV market in Japan .
People in Japan are not used to paying for television .
It 's not customary .
It 's not common .
The only way to revive Japanese MMA , I believe , is to have a Japanese UFC or WEC champion .
Look at MLB .
its very popular in Japan now because there are Japanese stars that are doing well - like Ichiro and Matsui .
But in the UFC or WEC , we still have n't seen Ichiro or Matsui yet .
Think of it this way : if GSP or Anderson Silva were Japanese , then they would be all over the Japanese TV by now and even an old lady in the deep woods of Yamagata prefecture would know what the UFC is .
So fighters are the ones that can really change everything .
Even only one Japanese champ might be able to change everything .
We need Japanese Tiger Woods in the UFC then everything would fall into the places for the entire industry .
Is there anybody fighting now that you think could become this champion that Japan needs ?
I honestly think Yushin Okami and Takeya Mizuagki still have a chance to became the first Japanese champion in the Octagon .
Besides them , I think fighters like Ikuo Usuda and Nobuhiro Obiya could be very competitive if they are willing to cut to 145 lbs .
I 've always believed that Hatsu Hioki could compete at the world 's top level at 145 lbs , as could Lion Takeshi .
However , because of Japanese MMA politics some of those fighters wo n't leave Japan and test their skill in the Octagon so I am actually already looking to the younger generation of athletes .
I am now doing a heavy scout on high school judo or wrestling champions that are willing to begin MMA training here in the States and start a pro MMA career here in the States .
I have to convince their parents as well but so far I am not having any difficulty explaining to kid's parents that UFC / WEC is far better than fighting in Japanese MMA shows .
Yes , times have changed .
I can not mention his name here yet , but I am close to signing a 17 - year old national high school judo champ that is willing to skip Japan as soon as possible and do MMA here in the States .
This kid and his father are huge UFC fans so it took me five minutes to convince them .
Team boss turned TV pundit Eddie Jordan continues to stick the boot into Michael Schumacher , claiming that his return to F1 was a " huge error " .
" Michael 's return was an excellent thing for the discipline , " he told Sport Bild , " but for him personally , it 's a huge error .
" To make a comeback at 41 years of age , to pitch yourself against young men 20 years younger than you , is simply against the laws of physics and medicine , " he added .
Fact is , Schumacher has struggled this season , as has his teammate , with a car that is widely seen as a bit of a dog .
Furthermore , in the opinion of this website , the German was always on a hiding to nothing , doomed if he returned a winner , doomed if he returned a loser .
There are some who remain convinced that Brackley is cursed and has been ever since Craig Pollock and British American Racing entered the sport in 1999 determined to continue a " tradition of excellence " .
For some reason , ever since the BAR - Supertec appeared in 1999 , Brackley cars have struggled , especially in terms of Bridgestone rubber .
While some will point to Brawn 's success in 2009 , let 's not forget that once rival teams were on a slightly more level playing field it was the tyres that once again worked against the white cars from Brackley .
This year , Mercedes is clearly struggling and it's the same old problem , the team 's failure to work with its Bridgestone boots , particularly at the rear .
If there is frustration at Brackley imagine what it 's like in Stuttgart where Mercedes bosses are wondering what on earth they 've got themselves into , what on earth happened to the winning team they bought at a far from knock - down price .
What money Stuttgart is willing to spend - and it is very little , surprising really when one considers the small fortunes made by the previous ' owners ' - is watched very , very carefully , with the bean counters wanting every last nut and bolt accounted for before it is purchased .
What hope serious development under those conditions ?
In Germany , many were against the purchase of Brawn , especially the unions , and therefore the German manufacturer is under intense scrutiny .
Nonetheless , our sources claim that , in the very best Japanese tradition , Mercedes does not want to lose face , and will therefore stick it out for 2011 in the hope that Pirelli rubber will bring a change in fortune ... however , some fear that the curse of Brackley remains .
Schumacher too , despite the claims of some , will stick with it , at least for another year , not so much about saving face but because the German still has worthwhile input to provide , whatever his numerous critics might say .
However , while the anti-Schumacher bias of some might be understandable - especially in terms of the British media - Eddie Jordan 's fortnightly bashing of the German is becoming tedious .
As Schumacher crosses the line in ninth , having struggled to hold off a Toro Rosso or Force India , the Irishman appears delighted , desperate to tell the viewers ; " I told you so " .
The Opposition Liberals have asked federal Auditor General Sheila Fraser to conduct an audit into the government ’s cost estimates of $ 930 million for security measures at the upcoming G8 and G20 summits .
Police officers stand outside the London Stock Exchange in central London 's financial district ahead of last year 's G20 summit .
In a letter sent to Fraser on Thursday , Liberal MP Mark Holland writes that the projected cost for security is more than the final price tag for security during the Vancouver Olympics , and almost six times the $ 190 million spent for the two - day G8 summit in Kananaskis , Alta. , in 2002 .
" While we do not dispute the fact that effective and efficient security is vital when world leaders are involved , we believe this amount to be excessive , " Holland wrote .
Federal documents show the cost of hosting the G8 and G20 summits next month in Ontario now stands at $ 1.1 billion and further outlays are likely .
Security costs at summits G8 summit Japan October 2008 : $ 381 million
G8 summit Gleneagles .
Scotland July 2005 : $ 110 million
G20 summit London April 2009 : $ 30 million
G20 summit Pittsburgh , September 2009 : $ 18 million
The price tag includes $ 160 million for hospitality , infrastructure , food safety and extra staffing .
That amount is in addition to the $ 933 - million security bill the Tories revealed earlier this week .
The cost estimates , Holland wrote , are more than 20 times the total reported cost for the G20 summit in Britain in April 2009 .
The government insists it has budgeted for the amount .
Public Safety Minister Vic
Toews defended the spending as as the " most efficient and effective " use of public money for Canada 's " unprecedented " hosting of back - to - back international summits amid a medium security threat level .
Toews said the government has followed the advice of security experts and has an obligation to protect visiting dignitaries from around the world .
" The cost is expensive , but the security is worth it , " Toews told the House of Commons during Thursday 's question period .
Toews also cited the recent firebombing of a Royal Bank branch in Ottawa as a " prime example " of why Canada needs to be " prepared to face thugs and terrorists who threaten our safety . "
But Holland blamed the " skyrocketing " cost on " improper planning and foresight " on the part of the Conservative government , which changed the site of next month 's G20 meeting from Huntsville , Ont. , to Toronto .
The G8 summit is being held in central Ontario 's Muskoka region .
The Conservatives , he said , should have seen from the start the " challenges " Huntsville presented , and found a more " practical and affordable solution " — other than downtown Toronto .
Q : How should one respond to someone who asks " When is your due date ? " or " Are you pregnant ? " when you are not pregnant ?
Why someone who is not a close friend would consider making such a comment is beyond me , but I am looking for a good retort .
Melissa Forbes - Nicoll
Boston
A : I can barely conjure a thoughtful response to such a thoughtless question !
But I 'll use this opportunity to spread the word far and wide that no matter how pregnant someone appears―even if she looks like she 's about to go into labor ―do not make any mention of it .
The two times I thought it was safe enough to break this rule I suffered bitterly for it .
The first was when I was getting my hair cut by a woman I 'd never met before , who I suspected might be pregnant .
But of course , knowing full well that you never say anything , I kept my trap shut and let her continue cutting my hair ... until she mentioned she was pregnant , and how that was going to affect her schedule .
I breathed a sigh of relief and said lightly , " Oh , you know I was going to say something , but I was n't sure ! "
Ha ha ha .
To which she replied , curtly , " Well , I 'm only 7 weeks pregnant , I 'm not even showing yet . "
Let 's just say I 'm lucky I walked out of there with any hair left on my head .
The other time I thought it was safe to comment was at the office of my OB , who specializes in high - risk pregnancies ; the place is crawling with pregnant women .
I was waiting to get my blood drawn , sitting next to a woman who did , in fact , look like she was about to go into labor any day now .
And again , I made the mistake of saying , " When are you due ? " to which she answered , " I gave birth last Thursday .
To twins . "
Touché .
But obviously you , Melissa , are not the one sticking your foot in your mouth ; you 're the unwitting victim in this scenario , so I give you permission not only to say a firm " No " to the " Are you pregnant ? " question , but to add , " For the future , that 's never a safe question . "
Then just laugh like it was the funniest joke you 've ever heard and get the hell out of there .

Mouseless is a computer mouse that allows you to interact with a computer with a mouse in the same way as usual - except that there is no mouse hardware .
The researchers call it an " invisible mouse . "
A group of scientists working with the Fluid Interfaces Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) Media Lab in Cambridge Massachusetts , were interested in removing the requirement for a physical mouse , while still allowing computer users to interact with their computers in a way with which they were familiar .
The researchers , Pranav Mistry , Liyan Chang , and Pattie Maes , developed an infrared ( IR ) laser beam and associated camera that could be incorporated into the computer so that a plane of IR laser would be created just above the surface on which the computer is resting .
The user acts as though a physical mouse were present and the laser beam is intersected by the hand , and parts of the hand are shown up as bright spots of light that change position as the hand moves .
The built - in camera then interprets the changes in position of the hand and fingers and translates them as moves of the mouse and clicks on the two buttons , and the cursor on the screen moves as if the user was operating a physical mouse .
Mouseless is an invisible computer mouse .
There are no plans for commercializing the " invisible mouse , " but the prototype Mouseless was built for around $ 20 USD .
The MIT group of researchers are now working on improvements to the recognition and tracking algorithms with the aim of building up an expanded command library .
This may in the future lead to more complex gesture recognition than is possible at present , and could ultimately give the Mouseless a number of advantages over a physical mouse , since the number of functions handled by a physical mouse is limited .
Mouseless working prototype system
The MIT Media Lab ’s Fluid Interfaces group works on ways of integrating the world of digital information and services more naturally into our normal lives , by designing intuitive and intelligent interfaces .
Pranav Mistry is a PhD student and research assistant at MIT Media Lab .
His project “ SixthSense ” won the Popular Science Invention of the Year award in 2009 .

Der Einfluss der neuen Medien ist wohl begrenzter , als die Ängste davor vermuten lassen .
Statt über aktuelle Technologien zu jammern , sollten wir Strategien zur Selbstkontrolle entwickeln .

Seit jeher versetzen neue Medienformen die Menschen in panische Angst vor einem Sittenverfall : Ob Druckerpresse , Zeitungen , Taschenbücher oder Fernsehen - sie alle erklärte man zu Bedrohungen für die geistige Leistungskraft und die Charakterstärke ihrer Konsumenten .

So ergeht es auch den digitalen Technologien .
PowerPoint , so heißt es , reduziere Diskurse auf bloße Stichpunkte .
Suchmaschinen senkten unsere Intelligenz , indem sie uns dazu verführten , uns Wissen nur oberflächlich anzueignen , anstatt in seine Tiefen einzutauchen .
Twitter lasse unsere Aufmerksamkeitsspannen zusammenschnurren .
Doch solche Ängste halten oft einfachsten Realitätstests nicht stand .
Zur gleichen Zeit als in den fünfziger Jahren Comichefte beschuldigt wurden , Jugendliche zu Straftätern zu machen , fiel die Kriminalitätsrate auf Rekordtiefs .
Dummheitsdebatten bei steigendem IQ
Genauso verteufelte man in den neunziger Jahren Videospiele gerade dann , als in Amerika der historisch große Rückgang in den Verbrechenszahlen einsetzte .
Die Jahrzehnte von Fernsehen , Transistorradios und Musikvideos waren auch Jahrzehnte , in denen die IQ - Werte ununterbrochen stiegen .
Für eine aktuelle Prüfung muss man nur einen Blick auf den Zustand der Naturwissenschaften werfen .
Sie erfordern ein hohes Niveau an geistiger Leistung , und die Zahl neuer Entdeckungen lässt sich hier als klares Bewertungskriterium messen .
Die Wissenschaftler von heute verlassen kaum je den Bereich ihrer E - Mails , sie nehmen selten ein Blatt Papier in die Hand , und sie können keine Vorlesungen ohne PowerPoint halten .
Blüten des Geisteslebens
Würden elektronische Medien die Intelligenz gefährden , so müsste die wissenschaftliche Qualität längst ins Bodenlose stürzen .

Kritiker der neuen Medien greifen gelegentlich auf die Naturwissenschaft selbst zurück , um ihre Position zu untermauern .
Sie zitieren dann Forschungen , die angeblich zeigen , wie " Erfahrungen das Gehirn verändern " .
Unser Gehirn ist keine Lehmkugel
Aber in der kognitiven Neurowissenschaft verdreht man bei solchem Gerede nur die Augen .
Es stimmt zwar , dass sich unser Gehirn jedes Mal neu verdrahtet , wenn wir uns ein Faktum oder eine Fähigkeit aneignen .

A recent change to IBM 's internal IT policy has made Firefox the company 's default Web browser .
The move is a major endorsement of the browser 's suitability in large - scale enterprise environments .
IBM plans to roll it out to employees on new computers and will encourage its staff of 400,000 to use it on their existing systems .
Bob Sutor , IBM 's vice president of Linux and open source software , discussed the company 's motives for adopting Firefox in a blog entry published this morning .
He says that its transparent development model , strong security , and robust support for Web standards and extensibility have made it the " gold standard " for open source Web browsers .
Sutor contends that Mozilla 's efforts have " reinvigorated " the browser market , bringing standards and interoperability to the forefront .
He believes that company - wide adoption of the browser will help accelerate IBM 's shift towards cloud computing .
" There 's another reason we want to get as many of our employees using Firefox as soon as possible , and that is Cloud Computing .
For the shift to the cloud to be successful , open standards must be used in the infrastructure , in the applications , and in the way people exchange data , " he wrote .
" The longstanding commitment of Mozilla to open standards and the quality of the implementation of them in Firefox gives us confidence that this is a solid , modern platform that should be part of IBM 's own internal transformation to significantly greater use of Cloud Computing . "
Corporate adoption of Firefox has historically been weak because it is difficult to manage and deploy the browser in enterprise environments .
The lack of MSI packaging and similar limitations pose some challenges ; Mozilla formed an Enterprise Working Group to explore the problem space in 2007 , but it has n't been a high priority .
A number of third - party tools have been developed over the years to simplify certain aspects of organization - wide Firefox roll - outs .
One of those tools is the Client Customization Kit ( CCK ) , which was developed by Firefox modification consultant Michael Kaply while he was employed by IBM .
Kaply still actively maintains the tool and released an updated version for Firefox 3.6 in March .
IBM is using it alongside other tools to ensure that its Firefox adoption plan goes smoothly .
Image caption Ubisoft have issued an image from the new game
Singer Michael Jackson is to be captured in a new video game , developers Ubisoft have announced .
The game , which has yet to be given a title , will rate players ' ability to dance like the late pop star .
It will be one of the first titles to use motion detection technology , due to be rolled out on a number of consoles later this year .
The musician voiced a video game character called Space Michael in the game Space Channel 5 in 1999 .
In 1989 , he also appeared in the game Michael Jackson 's Moonwalker .
The game 's launch is set to coincide with the release of an album in November containing previously unreleased Jackson tracks .
It will include songs from the singer 's back catalogue , including the hits Billie Jean and Beat It .
At an announcement in Los Angeles , Ubisoft 's Tony Key said : " Your goal is to dance like Michael .
" Do what the guy on the screen is doing and you 're there .
It 'll score you based on the quality of your performance . "
Developers are lining up to release dance - based games , including Dance Central , which uses the Kinect system to detect players ' movements , which are then translated onto the screen .

The war on drugs has been a war on communities of color , plain and simple .
Some people realize that it is time to end a war that has devastated so many people , so many families , and has accomplished little to deal with actual drug addiction .
A criminal justice model for drug use must give way to a public health model and a regulatory framework .
The California NAACP , with the support of law enforcement professionals , realizes that the state ’s battle for legalization of marijuana is part of the war against the war on drugs .
And this new war is part of the fight for civil rights .
Yes , pot legalization is a civil rights issue .
California NAACP president Alice Huffman is catching a great deal of flack for supporting Proposition 19 , the ballot initiative that would legalize , regulate and tax the drug in her state .
In an official statement , the California NAACP mentioned a recent study by the Drug Policy Institute that clearly shows marijuana laws are unfairly applied to young African Americans .
Although young blacks use marijuana at lower rates than their white counterparts , they are arrested for arrested for marijuana possession at double , triple or even quadruple the rate of whites .
In Los Angeles County , blacks are 10 percent of the population , but 30 percent of the weed - related arrests .
“ While marijuana has been decriminalized over the years , there are staggering statistics that African Americans in every county of California have conviction rates far and above those of whites .
It is time for the War on Drugs to focus on drug lords and cartels , ” the NAACP said .
“ We need to give our young African American citizens a chance at opportunity and not an arrest record that dooms their chances of success .
The money spent on these minor drug arrests could be better used on education , health services , and counseling . ”
Supporting the NAACP is Neill Franklin , a retired black narcotics cop who now leads Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , an international group of pro-legalization cops , judges and prosecutors .
These are the people who have been on the frontlines of the war on drugs .
And war can leave you weary and disillusioned , particularly when you do n’t like what you witnessed in that war .
“ As a member of the NAACP , and as a former police officer who waged the ‘ war on drugs ’ for three decades , I can tell you that it is long past time to change our failed marijuana laws , ” Franklin said .
“ Like Alice and the other good folks at the NAACP , I ’m tired of seeing young black men and women funneled through the revolving doors of the criminal justice system , all in the name of a ‘ war on marijuana ’ that actually does nothing to reduce its use . ”
Franklin also believes that continuing the failed policy of prohibition bears obscene human and fiscal costs , and California voters need to know that .
Franklin and LEAP are standing with Huffman on an important policy issue , but they are also supporting the embattled California NAACP chief against unwarranted attacks from anti-reform groups .
First and foremost among the forces out to get Alice Huffman is the conservative black clergy , led by Bishop Ron Allen of the International Faith Based Coalition ( IFBC ) .
The IFBC website raises more questions than it answers about the organization , which purports to represent a coalition of more than 4,100 congregations .
That ’s quite a claim , and quite unsubstantiated , for that matter .
The group describes itself as “ an all - denominational , multi-racial , non-partisan non-political coalition of churches , ministries , community - based organizations , governmental agencies , businesses and concerned individuals . ”
Yet , this “ non-partisan , non-political ” group lists among its partners the California Republican Party and GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman ( in fairness it also lists U.S. drug czar R. Gil Kerlikowske ) .
And curiously , IFBC claims the NAACP as a partner , even as it simultaneously urges people on its website not to support the NAACP .
“ I would like to commend Rev. Ron Allen in his leadership against this evil Prompt 19 [ sic ] , ” said Rev. Anthony Evans of the National Black Church Initiative , on the IFBC website .
Rev. Evans , by the way , has taken a prominent role against same - sex marriage in Washington .
DC. , and declared the black church will no longer allow African - American politicians to promote policies ( i.e. , gay marriage ) that hurt the black church .
It is uncertain how same - sex marriage will hurt the black church , but oh well .
Of Huffman and “ Prompt ” 19 , Rev. Evans asserted , “ The NAACP is becoming an enemy to the Black family …
Now they are allowing Ms. Huffman to unleash her unethical practices by supporting drugs that have ravished the African American community over the past 30 years . ”
He continues : “ I am authorizing all of our churches in the West Faith Command not do [ sic ] give a damn dime to the NAACP and not allow their congregation to be used for any of the NAACP meetings .
There is no way that the Black Church will permit this immoral act as it will only further the devastation of the African American community . ”
Conservative preachers such as Rev. Evans and Bishop Allen are missing the whole point about the war on drugs , or perhaps this is intentional .
Has drug addiction destroyed lives ?
Yes , to be certain , but so , too , have the consumption of alcohol and tobacco – and these substances are not criminalized , but are regulated and treated as health concerns .
Detractors insist Alice Huffman and the NAACP are an enemy of black America for supporting the legalization of marijuana .
Yet , how can the prohibitionists claim to act in the interests of the black community when they support the perpetuation of a failed drug war that has placed countless black , brown and poor white folk behind bars , wasting their lives away in a cell , separated from their children , with their communities depleted of resources , hollowed out and disenfranchised ?
The California NAACP is under fire when it should be applauded for its courage .
Alice Huffman is carrying out the mission of her organization , ensuring that it protects civil rights and remains relevant in changing times .
Should we expect her to do less ?

Campaign for Liberty
June 30 , 2010
Dear Liberty Activist ,
The FEC has launched a pair of investigations on Campaign for Liberty .
Both are meritless , but could seriously disrupt our growing program .
Please read Campaign for Liberty President John
Tate ’s letter below and stand with us .
This is exactly the type of government action to quell liberty that I have spent my life opposing .
Sincerely ,
Congressman Ron Paul
—
Dear Friend of Liberty ,
The best way to know you are succeeding in changing Washington is when you get attacked by the FEC .
And attack us they have !
I ’m writing you this letter today not to scare you or to cry wolf .
I ’m writing to let you know that our success has its price , and that price right now is the wrath of the Obama Administration and its attack dogs at the Federal Election Commission .
I urge you to read this message and then sign the Declaration of Support ( in which I ask for your advice on a critical legal and moral question ) , as we are forced into battle with federal agencies and courts .
You see , this is n’t theoretical .
They ’ve already come after us in multiple cases , alleging that Campaign for Liberty has acted illegally merely by putting the candidates on the record and reporting their positions .
My attorneys tell me we are under a gag rule and cannot go in to too many details or even tell you with what we have been charged and where the charges originated .
But I can say there have been at least two complaints filed in two different states against our issue discussion activities .
They claim we are in violation of various FEC rules and laws .
Their allegations are completely false .
And we must fight back now , or they will win and be able to silence our movement .
You see , the Washington , D.C. , establishment does n’t like to be challenged .
They hate it when we fight back .
They are absolutely BESIDE themselves when we are winning .
In less than 2 years , your Campaign for Liberty has become a major force on the American political landscape .
I can give you a list of our accomplishments , talk about our growth ( we are approaching half a million members ) , and show you press coverage from across the nation on our efforts .
But nothing shows our success more than how our enemies react when challenged .
When that happens , they do what they do best : use the power of the federal government to attack us .
They want to do one of two things : shut us up , or shut us down .
This battle is over a very fundamental idea – that Campaign for Liberty and our members should have a voice in lobbying their legislators and exposing the radical views of candidates for office .
Exposing what they ’re up to – that ’s what the powers that be ca n’t stand .
That ’s because they do n’t want Americans to know :
** Congress is spending at a record pace and has now left us over 13 TRILLION dollars in debt , with no end in sight .
** The out of control FED has not accounted for nearly 2 trillion dollars and has doubled our monetary base , risking our entire economy .
** The federal government has imposed a mandate that every American either purchase a health care product the Feds approve of , costing tens of thousands of dollars , or risk fines and jail time .
** The federal government has attempted to take away your 1st , 2nd and 4th Amendment rights , all in the past year , with more certainly to come .
We ’re exposing them – and holding them accountable as they come back home to seek reelection .
Of course , this may not sound like the end of the world .
But just think : the FEC has an ARMY of lawyers and a budget of nearly $ 70 MILLION dollars .
That ’s a lot of lawyers .
And add to it the fact that this group of people is adamantly against free speech under the First Amendment , and well , you have a recipe for trouble .
Subpeonas .
Depositions .
Fishing expeditions that cover tens of thousands of documents .
Legal fees just to defend our right to free speech .
Thousands of hours of staff time to comply with their demands .
You can see where this is going .
If FEC radicals succeed , I will not even be allowed to tell you and your neighbors how candidates for the House and Senate ( or for President in the future ) have voted on Liberty issues , so you can put the heat on them when they are most likely to listen .
Let me explain that a bit more .
For the first time ever , there is a nationwide group that is dedicated to holding politicians accountable for their votes on Liberty issues .
It ’s Campaign for Liberty , and our over 450,000 members are doing battle across the country to hold the politicians ’ feet to the fire .
Whether it is getting more than 300 sponsors for Audit the Fed , or lobbying to stop Cap and Tax and Real ID schemes , Campaign for Liberty is making a difference .
And we ’re prepared to make an even bigger difference this fall , as the time comes to inform the people where their candidates stand .
So the statists in Washington are out to make sure that does n’t happen .
Their main weapon is the Federal Election Commission .
The FEC has always been against free speech and a tool of the powerful elite in Washington , who desperately seek to hang on to power .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
But as bad as the FEC has been since its inception , with the Obama Administration in power , you and I face even more aggressive assaults on our free speech .
My attorneys have warned me that the puppets at the Federal Election Commission are ordering me to stop mobilizing hundreds of thousands of Americans against power grabs in Congress .
In doing so , they are trying to cripple our ability to stop dangerous legislation in Congress .
If we continue to oppose these Liberty - stealing bills as we have in the past , I face the danger of multimillion - dollar fines and even a jail term !
In fact , I may even be questioned in court for writing this letter tonight .
I must make a decision soon .
Should I allow the Federal Election Commission to tie my hands during this crucial election year ?
Or should I defy their gag - rule regulations . . . and face prosecution from the out of control federal authorities for exercising our right to political speech ?
Please give me your answer by filling out the Declaration of Support .
If you and other members want me to proceed with our efforts to inform the public of the positions of your candidates on Liberty issues , and to oppose legislation in the Congress ( and I hope you do ) , I will also need your financial help .
So please consider making a generous contribution of 10 , 20 or even 40 for this battle , if you can .
The fact is the enemies of Liberty are preparing for a political attack far more serious than their election power grab of 2008 , in which they put in power some of the biggest enemies of freedom and promoters of Big Government in a generation .
Our program to stop more statist takeovers in Congress is simple .
By mobilizing our grassroots army , we can put a lot of heat on individual Congressmen and Senators .
The FEC insists we ca n’t do that during election years .
They say by telling you where your Congressman and Senators stand , I may influence your vote .
The FEC election regulators contend that ’s illegal electioneering .
Basically , government bureaucrats and their out of control regulations insist I dismantle our lobbying operation during election years — precisely at the time it would have its greatest impact .
Top legal experts tell me that this harassment by the FEC and any attempts to shut down our program violate several decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and are flatly unconstitutional .
But they also warn me that if I challenge the FEC ruling , I may face a huge , tax - funded lawsuit which could stretch on for decades and cost us as much as a million dollars .
In addition to potential million - dollar fines and legal penalties , I also face an enormous funding challenge .
Our program to fight back in Congress will require at least $ 3.2 million .
So there are a lot of decisions to make , and I wanted to be sure I have your support as we move forward .
If I am to proceed with this effort ( which I am hoping you will allow ) , I will need more than just your authorization .
I will need your financial support as well .
I ’m hoping you will be able to help with a special contribution of 10 , 20 or 40 .
But perhaps you could afford even more .
Every dollar , every quarter , every dime will be used to defeat dangerous Liberty - stealing schemes in Congress and in all 50 states .
George , please respond soon .
This is one of the most far - reaching questions I have ever had to pose to you .
The future of Campaign for Liberty is at stake .
If our people are heard , I am sure Liberty will once again thrive in our country .
And we are making great strides in even just the past year .
So please , act today .
If you believe our voices should be heard , and that the federal government CANNOT be allowed to silence them , it ’s vital you answer today .
Please fill out your Declaration of Support , and consider making a generous contribution of 10 , 20 , or even 40 today .
Thank you for all you do for Liberty .
In Liberty ,
John Tate
President
PS : Your Declaration of Support and your maximum possible contribution today will ensure Campaign for Liberty will be able to keep fighting this election year .
Just like in 2008 , the establishment and statists are desperate to shut us up or shut us down .
They do n’t want to have their records exposed .
You and I cannot give them the playing field .
We must fight back today .

The last of Arizona 's blue laws is going out with little objection as the deadline nears to legalize early Sunday morning alcohol sales , and merchants admit the change will probably be even more welcome to their customers than to them .
When the legislation , which changes the 10 a.m. postponement of alcohol sales on Sundays to the regular daily 6 a.m. time , takes effect on the first Sunday in August , it will end the last Arizona law that enforced moral standards on Sundays .
The change affects 11,273 establishments statewide , according to the number of active liquor licenses compiled by the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control .
At the Crowne Plaza San Marcos Golf Resort in Chandler , guests sometimes ask for a Bloody Mary or a mimosa in the morning , and on Sundays , the staff must tell them to wait .
" For the customers , it 'll be more convenient for them , " said resort General Manager Frank Heavlin .
But for the resort , " it 's been one way for so long it 's rarely been a problem . "
Four extra hours a week in which guests can drink will have a minor effect on the resort 's revenue , but guests may appreciate the gesture , Heavlin said .
" Lifestyles have changed since the '50s , and I think it 's something customers are looking for , " he said .
" It 's just the changing of the times . "
Tim McCabe , president of the Arizona Food Marketing Alliance , said in the case of grocery stores that sell liquor , " it 's really more of a convenience for the consumer . "
In recent years , shopping patterns have shifted toward the weekends instead of weekdays , and many people do n't realize until they get to the store that they can't purchase liquor on Sundays until 10 a.m. , McCabe said .
As far as the grocery stores ' income , " it'll really have a minimum impact , " he said .
" A lot of these stores are already open 24 hours . "
At the bottom of the list of establishments this legislation will affect are bars , many of which do n't open until about 11 a.m. anyway .
But sports bars are the exception .
They often need to serve their customers ahead of early games .
" It 's amazing that when we open at 9 a .m. ( in August ) , we 'll be able to serve alcohol , " said Doug Collins , owner and operator of The Tavern on Mill .
" Once you get into football season , some games start early , so you have people in here waiting for the 10 o'clock hour to strike . "
Collins said an hour difference could mean a few more hundred dollars a day , and his establishment is happy to welcome the change .
Despite the milestone end to Arizona 's blue laws , Pastor Dave Summers of Tempe First United Methodist Church said those in the religious community were more upset five years ago when " last call " was extended .
On Aug. 24 , 2005 , Arizona drinkers began celebrating another hour at the bars , as the time consumers could buy alcohol was extended to 2 a.m. , from 1 a.m .
Religious leaders as well as activist groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and officials such as Scottsdale Police Chief Alan Rodbell spoke out against the legislation .
But the latest change has resulted in much less dissent .
" This one seems to have kind of slipped under the radar , " Summers said .
Still , Summers said he believes the legislation is eliminating an important tradition .
" It 's disappointing to me because it 's part of that shift in our society that becomes more secular , " he said .
" There are times where we need some sort of restraint .
Anything that erodes that is part of the tragedy of life becoming less and less holy .
I feel a real sense of sadness that we 're losing something that is both important and sacred to us .
This may be one of the last stands for Sunday . "
Blue laws , or laws that regulate business on Sundays based on moral standards , exist in 30 other states .
They regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages or other activities such as car sales , hunting , horse racing or sporting events on Sundays .
More than a decade ago , Arizona restricted alcohol sales until noon , but lawmakers changed the hours specifically to accommodate drinkers at sports bars and restaurants who came to watch morning games .
But legislators ' reasoning this time is the same as other states weighing their blue laws :
It may serve as an extra shot of revenue in a sagging economy .
Massachusetts , home to some of America 's founding blue laws , is also considering changing its Sunday morning alcohol restriction from noon to 10 a.m .
Rep. Matt Heinz , D - Tucson , first introduced the idea to the state House of Representatives as especially helpful for businesses such as the San Marcos Golf Resort and suggested that it could improve tourism revenue .
An analysis prepared by budget staff members also estimated that it could generate more than $ 430,000 a year in new tax revenues .
The plan did n't initially go through , but Heinz later reintroduced it to lawmakers with state Sen.
Frank Antenori , R - Tucson , by adding an amendment to legislation needed to keep the Department of Liquor Licenses and Control alive .
Antenori said it was easy for Heinz to convince him to back the amendment .
When the alcohol purchase time was extended to 10 a.m. from noon on Sundays , the state earned $ 250,000 in tax revenue , Antenori said .
He added that it would be good for tourism and the restaurant industry , which are floundering in the weak economy .
Antenori also said arguments that the amendment would lead to more drinking were not sound .
" This is n't going to do anything with regards to drinking , " Antenori said .
" People can stockpile beer and drink it whenever they want .
This is about the purchase of alcohol . "
Antenori said it did n't make sense to ban the purchase of alcohol at 6 a.m. on one day and allow it the rest of the week , nor to base it on a day of worship .
" We should not make laws that support an individual religion , " said Antenori , who is Catholic .
" This way , nobody gets special privileges and nobody gets discriminated against . "
Now , businesses and consumers will be the judge of whether the extra four hours is necessary or not .
Mary Ann Miller , president and CEO of the Tempe Chamber of Commerce , argued that a convenience for the consumer is a convenience for the business .
" The last thing you want to do is discourage someone from buying something , " she said .
Frederick Sheehan is the author of Panderer to Power : The Untold Story of How Alan Greenspan Enriched Wall Street and Left a Legacy of Recession ( McGraw - Hill , 2009 ) .
( Reuters ) – " Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday said ‘ outrageous ’ advice from former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan helped create record U.S. budget deficits that put national security at risk . "
- February 25 , 2010
Alan Greenspan lamented U.S. budget deficits in the Wall Street Journal on June 18 , 2010 ( " U.S. Debt and the Greece Analogy " ) .
For an analysis of Greenspan ’s flapdoodle , Barry Ritholtz covered the turf on his blog , The Big Picture .
The former Federal Reserve chairman should have withheld comment , given his personal contribution to the nation ’s poverty - stricken state .
Testifying before Congress on February 25 , 2010 , Hillary Clinton bemoaned the advice of Alan Greenspan : " I remember as vividly as if it were yesterday when we had a hearing in which Alan Greenspan came and justified increasing spending and cutting taxes , saying that we did n’t really need to pay down the debt — outrageous in my view . "
Reuters continued : " Though she did not give a date , that hearing must have taken place during the presidency of George W. Bush … . "
If only it were so simple .
During his tenure as Fed chairman , Greenspan ’s budget positions changed more often than the weather .
Always the opportunist , his self - serving opinions continue to bend the truth .
During the Greenspan Boom , he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service , and the Enron Prize for Distinguished Service .
Now , the Secretary of State looks ready to compile a dossier on his activities .
The State Department need look no further .
A review of his outrageous activities follows .
In February 2000 , the last year of the ( William Jefferson ) Clinton Administration , Greenspan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee .
He recommended the government use the federal budget surplus to pay down the national debt .
He amplified : " The growth potential of our economy under current circumstances is best served by allowing the unified budget surpluses … to materialize , thereby reduce Treasury debt held by the public . "
Meaning : we should use surplus dollars collected by the Treasury Department to reduce the federal debt .
( The Treasury can use surplus tax dollars to either purchase U.S. Treasury securities or reduce the size of new debt issues . )
This fit the politics of the time .
President Clinton was not proposing a tax cut .
One year later , Alan Greenspan worked for new management – the Bush Administration .
President Bush wanted a tax cut to kick off his presidency .
Greenspan marketed the tax cut as fiscally responsible , given recent surpluses .
His advice was rendered on January 25 , 2001 , to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget .
This was five days after George Bush ’s inauguration .
The Wall Street Journal reported : " Giving a big boost to President Bush , Chairman Alan Greenspan reversed his long - held view and said he now sees room for significant tax cuts in the federal government ’s financial future … .
‘[ O ]ver the coming decade , the latest budget - surplus numbers show not only room for reductions , but even a need . ’"
The New York Times reported on the same day : " Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve chairman , gave his blessing today to a substantial tax cut… .
In a clear shift from his previous position that reducing the national debt should be the focus of fiscal policy , Mr. Greenspan said improvements in the economy ’s long - term potential and the swelling surplus projections had ‘ reshaped the choices and opportunities before us . ’ "
In his testimony , Greenspan expressed concern " that continuing to run surpluses beyond the point at which we reach zero or near - zero federal debt brings to center stage the critical longer - term fiscal policy issue of whether the federal government should accumulate large quantities of private ( more technically nonfederal ) assets . "
[ Greenspan ’s parenthesis . ]
Here , the Fed chairman anticipated surpluses of such enormous quantity that there would not be a single U.S. Treasury security left to buy .
The government could be forced to buy " nonfederal " assets , such as IBM bonds .
Of the 100,000 most likely problems the government should consider , this was not one of them .
Greenspan was leaning on a bizarre computation from the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
In January 2001 , the CBO had projected a federal budget surplus for the period of 2002 through 2011 of $ 5.6 trillion .
This gem of infinite interpolation gave Greenspan the cover he needed .
In 2002 , the CBO reduced its surplus estimate by $ 5.3 billion , to $ 300 million .
Whether Greenspan ’s audience succumbed to his flight of fancy , another statement should have awakened its curiosity .
Greenspan prefaced his tale of woeful surpluses by discussing " recent projections [ which ] … make clear that the highly desirable goal of paying off the federal debt is in reach before the end of the decade .
This is in marked contrast to the perspective of a year ago when the elimination of the debt did not appear likely until the next decade . "
Since " a year ago " ( actually , the 10 months between March 10 , 2000 and when he spoke in January 2001 ) , the Nasdaq had fallen 43 % .
Tax revenue had risen from 12.5 % of personal income to 15.4 % during the boom years .
In 2000 , this 2.9 % increase equaled $ 237 billion – precisely the same as the total 2000 budget surplus .
It suited Greenspan ’s purposes to express mystification during testimony : " We still do not have a full understanding of the exceptional strength in individual income tax receipts during the latter 1990s . "
Greenspan could not have been blind to the source of the budget surpluses : capital gains , exercised stock options and bonuses .
These tributaries had dried up .
Without these flows , his fear of paying down the national debt , or even running a balanced budget , made no sense .
And , while Alan Greenspan could claim that paying down the debt was a bad thing , it is a tribute to the man ’s sway that his audience accepted such a silly pretense approvingly .
The Greenspan Campaign for Re-nomination to Head the Fed in 2004 had kicked off its media blitz a year earlier , on February 11 , 2003 .
The Boston Globe reported that Greenspan viewed Bush ’s ( new ) tax cut plan with suspicion : " Greenspan … used the opportunity to admonish the federal government for losing its ‘ fiscal discipline . ’"
In the chairman ’s words , a " return to fiscal discipline should be instituted without delay . "
That was the stick .
The next day , on February 12 , Greenspan offered Bush the carrot .
The Wall Street Journal reported : " Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan muted his initially chilly reception of President Bush ’s tax cut plan , offering more praise for eliminating taxes on dividends and playing down the near term consequences for the Federal deficit . "
[ Italics added . ]
On February 22 , President Bush announced that he would reappoint Greenspan for a fifth term .
On April 30 , 2003 , having accomplished his mission and with Bush now committed to reconfirm him , Greenspan scolded the president .
The New York Times reported : " Alan Greenspan …told Congress today that the economy was poised to grow without further large tax cuts , and that budget deficits resulting from lower taxes without offsetting reductions in spending could be damaging to the economy .
Opponents of the large tax cut favored by President Bush took Mr. Greenspan ’s testimony as support of their position . "
[ Italics added . ]
The dissembling was obvious ; yet , no one questioned Greenspan ’s motives .
No one questioned his logic either , but , few in Washington or Wall Street ever had .
On April 21 , 2005 , the chairman ’s bewildering tax and federal budget advice came full circle .
At a Senate Budget Committee meeting , Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes from Maryland pursued a ragged thread in the Greenspan tapestry .
The senator contended that Greenspan ’s endorsement of the president ’s 2001 tax cut was the " green light " that George Bush needed .
( This 2001 testimony is probably what Hillary Clinton remembered . )
At this meeting , Greenspan replied that he had not " specifically " endorsed the tax cut plan .
The chairman claimed : " [ Y ] ou will not find anywhere in the public record that I supported the [ 2001 ] tax cut . "
After the New York Times published Greenspan ’s " blessing today to a substantial tax " on January 26 , 2001 , the Federal Reserve chairman never made a speech or provided testimony that his advice had been misunderstood .
There was no reason for him to do so .
Reading the January 25 , 2001 , speech today ( available for anyone to judge on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors website , under " News and Events " and " Testimony " ) , his support is obvious .
He was rooting for a tax cut .
This civil servant had made false statements to the people ’s elected representatives before .
When a vote to balance the budget loomed early in Clinton ’s presidency , Greenspan said a Fed study showed a balanced budget would reduce interest rates .
The Fed had conducted no such study .
Greenspan testified to Congress in 1993 that tapes of Federal Open Market Committee meetings were destroyed after summaries were written .
Thus , no transcripts existed .
He later admitted to Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzales that he had known for years transcripts were kept but only remembered when a " senior staff member jogged my memory in the last few days . "
To Sarbanes ’ complaint , Greenspan deflected criticism with a tried - and - true tactic : flattery .
The Wall Street Journal reported on April 22 , 2005 , that Greenspan told the senator " an alternative program of tax cuts and spending increases then proposed by the Democratic Party ’s leadership would have achieved the same desired reduction in surpluses . "
The logic of Greenspan ’s prevarications seemed to mean he had not specifically endorsed the Bush tax cut .
Yet , he also told Senator Sarbannes that he " like many economists " had been wrong about the surpluses he warned of in 2001 .
Three years later , in 2004 , the federal government set a new record with its first $ 400 billion deficit .
So why was he now saying the Democratic Party ’s proposal would have " achieved the same desired reduction " since the budget surpluses had , instead , degenerated into record - setting deficits ?
We will never know .
Greenspan had triumphed once again .
As presidential candidate in 2008 , Senator Hillary Clinton fully understood her man .
She proposed an " emergency group " to " deal with high - risk mortgages . "
Greenspan was one of those she would appoint to her brain trust .
When an opponent questioned her strange selection of the former Federal Reserve chairman , Clinton offered an enigmatic endorsement .
Greenspan had " a calming influence … .
Do n’t ask me why , because I never understand what he ’s saying . "

Oz as his next project , when I spoke to him , all he wanted to talk about was World of Warcraft .
From the way he spoke , the man is really into the game and it sounded like that ’s the project he really wants to do as his next film .
I also asked him about the rumors that he could be directing The Hobbit .
He seemed to think those were just online rumors and nothing more .
Since I have so much to post , for more info you should watch the interview after the jump .
I ’ve time indexed the entire interview so you can read the questions .
For fans of the World of Warcraft game , make sure to watch his answer six minutes in .
You ’ll love it .

OMEGA Project 2009 - 2012
Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae ( OMEGA ) is an innovative method to grow algae , clean wastewater , capture carbon dioxide and to ultimately produce biofuel without competing with agriculture for water , fertilizer or land .
NASA ’s OMEGA system consists of large flexible plastic tubes , called photobioreactors .
Floating in seawater , the photobioreactors contain freshwater algae growing in wastewater .
These algae are among the fastest growing plants on Earth .
The algae use energy from the sun , carbon dioxide and nutrients from the wastewater to produce biomass that can be converted into biofuels as well as other useful products such as fertilizer and animal food .
The algae clean the wastewater by removing nutrients that otherwise would contribute to marine deadzone formation .
NASA ’s project goals are to investigate the technical feasibility of a unique floating algae cultivation system and prepare the way for commercial applications .
Research by scientists and engineers has demonstrated that OMEGA is an effective way to grow microalgae and treat wastewater on a small scale .
The OMEGA system is being investigated by NASA as an alternative way to produce aviation fuels .
Potential implications of replacing fossil fuels include reducing the release of green house gases , decreasing ocean acidification , and enhancing national security .
REHOBOTH BEACH , Del. -- Rehoboth Beach in Delaware is n't a topless beach -- but a few transgender men caused a stir by treating it like one .
Police say passers - by complained after the men removed their tops and revealed their surgically enhanced breasts over Memorial Day weekend .
A lifeguard asked them to put their tops back on .
The men initially refused , but covered up before police arrived .
Even if they had n't , though , Police Chief Keith Banks notes the men were doing nothing illegal .
Since they have male genitalia , they can't be charged with indecent exposure for showing their breasts .
Banks says there 's no need for a specific law to address the issue .
Rehoboth Beach commissioner Kathy McGuiness is n't so sure .
She says the matter will be discussed at a town hall meeting next week .
A new University of British Columbia study says that an overreliance on research subjects from the U.S. and other Western nations can produce false claims about human psychology and behavior because their psychological tendencies are highly unusual compared to the global population .
According to the study , the majority of psychological research is conducted on subjects from Western nations , primarily university students .
Between 2003 and 2007 , 96 per cent of psychological samples came from countries with only 12 per cent of the world 's populations .
The U.S. alone provided nearly 70 per cent of these subjects .
However , the study finds significant psychological and behavioral differences between what the researchers call Western , Educated , Industrialized , Rich and Democratic ( WEIRD ) societies and their non-WEIRD counterparts across a spectrum of key areas , including visual perception , fairness , spatial and moral reasoning , memory and conformity .
The findings , published in Nature July 1 and Behavioral Sciences the week before , raise questions about the practice of drawing universal claims about human psychology and behavior based on research samples from WEIRD societies .
" The foundations of human psychology and behavior have been built almost exclusively on research conducted on subjects from WEIRD societies , " says UBC Psychology and Economics Prof .
Joe Henrich , who led the study with UBC co-authors Prof. Steven Heine and Prof. Ara Norenzayan .
" While students from Western nations are a convenient , low - cost data pool , our findings suggest that they are also among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans . "
The study , which reviews the comparative database of research from across the behavioural sciences , finds that subjects from WEIRD societies are more individualistic , analytic , concerned with fairness , existentially anxious and less conforming and attentive to context compared to those from non-WEIRD societies .
According to the study , significant psychological and behavioral differences also exist between population groups within WEIRD nations .
For example , U.S. undergraduate students are typically more analytic and choosy and less conforming than U.S. adults without college educations .
" Researchers often implicitly assume that there is little variation across human populations or that these ' standard subjects ' are as representative of the species as any other population , " says Henrich .
" Our study shows there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations .
In fact , there is enough evidence that researchers cannot in good faith continue to make species - generalizing claims about Homo sapiens in the absence of comparative evidence . "
The research team calls on universities , peer reviewers , funding agencies and journal editors to push researchers to explicitly support any generalizations to the species with evidence or potent inductive arguments .
Additionally , they envision the creation of research partnerships with non-WEIRD institutions to further and expand and diversify the empirical base of the behavioral sciences .

Hoffa Sends Warning About ' Fast - Buck Artists ' That Hurt Workers , Companies
WASHINGTON , July 4 / PRNewswire - USNewswire / -- Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa today sent an urgent warning to workers and their unions at French frozen - food manufacturer Picard Surgeles about a potential takeover by private equity firm Clayton , Dubilier & Rice ( CD&R ) .
( Logo : http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20100127/IBTLOGO )
( Logo : http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20100127/IBTLOGO )
CD&R , a leading U.S. private equity firm , is currently considering a bid for Picard Surgeles , a market - leading retailer and manufacturer of frozen food in France .
Several other companies have also expressed interest in purchasing Picard Surgeles from its current owner , London - based BC Partners .
Three unions currently represent workers of Picard Surgeles in France : CGT , CFDT and FO .
In a letter addressed to heads of CGT , CFDT and FO , Hoffa discussed the disturbing aftermath of CD&R - led takeovers of two Teamster - represented companies , Hertz and U.S. Foodservice .
CD&R 's participation in a group of private equity firms that purchased Hertz , a car rental company , in 2006 was labeled the work of " fast - buck artists " by BusinessWeek after the firms used Hertz assets to pay themselves a $ 1 billion special dividend and eliminated 1,500 jobs .
Regarding U.S. Foodservice , Hoffa said that the takeover has led to " facility closures , layoffs and loss of market share . "
" CD&R is now leading U.S. Foodservice down a contentious and destructive path , " Hoffa said in the letter .
" Under CD&R leadership , U.S. Foodservice continues to disregard the rights of its employees , undermining long - term growth through continued mismanagement , assets sales and cost - cutting .
" I sincerely hope that your unions can avoid a similar leveraged buyout by any firm interested more in extracting and turning deals than continuing to build upon the strong legacy of Picard Surgeles .
In our experience , a CD&R takeover can truly hurt workers , their families and entire communities . "
U.S. Foodservice is the nation 's second - largest foodservice distributor with 25,000 employees and annual revenues of $ 20 billion .
CD&R , along with Kohlberg , Kravis and Roberts ( KKR ) , purchased the company using $ 2.1 billion in equity , and $ 5 billion of debt taken from U.S. Foodservice 's own assets .
In the years following the buyout , USF has closed nine distribution centers and shed more than 3,000 jobs .
Labor relations soured leading to numerous violations of U.S. labor law , including almost 200 violations of federal labor law in the State of Arizona .
Hoffa offered to work with CGT , CFDT and FO to avoid any leveraged buy out for Picard Surgeles .

In February , the premier of a new documentary sparked fierce debate in the fine arts world .
The Art of the Steal , directed by Don Argott , centers on the controversial relocation of early - 20th - century pharmaceutical magnate Alfred C. Barnes ' private collection of post - impressionist and modern art -- the largest in the world - - from his Beaux - Arts mansion in Merion , PA to a larger , more accommodating facility at the heart of Philadelphia .
As Katya Kazakina reported for Bloomberg News in February , the collection maintained by the Barnes Foundation after Barnes ' death in 1951 includes " 181 Renoirs , 69 Cezannes , 59 Matisses , 46 Picassos , 16 Modiglianis and seven Van Goghs . "
The artwork itself was not the only attraction to the Barnes estate : " Barnes , who had eccentric tastes in display , insisted that the paintings be hung densely amid medieval relics , African art and modernist furniture . "
The controversy arises not from the sheer wealth of art but its rightful display .
When Barnes established his foundation , he mandated that his collection be used " for art education , not commercial display . "
" The artworks could n’t be lent , sold or moved , " noted Kazakina .
" The galleries were to be open to the public only two days a week ; other days were dedicated to educational programs . "
But after decades of litigation surrounding the foundation , Barnes ' original wishes for his collection were gradually superseded .
In a heartfelt article departing from the Weekly Standard 's usual conservative line , Lance Esplund chronicled the recent history of the museum after decades in hibernation following a dispute with Philadelphia Inquirer publisher Walter Annenberg in 1951 :
When the foundation reopened in 1995 , it had audio guides and a gift shop that sold coffee mugs , T - shirts , color reproductions , and jewelry .
A gallery referred to as the “ Dutch Room , ” housing decorative arts , had disappeared and an elevator taken its place .
With increased visitors came pollution and traffic .
The Barnes ’s neighbors understandably complained : Tour buses blocked their driveways ; fast food wrappers littered their lawns , which were trampled by tourists .
[ Barnes Foundtion president Richard ]
Glanton embarked on rounds of endless litigation — including suing the Barnes 's neighbors for racism ( Glanton is black ) .
In the end , nearly $ 6 million of the Barnes ’s endowment was spent on attorney fees .
The Barnes was suddenly broke .
When Glanton was not reelected , a new president was instated .
Admission fees were again increased ; a parking lot was added ; 1,200 visitors were allowed in per week .
But those in charge were truly only interested in the final solution .
...
The new Barnes is scheduled to open in downtown Philadelphia by 2012 .
Since the release of " The Art of the Steal , " admirers of the Barnes collection have howled over the move :
It 's A Legal Problem Discussing the film in March , Jamie Johnson of Vanity Fair portrays the conflict as couched in legal ambiguities , declaring the controversy over the Barnes collection " glaringly manipulative , and sometimes unlawful , interpretations of high - profile wills . "
" Contrary to what most people might believe , the rich routinely fail to draft effective trust agreements that faithfully carry out their dying wishes , " notes Johnson .
" In fact , power struggles over inherited wealth are so endemic in the culture of affluence that nearly all of the nation ’s most profitable law firms maintain trust - and - estates divisions whose sole purpose is to handle such disputes — and reap the financial rewards . "
While Johnson concedes that " no illegality has ever been proven " with regards to the specific stipulation 's in Barnes ' will , there remains the distinct possibility of outside influences commandeering his legacy .
" Thanks to the vagaries of legal documents and the general greed that money seems always to breed in humans , the rich rarely get to control their bequests from the grave . "
It 's A Commercialization Problem
In the Weekly Standard , Esplund bemoans the Barnes collection 's move to the center of a commercial circus .
" It is such people who are hell - bent on turning museums into shopping malls with ease of access to the ' customer , ' " seethes Esplund .
" Through homogenization and expansion , they have already ruined once - great institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art , the Brooklyn Museum , and the Morgan Library .
There is a belief that getting more people in the door is a museum ’s prime function . "
Esplund emphasizes the need to respect the founder 's intent : what would Barnes have wanted ?
" Barnes gave life to a unique institution , and its present - day stewards should be obligated to follow the ethical oath of others ( medical doctors and art conservators among them ) entrusted with the care of the living : First , do no harm .
The relocation of the Barnes is disguised as altruism , but it is fueled solely by ignorance and avarice . "
It 's About Context The Los Angeles Times ' Christopher Knight agrees with Esplund 's assertion that the Foundation 's move is fueled by " ignorance . "
" The uniqueness of the Barnes Foundation in Merion , Pa. , is a primary reason for the difficulty in explaining why the planned move ... is such a gut - wrenching tragedy , " laments Knight .
" A simple sentence , encapsulating shorthand or a brief paragraph just cannot explain it .
The problem is compounded when most readers are accustomed to museum galleries that have almost nothing in common with the Barnes .
Sui generis , constituting a class of its own , the Barnes Foundation is literally incomparable . "
Knight 's closing criticism of Esplund and the Weekly Standard only drives home his conviction on the Barnes Foundation 's move .
" On art , Esplund is a critic with whom I do n't agree about much , " scoffs Knight .
" And I think the Weekly Standard is , typically , a magazine best picked up with long - handled tongs ... "
Nevertheless , he calls Esplund 's article " often enlightening . "

Robert M. Price is a world - famous biblical scholar who ( among other things ) does the Bible Geek podcast where he takes questions from listeners about the Bible .
I sent in a letter ( below ) asking what he thought of William Lane Craig ’s crazy explanation of the Caananite genocide .
Here is my appearance on the Bible Geek : *
He finishes reading the question at 3:35 , but skip ahead only if you are willing to miss Dr. Price doing Charlton Heston .
He then covers the Canaanite evidence , and the high point begins at 5:53 when he turns to Craig ’s words , calling them “ horrifying ruminations . ”
Note that Dr. Price accidentally attributes my quip “ God ’s morality is not our morality ” to Craig , but it makes little difference since in the same article Craig says that God “ is certainly not subject to the same moral obligations and prohibitions that we are . ”
My letter to the Bible Geek follows .
O Geekiness Kurios ,
On an apologetics website someone asked William Lane Craig about the slaughter ( or genocide ) of the Canaanites in Deuteronomy 20:12 - 18 :
If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle , lay siege to that city .
When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand , put to the sword all the men in it .
As for the women , the children , the livestock and everything else in the city , you may take these as plunder for yourselves .
And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies .
This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby .
However , in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance , do not leave alive anything that breathes .
Completely destroy them –the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites–as the LORD your God has commanded you .
Otherwise , they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods , and you will sin against the LORD your God .
Dr. Craig began his response with the standard [ Note : Price misreads , saying statement instead ]
“ God ’s morality is not our morality ” line of argumentation , however I was astonished by what he said next :
Moreover , if we believe , as I do , that God ’s grace is extended to those who die in infancy or as small children , the death of these children was actually their salvation .
We are so wedded to an earthly , naturalistic perspective that we forget that those who die are happy to quit this earth for heaven ’s incomparable joy .
Therefore , God does these children no wrong in taking their lives .
So whom does God wrong in commanding the destruction of the Canaanites ?
Not the Canaanite adults , for they were corrupt and deserving of judgement .
Not the children , for they inherit eternal life .
So who is wronged ?
Ironically , I think the most difficult part of this whole debate is the apparent wrong done to the Israeli soldiers themselves .
Can you imagine what it would be like to have to break into some house and kill a terrified woman and her children ?
The brutalizing effect on these Israeli soldiers is disturbing .
http://www.reasonablefaith.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5767
I began to outline a response but I found the process too exasperating .
Dr. Craig appears to be greatly respected among evangelicals , but more than ever I sense from him an aura of pure nuttiness ( I almost said pure evil , which is pretty much how I feel about his reasoning and its implications ) .
What do you make of Craig ’s response ?
Could you provide some background on these passages from Deuteronomy ?
I think you once discussed some archaeological findings on the Canaanites — would you mind mentioning them again ?
Many
Thanks ,
Oedipus Maximus

Canadian soldier Sapper Brian Collier , shown in an undated military photo , was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan on Tuesday .
He was a member of the 1 Combat Engineer Regiment based at CFB Edmonton .
( ( DND ) )
A Canadian soldier , Sapper Brian Collier , was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan Tuesday .
Collier was killed while on a foot patrol in the village of Nakhonay , in the eastern part of Panjwaii District .
He had dismounted from his vehicle near Nakhonay , about 15 kilometres west of the city of Kandahar , when he was killed by the improvised explosive device .
Collier , 24 , was born in Toronto and raised in Bradford , Ont .
He was a member of the 1 Combat Engineer Regiment based at CFB Edmonton and was serving in Afghanistan with the 1st Battalion , Royal Canadian Regiment .
Collier , who was on his first deployment to Afghanistan , was previously injured in a separate IED blast .
" He fought hard to overcome his injury in order to get back to doing his job with his comrades , " Brig . - Gen. Jon Vance , commander of Task Force Kandahar , said in a statement .
" Always quick to smile , Brian had an easygoing nature and a great sense of humour .
Brian was an enthusiast of fine automobiles , and loved to spend time with his Audi , " Vance said .
" Any Canadian who could have seen Brian in action would have been proud of him and proud of our country for the work being done with and for Afghans . "
In another statement , Prime Minister Stephen Harper commended Collier 's service , and extended condolences to the soldier 's family and friends .
" The bravery and remarkable commitment of Canadians like Sapper Collier are bringing safety and stability to the people of Afghanistan , " Harper said .
" Every day , their dedication and work protect our interests and values here at home and around the world .
Sapper Collier 's sacrifice will not be forgotten . "
Collier 's is the first Canadian death in Afghanistan since June 26 , when Master Cpl. Kristal Giesebrecht , 34 , and Pte. Andrew Miller , 21 , died after the vehicle they were in was struck by an IED .
The latest death brings to 151 the total number of Canadian soldiers who have died as part of the Afghan mission since it began in 2002 .

Sharp images of fireworks are common .
But many fireworks sizzle or sparkle , appearing fuzzy as they expand .
To capture a fairytale quality , I briefly touched the tripod with my hand to shake it a tiny amount , unnoticeable to the naked eye but caught by the camera sensor .
The resulting texture reminds me of delicate watercolor paintbrush strokes .

All I had really wanted to do this independence day was get a decent picture to submit for the challenge , so my family & I went to where i thought would be a perfect spot .
As it turns out , all the fireworks were too far away to get anything good .
Luckily , my sister had gotten a text that people were setting them off at the local elementary school .
We had gotten there in time to see not the most professional display of fireworks , ( a few of them fell over & exploded on the ground ) but certainly more photographical .

The Windows attack used by a recently discovered worm is being picked up by other virus writers and will soon become much more widespread , according to security vendor Eset .
Eset reported Thursday that two new families of malicious software have popped up , both of which exploit a vulnerability in the way Windows processes .
link files , used to provide shortcuts to other files on the system .
The vulnerability was first exploited by the Stuxnet worm , discovered on computer systems in Iran last month .
Highly sophisticated , Stuxnet targets systems running Siemens industrial control system management software .
The worm steals SCADA ( supervisory control and data acquisition ) project files from Siemens ' computer systems .
Siemens issued a Security Update for its customers on Thursday , but Microsoft has yet to patch the Windows bug that permits the worm to spread .
The newly discovered malware is " far less sophisticated " than Stuxnet and " suggests bottom feeders seizing on techniques developed by others , " said Eset researcher Pierre - Marc Bureau , writing in a blog post .
One of the new samples installs a keystroke logger , a tool hackers use to steal passwords and other data , on the victim 's computer .
" The server used to deliver the components used in this attack is presently located in the US , but the IP is assigned to a customer in China , " Bureau said .
The other variant could be used to install one of several different pieces of malicious software .
As each new variant of the attack pops up , it adds pressure on Microsoft to patch the underlying vulnerability .
Microsoft 's next set of security patches is due Aug. 10 , but if enough customers get infected , the company may be forced to rush out an emergency patch for the issue .
Microsoft has already posted a temporary workaround to the problem and says it is working on a patch .
Right now , the Stuxnet worm makes up a very tiny volume -- less than 1/100th of a percent -- of the malware that Eset is seeing on the Internet , said Randy Abrams , Eset 's director of technical education , in an interview .
However that 's likely to change .
" It 's likely to become one of the most prevalent attack vectors , " he said .
" I expect that within a few months , we 'll see hundreds if not thousands of pieces of malware using the link vulnerability . "

Using magnetic nanoparticles , scientists have found a way to remotely control neurons and affect animal behavior .
The nanoparticles , which are targeted to attach to cell membranes , heat up when exposed to a magnetic field .
Researchers have demonstrated that the heat can open calcium ion channels in cells , activate neurons and even cause C. elegans worms to recoil , according to a paper released in Nature Nanotechnology June 27 .
“ This research will help us unravel the signaling networks that control animal behavior , ” physicist Arnd Pralle of the University of Buffalo , co-author of the study , said in a press release July 6 .
The work could also have applications in cancer treatments and diabetes therapies .
If the nanoparticles can be targeted to specific proteins or cells , it may be possible to kill cancer cells by overheating the cell wall , or to stimulate the pancreatic cells to release insulin .
The method only affects cell walls , so patients would n’t actually feel the heat .
“ It would take forever to heat up [ a ] whole cell since it is cooled so well by all the water around it , ” Pralle said .
One of the major questions for using the technique in human applications is where the heat - sensitive ion channels are in the body .
In the C. elegans worms , the researchers were able to target known ion channels that opened up at 93 degrees Fahrenheit , which caused the recoil response .
In humans , similar ion channels in fingers open up at 122 degrees Fahrenheit , which is what causes our fingers to jump back when we touch something too hot , but little is known about other places where this happens in the body .

The vibrations from launching fireworks at the Alameda County Fair probably disturbed two nests of yellow jackets Friday night and resulted in about 100 people being stung , fair and fire officials said Saturday .
Minutes after the fair ’s fireworks show began about 9:15 p.m. , a steady flow of spectators suffering from insect stings made their way to the first aid booth , Alameda County Fire Department spokeswoman Aisha Knowles said .
The medical staff at the fair treated nearly 100 people in less than an hour , she said .
Several people were treated for multiple stings , but no one suffered an allergic reaction , and no one needed to be taken to the hospital .
The insect attack victims ranged in age from 6 months to 60 years .
After examining the area of the grandstands where the incident occurred , officials determined fairgoers had been attacked by a swarm of yellow jackets .
Their nests were found around midnight Friday at the base and near the top of a palm tree at the north end of the grandstands .
The yellow jackets were exterminated , according to a statement by fair spokeswoman April Mitchell .

Twelve Indonesian children have died after a suspension bridge collapsed as they were taking part in a traditional ceremony to dispel bad luck , a local official said .
The accident took place in a remote village in Aceh .
" There were about 37 kids gathered together on a wire - cable suspension bridge when it collapsed and they fell into a river , " district chief Ibnu Hasyim said .
Twenty - five children were rescued with minor injuries but 12 others - all below the age of 12 - were swept away in strong currents .
The children were watching a ritual ceremony to dispel misfortune after a measles outbreak in the area .
The adults were throwing offerings in the form of chickens into the river when the bridge collapsed , the official said .

Times are still tough out there , but our needs and desires do n’t always flag just because the economy does .
If an accident or an equipment failure has punched an unexpected hole in your computing life , you may be in need of a system — any system — to fill it .
Or maybe you ’ve discovered that your family just needs one more box to use as a Web terminal to keep the more powerful systems free more often .
Whatever the circumstance , you may be tempted to drop $ 500 or even more on one of the cheaper , pre-fab models you can find at Costco , Wal - Mart , or from one of the major manufacturers .
But once you ’ve factored in all the attendant costs , taxes , and shipping , you could be spending a lot more than you planned — and that ’s something to avoid , especially when every penny counts .
Even if you need a computer right away , there are plenty of good reasons to build one rather than buy one .
You control the parts , so you get exactly what you need at the price you can best afford .
You ’re assured of being able to upgrade any ( or all ) of the pieces later , when you have more money to spend .
And , perhaps most importantly , you get the satisfaction of doing it yourself and maintaining complete control over it from the very instant you open the boxes .
No matter how little you want to drop , building your own computer is still the best way to go .
So we asked ourselves :
What ’s the lowest point at which these two goals could intersect ?
If we needed a simple computer right away , and wanted to spend as little as possible , what could we build ?
We knew we wanted to aim low , almost ridiculously low — so we decided on what seemed like almost an unthinkable total : $ 200 , which would include everything needed for the base computer itself ( but not counting the monitor , keyboard , and mouse , or tax and shipping charges ) .
Once we had our target price , we took to Newegg.com to see whether this could really be done .
We spent hours researching all the possibilities , making swaps , compromises , and last - minute changes until we had all the parts for our impossibly inexpensive system that , amazingly , came in under budget .
We had met our goal — on paper .
But there ’s a lot more to any computer than just how it looks on a Web site or in the cells of an Excel spreadsheet .
We needed to make sure the computer would meet our needs , and not be stuck functioning as a big steel paperweight .
Read on for the details about how we built one of the least expensive computers we ’ve seen , while learning a lot more than we expected about the difficulties of component shopping , the importance of knowing what you need ( and what you ’re willing to settle for ) , and the knowledge that what you get can sometimes be considerably more than just what you see .

Patrick Stewart has had quite a year .
From being knighted to being in almost every Shakespearean production this side of Talos IV , our humble Captain seems to be in his prime .
Added to his full year has been his seemingly none stop convention attendance .
This is a true treat for Trek fans as Patrick had been absent for many years .
Add another date to your Patty - con calendar , it appears that the Captain will be appearing at Vegas Khhaaan !
this year .
We just received the news and a big thanks to Televixen from DVD Geeks for cluing us in .
Check out the details below .
One of the world 's most beloved and talented superstars Patrick is equally at home on stage , film and television having had major success in all mediums .
It is truly an honor to welcome Sir Patrick back to Creation Entertainment 's Official Star Trek Convention in Vegas as we celebrate his continuing contribution to the arts as well as his past credits including of course his wonderful portrayal of Captain Picard on STAR TREK : THE NEXT GENERATION .
Appearing Sunday August 8th .
To get more info and buy tickets for Vegas Khhaaan ! , check out the Creation Entertainment website here .
Will Bunch at Attytood brings us a story that 's so bizarre , at first I thought it was a joke .
It is n't .
( The fact that anyone will pay the Beckster $ 10 a month during a depression to get Double - Secret Indoctrinated ?
That 's a joke . )
I wish I could tell you that this is a clever photoshop on my part -- but sadly , no .
This is the actual emblem of something called Beck University that was officially announced today by the king of all distorted right - wing media , although judging from the initial info its formal accreditation as one of America 's institutions of higher learning may be a few years away ( and there 's no truth to the rumor that the Pac - 10 immediately asked Beck U. to become a member ) :
From Beck 's web site :
This July , while others are relaxing poolside , head back to the classroom - from the comfort of your own home .
That may sound like an oxymoron but Glenn ’s new academic program is only available online .
Offered exclusively to Insider Extreme subscribers , Beck University is a unique academic experience bringing together experts in the fields of religion , American history and economics .
Through captivating lectures and interactive online discussions , these experts will explore the concepts of Faith , Hope and Charity and show you how they influence America ’s past , her present and most importantly her future .
I guess you could call this " the Harvard of right - wing radio universities , " in the sense that , well , to my knowledge there are n't any other right - wing radio universities .
Unlike Harvard or Yale , where Beck was a half - term ( sound familiar ? ) student in one theology course after his ex-friend Joe Lieberman pulled some strings , Beck U. is strictly a profit deal .
Only by paying Glenn Beck Inc. to become an extreme insider ( $ 9.95 a month , or $ 74.95 ) can you enroll on Beck 's pseudo - cyber - campus .
How else do you think Beck expects to sell that $ 4.25 million manse and move into bigger digs ?
In addition to the myriad other reasons , one thing that guarantees that Beck U. wo n't be showing up in the U.S. News and World Report survey anytime soon is that 33 percent of the faculty is a fraud .
That would be the Christian - oriented pseudohistorian and Texas schoolbook perverter David Barton , whose sins against knowledge have been chronicled here in the past .
Students at Beck U. can also learn economics from a Beck pal , David Buckner , with a mediocre pedigree ( he has been an adjunct associate professor not of economics but of psychology and education at Columbia ) and also from an actual professor who somehow sneaked in there , LSU 's James Stoner .
Fabio Capello has condemned John Terry for making " a very big mistake " by publicly calling for senior players to stand up to the England manager after the side 's stuttering start to the World Cup .
The Italian claimed the deposed captain had let down his team - mates by effectively implicating them in a perceived coup that was due to take place at a meeting on Sunday evening .
Terry felt compelled last night to issue a public apology and is understood to have privately said sorry to some of his colleagues , who were dismayed by his conduct .
Terry was left isolated by their refusal to back him and the team meeting passed off without incident after the defender was
warned of the implications of speaking out by a member of Capello 's coaching staff .
Asked whether England had been on the verge of a player revolt to match that which has erupted in the France squad , Capello said : " No , it 's not a revolution .
It 's one mistake from one player , no more .
I read yesterday that John Terry said this .
I do n't understand why he does n't speak with me every time .
" I think he 's more disappointed some players because , when you speak , you have to speak privately , not with the media .
This is the big mistake .
This is very big mistake .
I know sometimes some players want to speak more with the media than with the other players .
The mistake is you have to speak with the players , with me , with the dressing room .
" I spoke with some players , and only John Terry said this .
No one spoke with me about problems .
My door is open always if they want to speak with me .
They can .
Every time we have a meeting I ask the captain : ' [ Are there any ] problems ?
You want to say something ? '
Never .
But I hope that from the big mistake comes out a big performance . "
The Italian was just as unimpressed with Terry 's ill - advised call for Joe Cole to be selected in tomorrow 's decisive match against Slovenia , with the defender 's comments seen as betraying a lack of respect to his other team - mates .
Terry completed his climbdown last night by apologising publicly .
" I went into yesterday 's press conference with the intention of being honest , " he told the Daily Mail .
" I was asked a question about Joe Cole and maybe I went too far .
But it was never my intention to upset the manager or the players and , if I did upset anyone , I apologise .
" I have told the manager he has my total support and I would like to stress that I do n't believe I have been a disruptive influence in the camp .
I would now like to put this episode behind me and concentrate on trying to win what is a massive game for England .
All I was trying to do was to say how important it is to me to try to win the World Cup . "
Terry is not alone in hoping Cole features against Slovenia and there remains the very real possibility that the 29 - year - old will make his first appearance of the tournament in a game Capello counts as " one of the biggest " of his career .
Yet Terry 's honesty when asked about the midfielder 's possible recall – " I personally think he and Wayne [ Rooney ] are the only two who can open up defences , " he said – was not welcomed by the management .
" It 's another mistake when you speak about one player because there is no respect for the players that play before , " said Capello .
" Always the players think individually .
I have to think about the team .
That 's important .
When you speak you have to be careful .
Joe Cole is one of the 23 players who are here .
I think you have to respect the other players who have played before . "
Asked about the mood in the squad after the suggestion on Sunday of a challenge to his authority , Capello said : " Probably one or two are not happy but the majority are happy .
For this reason it is no problem .
One player is not so important compared to all the other players .
The group is more important than one player .
If somebody wants to speak with me , he can speak .
I always tell people they can speak , but yesterday nobody spoke .
We saw the [ Algeria ] game without any comments .
" The spirit in the camp is fantastic .
Not good – it 's incredible .
I just spoke with the other coaches and they say : ' It 's incredible . '
They are training really well .
The spirit was there , the smiles and the players together .
Everything is like the best moment of their lives .
But I want to see this during the game , not only in training .
We have prepared everything perfectly for the players : they can swim , go to the gym and train .
The players are free and can go where they want .
Everything is more or less perfect .
But we are here to play at the World Cup and not for a holiday . "
Capello will play Matthew Upson at centre - half in the absence of the injured Ledley King and the suspended Jamie Carragher .
" Upson will play because he played always with John Terry [ for England ] , " said the Italian .
" I will probably change some other players . "
That could see Jermain Defoe start alongside Rooney at the expense of Emile Heskey , with Capello intent upon England quickening the tempo of England 's passing and movement .
Shaun Wright - Phillips or Cole could replace Aaron Lennon on the right , while both midfielders could feature if the management opt instead for a more radical switch to 4 - 3 - 3 or 4 - 5 - 1 with Steven Gerrard playing off a lone front man .
Those combinations have been scrutinised in training this week , with England now left with one session — at Royal Bafokeng this morning given the state of the sandy pitch at the Nelson Mandela Bay stadium — to fine - tune their approach ahead of the fixture against Slovenia .
The game is to be refereed by Wolfgang Stark , an official Terry had , ironically enough , denounced as " disrespectful " after Chelsea 's Champions League elimination to Internazionale last season .
" Today was the same as the last times : we trained very well , " added Capello .
" I 'm really happy with that .
But we had a meeting on Sunday and we saw what really happened on the pitch during the first half against Algeria .
I hope the players understand what really happened during this game .
And I hope , also , that on Wednesday the performance of the players will be the same I can see every day here in the training camp .
" It 's a mental thing , absolutely .
Physically , they 're training very well .
The tests are good .
But when you are in a game the pressure sometimes is big and the legs do n't work normally .
This is what happens .
I remember it happened to me as a player during one important match .
But I think on Wednesday the team will be fit .
" The results have not been not good .
I did n't see that spirit on the pitch .
We had it at some moments but not for 90 minutes .
It was only for five or six minutes that I could see the spirit .
I hope that in the next game against Slovenia the spirit will be back like we had it at other times , the same spirit I saw in qualifying .
This is one of the biggest games of my career because , after this match , we have no more chances .
We have to win . "
Six hundred arrests and half a dozen journalists have been assaulted .
The excuse given for this brutality being the actions of a handful of Black Blockers .
If the BB was the issue why the arrests and beatings of peaceful demonstrators ?
Why the assault on the media ?
There are two possible answers .
One is that the Harpocrit wants to rationalize his squandering a billion on " security " , especially at a time when he is demanding cut - backs .
The other is an attempt to show to the populace what the state can really do if the people step out of line , that the velvet glove is off and Canada is as thuggish as any other country .
( Of course , the First Nations knew that all along ! )
A lot of effort and money will have to be spent defending the 600 , even though the vast majority of charges are bogus .
This is another tactic favoured by a repressive state – keep 'em tied up in court , whether the charges stick or not .
But the result will not be to drive people into passivity .
The 600 , their family members and friends , and all the people who will learn the truth through the alternative and social media , will be radicalized .
And when you are first radicalized you become very angry at the cruelty and lies of the authorities .
The mass media with their whorishness towards the state will further this radicalization .
( The CBC has been little more than a propaganda outfit for the terrorists .
Email them and give them hell .
They should at least try to be a bit objective , after all , we are taxpayers too . ) .
The question naturally arises after this repression .
" where should we go from here ? "
Now I do n't claim to have any answers and could be way off base , but there is one thing I do know .
The cops may love beating on skinny students and community activists , but they are scared shitless of the organized working class .
I have been on big worker demos in both Vancouver and Montreal and the police are like little mice .
Initially , it made sense to break off from the trade union marches and directly confront the authorities .
Indeed , that tactic was what made Seattle a success .
But it has become less successful as the authorities have figured out ways to combat demonstrators .
I think Toronto shows such tactics to be almost suicidal .
Maybe we need to exchange minority militant actions for numbers but less militance ?
Let 's face it , 300,000 people marching against the G8 - 20 would be far more meaningful than 300 fighting the cops .
The latter can be written of as a fringe and " criminals " , but the great mass of " ordinary folks " are harder to ignore .
At the same time , activists from the various organizations could dialogue with the rank and file .
There is a lot of latent anger out there and when the so - called recovery fails to materialize and more cut - backs are demanded , it could manifest openly .

UPDATE
It appears that the arrests totaled 900 - which is about double during the October Crisis in Quebec , 1970 !
And according to the Civil Liberties Assn. the Black Bloc consisted of about 50 to 100 people .

A group of researchers have discovered an objective way to measure the most important members of a soccer team .
Yes , there is a scientific reason why you love Lionel Messi .
It all comes down to statistics .
Advertisement
It 's relatively straightforward to calculate individual performances in team sports that can be easily divided into lots of discrete events , whether it 's at - bats in baseball , offensive possessions in basketball , or downs in football .
When each game is made up of dozens or even a hundred such moments , it 's a lot easier to drill down and identify which players made an impact in various situations .
Soccer exists on the absolute opposite furthest end of this spectrum .
With the exception of halftime , the games never stop , and goals are so rare ( as anyone watching the current World Cup can attest ) that it 's pretty much impossible to accurately judge who played well based purely on who scored .
So then , what 's a budding sabermetrician supposed to do with the elegant game ?
Advertisement
Three researchers at Northwestern think they 've figured out a solution .
The key was identifying the real objective in a soccer game is n't so much scoring goals as it is moving the ball away from your own goal and towards the opposing team 's , thereby maximizing your team 's scoring opportunities .
As such , players that are successful in maintaining possession of the ball for their team maximize their team 's chances of success .
( This is a lot like the sabermetric tenet that the most important thing a baseball team can do is not make outs , which is a big reason why on - base percentage enjoys its current exalted status . )
To chart this , the researchers created " flow networks " , in which each player on the team is identified by a node , and then all the attempted passes between each combinations of players are charted , along with two additional nodes that identify shots that missed and shots that scored .
This network reveals two essential statistics for each player : passing accuracy , or the amount of passes that are successfully completed to a teammate , and shooting accuracy , or the amount of shots that result in goals .
Taken together , these two metrics chart how successful each player is at contributing to the team 's scoring opportunities .
When placed in the context of the flow network , they reveal the myriad paths from player to player that the ball can take , and how likely each path is to result in a shot on goal .
This in turn provides a measure of each player 's flow centrality , or the percentage of the time they are involved in a ball path that leads to a shot .
The researchers believe it's this last metric , flow centrality , that holds the key to better quantitative analysis of individual soccer performance .
The new metric also provides some solid support for the argument that superstars do matter , even in a quintessential team game like soccer .
Using the 2008 European Cup as their data set , they found the highest correlation between a team 's chance of winning and the flow centrality of its top two performers .
And the metric is generally a good predictor - they found it does n't take much of a flow advantage for a team to have 3:1 odds of winning a given match .
Advertisement
Their results also accord well with the more subjective views of those watching the games , always a good sanity check for new , advanced statistics .
The researchers compared their list of the Euro Cup 's top twenty performers with those selected for team of the tournament honors .
The two lists had eight players in common , which is a shockingly significant result : even just four players in common would have just a 1/100,000 probability of happening by chance , and there 's essentially zero chance that an eight player overlap could happen by coincidence .
Advertisement
And it 's not just athletics for which flow networks can be used to chart individual performances .
The team suggests any cooperative activity in which information is passed from one person to another - say , a project that involves lots of phone calls or emails - can be calculated using these networks .
They looked at some of their own scientific papers and how each had interacted with their coauthors , charting which communiques led to forward progress like new data or even completion , which led to scheduling a meeting , and which came to nothing .
Although they are very optimistic about providing a hugely useful metric to the field of soccer analysis , they are much more cautious when it comes to extending their work .
This is probably wise , considering they came this close to providing a method to figuring out who really pulls their share of the weight on scientific papers .
Ask any scientist , and I 'm sure they 'd prefer that level of statistical precision remains safely confined to the soccer pitch .

Many hedge funds expected share prices to recover in May
Hedge funds suffered their worst losses for 18 months in May as investors bet wrongly that stock markets would rise .
The Hennessee Hedge index said funds were down on average 2.99 % last month , the heaviest fall since October 2008 .
Funds were wrong - footed by factors such as the mysterious Wall Street " flash crash " , when shares plunged in seconds .
But Hennessee Group founder Charles Gradante said the losses at hedge funds still beat other benchmarks such as the S&P 500 index , which fell 8.2 % .
Another index tracking hedge funds ' performance , from Hedge Fund Research , said average losses in May were down 2.26 % , the worst fall since November 2008 .
Some funds run by Paulson & Co , the world 's biggest hedge fund , were among the hardest hit in May , even though most of the group 's funds are up this year .
The Paulson Recovery Fund , which is backing the US economy to recover strongly , lost 8.67 % in May .
Mr Gradante said : " There are many things keeping hedge fund managers awake at night , and as a result managers are operating with lower gross exposure levels . "
He cited concerns about sovereign debts , the Gulf of Mexico oil spillage , Chinese monetary policy , tougher financial regulation and geopolitical worries in the Middle East and North Korea .
" I cannot remember when there have been so many potential global crises happening at the same time , " Mr Gradante said .
England striker Wayne Rooney has said sorry for remarks about England fans after Friday 's 0 - 0 draw with Algeria .
Some fans booed the team off the pitch after the final whistle , prompting Rooney to say into a television camera " nice to see your home fans booing " .
" I said things in the heat of the moment out of frustration of our performance and the result , " he said in a Football Association statement .
" For my part I apologise for any offence caused by my actions . "
Friday 's goalless draw , coming after a 1 - 1 draw with the United States , leaves England needing a win from Wednesday 's final game against group leaders Slovenia to guarantee progress to the knockout stages .
606 : DEBATE Rooney 's reaction was just as pointless as the booing in my opinion .
Put it behind us and let 's thrash Slovenia
DeadRevel Rooney looked a shadow of the player who shone in the Premier League and Champions League all season , scoring 34 goals on his way to walking away with the PFA and Football Writers ' Association Player of the Year awards .
Numerous passes failed to stick as Rooney 's normally impeccable control let him down , and he found himself dropping increasingly deep in search of possession .
With Rooney failing to score for Manchester United or England ( with the exception of a goal in the pre-World Cup friendly against the Platinum All - Stars ) , speculation has suggested that the 24 - year - old has not shaken off the ankle and groin injuries which marred the end to his superb season .
England coach Fabio Capello admitted Rooney was not been at his best against Algeria , but rejected the suggestion that it was a fitness problem .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I know he gave the ball away a lot yesterday and some of his passes were not good but he is still an important player , " said the Italian .
" He is completely fit .
He has trained and he has been on the pitch for as long as any other player .
He is perfect .
" The problem is in the mind .
I know this .
I was a player .
I remember these moments .
In the mind you are OK - then you get to the pitch . "
Capello said the problems were not specific to Rooney , but seemed to be affecting the squad in general .
" This is not the England that I know , " said Capello .
" It is a problem because these players have trained very well .
But in the two games it is not the same team that I know .
" It is the same thing I saw in that first game at Wembley when I became England manager .
" I hope in the next game we forget these two performances .
On Wednesday I hope to see the England team . "

The red plains of Mars were once covered by a vast ocean ... and lush planet could have supported extra-terrestrial life
A vast ocean once covered a third of the surface of Mars , scientists revealed last night .
Far from being a dusty red desert , our neighbouring planet was once wet and rainy - raising the prospect that it was home to extra-terrestrial life .
The ocean stretched across 36 per cent of the red planet around 3.5 billion years ago and contained 30 million cubic miles of water .
Life - sustaining :
The ocean and shoreline of Mars as it might have looked 3.5 billion years ago
The discovery is based on a detailed study of the dried - up river deltas and thousands of river valleys that scatter the Martian surface .
Scientists from the University of Colorado at Boulder are unsure why the water vanished , but many suspect traces of the ocean remain in ice buried deep beneath the surface .
Dr Brian Hynek , who took part in the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience , said Mars probably once had a water cycle like the Earth's - with rain falling into rivers and oceans , evaporating into the atmosphere and forming clouds .
The Martian sea - which has not been named - contained around a tenth of all the water found in Earth 's oceans , he said .
Mars is slightly more than half the size of Earth .
Long lived oceans may have teemed with microbes at a time when the life is thought to have also been starting on Earth .
Vast : Mars 's northern hemisphere ocean held 10 times more water than all the Earth 's , research suggests
Using detailed maps of Maps created by orbiting Nasa and European Space Agency spacecraft , the researchers looked at the remains of 52 river deltas , each fed by numerous river valleys .
More than half were at the same altitude and appeared to mark the boundaries of a massive ocean .
The amount of water in the ocean would have formed the equivalent of a 1,800 foot layer spread out over the entire planet .
Barren : Dry and dusty , how Mars looks today
Co-author Dr Gaetano Di Achille said : ‘ On Earth , deltas and lakes are excellent collectors and preservers of signs of past life .
If life ever arose on Mars , deltas may be the key to unlocking Mars ' biological past . ’
A second study also detected around 40,000 river valleys - four times more than have previously been spotted .
The valleys were the source of sediment that was carried downstream and dumped into the deltas .
Dr Hynek said : ' The abundance of these river valleys required a significant amount of precipitation . '
The idea of a large ancient ocean on Mars has been debated for two decades .
However , the new study provides compelling evidence that the sea existed - and raises tantalising questions about the planet 's history .
' One of the main questions we would like to answer is where all of the water on Mars went , ’ said Dr Di Achille .
TORONTO — A government changes a law to allow police to arrest people without probable cause .
It does so without any legislative debate .
Then it keeps the change a virtual secret , until someone is arrested under those new powers .
The Soviet Union circa 1950 ?
Nope .
Try Canada , June 2010 .
Civil liberties advocates and political activists are up in arms after it emerged Friday that police in Toronto have been given special powers to arrest anyone near the site of the G20 summit if they fail to identify themselves .
ADVERTISEMENT
What ’s more , the government of the province of Ontario , which green - lit the new powers , did n’t tell anyone about it until after someone was arrested under the new powers .
Thirty - one - year - old Dave Vasey was arrested near the G20 perimeter security fence in downtown Toronto Thursday afternoon after refusing to identify himself to a police officer .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The officer told me , Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœI am going to have to place you under arrest if you do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t show your identification , Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and I replied Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not comfortable with that , Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Vasey said , as quoted at the Toronto Star .
With Vasey ’s arrest , it emerged that Ontario secretly changed its Public Works Protection
Act to allow police officers unprecedented powers of arrest .
That law allowed police to arrest people if they fail to identify themselves to a police officer when inside a government building or near a “ public works ” project .
It has now been expanded to include the area around the G20 summit , meaning a significant portion of downtown Toronto .
The Toronto Star reports :

The regulation kicked in Monday and will expire June 28 , the day after the summit ends .
While the new regulation appeared without notice on the provinceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s e-Laws online database last week , it wonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t be officially published in The Ontario Gazette until July 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€ one week after the regulation expires .
According to the new regulation , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ guardsÃ¢â‚
¬Â appointed under the act can arrest anyone who , in specific areas , comes within five metres of the security zone .
Within those areas , police can demand identification from anyone coming within five metres of the fence perimeter and search them .
If they refuse , they face arrest .
Anyone convicted under the regulation could also face up to two months in jail or a $ 500 maximum fine .
Toronto Chief of Police Bill Blair , who reportedly requested the arrest powers , denied Friday that it had been done in secret .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We have nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t changed the rules , ” he said , as quoted at the National Post .
“ We have put up a fence .
We have told people very very clearly that we will not be allowing the public access into that area . …
Our authority comes primarily comes from common law , but also by the regulation that has been passed by the province of Ontario . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But the assertion that the change was n’t secret was immediately challenged by reporters covering the G20 summit .
“ Funny , ” writes Adam Radwanski at the Globe and Mail , “ I asked two different spokespeople for the integrated G20 police unit Ã¢â‚¬â€  at least one of whom was from the Toronto force Ã¢â‚¬â€ about the legal justification for the measures being taken around the perimeter .
Neither breathed a word about anything about the Public Works Protection Act , let alone any recent cabinet decisions that affected it . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s just unbelievable you would have this kind of abuse of power where the cabinet can create this offense without having it debated in the legislature , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Vasey ’s lawyer , Howard Morton , told the Star .
Activist groups say that keeping the new police powers a secret means they have been giving G20 protesters inaccurate advice about how to deal with police confrontations .
Vasey himself refused to show identification to police because he was following the advice laid out by the Toronto Community Mobilization Network , which is organizing some G20 protest activities .
“ This act values public property over the freedom of people and prevents community members from walking freely through the streets without questioning from authorities , ” the group said on its Web site Friday .
“ We will not be made examples of , but rather , we will publicly denounce oppressive activities of the state and highlight the solidarity in our communities . ”

Vasey is scheduled to appear in court on July 28 .
SAN FRANCISCO 
After the deaths of five infants , California health authorities declared an epidemic of whooping cough in the state on Wednesday , urging residents  particularly those of Latino background  to get vaccinated against the disease .
The announcement came after authorities noticed a sharp spike in reports of pertussis , the scientific name for whooping cough , which often is mistaken for a cold or the flu and is highly contagious .
All told , 910 cases have been confirmed , with several hundred more under investigation .
If the pace keeps up , the outbreak could be the largest in the state in 50 years , the California Department of Public Health reported .
Dr. Gilberto Chavez , the deputy director of the department ’s Center for Infectious Disease , said health officials had seen a fourfold increase compared with 2009 .
And the worst may be to come .
“ The peak season starts in the summer , ” Dr. Chavez said , noting that July and August usually have the highest number of cases .
“ And we expect to see a much larger number of cases if we do n’t intervene quickly . ”
Well Arbitrary Day is nearly upon us – and if you do n’t know what that is here is a small excerpt from Reddit Gifts :
“ Arbitrary Day is the celebration that takes place at the half - life of Christmas – June 25th .
It ’s just an awesome excuse for strangers to mail each other presents , and then talk about it on the Internet . ”
Of course being a keen redditor who also took part in the Reddit Secret Santa project I just had to sign up for it .
Home made gifts are highly encouraged ( and normally well received ) for this give - athon .
I made my giftee a rage t- shirt for Secret Santa which I though was pretty neat – until I saw all the awesome home made things other people got .
I swear the users of that website are an untapped source of imagination and artistry mixed in with a bit of cunning and a lot of bacon .
I was thinking about doing the same kinda thing for A.D. but knew that I would n’t be able to make any decisions until I was matched with my giftee .
Half the fun is trying figure out a good gift for the person you finally get by becoming their personal e-stalker .
You start out by googling their name , then you check out their address on Gmaps .
Next comes the Facebook and MySpace searches , which can sometimes hold a wealth of usable information .
And then comes the arduous task of pouring over all their previous Reddit posts and comments .
Well after my bout of obsessive stalking I had found out a few good bits of info about my victim giftee .
I ’m not going to post anything I found out on here due to the 1 in 6 billion chance that they ( or any other living soul ) comes across this post .
The only thing I will say is that they own an Xbox 360 – which means they play games .
This is great news for me as I started feeling that making another t- shirt would be a bit of a cop out .
Instead I thought I ’d try my hand at something that I think I first saw on Instructables , although it could ’ve been somewhere else for all I know .
Put simply , it was an old NES controller that connected to a PC via USB and held a compendium of NES games and an emulator on it .
I remember drooling over the video of it and always wanting to try it out for myself .
Unfortunately I do n’t have any old NES controllers lying around , so I thought I ’d try it out with a standard PS2 style gamepad instead .
So I went down to my local electronics store and got myself some supplies , which consisted of :
USB gamepad
4 port USB hub ( smallest one I could find )
Mini USB cable
4 GB USB flash memory
I figured it would be a simple enough job ;
Connect the controller and the memory to the hub , connect the hub to the USB cable and then jam it all inside the controllers housing .
Before I started any connecting I decided to try and lay out where the components would go .
As you can probably tell from the pictures below there is n’t really a lot of free space inside those things , and the hub / memory are relatively bulky .
Even after cutting away some of the interior plastic supports there was still no room to fit them .
I ended up having to remove all the USB sockets from the hub and stripping the memory down to the board itself .
Surprisingly now this was done it all fitted perfectly , albeit in different parts of the case .
Now it was just a case of soldering everything together .
I ’m not the best at this , but I think I did a reasonable job .
Obviously I could n’t possibly put 3.7 GB of game ROMs onto the flash drive , as that would be illegal .
But I can put on some of the legal emulators and make a simple autorun start menu for them in Director .
And so the hardest part of this whole thing is left .
I now have to wrap it and mail it without too much procrastination in between .
I have less than two weeks to make this happen , but hopefully I ’ll get off my arse and do it tomorrow …. or Friday .
Yeah , Friday sounds good .
I just hope that my giftee likes it at least a little bit , and that I have n’t gone off at a tangent with this .
Fingers crossed , and Happy Arbitrary Day !
Update : I ’ll be putting together a proper how - to with more pictures for this so that you can make one if so inclined .

At today 's Cyber - Safety and Youth Advisory Group Summit in Canberra , Senator Conroy announced the Government 's latest tool to protect children online .
Based on the Adobe Air platform , the security device , notionally referred to as a ' big red button ' will either occupy the Windows taskbar or sit prominently on the desktop .
Clicking the device will permit a child experiencing trouble to either access assistance to report issues to a social networking site or to connect with Police .
Following final testing by the 50 members of the Youth Advisory group , the tool will be made available to children throughout Australia without charge .
Mooted first in November last year , the device was later rumoured to have cost in excess of $ 100,000 dollars .
According to the Whirlpool forum posting , there has been a team of eight programmers working on the project for a considerable length of time .
Eight programmers ?
For a simple panic widget ?
As iTWire sees it , there are two significant , perhaps insurmountable , problems with this project .
Firstly , a wide variety of research has clearly demonstrated that kids do not understand the significance of what in hindsight would be labelled sexual overtures from strangers - they will happily go along for the ride .
The button will ( generally ) not be pushed .
Secondly , kids ( being kids ) will test out the reporting systems and flood Police contact centres with ( not necessarily bogus , but certainly ) pointless reports of undesired activity by adults , classmates and even those they dislike .
One can only be happy that the big-red - button will be both free and optional ( unlike the Filter ) ; however just like the Filter it will be entirely pointless .
This appears to be yet another attempt by the Federal Government to absolve parents of their responsibilities .
Updated Dell is warning customers that there is malware on some of its server motherboards .
The PowerEdge R410 Rack server has spyware within its embedded systems management software .
The direct seller is sending customers letters warning of the danger and also telephoning those affected .
A post in a support forum says customers should hear from Dell shortly .
It does not provide any technical explanation of what type of spyware is included with the hardware or what extra cleaning process customers should go through .
Some forms of malware are likely to have spread if the hardware has been attached to a network .
We 've put calls in to Dell UK and will update this story when we hear more .
The forum post , from yesterday morning , is here .
The forum poster was concerned not to have more technical information - and that the call he received to book technical support said the call might not happen for up to ten days .
In response a Dell support staffer said there was an issue with a small number of service motherboard stock - new PowerEdge systems are not infected .
He said the malware would not infect non-Windows servers .
Update :
Dell sent us the following statement :
“ Dell is aware of the issue and is contacting affected customers .
The issue affects a limited number of replacement motherboards in four servers - PowerEdge R310 , PowerEdge R410 , PowerEdge R510 and PowerEdge T410 – and only potentially manifests itself when a customer has a specific configuration and is not running current anti-virus software .
This issue does not affect systems as shipped from our factory and is limited to replacement parts only .
Dell has removed all impacted motherboards from its service supply chain and new shipping replacement stock does not contain the malware .
Customers can find more information on Dell ’s community forum . ” – Forrest Norrod , vice president and general manager of server platforms at Dell .
Fortunately the forum has also been updated with information which answers some of the relevant questions - the malware was found in the flash on motherboards , not in firmware .
It is a W32 .
Spybot worm which should be detected by any decent anti-virus software .
Dell said that less than one per cent of boards shipped have the infection .
Systems using an iDRAC Express or iDRAC Enterprise card will not be damaged .
In fact systems will only be hit if you run an update to either Unified Server Configurator ( USC ) or 32 - bit Diagnostics .

Well , I ’ve been saying it all year , and it finally happened tonight : David Ortiz became the first player in the 2010 season to take more than 30 - seconds to trot around the bases after a home run .
With four of the top five slowest home run trots of the year already – all four of which were clocked in at 28.95 seconds or slower – it seemed inevitable that he would be the first to break the half - minute barrier .
With his laser beam down the right field line in the second inning of tonight ’s game , he finally did it .
See the home run trot here .
A trot like this does n’t come without help .
Papi is certainly one of MLB ’s premiere home run watchers , usually taking a second or more to watch the path of the ball and compose himself before he leaves the batter ’s box ( Vlad Guerrero and Alfonso Soriano are two others in the same camp ) .
But standing in the batter ’s box and watching the flight of the home run is n’t always a bad thing .
Long fly balls pulled into the corner can very easily end up foul , and it ’s not uncommon to see the batter spend an extra second in the box as he waits to see where the ball will land .
Ortiz ’s home run tonight was of that type , though he did seem to spend more time in the batter ’s box than most people like .
Even more , as he left the batter ’s box to run towards first , he very briefly ran into the home plate umpire , who had run out from behind the catcher and raced up the line a bit to get a better view on where the ball ended up .
You ca n’t see that in the highlight above ; I only noticed it on the ESPN feed , as they cut to commercial .
Still , I can tell you with pretty good confidence that the umpire did not obstruct Papi enough to be the sole reason he spent 30 - seconds on the basepath .
That ’s the product of a slow - moving man who shows no desire to speed anything up .
One might say Papi is the perfect example
of the “ Savor the Moment ” t- shirt .
Just for fun , I thought I ’d break Ortiz ’s home run into it ’s main parts ( leaving the box , touching the bases , etc ) and compare it to Adam Rosales , the quickest ( non-inside - the - park ) trotter in the game .
It might help put Papi ’s trot into perspective :

In case it was n’t clear to you before , it should be now : David Ortiz is ** slow * * around the basepaths .
I was hoping to animate a comparison of the two batters , but I am not exactly competent in Flash or other video .
Hopefully this table will make due .
After I tweeted about Papi ’s accomplishment this evening , fellow Bloguiner Joe Tetrault of the excellent Tetrault Vision asked this question :
“ can we set a pool on his longest trot time ?
I want 35.50 # bigpapi # strollinginthepark ”
Great question .
With such a prolific
May – in terms of both total home runs and average trot time – there ’s a lot of room for Ortiz to add to his record .
So what say you : just how long will Ortiz ’s longest trot time be this year ?
Will it be the slowest trot of the year , or will someone somehow pass him ?
If it ’s not the slowest trot , what will the slowest trot be ?
Give me some numbers in the comments .
If we have enough guesses , we might even be able to make this a contest ( maybe for a Tater Trot Tracker t- shirt ? ) .
Have at it .

Update : Radio Iowa reports , “ A billboard in Mason City that pictured President Obama flanked by Nazi leader Adolph Hitler and communist leader Vladimir Lenin has been papered over this morning . ”
A billboard created by an Iowa tea party group that compares President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Lenin is drawing sharp criticism Ã¢â‚¬â€ even from fellow tea party activists who have condemned it as offensive and a waste of money .
ADVERTISEMENT
The North Iowa Tea Party began displaying the billboard in downtown Mason City last week .
The sign shows large photographs of Obama , Nazi leader Hitler and communist leader Lenin beneath the labels “ Democrat Socialism , ” “ National Socialism , ” and “ Marxist Socialism . ”
Beneath the photos is the phrase , “ Radical leaders prey on the fearful & naive . ”
The co-founder of the roughly 200 - person group said the billboard was intended to send an anti-socialist message .
But Bob Johnson admitted Tuesday that the message may have gotten lost amid the images of fascist and communist leaders .
“ The purpose of the billboard was to draw attention to the socialism .
It seems to have been lost in the visuals , ” Johnson said .
“ The pictures overwhelmed the message .
The message is socialism . ”
He said he did n’t know of any plans to remove the sign .
But others in the tea party movement criticized the sign .

“ That ’s just a waste of money , time , resources and it ’s not going to further our cause , ” said Shelby Blakely , a leaders of the Tea Party Patriots , a national group .
“ It ’s not going to help our cause .
It ’s going to make people think that the tea party is full of a bunch of right - wing fringe people , and that ’s not true . ”
Blakely also expressed outrage at linking Obama to Hitler , the leader of Nazi Germany who oversaw the killing of 6 million Jews and whose invasions of neighboring countries led to World War II .
“ When you compare Obama to Hitler , that to me does a disservice to the Jews who both survived and died in the Holocaust and to the Germans who lived under Nazi regime rule , ” Blakely said .
ADVERTISEMENT
John White , an Iowa coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots , said that he can understand the North Iowa group ’s perception that Obama is “ Hitler - esque , ” but he thinks the billboard is offensive and unproductive .
White said that he planned to discuss the matter with national tea party officials .
“ I fear they may end up in some kind of trouble over it , because it ’s basically slanderous , ” White said .
“ I do n’t know that it ’s the message we want to send .
I ’d much rather see billboards that say ‘ Remember in November .
Get Out and Vote . ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The billboard is owned by Waitt Outdoor of Omaha , Neb .
Waitt general manager , Kent Beatty , said the company did n’t have a problem with the message .
“ We believe in freedom of speech , ” Beatty said .
“ It does n’t reflect our views , necessarily . ”
The White House declined to comment on the sign .
ADVERTISEMENT
One person who welcomed the billboard was Dean Genth , a Democratic activist from Mason City , a city of 30,000 people just south of the Minnesota border , who said he thinks the sign lays bare the views of tea party supporters .
“ I welcome them to continue to spew that kind of stuff because I think it ’s going to do a lot of good for the good Democrats around the state , ” Genth said .

A while ago I did a post called game theory applied to game design .
It might be good to take a quick look at that post again if you do n't remember it .
However , to refresh your memory , my major claims were :
Giving the player a dominant strategy is a bad idea because it dooms the player to using one unbeatable super move for their whole gameplay experience .
Any dominated strategies might as well not be included because they are options that a rational player ( a player trying to win ) has no reason to use .
As a result Rock , Paper , Scissor emerged as a clean example of a game where there are no strictly dominant or dominated strategies ; all strategies are equally useful in different situations .
Remember that player 1 is the row player and player 2 is the column player and that the outcome scores are listed as ( player 1's score , player 2's score ) .
Therefore when player 1 plays rock and player 2 plays scissor you can see that the outcome is ( 1,0 ) .
Where the two players play the same strategy you can see the outcome is a draw represented by ( 0,0 ) .

Where the two players play the same strategy you can see the outcome is a draw represented by ( 0,0 ) .
Since we 're in the process of making a fighting game , it 's interesting to think about how a balanced framework like this might apply directly to Overgrowth .
What if we actually used Rock , Paper , Scissor for our combat framework ?
My gut reaction is that Rock , Paper , Scissor is way too simple .
In real combat scenarios , fighters have virtually infinite moves at their disposal , so restricting combat to three moves seems rather underwhelming .
But can we add more moves to this framework without creating strictly dominant or dominated strategies ?
Yes !
In fact it is trivially easy .
Check out this game I made called Rock , Paper , Scissor , Shoe , Ray Gun .

But still that 's only 5 moves .

The tyranny of choice
As you can probably see , for any odd number N where N > 1 we can follow this pattern to create a Rock , Paper , Scissor variant with N strategies .
But I think there is obviously a problem emerging .
What the heck is the intuition supposed to be here for each strategy ?
Say the enemy plays the strategy " Shoe " and you have 3 seconds to come up with a counter move .
Would you remember what to pick or would you have to guess randomly ?
Games that overwhelm you with potential moves encourage " button mashing " .
The tyranny of user input schemes
Even if you can think of the move you want to do , how do you correctly communicate your intentions to the game ?
You need some way to translate your controller inputs to fighting moves .
Motion controllers may be the future of gaming because they provide the player with an analog mapping of real world moves to virtual moves .
However , in light of the fact that Wii Sports Boxing was one of the most frustrating video games experiences of my life , I think it 's likely that motion control technology still has a long way to go ( maybe Natal or one of those other newfangled devices will be better ) .
An exciting demo of cutting edge motion control technology ( An exciting demo of cutting edge motion control technology ( Watch on YouTube
Excluding motion controllers , a character 's fighting moves must be generated by arbitrary controls that are n't related to what your character is actually doing .
If the control scheme is complicated , trying to perform the key strokes required for the move you have in mind can be a tricky problem .
Giving the player a fighting chance
Use a framework with some intuition
When I chose the names of the strategies in my sample games above , my methods were random .
In fact I would argue that even the original Rock , Paper , Scissor game already requires an unintuitive stretch of the imagination .
Namely , if you were about to get into a fight , would you arm yourself with a piece of paper or a rock ?
Yet somehow we manage to train ourselves that paper beats rock .
I propose that the best framework would intuitively convey the interrelation of strategies to people who had never even played before .
For example , what if you represented every strategy with an elemental force .
You might end up with something like this :
It 's still not perfect , but I 've never played Pokemon before and it seems quite natural to me that if a fire Pokemon attacks a plant Pokemon , it will get a bonus as will an electricity Pokemon attacking water Pokemon , or water attacking fire .
I just can't say the same thing about a shoe with respect to a potato .
Good frameworks allow players to know what the underlying strategy chart is without being shown or having to discover it through excessive trial and error .
Give the player more time
The truth is that humans are fairly slow .
The average human response time for an action you are already prepared to perform ( clicking the mouse for example ) after observing a signal , is about .2 seconds .
Do n't believe me ?
Check this game out !
In the real world people can deliver fast analog responses to situations they encounter .
In games it 's not so simple .
( In the real world people can deliver fast analog responses to situations they encounter .
In games it 's not so simple .
( Watch on YouTube
Now imagine , you have several moves to choose from but you must choose the correct one among them .
It 's going to take you a lot longer .
Feel free to try this more complex game to see what I mean .
Unlike Pokemon , which is turn - based so you have all day to think about the chart , real - time combat systems are all about fast decisions .
This creates a bit of a paradox because fast fights look way cooler than slow ones , but fast fights are fundamentally much more difficult to control ( fortunately there can be tastefully applied slow - motion Matrix effects ) .
Lugaru fans likely noticed that the main difference between the normal and insane difficulty settings is the game speed .
Reduce your massive move list with contexts
Keep it simple
You can streamline the player 's decision tree by forcing them to make choices about the fight .
The UFC video game has tons and tons of striking and grappling attacks but since it's not physically possible for fighters to be standing and grappling at the same time , the two move sets are divided .
You start the game standing with controls that map to punches and kicks .
Then if you decide to perform a takedown , the controls logically switch from standing strikes to grappling techniques and " ground and pound " .
Similarly
In Lugaru , I can alter my move set from range by choosing to equip a weapon or stick with my fists and feet .
Next , by choosing my character 's position ( whether I run , jump crouch or stand still ) I end up effectively determining and reducing my set of eligible attacks .
By the time I 'm in range to deliver a blow , I 'm left with a streamlined choice .
Many mainstream fighting games seem to take the approach that the more moves you can cram in , the better .
I have spent countless hours on games like Tekken and Soul Calibur .
However , when each character has over 90 unique moves , there really is n't a clean way to process it all .
I end up committing to one guy ( I usually pick the guy I think looks the coolest , Kilik FTW ) and then try to study all his moves in practice mode .
I pick about 10 moves that I think will be most effective and then try to memorize the key combo's that generate them .
Then by getting into fights , I can use trial and error to learn what attack beats what ( most games are not going to give you a comprehensive chart of how it all fits together and even if they did , you probably would n't be able to read it ) .
Slowly it feels like I am getting better , but this solution space is not smooth .
Once I learn a few tricks that seem to work initially , I am prone to become set in my ways prematurely .
Unlike David , who managed to solve Soul Calibur II with Ivy , I think I often get stuck at local skill maxima without reaching the absolute maximum .
With this in mind , it seems the most powerful way to preserve intuition and eliminate confusion is to be disciplined about how many moves you include .
More moves , means more complication which translates to more research and trial and error for the players before they can become proficient .
Conclusion
I think many people have the impression that it's hard to lay down a balanced combat framework with lots of moves .
The truth is that this challenge is trivially easy compared to making sure your combat system is intuitive .
We 've been talking some internally about Overgrowth 's fighting system and while adding an extra attack button to Lugaru 's standard combat system could easily allow us to double the number of combat moves , it 's not clear whether or not we should .
In the end it will probably come down to playtesting but I thought it might be fun to share my initial ramblings with you .
I 'd be very interested to hear your thoughts .

THE Dutch troop deployment in Afghanistan , often held up as a model for other peace missions , ends after four years on Sunday amid concerns about the void it will leave .
About 1950 Dutch troops are deployed in Afghanistan under the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , mainly in the southern Oruzgan province , where Australia has operated as junior partner to the Dutch since 2006 .
As from Sunday , Dutch troops will be replaced by a US - lead multinational Combined Team Oruzgan comprising Australian , Slovak and Singaporean forces .
NATO had asked the Netherlands to extend the mission , which started in 2006 and has cost the lives of 24 soldiers , by a year to August 2011 .
This sparked a political row that led to the Government collapsing in February and the end of the Dutch deployment .
Once the Dutch troops leave , Australia will take on some fresh responsibilities , including provision of a civilian to head the Oruzgan Provincial Reconstruction Team , a position previously held by the Dutch .
Australia will also take on an increased role in security for growing Australian civilian aid activity in the province .
Oruzgan is one of Afghanistan 's poorest and most remote regions , where opium production is high and the Taliban very active .
The Dutch mission has become known for its 3D approach of defence , development and diplomacy .
Since the start of its lead role in Oruzgan at a cost of some 1.4 billion euros ( $ 2.04 billion ) to the Dutch state , the number of NGOs doing development work in the province has risen from six to 50 , according to a Dutch embassy document .
It states that 50,000 children are attending school in Oruzgan , four times as many as in 2002 .
A million fruit trees have been distributed to farmers to provide an alternative livelihood to poppy cultivation .
The Dutch are also helping to build a road between the province 's two most populated towns , Chora and Tarin Kowt , in a bid to boost trade .
And it has trained 3000 Afghan soldiers , who " are now able to independently carry out operations , " according to chief of defence , General Peter van Uhm .
" We offer the majority of the population relatively safe living conditions and advancements in health care , education and trade , " chief of defence , van Uhm said of his troops ' legacy in Oruzgan .
" We have achieved tangible results that the Netherlands can be proud of , " he told a news conference today .
However , Rob de Wijk , director of The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies , said the Dutch mission 's work was not done .
" One does not leave as one starts registering success , " he said .
Jan Kleian , president of the ACOM military union , said he had spoken to several soldiers on the ground , " and they are not happy to leave " .
" They want to finish what they started ; the mission is not completed , " he said .
During a visit by Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende to Washington in July last year , US President Barack Obama described the Dutch troops as " one of the most outstanding militaries " in Afghanistan , and asked the country to consider staying on .
In a letter to Balkenende in February , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen wrote : " The standard which has been achieved by your armed forces and civilian personnel in one of the most challenging parts of Afghanistan has become the benchmark for others . "
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has also thanked the Netherlands " for the work that Dutch soldiers and development workers have done , and are still doing , in building the country " .
A Dutch Government spokeswoman said all Dutch ISAF troops would be back home by September while the hardware , including four F - 16 fighter jets , would be repatriated by year - end .
Last month , the Australian Government also fixed a timeline for Australia 's Afghanistan drawdown , which could see troops leave as soon as 2013 or as late as 2015 .
Under this program , 2 - 4 years will be devoted to training Afghan forces to an acceptable standard , followed by perhaps a year with a reduced Australian force providing overwatch while Afghan forces take responsibility for the Oruzgan province .
Australia currently has 1550 troops in Afghanistan , most of them in Oruzgan .

The Microsoft Windows tablet is n't dead , according to Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer .
Microsoft was years ago .
Of course , it took Apple to show the consumer electronics world how to make a successful mainstream consumer tablet , with its .
Now that world is , and if the coming onslaught of is any indication , it seems as though Google and its partners have second place locked down .
Ballmer let it be known this morning , however , that his company is n't going to give up without a fight .
During his keynote at the Worldwide Partner conference , Ballmer announced that Windows 7 tablets by such high - profile partners as Asus , Dell , Samsung , Toshiba , and Sony will be coming later this year .
Not surprisingly , the form factors and price points of said devices will be as diverse as the companies manufacturing .
Some will feature keyboards , some will be dockable , some will offer electronic ink displays .
Ballmer 's announcement echoes his unveiling of an , at this year 's CES .
Of course , the roadmap on that device may well have changed dramatically .
Given , however , chances seem good that a webOS tablet from the company will beat a Windows 7 device to market .
During his long career as one of Victorian England 's most acquisitive gentleman explorers , William Bankes rightly gained a reputation for spotting a good bargain .
Among the items he sent back from his travels abroad to his family seat in Dorset were an Egyptian obelisk , Venetian ceilings and Nubian carvings .
But until now a question mark has always hung over one of his most high - profile purchases – a painting of Apollo or possibly the god of marriage , Hymen , crowning a poet which Bankes attributed to the Italian Renaissance master Tintoretto but whose cracked and varnish - stained condition made expert attribution impossible .
That mystery was solved yesterday when , after a £ 36,000 cleaning and restoration project , the unusual octagonal masterpiece was put on public display for the first time in more than a century and revealed to indeed be the work of the Venetian artist whose dramatic use of light and vigorous energy while at work earned him the nickname " Il Furioso " .
The National Trust unveiled the restored painting at Kingston Lacy , the ancestral seat of the Bankes family which was transformed by William in the first half of the 19th Century as he travelled Europe and the Middle East exploring his passions for Ancient Egypt , fine art and high - end souvenir shopping .
The flamboyant aristocrat also achieved something of a reputation for enjoying himself : his friend and fellow dilettante Lord Byron described him as " the father of all mischief " .
Kingston Lacy was renovated in a flamboyant Renaissance style by the architect Sir Charles Barry , designer of the Houses of Parliament and a friend of Bankes who set about achieving his client 's instructions : " I found it brick and left it marble . "
The 450 - year - old Tintoretto , which was entitled Apollo and the Muses when it was bought by Bankes in Italy in 1849 , hung in the dining room until it was acquired by the Trust in 1981 , by which stage the painting was in such poor condition that it had to be placed in storage until the funds could be raised for a full restoration .
Work by experts at the Hamilton Kerr Institute , in Cambridge , to lift nearly 500 years of dirt , varnish and retouching has now revealed the picture in its full glory , confirming that it is one of the few Tintorettos to be held outside Italy .
Alastair Laing , the Trust 's curator of pictures and sculpture , said : " This is undoubtedly a work of great significance – Titian , Veronese and Tintoretto are the three great masters of the mid-to - late 16th century Venice .
To have a painting by Tintoretto in an English house , rather than still in its original location in Venice or in an Italian museum is extraordinary . "
Despite settling the matter of the authorship of the painting , its restoration has had the unusual side effect of opening up a number of questions about its subject matter .
The 8ft10 by 7ft9 canvas , which dates from the 1560s or 1570s , depicts a central figure , either Apollo or Hymen , crowning an androgynous figure while surrounded by several characters from mythology .
But the work seems to have been mistitled Apollo and the Muses because rather than featuring nine of the goddesses ruling the arts and sciences , it has just seven attending figures and a number of unexplained objects , including a single die with five dots and a gold cup , dish , box and steeple beneath Apollo 's feet .
The Trust is asking the public to offer explanations for Tintoretto 's symbolism .
Christine Sitwell , a painting conservation adviser , said : " The cleaning process has revealed the sheer quality and energy of Tintoretto and how he worked , but we are still baffled as to some of the content of the painting . "
Quite what William Bankes thought of his acquisition once it was returned to England has gone unrecorded .
The Cambridge - educated Egyptologist , whose meticulous drawings and descriptions form the only historical record of some inscriptions and monuments since lost to history , left Britain for Italy exile in 1841 after he was caught have a gay fling with a guardsman in a London park .
Ah , the World Cup .

And an occasion , too , to watch on YouTube , over and over , the utterly baffling ways this moment can be represented in advertising .

The matches are but a week away , and already there is much rejoicing in the streets naked .
In the case of this truly bizarre commercial for Nando's , a South African restaurant chain , the universalism of naked flesh is offered as a knowing ( kind of not really ) play on how the rest of the world might perceive Africa through National Geographic - branded glasses :
That was disturbing .
Probably no more so than Argentina boss Diego Maradona 's madman threats to circle Buenos Aires ' famed Obelisk sans pants should his absurdly striker - rich squad bring home the trophy .
Presumably in this *.
For Maradona 's sake , we hope his victory lap around the Obelisk will not climax in a recreation of this .

The planet - hunting space telescope , Kepler , released its first big batch of data today .
That should be exciting , but the team held back the good stuff until February 2011 , wanting to analyze and follow up on the early observations themselves .
Kepler is trying to find Earth - like planets that exist at just the right distance from their home stars to retain water in liquid form .
Of the 156,000 target stars in the telescope 's field of vision , the 43 days of observations found 706 possible extrasolar planets from Earth size up to a bit bigger than Jupiter .
Today , the NASA Ames Research Center crew , led by William Borucki , released data on the 306 targets they 're least excited about .
Their top 400 candidates to investigate as possible Earth twins will not be announced for eight more months .
" Many of the candidates are likely to be false positives and the brighter stars , and those with the small - size candidates ... are among the 400 withheld targets and are thus not among those considered here , biasing the results toward the dimmer stars and larger candidates , " Borucki wrote in an article posted to arXiv.org .
The data release plan was approved earlier this year by a special NASA advisory board , but has recently touched off controversy over its fairness and wisdom .
Without all the data in hand , it 's hard to answer the question that Kepler was built to answer :
How common are planets like Earth ?
Though we now know hundreds of exoplanets , most of them are big , hot Jupiters around very bright stars that could not sustain any kind of life that we recognize .
It 's easy to detect the bigger planets that orbit close to their stars because their gravity makes the star " wobble " more noticeably and their size dims its light more .
So , the data we 've collected on extrasolar planets over the last two decades is muddied by observation bias .
Borucki's mission , which he pushed for over decades before finally getting funding , is like a stellar census that may reshape our notions about the prevalence of life and the habitability of the universe .
By figuring out how many Earth - like planets exist , we will have a much better idea about some key variables in the Drake equation , which attempts to describe the likelihood of finding intelligent life .
The mission is complicated by the fact that it finds planets by monitoring stars that periodically dim when planets cross in front of them .
For us to see that happening from our solar system , we have to be very precisely aligned with the other star and planet .
And we may have to wait a very long time for a planet like Earth to orbit its star twice :
Alien astronomers would have to wait two years to observe our planet transiting the sun twice .
" If we were to assume that every star had an Earth - like planet in an Earth - like orbit , the likelihood we could see it is half of a percent , " said Charles Sobeck , a systems engineer at NASA Ames and the deputy project manager of the Kepler mission .
" You not only have to have it lined up , the star has to be bright enough too . "

to accurately predicting the size of earthquake - induced tsunamis .
Tsunamis are generated when an earthquake or underwater landslide displaces a large amount of water ; only when that displaced water reaches shore does it turn into large waves .
When an 8.8 - magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Chile on Feb. 27 , scientists predicted that waves as high as 12 feet could hit Hawaiian shores ; only 12 - inch waves actually materialized .
" Magnitude is just a proxy for how big [ an earthquake ] is , " says Brian Shiro , a geophysicist at NOAA 's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center .
" It 's tough to say how that translates to movement on the seafloor . "
Because of the sheer size of the earthquake , Shiro says , a Pacific - wide warning was issued right away , before the typical models that predict the size of a tsunami — which use combined readings from deep ocean monitoring buoys and shore - based sea - level gauges — could even be run .
( Hawaii residents completely evacuated to higher ground . )
The first models predicted the 12 - foot waves ; a second model , obtained when more data became available , was right on at 12 inches , Shiro says .
A prototype detection system developed by scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory more accurately predicted the size of the tsunami much more quickly , without the need for buoy feedback .
The system used data from JPL's Global Differential GPS ( GDGPS ) network , which measures the ground movements — down to a few centimeters — of hundreds of regional and local GPS sites every second .
The method allows scientists to estimate the amount of energy an undersea earthquake transfers to the ocean to create a tsunami .
The ground motion of the Feb. 27 quake was captured by a GDGPS station 146 miles from the quake 's epicenter .
Based on the GPS data — provided to scientists within minutes of the quake — the system predicted that a moderate local tsunami would be generated by the quake , with minimal effects in the Pacific ; the result was confirmed using sea surface height measurements from altimetry satellites .
" This successful test demonstrates that coastal GPS systems can effectively be used to predict the size of tsunamis , " team leader Y. Tony Song said in a press release .
" This could allow responsible agencies to issue better warnings that can save lives and reduce false alarms that can unnecessarily disturb the lives of coastal residents . "
Yoaz Bar - Sever , manager of the GDGPS system , says that scientists were fortunate to have a station close to the epicenter , which helped them get accurate results quickly .
" Broad international collaboration is required to densify the GPS tracking network , " he said , " so that it adequately covers all the fault zones that can give rise to large earthquakes around the world . "
NOAA 's deep ocean buoys and shore - based sea - level gauges are no longer the most accurate tsunami- detectors in town .

At least 28 people were killed and 169 others wounded this evening in a pair of suicide attacks against a major Shi’ite mosque in the city of Zahedan , the capital of Iran ’s Sistan - Balochistan Province .
The death toll is said to have included a number of members of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard .
Jundallah , a militant separatist group that at one point was tied with al - Qaeda , but has more recently been linked with the US government , claimed credit for the attack , saying it was revenge for the execution of their leader , Abdulmalek Rigi , last month .
Iran was quick to blame the US for the latest attack , since US officials have repeatedly acknowledged providing “ support and encouragement ” to the group , which has been launching terror attacks in Iran and Pakistan for years .
The attack is eerily similar to a previous strike in Zahedan in May 2009 , which also involved suicide bombers attacking worshipers at the Shi’ite mosque in the largely Sunni province .
Jundallah claimed that attack as well .
It might take awhile to get it , but the payoff is worth it .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Verizon Wireless could be prepared to follow AT&T Inc's T.N lead and change how it charges wireless subscribers to download data -- but analysts say other carriers may be better served by standing their ground in the latest pricing upheaval .

AT&T ’s move on Wednesday to halve mobile data fees for most customers -- but eliminate its unlimited data plan and make heavy users pay more -- created a rash of speculation about what rivals would do .
None have revealed their plans .
Analysts are betting that U.S. market leader Verizon Wireless , owned by Verizon Communications VZ.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L , will react by cutting its prices at the low end .
It will also pull its unlimited service to help it manage network capacity .
But AT&T 's next - biggest rivals -- Sprint Nextel S.N and T - Mobile USA , a unit of Deutsche Telekom DTEGn .DE -- are more likely to maintain their unlimited plans , allowing customers to surf the Web as much as they want for a fixed price .
Gartner analyst Phillip Redman said that Sprint Nextel and T - Mobile , because they have been losing subscribers , have more spare network capacity and can therefore lure away any customers that want to stick with unlimited plans .
Both operators , however , may still introduce new low - end plans to match AT&T ’s price cut .
“ T- Mobile USA and Sprint are in the same boat .
I do n’t see them changing their top end plans , ” Redman said .
“ But they will need to on the low end . ”
Verizon Wireless , by contrast , has greater incentive to pull back on its unlimited plan , Nielsen wireless specialist Roger Entner said .
“ The one that has probably to move the quickest is Verizon ... they ’re growing and their data consumption is growing substantially , ” Entner said .
Verizon executives have already discussed the likelihood of moving away from unlimited plans after the operator kicks off service late this year on a high - speed network it is building .
Some analysts said Verizon Wireless may wait until it launches the new service to pull away from unlimited pricing .
But it will react very soon if AT&T ’s cheapest plan gains ground .
“ Verizon is very quick to respond , ” Entner said .
“ If they see in their numbers that the AT&T price change is moving customers to AT&T and away from Verizon , then they ’ll follow . ”
The end of unlimited pricing is seen helping profit margins at AT&T and any rivals who follow suit .
For instance , AT&T ’s new $ 25 plan for 2 gigabytes of data represents a $ 5 per month revenue cut per user .
Yet it will be cheaper for AT&T to support 2 gigabytes of data than unlimited services , which have put a massive strain on its network .
Charles Golvin from Forrester Research said AT&T ’s $ 15 plan looks even better from a profit standpoint because it involves supporting 10 times less data than the 2 gigabyte plan .
“ The margins are considerably higher for that plan , ” he said .
While many commentators complained bitterly about the new service pricing , analysts say that it is actually good news for all but the heaviest smartphone data users , which AT&T says represent just 2 percent of customers .
Entner said that on average smartphone users roughly tripled their data downloads in the past year .
Even if usage keeps growing at this rate , most consumers will save money under the new usage - based AT&T plan , he said .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Ecuador ’s President Rafael Correa said on Monday that Colombia ’s president - elect Juan Manuel Santos could be arrested if he visited Ecuador because of an outstanding Ecuadorean arrest warrant against him .
Correa told Reuters in an interview in Caracas that the arrest warrant against Santos , issued over the 2008 Colombian bombing of FARC guerrilla camps in Ecuador when Santos was Colombian defense minister , still stood and could only be dealt with by his country ’s independent judicial authorities .
“ A crime was committed , ” Correa said , adding he could not interfere in the process .

Lebanon has claimed the latest victory in the continuing battle with Israel over which country can make the largest serving of hummus .
Some 300 chefs set the new record , creating a huge 10 - tonne vat of the chickpea - based dip in Fanar .
That more than doubles the previous record of about four tonnes , set in January by cooks in the Israeli - Arab town of Abu Ghosh near Jerusalem .
Both Lebanese and Israelis claim hummus as a national dish .
A Guinness World Records adjudicator confirmed that Lebanon now held the record .
Hummus is a dip made of chickpeas , olive oil , sesame paste , lemon juice and garlic .
The chefs mixed the ingredients together in a giant plate which itself claimed a record for the largest earthenware dish .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Expanding on work published two years ago , MIT 's Daniel Nocera and his associates have found yet another formulation , based on inexpensive and widely available materials , that can efficiently catalyze the splitting of water molecules using electricity .
This could ultimately form the basis for new storage systems that would allow buildings to be completely independent and self - sustaining in terms of energy :
The systems would use energy from intermittent sources like sunlight or wind to create hydrogen fuel , which could then be used in fuel cells or other devices to produce electricity or transportation fuels as needed .
Nocera , the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy and Professor of Chemistry , says that solar energy is the only feasible long - term way of meeting the world ’s ever - increasing needs for energy , and that storage technology will be the key enabling factor to make sunlight practical as a dominant source of energy .
He has focused his research on the development of less - expensive , more - durable materials to use as the electrodes in devices that use electricity to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water molecules .
By doing so , he aims to imitate the process of photosynthesis , by which plants harvest sunlight and convert the energy into chemical form .
Nocera pictures small - scale systems in which rooftop solar panels would provide electricity to a home , and any excess would go to an electrolyzer — a device for splitting water molecules — to produce hydrogen , which would be stored in tanks .
When more energy was needed , the hydrogen would be fed to a fuel cell , where it would combine with oxygen from the air to form water , and generate electricity at the same time .
An electrolyzer uses two different electrodes , one of which releases the oxygen atoms and the other the hydrogen atoms .
Although it is the hydrogen that would provide a storable source of energy , it is the oxygen side that is more difficult , so that ’s where he and many other research groups have concentrated their efforts .
In a paper in Science in 2008 , Nocera reported the discovery of a durable and low - cost material for the oxygen - producing electrode based on the element cobalt .
Now , in research being reported this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) , Nocera , along with postdoctoral researcher Mircea Dincă and graduate student Yogesh Surendranath , report the discovery of yet another material that can also efficiently and sustainably function as the oxygen - producing electrode .
This time the material is nickel borate , made from materials that are even more abundant and inexpensive than the earlier find .
Even more significantly , Nocera says , the new finding shows that the original compound was not a unique , anomalous material , and suggests that there may be a whole family of such compounds that researchers can study in search of one that has the best combination of characteristics to provide a widespread , long - term energy - storage technology .
“ Sometimes if you do one thing , and only do it once , ” Nocera says , “ you do n’t know — is it extraordinary or unusual , or can it be commonplace ? ”
In this case , the new material “ keeps all the requirements of being cheap and easy to manufacture ” that were found in the cobalt - based electrode , he says , but “ with a different metal that ’s even cheaper than cobalt . ”
The work was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Chesonis Family Foundation .
But the research is still in an early stage .
“ This is a door opener , ” Nocera says .
“ Now , we know what works in terms of chemistry .
One of the important next things will be to continue to tune the system , to make it go faster and better .
This puts us on a fast technological path . ”
While the two compounds discovered so far work well , he says , he is convinced that as they carry out further research even better compounds will come to light .
“ I do n’t think we ’ve found the silver bullet yet , ” he says .
Already , as the research has continued , Nocera and his team have increased the rate of production from these catalysts a hundredfold from the level they initially reported two years ago .
John Turner , a research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado , calls this a nice result , but says that commercial electrolyzers already exist that have better performance than these new laboratory versions .
“ The question then is under what circumstances would this system provide some advantage over the existing commercial systems , ” he says .
For large - scale deployment of solar fuel - producing systems , he says , “ the big commercial electrolyzers use concentrated alkali for their electrolyte , which is OK in an industrial setting were engineers know how to handle the stuff safely ; but when we are talking about thousands of square miles of solar water - splitting arrays , and individual homeowners , then an alternative electrolyte like this benign borate solution may be more viable . ”
The original discovery has already led to the creation of a company , called Sun Catalytix , that aims to commercialize the system in the next two years .
And his research program was recently awarded a major grant from the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Advanced Research Projects Agency — Energy .

Llevamos cinco días de Mundial y por ahora los grandes protagonistas han sido los porteros .
Ni grandes sorpresas ni goles remarcables , sólo unas cuantas cagadas más propias de infantiles que de porteros profesionales nos han salvado de un arranque soporífero .
Por eso una vez más lo mejor del fútbol tenemos que ir a buscarlo fuera del terreno de juego , concretamente a esa web capaz de retratar a una joven alemana de tan solo 44 kilos como de proponer a sus mejores modelos que se dejen la piel por sus equipos en épocas mundialistas .

Oakland has become the first city to authorize large - scale industrial cultivation of marijuana .
The City Council voted Tuesday in favor of a plan to license four factories where marijuana would be grown and packaged for medical use .
The facilities would not be limited in size , but would be heavily taxed and regulated .
Supporters of the measure say it would create jobs and bring in millions of dollars to the city .
Opponents say it will put small growers out of business .
Officials at the American Embassy and in the United States - led coalition force said they could not comment on specific cases .
Several e-mail messages and telephone calls to Sarah Lee , the president of Bennett - Fouch , the company offices and other employees were not answered , and Ms. Lee did not return three messages left on the voice mail of her number in the United States .
Lt. Col. Michael T. Lawhorn , a senior military public affairs officer in Afghanistan , said previous reports of Afghan companies not being paid for contracted work had turned out to be problems of incomplete or improperly filed paperwork .
Officials with the Afghan companies said they believed that they had been cheated .
Two foreigners working in southern Afghanistan who were familiar with Bennett - Fouch said its managers had left Afghanistan owing Afghan companies up to $ 5 million .
One who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the company was using money owed to subcontractors to set up a sister company , K5 Global ; the military official said Bennett - Fouch ran into trouble after a concrete and asphalt batching plant it bought in Afghanistan failed because of poor construction .
“ The subcontractors out here are very unlikely to be able to hire an attorney in the U.S. , and thus the chances of seeing any payment is really zero , ” the ISAF military official said .
As the United States military contingent in Afghanistan rises to nearly 100,000 troops , millions of dollars are being spent to expand the military bases and build extra forward operating bases , as well as training centers , bases and outposts for the expanding Afghan Army and police forces .
The bulk of the construction work is handled by American companies who frequently subcontract to one or more layers of smaller companies .
BUKAVU , EASTERN CONGO
The heart of darkness , in one boy ’s story , is a human organ eaten raw .
“ When you kill a Tutsi , you remove his heart and mix it with special potions , like a medicine , ’’ explains Popy Matenda , rather blandly .
“ Other parts of the body can be eaten too but the heart is special .
It gives you the strength of the person you killed , like you are sucking in his spirit .
It ’s a kind of magic . ’’
A reporter , listening to this macabre tale , scoffs .
It sounds like the fanciful invention of an over - active imagination , or the brazen lies of a teenage boy ; akin to telling ghost stories ‘ round the campfire .
Except Matenda , and the other youths with him this afternoon , are all residents of a child soldier repatriation facility in Bukavu , rescued from the bush .
The compound is situated behind a tall red - brick wall topped off with razor wire , from which laundry hangs drying .
No sign at the gate identifies the humanitarian agency that runs the place or who lives inside — though everybody in town is aware of its tenants and will cross the road to avoid the boys when they loiter out front .
They fear them .
Cannibalism is the dirty secret of the Congo , an historical fact — the Pygmy Peoples most ruthlessly targeted — yet also , in the modern era , a grisly consequence of ongoing guerrilla warfare among rebel groups .
The practice has been confirmed by field workers for aid organizations and is the subject of several reports released by Human Rights Watch .
Given the deep - rooted Congolese belief in sorcery and magic , it should probably come as no surprise that Mai - Mai tribal warriors and rebel fighters who ’ve survived in the jungle for years —
Hutu and Tutsi guerrillas still preying on each other in an imported war — would adopt the ritual of devouring one ’s enemies .
It ’s really about instilling fear in the populace and submission in abducted children .
Kidnapped kids might not be kept forever — their adult commanders frequently leave the youngest behind when they flee from pursuing government troops — but the children will never really be able to go home again .
For them , childhood is a distant country that ca n’t be revisited .
“ It did n’t make me sick or anything , eating humans , ’’ continues 15 - year - old Matenda as he slurps up a cola , when what he ’d really wanted was a whiskey .
“ You could n’t even taste the flesh because it was all ground up with the medicine .
“ But , yeah , I ’m sorry now that I did it , that I ate people . ’’
He does n’t look sorry .
He does n’t look like he ’s lying either .
But how to tell with teenagers in general and these , rescued from indenture to savage men , in particular ?
Matenda was abducted when he was 9 by a Mai - Mai cadre whose leader , Gen .
Yanzi , took a special shine to the child , or so the youth tells it .
“ He made me chief escort , ’’ Matenda claims proudly .
Then , less boastfully , adds : “ I grew up fast . ’’
At the Mai -Mai camp , deep in the wilderness , Matenda was taught how to load and shoot a Kalashnikov , how to escape quickly through heavily concealed footpaths when threatened by the Congolese Army or rival factions and , by puberty , how to rape little girls stolen from their villages .
Abductees , says Matenda , were kept docile with alcohol and drugs .
Two months ago , he slipped up and was caught by regular army soldiers , handed over to child soldier reintegration specialists and brought to this facility in Bukavu .
Whatever violence was done to him by his abductors , Matenda has no desire to recount .
His new friend , Prince Jamarie — at least , that ’s the name he gives — is not so reluctant to describe the physical abuse he absorbed in six years with a Hutu Mai - Mai group .
“ I was in primary school but not a very clever student , ’’ he admits of his former 10 - year - old self .
“ So I took a job as a porter at the market in my town .
The Mai -Mai came and ordered me and two other boys to carry their big sacks and crates back to their camp .
They forced us to do this for them .
“ When we got to their base , they put me in a pigsty for three days with my arms tied behind my back .
Every day they would come in and beat me .
They would n’t give me any food .
On the fourth day , a man pointed his gun at me and said , you can either work for us or I can kill you — which do you choose ? ’’
There was no choice .
Like other child soldiers , Jamarie was indoctrinated into the Mai -Mai subculture , trained on weapons and instructed on village - looting .
As a rite of passage , he too was given girl slaves for sex .
“ They were not very good workers .
Girls always cry and get sick .
Then we ’d leave them behind . ’’
A Congolese Banyanga by ethnicity , Jamarie has absorbed the Hutu revulsion for Tutsis .
“ I hate Tutsis .
They came here from Rwanda and took our land .
Okay , some of them were born here but they ’re still Tutsis and they should all be killed .
I have no pity for them . ’’
Jamarie has been at the facility for only two weeks .
It ’s unclear how he came to be rescued except that he ended up first at a transit station run by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees .
Jamarie says he would now like to go home .
“ I ’m sure my parents will be very happy to see me .
We will hug each other and they will be so amazed that I ’m still alive .
Parents do n’t ever stop loving their children , even if they ’ve done bad things . ’’

Another 16 - year - old , Bahati Cerish , recounts his own wretchedly similar narrative — abducted at 12 while on his way to school in the village of Kavumo , kept shackled and tied to a tree , scared out of his skin .
“ When they untied me , they said I could run but they would shoot me down .
They said , ‘ What makes you think you ’re so special ?
You ’re no better than us . ’
They beat me with their belts . ’’
Resistance , as they say , was futile .
To his own surprise , Cerish became , he says , a good fighter , though never quite understanding who they were fighting against except the gunfire skirmishes were frequent and the pillaging of villages even more so .
He rolls up his trouser leg to show where he was struck by a bullet .
“ But I killed many enemies . ’’
Within a year of his abduction , Cerish was put in charge of a dozen younger children .
“ It was like graduating up to a higher class . ’’
Cerish claims he sneaked away from the group after deciding he ’d had enough of living in the jungle and that , by then , he knew his way through the wilderness .
He ran to a Congolese army encampment .
Finally , there ’s Riziki Sloyamungu , also 16 but small for his age .
What was distinct about his abduction at 13 was that it came , he says , at the hands of government troops , regular army soldiers .
Being gang - pressed into army service is a not infrequent occurrence in the Congo , where widespread desertion means that companies replenish themselves by force from the local population .
“ They came right into the church in my village , Shabunda , and took away 10 of us , ’’ says Sloyamungu .
“ The priest did n’t even try to stop them . ’’
There was a lot of fighting the first two years , he continues , less later on .
A double - scar on his neck shows where a bullet went through - and - through .
Sloyamungu explains he was “ demobilized ’’ late last year when UN troops forced his unit to release all their underage soldiers .
At the facility in Bukavu , he learned that both his parents had been killed in the years he was away .
But Sloyamungu has two brothers and four sisters he would like to rejoin , if officials can find them .
They ’re likely in a displacement camp .
Asked what he wants to do next with his interrupted life , the teenager says : “ Go back to school .
Become a doctor . ’’
There is as much chance of that happening as flying to the moon .
But that these boys are even here now , sipping Coke and slapping each other in the way of male teenagers , is almost as much of a miracle .
They ’ve been to the dark side and come back .
Conservative politicians in the US — and elsewhere — get a lot of mileage from appeals to false nostalgia , to a yearning for a time when things were simpler , everyone was sturdily self - sufficient or knew their place ( or both ) , and government was small ( sometimes small enough to drown in a bathtub ) .
Nostalgia trips manifest themselves in all sorts of curious places .
In SF ( the literary field I know most about ) we have the perennial libertarian / space colonization nexus .
We have Ayn Rand , and her wish - fulfilment nerd fantasy of a world sustained by a tiny , overworked minority of geniuses who , if only they could demand a level of rewards corresponding to their work , would be rich beyond dreams of avarice ( and able to make the trains run on time ) .
Outside it , we have the peculiarly rustic aspirations of the green fringe , who'd like to see a world of five million or so pre-industrial humans living in harmony with nature .
In the Republican party of the United States we see rhetoric couched in hatred for " big government " , and among the UK 's conservatives we see an almost masochistic addiction to cuts in public spending framed with calls for a big society in which many current government services will be delivered by voluntary citizens groups instead .
I think these ideas are mostly delusional because they rely on a fundamental misapprehension about the world around us — namely that we live in a society that can be made simple enough to comprehend .
Let 's take a look at the superficial structures around us .
How many people does it take to design a new automobile ?
Back in Henry Ford 's day , it needed an office full of draughtsmen , a handle of senior engineers to sort out each major mechanical subsystem ( gear train , engine , electrics , brakes , suspension , bodywork ) , and experts on coachbuilding to dictate the shape of the bodywork .
There would be time and motion men to dictate the speed and sequence of assembly line activities , and more drafting work to design the tools the production line workers would use ... it took the effort of a few hundred men .
But modern cars are different .
A typical 2010 automobile may contain roughly 20 - 30 electric motors and actuators ( for everything from the central locking system to the air conditioning and the motorized seats and windows ) .
There 's a similar number of microprocessors involved in everything from the engine and gearbox management systems to the entertainment , navigation , communication , and accident mitigation systems ( for example , the sensors and microprocessors that control the sequence of pyrotechnic detonators that inflate air bags , tension seat belts , and collapse the steering column in event of a collision ) .
The in - car electronics alone require on the order of 10 - 20 million lines of code to run all these services — which implies the combined efforts of thousands of software developers , never mind the small army who design not only the body panels but the handling tools the production line robots use to install them .
Cars are no longer user - serviceable because they 're nearly as complex as 1960s airliners .
And as for your smartphone ?
The damned thing has a component count somewhere between ten major subsystems and frame components and a hundred billion ( if you go down to the smallest scale and count the capacitors in its FLASH memory ) .
The number of fab lines on the planet that can make memory chips of that density is limited , and they rely on rare elements mined only in exotic locations and in tiny abundance .
Medicine : let 's not go there .
Back in the late 19th century , we had doctors , nurses , surgeons , pharmacists , and dentists .
Today , each of those professions has exploded into platoons and battalions of sub- specialities , and their roles are supported in turn by complex industries full of strange niches .
Around 1900 , it took the effort of about 20 - 30 % of a nation 's work - force to provide food for everybody ; and another 30 - 50 % working in factories to produce clothing , machinery , and processed materials like bricks and billets of pig iron .
Today , we only need 0.5 - 1 % of the work force to feed everyone , and another 1 - 4 % working in industry to produce the basics — but the microspecialities have exploded , to the extent that a lot of our needs seem to require a trans-national economy to provide .
There are only two vendors of wide - body airliners on any scale today , Boeing and Airbus , and both of them are effectively multinational consortia ( more than half the components of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are produced overseas , and shipped to Seattle for final assembly ) .
There seems to only be room for one vendor of super - Jumbo airliners — if Boeing and Airbus tried to exploit that niche simultaneously , they 'd both starve — so they appear to be avoiding conflict in that ( and some other ) area( s ) .
And so on .
So .
I ask : how many people does it take , as a minimum , to maintain our current level of technological civilization ?
I 'd put an upper bound of about one billion on the range , because that encompasses basically the entire population of NAFTA and the EU , with Japan , Taiwan , and the industrial enterprise zones of China thrown in for good measure .
( While China is significant , more than half of its population is still agrarian , hence not providing inputs to this system ) .
I 'd put a lower bound of 100 million on the range , too .
The specialities required for a civil aviation sector alone may well run to half a million people ; let 's not underestimate the needs of raw material extraction and processing ( from crude oil to yttrium and lanthanum ) , of a higher education / research sector to keep training the people we need in order to replenish small pools of working expertise , and so on .
Hypothetically , we may only need 500 people in one particular niche , but that means training 20 of them a year to keep the pool going , plus future trainers , and an allowance for wastage and drop - outs by people who made a bad career choice .
Higher education accounts for 1.8 - 3 % of gross spending in the developed world , with primary and secondary education taking a whopping chunk on top of that ( if you spent 10 years in a school with a staff : pupil ratio of 1:10 , then you soaked up a person - year of time ; there may be more labour going into pre-university education than goes into agriculture and industry combined ) .
As to those political implications ...
Firstly : no , you can't simplify a complex society that runs on just - in - time delivery and a host of specialities .
You need a huge training back - end to provide for the thousands of skilled graduate - entry niche occupations .
You need an efficient just - in - time delivery system to keep everyone supplied with food , water , power , shelter and whatever else they need — it 's that , or accept huge inefficiencies in your supply chain that wipe out the gains produced elsewhere .
Secondly , seemingly similar artefacts ( cars , phones , airliners ) have invisibly accreted complexity .
The complexity makes them better ( safer , more economical , more luxurious ) than their predecessors , but vastly more difficult to engineer ; stuff that used to be fixable by shade - tree mechanics and jobbing electricians has receded over the horizon .
Back in the early 19th century , the complement of a sailing ship could expect to maintain the ship in every significant way using tools and expertise that they could carry aboard the ship .
Today in the early 21st century , that 's not an option with airliners or probably even automobiles .
Thirdly , the complexity embodies in these new products means that their production is dependent on a complex web of lower - level specialities .
Fourthly , there are more side - effects to keep track of .
Exotic materials mean exotic contamination events from waste dumping , for example .
Fifthly : space colonization ?
Get back to me when you 've tracked down how many people it takes to design and build a space suit .
( The number is in the hundreds , if not the thousands . )
More realistically , we wo n't have autonomous off - world colonies unless and until they can cover all the numerous specialities of the complex civilization that spawned the non-autonomous , dependent - on - resupply space program .
Or , to put it another way : colonizing Mars might well be practical , but only if we can start out by plonking a hundred million people down there .

I started working when I was 14 ( I lied about my age ) and counting four years in the Air Force I ’ve worked in 12 jobs .
I left each one of them when I was bored , ready to move on , got fired , or learned as much as I can .
There was only one job that I quit when I feared for my life .
Life Is Good
The Vietnam War had just ended and I was out of the Air Force back in college living in Ann Arbor Michigan .
Colors other than olive green or camouflage slowly seeped back in my life as “ Yes sir , and no sir ” faded away .
Unlike my previous attempt at college as a pre-med , four years working with electronics convinced me that perhaps I ought to study engineering .
Civilian life was good , the government was paying my tuition and I got a college work / study job in the University of Michigan physics department .
After a few weeks , the Physics lab staff realized I knew something about repairing electronics ( you try fixing a sodium - iodide scintillation detector without a manual . )
I got asked , “ Would you like to work at the nuclear reactor ? ” I thought they were joking .
“ The university has its own nuclear reactor ? ”
Oh man , something really new to learn .
“ Heck yes , sign me up . ”
Nuclear Reactors on Campus
Starting in 1953 the U.S. built over a 150 research reactors .
Much smaller than the ~500 - 1,500 megawatt nuclear reactors that generate electricity , by the late 1960s these 1 to 10 megawatt reactors were in 58 U.S. universities .
In addition , 40 foreign countries got research reactors in exchange for a commitment to not develop nuclear weapons .
( But these reactors used weapons grade Uranium - 235 for their cores , and by the late 1970 ’s we realized it was n’t a good idea to be shipping highly enriched uranium overseas . )
My first day in the reactor electronics lab I got a lecture from the health physics department .
I was given a film - badge ( a dosimeter to measure whole body radiation ) and taught how to use the hand and foot monitors ( to prevent radioactive contamination from spreading outside the containment dome . )
Scram
Lots of things could go wrong in a nuclear reactor – loss of cooling , power failure , jammed control rods , reactor power excursions , etc .
While a reactor failure can’t create a nuclear explosion , if its core is uncovered long enough it can generate enough heat to melt itself , with all kind of nasty consequences ( see Three Mile Island and Chernobyl . )
To “ scram ” a reactor means an emergency shutdown by inserting neutron - absorbing control rods into the core .
This stops the nuclear chain reaction .
My job in the reactor electronics lab was to rebuild the reactor “ scram system . ”
The scram system had three parts : the mechanical part ( the control rod drives and electromagnetic latches ) , the electronic part ( comparators circuits and trip logic ) , and the sensors ( to measure neutron flux , core temperature , pool water level , etc . )
The 20 - year old electronics in our existing scram system were based on vacuum tubes and had the annoying habit of scramming the reactor every time a thunderstorm was nearby .
And summertime in the Midwest has lots of thunderstorms .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission had approved a transistorized version of the electronics .
My job was to build the approved design , retrofit it into the existing power supplies and integrate it with the existing mechanical systems and sensors .
But first I was going to see the reactor .
Cerenkov radiation
Over time I would get used to visiting the reactor , but the first visit was awe - inspiring .
Entering the containment building through the air lock , my eyes took a few seconds to adjust to the dim light .
The first thing I saw was a gigantic mural of the earth rising over the moon painted on the side of the dome .
After another few seconds I realized that the mural was illuminated by an unearthly blue glow coming from what looked like a swimming pool below it .
My eyes followed the source of the light down to to the pool and there I first saw the 2 MW nuclear reactor in the bottom of the swimming pool – and it was generating its own light .
When I could tear my eyes from the pool I noticed that in the far end of the building was a glass wall separating a room bathed in red light , where the reactor operators sat at their console .
The lab manager let me stand there for a while as I caught my breath .
Hollywood could n’t have set the scene better .
As we walked towards the pool I learned that the bright blue light was Cerenkov radiation from the reactor core ( electrons moving faster than the speed of light in water polarizing the water molecules , which when they turned back to their ground state , emitted photons . )
We briefly walked across a bridge that spanned the pool and stood directly over the core of the reactor .
Wow .
They were going to pay me for this ?
Dose Roulette
Over the next few weeks , as I began work on the scram system , I got to know the control room operators and others on the staff .
Most of them were ex-Navy reactor technicians or officers .
They had been around nukes for years and were bemused to find an ex Air Force guy among them .
One of their weekly rituals was to read the bulletin board for the results of the dosimeter readings .
Since most of my time was spent outside the containment dome my radiation exposure numbers were always zero .
But there was a bizarre culture of “ you ’re not a real man until you glow in the dark ” among the ex-Navy crew .
They would celebrate whoever got the highest dose of the week by making them buy the beer for the rest .
After spending the last four years around microwaves I had become attuned to things that you could n’t see but could hurt you .
In the Air Force I had watched my shop mates not quite understand that principle .
On the flightline they would test whether a jamming pod was working by putting their hand on the antenna .
If their hand felt warm they declared it was .
When I tried to explain that the antenna was n’t warm , but it was the microwaves cooking their hand , they did n’t believe me .
There were no standards for microwave protection .
( I always wondered if the Air Force would ever do a study of the incidence of cataracts among radar technicians . )
You Buy The Beer
In a few months I had the new scram system ready for debugging .
This required connecting the new electronics to the neutron detectors in the pool that monitored the core .
We timed this for the regular downtime when used fuel elements were swapped out and they had lowered the pool water level for easier installation .
I remember standing on the bridge right over the reactor core watching as the reactor techs remotely connected up the cables to my electronics .
I leaned over the bridge to get a better look .
By now the reactor was so familiar that I did n’t think twice of where I was standing .
A week later as I was about to enter the dome , I heard someone congratulate me and ask when I was going to buy the beer .
They were pointing to the Health / Safety printout on the wall .
In one week I had managed to get close to my annual allowable radiation dose ( ~5 rems ? ) .
In my mandatory talk with the the safety officer to figure out where I got exposed , I remembered hanging out over the core on the bridge .
The heavy water in the pool was both a moderator and a radiation shield .
With the pool level lowered I should n’t have been on the bridge .
I had been in the wrong place at the wrong time .
“ Do n’t do it again ” was his advice .
Career Choices
That week I finished up the installation and resigned from the lab .
While the radiation dose I received was unlikely to effect my health , the cumulative effect of four years of microwaves and the potential for more unexpected “ winning the dosimetery lottery ” convinced me to consider alternate jobs in electronics .
In some sense my career in startups was steered by deciding to avoid future jobs with gamma rays or high - power microwaves .
But I sure learned a lot about nuclear reactors .
— — — ——
–
Postscript : a year and a half after I left , the power reactor at Three Mile Island had a core meltdown .
For years I would worry and wonder if I had wired my scram system correctly .
Lessons Learned
Things you ca n’t see can hurt you ( microwaves , gamma rays , toxic bosses . )
No job is worth your health .
If it seems dangerous or stupid it probably is .
Rules and regulations wo n’t stop all possible mistakes .
No one but you will tell you it ’s time to quit .

Data at Rest vs. Data in Motion
For a while now , I ’ve pointed out that cryptography is singularly ill - suited to solve the major network security problems of today : denial - of - service attacks , website defacement , theft of credit card numbers , identity theft , viruses and worms , DNS attacks , network penetration , and so on .
Cryptography was invented to protect communications : data in motion .
This is how cryptography was used throughout most of history , and this is how the militaries of the world developed the science .
Alice was the sender , Bob the receiver , and Eve the eavesdropper .
Even when cryptography was used to protect stored data — data at rest — it was viewed as a form of communication .
In “ Applied Cryptography , ” I described encrypting stored data in this way : “ a stored message is a way for someone to communicate with himself through time . ”
Data storage was just a subset of data communication .
In modern networks , the difference is much more profound .
Communications are immediate and instantaneous .
Encryption keys can be ephemeral , and systems like the STU - III telephone can be designed such that encryption keys are created at the beginning of a call and destroyed as soon as the call is completed .
Data storage , on the other hand , occurs over time .
Any encryption keys must exist as long as the encrypted data exists .
And storing those keys becomes as important as storing the unencrypted data was .
In a way , encryption does n’t reduce the number of secrets that must be stored securely ; it just makes them much smaller .
Historically , the reason key management worked for stored data was that the key could be stored in a secure location : the human brain .
People would remember keys and , barring physical and emotional attacks on the people themselves , would not divulge them .
In a sense , the keys were stored in a “ computer ” that was not attached to any network .
And there they were safe .
This whole model falls apart on the Internet .
Much of the data stored on the Internet is only peripherally intended for use by people ; it ’s primarily intended for use by other computers .
And therein lies the problem .
Keys can no longer be stored in people ’s brains .
They need to be stored on the same computer , or at least the network , that the data resides on .
And that is much riskier .
Let ’s take a concrete example : credit card databases associated with websites .
Those databases are not encrypted because it does n’t make any sense .
The whole point of storing credit card numbers on a website is so it ’s accessible — so each time I buy something , I do n’t have to type it in again .
The website needs to dynamically query the database and retrieve the numbers , millions of times a day .
If the database were encrypted , the website would need the key .
But if the key were on the same network as the data , what would be the point of encrypting it ?
Access to the website equals access to the database in either case .
Security is achieved by good access control on the website and database , not by encrypting the data .
The same reasoning holds true elsewhere on the Internet as well .
Much of the Internet ’s infrastructure happens automatically , without human intervention .
This means that any encryption keys need to reside in software on the network , making them vulnerable to attack .
In many cases , the databases are queried so often that they are simply left in plaintext , because doing otherwise would cause significant performance degradation .
Real security in these contexts comes from traditional computer security techniques , not from cryptography .
Cryptography has inherent mathematical properties that greatly favor the defender .
Adding a single bit to the length of a key adds only a slight amount of work for the defender , but doubles the amount of work the attacker has to do .
Doubling the key length doubles the amount of work the defender has to do ( if that — I ’m being approximate here ) , but increases the attacker ’s workload exponentially .
For many years , we have exploited that mathematical imbalance .
Computer security is much more balanced .
There ’ll be a new attack , and a new defense , and a new attack , and a new defense .
It ’s an arms race between attacker and defender .
And it ’s a very fast arms race .
New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time .
The balance can tip from defender to attacker overnight , and back again the night after .
Computer security defenses are inherently very fragile .
Unfortunately , this is the model we ’re stuck with .
No matter how good the cryptography is , there is some other way to break into the system .
Recall how the FBI read the PGP - encrypted email of a suspected Mafia boss several years ago .
They did n’t try to break PGP ; they simply installed a keyboard sniffer on the target ’s computer .
Notice that SSL - and TLS - encrypted web communications are increasingly irrelevant in protecting credit card numbers ; criminals prefer to steal them by the hundreds of thousands from back - end databases .
On the Internet , communications security is much less important than the security of the endpoints .
And increasingly , we can’t rely on cryptography to solve our security problems .
This essay originally appeared on DarkReading .
I wrote it in 2006 , but lost it on my computer for four years .
I hate it when that happens .
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/14 ) :
As several readers pointed out , I overstated my case when I said that encrypting credit card databases , or any database in constant use , is useless .
In fact , there is value in encrypting those databases , especially if the encryption appliance is separate from the database server .
In this case , the attacker has to steal both the encryption key and the database .
That ’s a harder hacking problem , and this is why credit - card database encryption is mandated within the PCI security standard .
Given how good encryption performance is these days , it ’s a smart idea .
But while encryption makes it harder to steal the data , it is only harder in a computer - security sense and not in a cryptography sense .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A team of U.S. and Chinese physicists are zeroing in on critical effects at the heart of the latest high - temperature superconductors -- but they 're using other materials to do it .
In new research appearing online today in the journal Physical Review Letters , the Rice University - led team offers new evidence about the quantum features of the latest class of high - temperature superconductors , a family of iron - based compounds called " pnictides " ( pronounced : NICK - tides ) .
" In correlated electron systems like the pnictides and their parent compounds , the electrons are caught in a competition between forces , " said Rice physicist Qimiao Si , a co-author of the study .
" On the one hand , they are compelled to move around , and on the other , they are forced to arrange themselves in a particular way because of their desire to repel one another .
In this study , we varied the ratio between these competing forces in an effort to find the tipping point where one takes over from the other . "
The aim of the research is to better understand the processes that lead to high - temperature superconductivity .
If better understood and developed , high - temperature superconductors could revolutionize electric generators , MRI scanners , high - speed trains and other devices .
In today 's wiring , electricity is lost due to resistance and heating .
This happens because electrons bump and ricochet from atom to atom as they pass down wires , and they lose a bit of energy in the form of heat each time they bounce around .
Almost a century ago , physicists discovered materials that could conduct electrons without losing energy to resistance .
These " superconductors " had to be very cold , and it took physicists nearly 50 years to come up with an explanation for them :
The electron - electron repulsion in these low - temperature superconductors was so weak that with the mediation of lattice vibrations , electrons overcame it , paired up and glided freely without the bumping and heating .
That explanation sufficed until 1986 , when physicists discovered new materials that became superconductors at temperatures above 100 kelvins .
These " high - temperature superconductors " were made of layers of copper alloys sandwiched between layers of nonconducting material that were laced , or " doped , " with trace amounts of material that could contribute a few extra electrons to the mix .
Physicists quickly realized their existing theories of superconductivity could not explain what was happening in the new materials .
For one thing , the undoped versions of the compounds did n't conduct electricity at all .
Their electrons -- due to their desire to repel one another -- tended to lock themselves a comfortable distance away from their neighbors .
This locked pattern was dubbed " Mott localization , " which gives rise to an insulating state .
In 2008 , the search for answers took another turn when a second class of high - temperature superconductors was discovered .
Dubbed the pnictides , these new iron - based superconductors were also layered and also needed to be doped .
But unlike their copper cousins , undoped pnictides were not Mott insulators .
" Mott localization does n't occur in the undoped pnictides , but there is considerable evidence that the electrons in these materials are near the point where Mott localization occurs , " Si said .
" This proximity to Mott localization endows the system with strong quantum magnetic fluctuations , which we believe underlie the high - temperature superconductivity in the pnictides . "
In all high - temperature superconductors , the iron or copper atoms in the conducting layers form a grid - like , checkerboard pattern .
In work published earlier this year , Si and colleagues replaced arsenic atoms in one of the intervening layers of a pnictide with slightly smaller phosphorous atoms .
This subtle change brought the iron atoms in the checkerboard a tad closer together , and that changed the amount of energy that was compelling electrons to move between the iron atoms .
The experiments confirmed a 2008 prediction of Si and , University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) theorist Elihu Abrahams , who had predicted that boosting the electrons ' kinetic energy would drive the pnictides further away from the Mott tipping point .
In the latest tests , Si and colleagues at Rice , China 's Zhejiang University , UCLA , Los Alamos National Laboratory and the State University of New York at Buffalo ( SUNY - Buffalo ) sought to move the system in the other direction , toward Mott localization .
" We wanted to decrease the kinetic energy by expanding the distance between iron atoms in the lattice , " said study co-author Jian - Xin Zhu , a theorist from Los Alamos .
" Unfortunately , there is no pnictide material with those properties . "
So the team 's experimentalists , Rice 's Emilia Morosan and Zhejiang 's Minghu Fang , hit upon the idea of substituting a similarly patterned material called an iron oxychalcogenide ( pronounced : OXY - cal - cah - ge - nyde ) .
Like the iron pnictides , iron oxychalcogenides are layered materials .
But compared with the pnictides , the distance between iron atoms is expanded in the oxychalcogenides .
Tests on the new materials confirmed the theoretical predictions of the team ; a slight expansion of the iron lattice pushed the system into a Mott insulating state .
" Our results provide further evidence that the undoped iron pnictide parent compounds are on the verge of Mott localization , " Abrahams said .

People who lack friends and relationships are just as likely to risk an early death as heavy drinkers and smokers .
A new study by US researchers came up with the surprising findings after reviewing more than 140 medical articles involving more than 300,000 people .
The study found that people with a good social network have a 50 per cent chance of living longer than those with poor or insufficient social relationships .
The findings were published today in the Public Library of Science Medicine .
Lead researcher Professor Timothy Smith , from Brigham Young University in Utah , says scientists have known that social support does predict mortality for several decades .
" What 's new about our research is that we 've summarised 148 medical research studies that now conclusively provide evidence for that finding , " he said .
" In our study we compared [ loneliness ] to being twice the risk of being obese , about being twice the risk of not exercising physically when you should and about equivalent to being alcoholic . "
He says that result was very surprising .
" We 've known that clearly relationships have to do with our wellbeing and happiness but the fact that it predicts our physical health to that extent is remarkable , " he said .
" The research studies that we reviewed defined [ social isolation ] in many ways .
" They looked at the size of the networks , the density of the networks as well as the quality of the networks and sort of self perceived levels of social support .
And it turns out that all of those were equally predictive . "
Professor Smith says there are many factors involved that explain why relationships are linked to mortality .
" It 's kind of like a spiral , both positive and negative , " he said .
" When you have a great marriage , you tend to be happier ; you tend to treat your children more positively .
Oppositely when you 're depressed you take less well care of yourself and so you 're not functioning as well , so it 's a cycle in both the positive and negative direction .
" For public health officials it 's time now that social factors made it to the short list of factors to consider in terms of risk for mortality . "
The study recommends that social wellbeing becomes something doctors evaluate as seriously as diet , smoking and exercise .
The authors suggest hospitals could make patient support networks an integral part of a patient 's treatment plan .
THE hot dry weather is revealing some of Oxfordshire ’s Bronze Age history normally hidden from view .
Hot air balloon pilot Michael Wolf , of Reading Road , Wallingford , was training another pilot near North Stoke when they spotted several dark circles in a farmer ’s field .
Crops had grown at different speeds because of ancient ditches hidden beneath the soil which once surrounded prehistoric burial mounds .
The site dates back 3,500 years but is hidden under fields and normally cannot be seen .
The 52 - year - old said : “ In twelve years of ballooning , I have never seen anything as clear as this .
It was like looking down on a map .
“ I have flown over this field before , and never seen any marks .
The hot weather must have created absolutely perfect conditions for seeing the marks . ”
He added : “ There were seven or eight big circles .
It was absolutely fantastic . ”
County archaeologist Paul Smith said : “ There are very extensive areas of Bronze Age barrow cemeteries in that area , and some Roman remains too .
There is a whole mix of multi-period sites .
“ There has not been a lot of excavation , but these sites periodically show up through crops .
“ When it has been dry , the ditches once dug for round barrows hold more moisture than the surrounding area , and when the rest of the field is ripening , the crops above the ditch are considerably greener .
He added : “ This period of the summer is the best time to see crop marks , but it may last for just a few days or a few weeks .
“ Some summers are definitely better than others .
This year , a lot of sites are showing up . ”
He said the county council ’s archaeology service had been contacted by a number of people who had spotted other marks across the county , either from planes and hot air balloons , or while passing through the countryside on trains or buses .
The barrows , constructed between 2,200 BC and 1,000 BC , would once have been mounds , like the prehistoric Seven Barrows site on the Lambourn Downs south of Wantage , but over the centuries , farming has obliterated all surface traces of them .

Former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser says Julia Gillard struck a " sellout " deal on the mining tax but Tony Abbott has rocks in his head for wanting to rescind it .
Mr Fraser , the head of the RBA from 1989 to 1996 and a former Treasury boss , said Ken Henry 's resources super profits tax ( RSPT ) in its original form was too complicated .
" It was never going to fly ... because it was n't understandable ... it was over - engineered in a way , " Mr Fraser told ABC Television on Wednesday .
Ms Gillard brokered a deal with the big miners soon after being installed as prime minister .
The resulting minerals resources rent tax ( MRRT ) was a sellout , Mr Fraser said .
Das Schlagloch : Wozu Rundfunkgebühren ?
ARD und ZDF sollten auf Werbung verzichten und dem Quotendruck entsagen .
Und da bist du auch noch stolz drauf ? "
Ich war empört , und mein junger Freund , verlässlich links und taz - Leser , lachte : " Allerdings ! "
Er habe noch nie Rundfunkgebühren gezahlt , er sähe das auch gar nicht ein .
ARD und ZDF seien genau so schrottig wie Sat.1 , die kommende Zwangsabgabe ein Skandal .
Als ich ihn daraufhin einen demokratiezerstörenden Schnorrer nannte , war er beleidigt .
Er hatte einen wunden Punkt bei mir getroffen .
Zunächst einen nostalgischen .
Ich bin in der Zeit aufgewachsen , in der es nur zwei Fernsehsender und drei Hörfunkwellen gab .
In den Trümmern des Krieges von BBC - Besatzern gegründet , kam dieser öffentlich - rechtliche Rundfunk ( ein abtörnendes Wortungetüm ) dem nahe , was der Medienwissenschaftler Roger Silverstone die " zweite Heimat " nannte : einen medialen Raum , der , zum Ausgleich für Zerstreuung der Familien und Ausdifferenzierung der Gesellschaft , eine virtuelle Agora schafft .
Eine Mischung aus Vorparlament und Ganztags - Gesamtschule der Nation .
Demokratietheoretisch gesehen war der Frequenzmangel ein Segen :
Da alle dasselbe hörten , wenn sie am Radioknopf drehten , synchronisierten sie sich ihre Erfahrungswelten .
Jeder , der sich zuschaltete , nahm , ob er wollte oder nicht , an der pluralen Kultur dieses Landes teil : Bertolt Brecht und Willy Millowitsch , Heinz Erhardt und Hans Magnus Enzensberger , die " Welt der Arbeit " und der Operettenzauber .
Die Nachrichten waren für alle dieselben , und in den ersten Fernsehjahren konnte man noch Hamlet zur Primetime im Ersten sehen .
Zwangskultivierung ?
Mathias Greffrath ist Jahrgang 1945 und lebt in Berlin .
Von 1991 bis 1994 war er Chefredakteur der " Wochenpost " .
Als freier Publizist befasst er sich vor allem mit den Auswirkungen der Globalisierung auf Politik , Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft .
Ende der virtuellen Agora
Dann gab es mehr Frequenzen , und l983 kam der Systemwechsel : Duales System hieß nun : private Presse und halbprivates Fernseh - und Rundfunkwesen .
Die Sache sei " gefährlicher als Kernenergie " , fand Helmut Schmidt damals , und die Folgen dieses Urknalls sind bekannt : der Fallout in den Kanälen von RTL und Sat1 , die Selbstboulevardisierung der öffentlichen Sender , die Auslagerung alles Anspruchsvolleren in die Spartenkanäle .
Dem Ideal einer " bürgerlichen Öffentlichkeit " folgt das schon lange nicht mehr .
Diese , so kürzlich noch einmal Jürgen Habermas , braucht Leitmedien , in denen die wichtigen Fragen der Nation " zu Problemstellungen verarbeitet und mit begründeten Stellungnahmen zu konkurrierenden öffentlichen Meinungen gebündelt " werden .
Und Analoges gilt für die Kultur : Seit wir die mediale Vielfalt haben , sind die Erfahrungswelten getrennter - und einfältiger - geworden : Unterschichten lernen auf Unterschichtenschulen und sehen Unterschichten - TV , Eliten hören Deutschlandfunk und sehen Arte .
Bedenklicher noch als der " Kulturverfall " ist die Zersplitterung der Diskurse in einer Gesellschaft , in der es angesichts der kommenden Herausforderungen - Migration , Klima , Sozialsysteme , Bildungsmisere etc. - darauf ankäme , Kenntnisse zu verbreiten und die Fähigkeit zu intelligentem Streit und Konsens zu stärken .
Die Senderflut ist nicht mehr rückgängig zu machen , einiges hat sie ja auch wohltuend aufgelockert ; heute kann man nur noch Dämme einbauen , und neue , bessere Angebote machen .
Immer noch gibt es , mehr oder weniger in Remmidemmi eingebettet , vortreffliche Sendungen im öffentlichen Rundfunk .
Insofern ist die gesetzliche Zementierung einer " Haushaltsgebühr " von 17,98 Euro eine gute Tat .
Strukturwandel des Internets
Eine beherzte Reform ist sie freilich nicht .
Denn die hätte ARD und ZDF zugemutet , auf Werbung zu verzichten - und sie so auf Dauer vom Quotendruck befreit .
Sie hätte den Einfluss der Parteien in den Anstalten zurückgeschraubt ( Brender ! ) und den Journalisten in den Rundfunkräten mehr Mitbestimmung eingeräumt - und so Voraussetzungen für eine Qualitätsoffensive geschaffen ( was nicht heißt : nur noch Grau und Bildung ! ) .
Vor allem aber hätte sie klarstellen müssen , dass im Internet , dieser medialen Prärie neuer Art , alle " Anbieter " gleiche Rechte haben : die unter kommerziellen Druck stehenden Verlage und die Garanten einer von Interessen unverzerrten Öffentlichkeit .
Angesichts der Mediengewohnheiten der Jungen wurde eine große Chance verpasst , die Anstalten mit ihren intellektuellen Kapazitäten , ihren Korrespondentennetzen und Archivschätzen offensiv ins Netz zu drängen .
Ich bin sicher , die Verfassungsrichter hätten wohlwollend genickt .
Ein Gut wie Wasser und Strom
Immerhin , mit der Haushaltsabgabe ist ein Schritt in die Richtung getan : Rundfunk ist als nationales Kulturgut anerkannt und den Schulen , Universitäten , Theatern gleichgestellt - aber ebenso Parks , Stadien und Musicalbühnen .
Wir zahlen dafür Steuern ; wir zahlen für Wasser und Strom .
Dass viele junge Menschen die Haushaltsabgabe für die kulturellen und politischen Ressourcen , ohne die der demokratische Staat nicht existieren kann , als Zwang empfinden , hat viele Gründe : vor allem den , dass das " Gefäß des gemeinsamen Denkens " ( Alexander Kluge ) seit dem Urknall von 1984 schon so ramponiert worden ist , dass die Nachwachsenden diesen Zustand für normal halten .
Immerhin , aus der staatskritischen Bloggercommunity kommt gelegentlich schon die Erkenntnis , dass die bunte Vielfalt der " Netzdemokratie " auch dazu führt , " dass es kein gemeinsames Nachdenken mehr gibt , sondern dass jeder über etwas anderes nachdenkt " .
Das Netz kann nicht zur " Dritten Heimat " werden oder zur " klassischen Öffentlichkeit " .
Aber ein paar Provinzen zuverlässigen Festlands im Meer der wogenden Vielfalt wären wohl möglich - und nötig .
Ach ja : Nachdem ich ihm eine halbe Stunde lang die Sendungen von Deutschlandfunk , der Dritten Programme , von Monitor und Arte , die Bundesliga , Georg Schramm und Maybrit Illner runterdeklamiert hatte , gab mein Freund auf .
Er werde , versprach er , von nun an bezahlen - wenn auch nur , um mich loszuwerden .
Es bleibe ihm ja auch nichts andres übrig , wollte ich sagen , aber hielt den Satz zurück .
Es war einer meiner seltenen bürgergesellschaftlichen Erfolge , und den wollte ich nicht durch Triumph gefährden .

Sie sollten ihre Kollegen bei einem Einsatz unterstützen - und machten dann selbst Krawall : Ordnungshüter haben in einem Vier - Sterne - Hotel randaliert .
Hamburgs Polizeipräsident ist " stinksauer " .
Normalerweise sorgt die Polizei für Recht und Nüchternheit : Wer im Alkoholrausch rumpöbelt oder randaliert , dem spendieren die Uniformierten eine Nacht auf der Wache .
Dass aber auch Polizisten gerne mal einen über den Durst trinken und ausfallend werden , zeigt ein Fall aus Hamburg .
Detailansicht öffnen Bier trinkend und pöbelnd sind Polizisten aus Sachsen - Anhalt durch die Flure eines Hamburger 4 - Sterne - Hotels getorkelt .
( Foto : dpa )
Eigentlich waren die Polizisten gegen Krawalle im Hamburger Schanzenviertel im Einsatz .
Doch dann machten sie selbst Krawall : Einem Zeitungsbericht zufolge haben Beamte einer Polizeihundertschaft aus Sachsen - Anhalt in einem Hotel betrunken andere Gäste belästigt .
Der Vorfall müsse nun " ordentlich untersucht " werden , sagte ein Polizeisprecher in der Hansestadt .
Er bestätigte damit einen Bericht des Hamburger Abendblatts .
Die rund 100 Polizisten waren am vergangenen Wochenende in dem Vier - Sterne - Hotel untergebracht , weil sie ihre Hamburger Kollegen bei einem Einsatz im Schanzenviertel unterstützen sollten .
Dort hatten am Samstag rund 800 Menschen gegen Polizeigewalt und staatliche Repression protestiert .
Nach dem Ende ihres Einsatzes gegen 23.00
Uhr seien Polizisten biertrinkend und grölend durch die Flure des Golfhotels getaumelt , hätten eine Hochzeitsgesellschaft gestört und Hotelangestellte verbal attackiert , bestätigte der Sprecher .
Pöbelnde Polizisten
" Wenn ich Hotelgast gewesen wäre , hätte ich wohl die 110 angerufen . "
Ein betrunkener Beamter soll sich sogar übergeben haben .
Hamburgs Polizeipräsident Werner Jantosch sei " stinksauer " gewesen und habe sich bei dem Hotel entschuldigt , berichtete der Sprecher .
" Die Veranstalter haben hanseatisch gelassen reagiert - weil es ein Einzelfall war . "
Die Polizei habe in dem Quartier schon häufiger Zimmer für Kräfte von außerhalb gebucht .
Wenn Hamburg Beamte aus anderen Bundesländern anfordere , müssten diese " nach bestimmten Kriterien " untergebracht werden , erläuterte der Sprecher .
" Sie können nicht mit 100 Leuten in einer Turnhalle schlafen . "
Das Hotel müsse zentral gelegen sein - und ermöglichen , dass alle Beamte samt des Fahrzeugparks gemeinsam untergebracht sind .
" Es gibt in Hamburg nicht so viele Hotels , wo man das machen kann . "
Das Vier - Sterne - Hotel liegt im Naturschutzgebiet Alstertal .
Im Internet wirbt die Nobelherberge mit einem Meisterschaftsgolfplatz , einem Höchstmaß an Service - und einem garantiert " unvergesslichen Aufenthalt " .
Bei den Polizisten aus Sachsen - Anhalt handelt es sich um Angehörige der Landesbereitschaftspolizei .
Deren Leitung in Magdeburg habe sich in einem Brief an die Hamburger Polizei für das Verhalten der Beamten entschuldigt , sagte der Sprecher des Innenministeriums .
Ob Disziplinarverfahren eingeleitet werden , sei noch nicht entschieden .
Die Polizisten hatten laut Hamburger Abendblatt zwar keine Rufbereitschaft und mussten daher auch nicht sofort wieder einsatzbereit sein .
Dass sie sich betrinken , ist dennoch verboten : Ihre " Funktionsfähigkeit " muss gewährleistet sein .
Das feucht - fröhliche Wochenende könnte für die Ordnungshüter nicht folgenlos bleiben : " Es wird ein Disziplinarverfahren geprüft und gegebenenfalls eingeleitet . "
Here are a few facts that you may not have known about the gang in gold and red ( and maybe a couple about the set in silver and green ) .
1. Hermione 's name was almost " Hermione Puckle . "
It has a sour tone to it , does n't it ?
J.K. Rowling thought so , too , and changed to something that suited the character better .
Rowling has said that Hermione has a healthy dose of herself in there , as she was quite the know - it - all herself as a child .
Hermione was originally going to have a younger sister , but Rowling never found the right moment to stick her into the books .
2. Gilderoy Lockhart , the insufferably vain professor and celebrity from The Chamber of Secrets , was based on someone Rowling knows in real life .
The rumor is that she based him on her ex-husband , but she has been quite adamant about denying that .
" He used to tell whopping great fibs about his past life , all of them designed to demonstrate what a wonderful , brave and brilliant person he was .
Perhaps he did n't really believe he was all that great and wanted to compensate , but I 'm afraid I never dug that deep , " she has said .
" He 's probably out there now telling everybody that he inspired the character of Albus Dumbledore .
Or that he wrote the books and lets me take the credit out of kindness . "
3. Hedwig , Harry 's Snowy Owl , is n't entirely accurate .
After the first book was accepted for publication , she found out Snowy Owls are diurnal .
And it was during the writing of book two that she realized that Snowy Owls are silent , meaning that Hedwig 's knowing hoots and conversational noises were n't quite true - to - life .
She admits this was just a research hole on her part , but says readers should feel free to assume that her unusual talents are just part of her magical ability .
Incidentally , although Hedwig is female , she is played by a male in the movies because females are n't wholly white like males are .
4. Collecting unusual and interesting names and words has been a lifelong habit for Rowling .
She has said that she loves reading lists of them , from war memorials to baby name books , and made it a point to remember her favorites .
Some of them found a new home in the Harry Potter books .
She makes up some of the words too - " quidditch " is a Rowling original .
She filled up five pages of made - up words that started with " Q " before she hit on one that sounded right .
" Voldemort " and " Malfoy " were also invented .
5 . If a muggle were to happen across Hogwarts , all they would see is nothing but a ruined castle with large signs on it saying ' keep out , dangerous building . '
This might sound a bit suspicious to those of us in the States , but it seems like the U.K. is rife with castle ruins .
6. Fred and George Weasley were born on April Fool 's Day .
Go figure .
While we 're talking about the Weasleys , there was a Weasley cousin named Mafalda who got edited out of The Goblet of Fire in order to make room for the love - to - hate - her invasive " journalist " Rita Skeeter .
That 's probably best - Ginny Weasley is supposed to have been the first girl born to the Weasley family for several generations , so scrapping Malfalda supports that backstory .
7. Harry , Ron , and Hermione all have wand cores based on their birthdays .
The Celt assigned trees to people based on that kind of like we assign gemstones today .
She had already assigned Harry 's holly - based wand when she discovered the Celt tree calendar and found that she had accidentally assigned him the " right " type of wood .
She did the same thing with Draco Malfoy ( Hawthorn wood ) .
But Ron and Hermione both purposefully received wands based on their birthdays - ash for Ron and vine wood for Hermione .
She did n't carry this convention out for all of the characters , though .
8. Filch 's cat , Mrs. Norris , takes her name from the Jane Austen book Mansfield Park .
Fittingly , Austen 's Mrs. Norris is also rather sour and bitter .
9 . Snape was partially based on a teacher J.K. Rowling once had .
She likes to write him , though , because she finds him such a pathetic creature .
10 . King 's Cross station is where young wizards hop on the Hogwarts Express to get to school .
What you might not know is that the station holds special meaning for J.K.
Rowling : it 's where her parents met .
They were coincidentally both headed to Arbroath in Scotland when they met on the train .
King 's Cross was intentionally chosen as the gateway to Hogwarts in homage to Rowling 's parents .

The stunning green glow of the Southern Lights photographed by astronauts from ABOVE
Advertisement
Like a green ribbon snaking its way out into space this stunning image shows the famous Southern Lights from a rather unusual angle - above .
Taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) , this picture shows the aurora australis against the backdrop of Earth 's horizon .
These ever - shifting displays are most visible near the North ( aurora borealis ) and South ( aurora australis ) Poles .
Green flash : The Aurora Australis ( Southern Lights ) as observed From the International Space Station .
The curve of the Earth and the blue light of the atmosphere can also be seen
The ISS was over the Southern Indian Ocean at an altitude of 350 km , with the astronauts looking towards Antarctica and the South Pole .
Dense cloud cover is dimly visible below the aurora .
The curvature of the Earth ’s horizon can be clearly seen as well as the faint blue line of the upper atmosphere .
The stunning sight is formed as charged particles streaming from the Sun – known as the solar wind - interact with Earth ’s magnetic field , resulting in collisions with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the upper atmosphere .
This striking aurora image was taken during a geomagnetic storm that was probably caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun on May 24th .
The atoms emit photons as a means of returning to their original energy state .
The photons form the aurora that we see .
Down to Earth : A more typical view of the Southern Lights over the Amundsen - Scott station at the South Pole taken in 2002
The most commonly observed colour of aurora is green , caused by photons ( light ) emitted by excited oxygen atoms at wavelengths centered at 0.558 micrometers , or millionths of a metre .
Visible light is reflected from healthy ( green ) plant leaves at approximately the same wavelength .
Red aurora are generated by light emitted at a longer wavelength ( 0.630 micrometers ) , and other colours such as blue and purple are also sometimes observed .
You may not have heard of Ralph Johnson and Joe Armstong , but they 've been programming longer than most of us have , including OO programming longer than most of us have .
It 's fair to say that after you 've been doing something a while , you tend to form opinions about it .
Mssrs. Johnson and Armstrong have opinions and this interview with Ralph Johnson and Joe Armstrong is full of said opinions .
It 's brilliant .
There 's a great bit from Joe Armstrong where he explains what he thinks " OO " should be about .
Though he does n't use the Web browser as an example , I will .
But first , it 's important to quote him at length .
The 3 things that object oriented programming has it's messaging , which is possibly the most important thing .
The next thing is isolation and that 's what I talked about earlier , that my program should n't crash your program , if the 2 things are isolated , then any mistakes I make in my program will not crash your program .
This is certainly not true with Java .
You cannot take 2 Java applications , bung them in the JVM and one of them still halts the machine and the other one will halt as well .
You can crash somebody else 's application , so they are not isolated .
The third thing you want is polymorphism .
Polymorphism is especially regarding messaging , that 's just there for the programmer 's convenience .
It 's very nice to have for all objects or all processes or whatever you call them , to have a printMe method - " Go print yourself " and then they print themselves .
That 's because the programmers , if they all got different names , the programmer is never going to remember this , so it 's a polymorphism .
It just means " OK , all objects have a printMe method .
All objects have a what 's your size method or introspection method . "
To summarize , Armstrong asserts that OO is about :
Messages
Polymorphism
Isolation
Forget for a moment whether or not you agree with this , just consider the implications .
Note that we 're not talking about classes , prototypes , code reuse , inheritance or syntax .
Those are implementation details .
We 're talking about " what " , not " how " .
Messages
I 'll use a Web browser as a perfect example of this .
First , messages are not method calls .
Object A sends a message to Object B and Object B is free to respond or not .
If Object A is a Google Chrome browser , the " message " it sends to a Web server might be :
GET /users / ovid/2010/07/firefoxchromesafari---beautiful-examples-of-objects.html
The Web server can choose to response or not .
If you 're making that request to http://blogs.perl.org/ , you probably will get a 200 response and find yourself reading this blog entry .
If you make that request to reddit.com , you 're probably going to get a 404 and not read this blog entry .
Either way , you can choose to send this message .
Polymorphism
This leads us to the next point .
You can send the same message to multiple objects .
If they choose to respond to this message , you should be prepared to handle it and Web browsers generally are .
In the " message " example above , the browser will likely wind up rendering content in both cases , but for a clearer example , consider GET / .
Virtually every Web server can and will respond to that .
They may respond with a 200 and the " home page " , or they may choose to respond with a 30 x redirect , forcing the browser to make a decision on whether or not to follow said redirect ( different browsers behave differently here ) .
In any event , the fact that almost all Web servers will respond to GET / , but may respond in different ways , is a perfect example of polymorphism .
Isolation
Some people think this means encapsulation , but that 's only part of what 's happening .
Imagine that you 're being naughty and trying to exploit an SQL injection attack on someone 's Web site .
In the process , you might crash their Web site .
You did not crash your browser ( or command line user - agent or whatever tool you 're using ) .
Isolation means that separate objects have no direct impact on one another , short of how they choose to handle sending and receiving messages .
So is that really OO ?
This is , admittedly , not a way of looking at OO that comes naturally to most programmers .
Whether this is due to genuinely differing opinions or staying in our comfort zone is for others to argue .
Even when I tell people how great Moose is , I have to keep in mind that it 's only one interpretation of how OO should be .
Thus , when people say things like REST is what OO design should be , it 's easy to get confused about what is meant , but when you think about messaging , isolation and polymorphism , things become much clearer .
It also becomes clear that most " OO " languages would struggle to fit this view of " OO " .
Neighbours who keep the curtains closed and a boy who likes to draw guns among ' suspects ' of terror hotline
A schoolboy ' obsessed ' with drawing pictures of bombs and guns , and a neighbour who liked to keep his curtains drawn , are among dozens of people being reported to a police scheme aimed to unearth potential terrorists .
Critics of the Channel Project say it encourages people to spy on their neighbours , but police claim the scheme 's aim is to prevent ' vulnerable people ' becoming radicalised .
Dozens of people in East Lancashire , mainly aged between 15 and 24 , have been reported to police for having either extremist Islamic views , far - right leanings and or being IRA sympathisers .
Vigilance or spying ?
The Channel Project encourages people to report any suspicious behaviour to police .
Critics say it could infringe on the right to privacy
Police complete background checks on all individuals reported before a panel meets to decide if any action needs to be taken .
Interventions can range from a simple chat , to a complex mentoring and counselling process .
Some cases include :
A school pupil who is obsessed with drawing bombs and guns ;
A bus passenger expressing racist views ;
New neighbours behaving oddly , including keeping their curtains drawn ; and
A vulnerable loner who suddenly received visitors to his home at irregular times .
The information has not prompted any criminal investigations , with tip - offs coming from people in public sector jobs , including teachers , social workers and bin men .
But now police are urging the wider community to report their concerns to the hotline .
The pilot schemes set up in Blackburn and Burnley are two of 28 launched last November after concerns that many neighbours in Leeds had suspicions about the 7/7 London bombers but did not report anything to police .
Prevention : The Channel Project was in response to concerns that neighbours in Leeds had suspicions about the 7/7 London bombers but did not report anything
Opponents of the scheme say it could cause more harm than good - striking fear into communities .
But police said it was ' not about spying , but identifying vulnerable people and helping them ' .
Inspector Paul Goodall , the sceme 's coordinator for East Lancashire , said the project aimed to target those with ' extremist views ' .
He said : ' We are looking at people who would not normally come on to our radar .
' In their behaviour they may not actually be doing anything wrong , but if we have concerns about how they could develop , it is our role to engage with that person .
' The Channel Project is all about supporting vulnerable individuals .
' This is a massive change for us because these people are not criminals .
We hope and expect that the numbers of referrals will increase . '
Blackburn MP and for Justice Secretary Jack Straw said a fine balance needed to be found to protect the public and not infringe on people 's privacy .
He said : ' The horror of terrorism is that he victims are chosen at random and as someone who was involved in an IRA attack in the 1970s I know hat it is one of those areas that the police cannot ignore .
' I am reassured that this project is in the hands of Lancashire police , who have a fantastic record in working with the community . '
Salim Mulla , chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques , said it was a ' step too far ' .
He said : ' People in the community already know what their responsibilities are and people will report to the police if they see anything suspicious .
' I think this could just create fear among the community . '
The NHS in England is to undergo a major restructuring in one of the biggest shake - ups in its history , the government has announced .
Hospitals are to be moved out of the NHS to create a " vibrant " industry of social enterprises under the proposals .
And , as expected , GPs are to take charge of much of the budget .
The move will lead to the abolition of all 10 strategic health authorities and the 152 management bodies known as primary care trusts .
THE KEY CHANGES GPs - Asked to get together in groups to take on responsibility for spending much of the NHS budget
- Asked to get together in groups to take on responsibility for spending much of the NHS budget Hospitals - Encouraged to move outside the NHS to become " vibrant " industry of social enterprises
- Encouraged to move outside the NHS to become " vibrant " industry of social enterprises Patients - More information and choice , including ability to register with any GP they want to
- More information and choice , including ability to register with any GP they want to Managers - Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts face the axe
The new structure will be held accountable by an independent NHS board which would be free from political interference , the government said .
Meanwhile , responsibility for public health will be passed to local authorities .
In many ways , the plans outlined in a White Paper go further than expected .
The coalition agreement had promised no top - down reorganisations .
But Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he had decided to go further than first envisaged to rid the health service of " unnecessary " bureaucracy .
He said the proposals would be challenging and turn the NHS " upside down " but in doing so help reduce management costs by nearly a half within four years .
He added : " The government 's ambition is for health outcomes - and quality services - that are among the best in the world . "
' Experiment '
The GP move had long been championed by Mr Lansley - and in recent months the British Medical Association had indicated it was willing to work with him on the idea .
The plans mean GPs working in groups will be in charge of a vast collection of hospital , mental health and community services - although specialist services and dentistry will not fall under their remit .
ANALYSIS
It had been clear for some time that Andrew Lansley was planning big changes .
But it is a mark of how far - reaching the White Paper actually is that many experts are still shocked by the scale of the proposals .
At a time when the NHS is having to find savings of up to £ 20bn by 2014 , the proposals are being seen as a huge gamble for the service itself and the health secretary personally .
At the heart of the plans are GPs .
They , Mr Lansley believes , are better placed than managers to make decisions about services .
Buffeted by years of criticism over what have been perceived as excessive pay rises , GPs now find themselves in the curious position of being given the keys to the NHS safe .
The question on everyone 's lips now is :
Can they spend it wisely ?
Under the new system , the independent board will sit above as many as 500 consortiums of GPs to set standards and hold the groups to account .
Another key aspect of the changes involves giving patients more information and choice .
To achieve this , a new body , HealthWatch , will be set up to compile data on performance , while GP boundaries will be abolished to allow patients to register with any doctor they want .
Mr Lansley also announced he expected all NHS trusts , which run hospitals and mental health units , to get foundation status by 2013 .
He also said he would be relaxing the rules which cap the amount of income a trust can make outside the NHS , opening the door to them seeing more private patients .
He said this would allow them to innovate and widen the scope of what they did , but he also admitted it would mean those which were not financially viable could go under .
The government will now consult on its plans before rolling them out over the next three years .
Professor Chris Ham , chief executive of the King 's Fund think - tank , said : " It is a very radical programme .
We have never seen anything like this since the inception of the NHS in 1948 . "
But he said the moves were not without risk , pointing out some GPs would not have the skills to manage the budget .
Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham went further , describing the changes as a " political experiment " .
" It is a huge gamble with a NHS that is working well for patients . "
There was a mixed reaction from NHS staff .
Unison said the changes could lead to " chaos " , but the BMA said they could benefit patients and it was looking forward to working with ministers .
Katherine Murphy , of the Patients Association , called for more clarity over how and what information would be provided to patients .
" We need more details , " she added .
In the July 10 , 2010 , edition of the British magazine The Economist , there is an article about China ’s banks , referred to as the “ Great Wall Street . ”
The Economist is the British version of the Wall Street Journal .
This article , with a little bit of attached explanation , I believe , can help my fellow workers understand why China - bashing in the labor movement is a bad idea .
Any sleazy politician or Wall Street banker knows the best way to take people ’s minds off mistakes you have made is to focus their attention on somebody else .
Problems with NAFTA and runaway corporate greed have given a lot of people associated with corporate America reason to point the finger at China as the culprit of America ’s economic problems while dodging their own responsibility .
Unfortunately some folks in labor , including in my own union , have fallen for this ploy .
In my view , the corporate ruling class and their system of profits first , people last , is the enemy , not China .
My union , the International Association of Machinists , has a front - cover article in the summer 2010 edition of the IAM Journal on the TRADE Act , backed by the IAM , featuring a picture of Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown ( Democrat ) , one of the co-sponsors of the bill .
The TRADE ( Trade Reform , Accountability , Development and Employment )
Act is supposed to fix the problems caused by NAFTA and other damaging trade agreements signed by the United States government .
But the IAM Journal article says , on page 13 : “ A far more serious threat lies just across the Pacific , where the rules of trade are even more skewed , less enforced and government transparency is taboo .
That menacing threat to fair globalization : China . ”
The IAM Journal goes on to say : “ The Economic Policy Institute estimates as many as 2.4 million U.S. jobs have been lost to China between 2001 and 2008 alone , ” and “ Experts say China has created an unfair trade advantage for themselves through the manipulation of its currency , cheap labor and government subsidies for its industries . ”
The British Economist says , “ While American and European banks have been busy blowing up , China ’s have been transformed from communist bureaucracies crippled by bad debts into to something resembling world beaters . ”
The article goes on to say that China ’s banks are government banks , and China did not suffer from the recent crisis because “ they never entirely left the government ’s embrace .
So although they make money … the state owns a majority stake and the Communist Party appoints the top brass , whose pay is a fraction of that of their Western peers .
Those bosses , with their dual role as party bigwigs and chief executives , are beholden to a higher authority than the stockmarket . ”
The overwhelming evidence from all sources that are reliable is that the policy that China ’s state banks follow that supersedes the stock market is that the banks ’ job is to develop China in an all - around way and overcome the poverty of millions of Chinese people .
In the last 30 years , since it changed course , away from the disastrous policies of the Cultural Revolution , and returned to its original platform of development and poverty - relief , China , according to the International Monetary Fund , has lifted more people out of poverty than at any other point in the history of the human race .
Corporate talking heads have claimed that this great economic development has only been possible because China embraced capitalism , but the Economist complains that China does not run according to the laws of the standard capitalist system .
In fact , China has used market forces under government or socialist control to achieve this amazing economic miracle .
The Economist also says , “ Rich countries tried to kick - start their economies by getting central banks to lend to banks , which , frustratingly , have hoarded the liquidity .
As in 1999 , after the Asian crisis , China ’s politicians just cut out the middleman and told the banks to supply more credit …
Even in rich countries with privately owned banks , supervisors are eyeing the tools used by China ’s regulators to control credit .
Communist Party diktat has been relabelled as ‘ macroprudential supervision . ' ”
Many in the U.S. labor movement have seen China ’s enormous stimulus package job creation through government - funded infrastructure programs as a model for what a U.S. job stimulus plan should look like .
My union , the IAM , clearly calls for a national industrial policy and massive investment in infrastructure – surprisingly , just like our friends in China have actually done , not just talked about .
Solidarity between workers of all nations is the only way to get workers in the United States and elsewhere out of the massive economic crisis .
Solidarity requires that we support efforts by workers in other countries who support policies that help workers rise up out of poverty .
Despite many problems , most commentators agree the majority of Chinese workers support the policies of development , opening up to the outside world , and socialist control for the betterment of the nation , pursued by the Chinese government .
We cannot forget that it was U.S multinational corporations who chose to find and use the cheapest labor anywhere in the world they could find it .
We cannot forget that China was a poor country when it opened up to direct foreign investment over 30 years ago .
They use their poverty as an asset to develop the whole nation and have done quite well with this policy .
Some poor countries using the capitalist model , rather than China ’s market - socialist model , have enriched an elite and left their nation underdeveloped and their masses with no hope .
We must put issues such as China ’s so - called “ currency manipulation ” in the context of government banks that put the nation ’s development first , before the stock market .
China ’s cautious monetary policy has actually been useful to the whole world , making China the rock in the global economy that can help the rest of the world climb out of this terrible recession .
China is already out of the recession , so what about us ?
Solidarity between workers , rather than competition , is our way out .
We need a massive government investment in infrastructure to kick - start our economy , just like the Chinese are doing .
Our enemy is not Chinese bankers that protected China from a banking crash , but the so - called deficit hawks who are crying on a false note that we must sacrifice Social Security and Medicare , and that we must not have another job - creating stimulus package or infrastructure investment .
It is not poor workers in Mexico who stole jobs from U.S. autoworkers .
It is Ford , Chrysler and GM that sought out cheaper labor , obeying the dictates of the capitalist system .
It is not Chinese economic policies that are the enemies of U.S. workers , but the corporate ruling class in the United States pursuing greedy policies that enrich themselves and bankrupt the U.S. working class .
The Chinese government is pursuing policies that strengthen workers ’ trade union organizations .
We can unite with the workers in China who are organizing to fight for their rights .
We can march with the AFL - CIO , SEIU , and the NAACP on October 2 , 2010 , for “ Jobs , Justice , and Peace . ”
And first and foremost , we can fight for a massive job - creating stimulus investment in our country ’s infrastructure and defeat the ultra - right in this November ’s election .

Some of the objects were reportedly picked up by air force radar
The video , filmed by pilots using an infrared camera , shows 11 bright objects moving rapidly in the sky .
" We are not alone !
This is so weird , " one of the pilots can be heard saying after the radar picked up the objects .
The Mexican defence ministry confirmed the videotape had been filmed by members of the air force , but did not comment on its content .
Mexican UFO investigator Jaime Maussan said that , while there were hundreds of UFO videos , it was the first time one " had the backing of the armed forces " .
" The armed forces do n't perpetuate frauds , " he added after showing the footage at a news conference on Tuesday .
I believe they could feel we were pursuing them
Maj Magdaleno Castanon
The objects were reported to be invisible to the eye - the pilots turned on the infrared camera to track them after three of them were picked up by the radar .
In a taped interview , the plane 's radar operator Lt German Marin said he had felt " a little afraid because we were facing something that had never happened before " .
Interviewed by Jaime Maussan , the captain of the aircraft , Maj Magdaleno Castanon , said they had chased the lights .
" I believe they could feel we were pursuing them , " he said .
" There was a moment when ... the screens showed they were behind us , to the left and in front of us .
It was at that point that I felt a bit tense . "
There have been many reported UFO sightings in Mexico , most of which have been dismissed by scientists .
Today ’s overdue Mac Pro update is a welcome change , but for a computer that ’s so expensive , why not just get an iMac ?
Here ’s an attempt at configuring an iMac and a Mac Pro to be as similar as possible , in a high - performance configuration ( yes , you can build a cheaper iMac , but this is for people who stress their hardware ) :
iMac Mac Pro Monitor 27 ” built - in 27 ” Cinema Display CPU 2.93 GHz i7 2.8 GHz W3530 RAM 8 GB ( in 4 slots ) 8 GB from OWC ( in 4 slots ) Max RAM 16 GB ( 4 slots ) 16 GB ( 4 slots ) , or 32 GB with OWC ’s 8GB modules Video card Radeon 5750 Radeon 5770 SSD boot drive 256 GB mediocre SSD 240 GB much faster SSD Second drive 1 TB 1 TB Hard - drive bays 2 , inaccessible 4 , easily accessible Max monitors 2 a lot Firewire ports 1 4 AppleCare $ 169 $ 249 As configured $ 3,487 $ 4,660 ( $ 1,173 more )
I made some assumptions , like that you ’d be willing to buy third - party disks and RAM , and that you ’d be comfortable upgrading both in a Mac Pro ( where it ’s easy and intended ) , but you would n’t be comfortable upgrading the disks in an iMac ( because it ’s difficult , unintended , and has so much potential to damage the screen or get dust in it that even I refuse to attempt it ) .
I also assumed that you would n’t care about the PCI - Express slots or extra optical bay in the Mac Pro , and that you would n’t find the dual - socket versions worth their premium , even though they give you twice as many RAM slots .
The Mac Pro will probably carry at least a $ 1200 premium over a similarly configured iMac no matter how you configure them .
So the iMac is the practical winner for most people with average needs .
So why buy a Mac Pro ?
I have a Mac Pro and Tiff has a 24 ” iMac .
Both were purchased in early 2008 .
We both have high demands : I write a lot of code and process a lot of data and media files , and Tiff heavily edits wedding photo shoots with thousands of huge RAW files .
Now that both of our computers are nearly three years old , mine ’s still doing fine for the foreseeable future ( although I ’ll put an SSD in it soon ) , but we ’re ready to throw Tiff ’s out the window .
My desk is clean and mostly free of cables and peripherals , but Tiff ’s desk is covered in hard - drive enclosures .
She ’s using an X25 - M SSD in a Firewire 800 enclosure as a boot drive , since the iMac ’s internal hard drive is too slow .
She ’s using a pair of 1 TB disks in RAID - 0 as primary storage , in another Firewire 800 enclosure daisy - chained to the SSD ’s , because the iMac ’s internal hard drive is too small .
And she has another 2 TB external USB disk for Time Machine .
My Mac Pro has 4 internal hard - drive bays , so I do n’t need any enclosures except for the occasional off - site backup disk .
All of my disks are faster , quieter , and more reliable because they ’re in directly connected , well - ventilated internal bays .
And each one was cheaper , because I did n’t need to buy an enclosure to go around it .
If I need more disks , I can add a PCI - Express eSATA card to connect an external enclosure at full speed .
Tiff ’s iMac is maxed out at 4 GB of RAM , which is part of the reason she needed an SSD .
My Mac
Pro has had 6 GB for its entire life so far , and if I needed more , I could add another 4 GB for just $ 150 or spend more as needed to install up to 32 GB .
When we replace Tiff ’s iMac , the excellent 24 ” monitor that ’s built into it will need to be replaced , too .
When we eventually replace my Mac Pro , I ’ll be able to keep my monitors .
( Possibly with an adapter , if the port has changed by then . )
If I splurge on an internal SSD , I can bring that with me to any future computers .
If the iMac had an internal SSD , it would likely depart with the iMac to wherever its new home was .
And if we sold our computers , I ’d get much more money for mine .
My friend recently sold his single - socket , 2.0 GHz Mac Pro for just over $ 900 on Craigslist with local pickup .
It cost about $ 2000 new … in 2006 .
A quick search indicates that we’d be lucky to get $ 600 for Tiff ’s iMac ( assuming we ’d keep the external disks ) .
Especially because that excellent 24 ” monitor stuck inside of it is starting to flake out .
And it ’s out of warranty .
When that monitor dies , the computer is worth almost nothing .
While the Mac Pro costs a lot more up front , high - performance users also get a lot more value and versatility over its lifespan , which is likely to be much longer and end much more gracefully .
You thought work was bad ?
Spouses cause ' more stress than our bosses '
Spouses are a bigger source of stress than bosses , research shows .
There may be no place like home , but if you want to relax then you might be better off at work , according to the survey .
The poll of 3,000 men and women also found that husbands are more likely to send their wives ' blood pressure soaring than the other way round .
Overall , 58 per cent of those surveyed said their spouse or partner was among those who put them under pressure .
Just 43 per cent said the same of their manager .
And 18 per cent of women said their partner added a lot of stress to their life – compared with just 12 per cent of men .
There may be no place like home , but if you want to relax then you might be better off at work , according to a survey .
( Posed by models )
Cary Cooper , professor of health psychology at Lancaster University , said it appeared that people were taking their work troubles home with them .
Fears about job losses during the recession are likely to be making matters worse .
He said : ' One coping strategy people have when they are feeling insecure is to take it out on their spouses .
' One of the causes of stress is the long hours culture .
If you consistently put in long hours , it will damage your health and also your relationship at home . '
The professor added that juggling family duties and a career can mean that women are under more stress than men .
However , they cope with it better , mainly because they find it easier to talk to others about their feelings .
The poll , by electronics and healthcare manufacturer Philips , also found that women worry more about their weight than their earnings .
Almost half said their weight was very important to their health and wellbeing , compared to 27 per cent who said the same about their salary .
Women were also twice as likely to worry about the effect of obesity on their future health than the impact of high cholesterol or even cancer .
Just 36 per cent of men thought their weight was very important to their health and wellbeing , while 33 per cent said it had more to do with wages .
Those polled were optimistic about the future , with almost half believing they will outlive the average life expectancy of 79 .
Three per cent expect to reach 100 , with many believing that by the time they get seriously ill , advances in medical technology will provide the cure .
Fugitive gunman ' wants suicide by cop ' : Bouncer who gunned down ex and her boyfriend taunts police with 999 call after shooting officer
Massive manhunt launched to catch armed suspect
Gunman claims lover was in affair with police officer
Policeman shot in unprovoked attack
Police fear grudge against couple is now aimed at them
Suspect had ' previously threatened victim with gun '

The sister of the young mother fighting for her life after being shot by killer gunman Raoul Moat said he would rather ' go out in a blaze of glory ' than give himself up .
The shocking claim comes after after police launched a huge manhunt for Raoul Thomas Moat , 37 , who allegedly targeted his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , 22 , and executed her lover Chris Brown , 29 .
Earlier today
Moat shot and injured uniformed police officer in an unprovoked attack .
The burly ex-nightclub doorman would attempt to commit ' suicide by cop ' than kill himself , said Kelly Stobbart , 27 , the half - sister of his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart .
Kelly , who is in hiding , said : ' He 's a coward and he has n't got the bottle to shoot himself .
' He 'd wants a stand off with the police , so they 'll either have to shoot him in the knees or kill him .
He wants to be known as a guy who went to prison because he shot a load of coppers or who died trying .
' He 's a nutter and he 's definitely not going to give himself up .
We are all terrified that he 's coming after us . '
Kelly , a mother of two young children , said she had not yet been allowed to visit Samantha , who is in a critical condition in hospital because of a long - running family dispute .
She said her 22 - year - old sister had been infatuated with Moat .
' Sam thought he was the bees knees .
Her problem was that she could not see above Raoul 's chest .
He 's all muscles , rippling biceps , six pack , " Kelly said .
' He 's all chest but he had a tiny waist and could fit into a pair of my size eight jeans .
' He 's got a face like a horse chewing a wasp .
You would n't say that to his face though .
He thinks he 's God 's gift but he 's the most ugly thing I have seen . '
Kelly said that Moat had a jealous personality and that he and Sam would frequently row .
She would then flee and stay with family members but Moat would sweet talk her into returning home .
' He 'd come round and soft soap her and she 'd disappear off and then we'd not hear from her for days because we knew she 'd gone back to him and she knew we'd tell her she was a fool for doing it , ' Kelly said .
She said that she did not know Moat had been released from prison on Thursday but said he had been jailed for assaulting a child .

Describing him as vain , Kelly added : ' Raoul 's completely unpredictable because of the steroids .
He has to have them , he 's addicted .
' He injects them and not only steroids , he also injects himself with tanning drugs to keep himself brown .
He would also wander around the supermarket with tiny skin tight jeans and sleeveless t- shirts , thinking all the girls were loving it . '
Kelly said Moat had contacts with the Newcastle underworld and believed they could be hiding him .
' He is involved with some very shady people and they will be hiding him out , " she said .
He loves that fact that he thinks people are scared of him .
He once threatened to ' car boot ' my brother and bury him .
He wants to be known as the big hard man .
He 's out of control and he 'll never give himself up .
' Raoul 's jealous that Sam got with someone else .
He always said that if he could n't have her , no one else would .
Asked if she had a message for Moat , the mother - of - two said : ' Either hand yourself in or do the decent thing and kill yourself . '
The ' unprovoked ' attack on a police officer earlier today is being linked to a double shooting less than 24 hours earlier .
Senior police officers this afternoon revealed Moat had called them to claim Ms Stobbart , a young mother , was having an affair with a police officer .
They fear the grudge Moat held against the couple has now been switched to the police force which is hunting him .

The former doorman was named as the man they want to question urgently in connection with both shootings , the first of which took place just a day after he was released from prison .
Temporary Chief Constable Sue Sim said : ' This was an unprovoked attack on a Northumbria police officer as he carried out his duty .
' We strongly believe that this was carried out by the same man who shot two people in Gateshead early yesterday morning .
' Raoul Thomas Moat is a wanted man .
He is very dangerous and should not be approached by members of the public .
' We know that Moat held a grudge against the people he targeted in Gateshead yesterday .
' It is now believed that his grudge at the moment is with the police . '
Pc David Rathband , 42 , a motor patrol officer , was blasted as he was carrying out a ' static patrol ' on a roundabout joining the A1 and A69 in East Denton , Newcastle , at around 12.45 am .

The married father - of - two is currently being treated in Newcastle General Hospital where his condition is described as ' critical ' .
Today , scores of forensic officers were investigating the Volvo patrol car the officer had been driving before he was shot .
During a press conference this afternoon , Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Anderson revealed Moat had spoken to officers around the time of the shooting of Pc Rathband .
' Yesterday you contacted the police and it is clear that you believe certain things to be true which I would like to clarify with you now .
' You have told us that the police are not taking you seriously .
We are .
I want you to know that you have our full attention , innocent people have been hurt .
This must stop now .
' You believe that Sam was having an affair with a Northumbria Police officer .
Sam has told us this is not true .
Our enquiries have verified this .
' Chris Brown , who was shot and killed yesterday , was not and never has been a Northumbria Police officer or in any way connected with Northumbria Police . '
He said he knew Moat was concerned for the future well - being of his three children .
' For their sake , this has to stop now , ' he said .
' These are not the memories that your children need to have of their father .
Enough people have been hurt .
You need to make contact with us now . '
Mr Adamson said victim Chris Brown , who had moved to the area from Slough , had never been a Northumbria police officer and was not connected with the force in any way .
The karate instructor had only recently become involved with Ms Stobbart .
Ms Sim said that despite being seriously injured , Pc Rathband had managed to provide colleagues with extremely valuable information , ' demonstrating his absolute professionalism in the most extreme circumstances ' .
The condition of the officer , who works in Newcastle , was described as ' critical but stable ' .
' This was an unprovoked attack on a Northumbria police officer as he carried out his duty , ' she said .

' I have personally visited David in hospital this morning and our thoughts are with his family and colleagues at this time .
' Understandably we are all shocked and upset by unfolding events , but I want to stress how proud I am of every single officer and member of staff who is involved in this incident and the way they have responded to this incident . '
She added : ' We are absolutely committed to finding the man who did this . '
On Friday night , the day after he was released , Moat issued a chilling warning on his Facebook site saying : ‘ Just got out of jail .
I ’ve lost everything , my business , my property and to top it all off my lass of six years has gone off with someone else .
‘ I ’m not 21 and I ca n’t rebuild my life .
Watch and see what happens . ’
Moat , who was released from Durham prison on Thursday having served a sentence for assault , went on the run after the shootings at around 2.30 am yesterday and is believed to be armed and dangerous

She was hit in the stomach when the gunman opened fire with a shotgun , blasting her through the living room window .
Miss Stobbart 's grandmother Agnes Hornsby , 69 , said Miss Stobbart would stay with her when things were going wrong with Moat , usually provoked by violence .
She said Moat turned up at her house in Gateshead one evening last year wielding a gun as he believed Miss Stobbart was with another man .
' He threatened us with a gun when she was here , ' she said , ' All because she 'd put on her Facebook that she was going out with a friend .
' He came here and said ' " you 've got a man in there " and I said ' there 's no men in this house , it 's me , Sam and Chanel . '
' He had a gun then and he was out there for about two hours and she was on the phone to him trying to calm him down . '

Ms Hornsby said she told Moat she would report him to the police , but he replied ' If you phone the police I 'll get some of them before they get me . '
She has not seen her granddaughter , who is her daughter Lesley 's daughter , since she left in a hurry in June last year when Moat came to pick her up .
Miss Stobbart and Moat had been living together for around six years , she said , and had a daughter Chanel , who is around two years old .
Ms Hornsby said her granddaughter had been physically abused by Moat .
' He 's got a violent temper , ' she said .
' Once he loses his temper he lashes out , of course she was always the nearest one and then she used to come here .
' He split her head open one night .
From what she told me he threw her against a wall and jumped on her stomach . '
Moat is believed to have killed Ms Stobbart ’s new boyfriend - thought to be a karate instructor and nightclub bouncer in his late 20s or early 30s - on a patch of grass outside the house .
Terrified neighbours dialled 999 and police and paramedics rushed to the scene in Birtley , Chester - le - Street , Co. Durham .
[ caption ]
Yesterday Detective Superintendent Steve Howes , the senior officer in charge of the manhunt , warned people not to approach Moat .
He said : ‘ We believe he targeted the two victims because of a grudge he harboured against them .
This was not a random attack - the people involved are all known to each other . ’
He said a team of 50 officers were involved in the search .
A friend of Samantha said : ‘ All her family are at the hospital - she ’s in a serious condition .
Everyone is praying she pulls through this .’
Neighbour George Williamson , 50 , told how his son came face - to - face with the gunman .
He said : ‘ My son heard the shots and went out to see what was happening .
Then the lad shot the girl in the house through the window .
He then pointed the gun at my son , but turned and shot the lad who was lying on the field . ’
Moat may be heading for France , Samantha ’s family said last night .
Her grandmother Ann Hornsby , 69 , said : ‘ Raoul ’s mum is French and I would have thought he would have gone straight back to France . ’

Moat and Samantha had a child together , Chanel , who is aged three - and - a - half .
Moat has also two other children by former partner Marissa Ree. Mary Hall , 63 , a neighbour living close to the scene , said she saw the gunman fire at the young woman through the living room window of her home .
Mrs Hall said she could also see a woman in the house screaming , apparently on the phone to the police , and thought it was the mother of the woman who was shot .
' The man shot through the window and shot the girl , ' she told the Northern Echo .
' I saw a figure of a man with a handgun .
' It 's all very shocking as there are a lot of old age pensioners around here and you do n't expect this to happen . '

Another local resident , who did not wish to be named , said : ' I did n't see it happen but I heard a few loud bangs that must have been gun shots .
' There was a police helicopter hovering around for a long time .
' It 's a really quiet area , it 's residential you know , so it 's a total shock . '
The area around Scafell is quiet and residential , consisting of a cluster of houses and bungalows .
A police tent was this afternoon still in place on the grassy area at the scene , covering the spot where the man 's body was found .
Around ten forensics officers could also be seen carrying out their investigations around the tent and at houses in the area .
A heavy police presence guarded various positions around and within the wide police cordon that included the green space , several houses and bungalows and many streets in the vicinity .
A number of residents sporadically peered out of the windows as the police carried out their investigations , but few ventured onto the streets .

In 1965 the " official " shooting war was less than a year old and already a growing number of people were starting to question what we were doing in Vietnam in the first place .
The logic behind waging a war where there seemed to be no clear solution , other than hearing the fear card played over and over that it was part of the " domino theory " of Communist domination over the far east , that India could fall under the influence of the Kremlin and that , if India went , would Japan be far behind were the constant warnings being trotted out in order to justify escalation .
1965 was a pivotal year for the war in Vietnam because it signified a point where America would either be bogged down in a protracted war and propping up a corrupt and ineffective government or it would go in , makes it point and leave .
Unfortunately it was a situation that had a long history and one which was n't going to be settled anywhere near 1965 .
There is an eerie similarity to our current state of affairs in Iraq and Afghanistan and those in Vietnam .
In 1965 the fear card was Communism and in 2002 the fear card was Terrorism .
Both are situations we 've found ourselves in where there was no easy way to extricate ourselves - a hopeless tumor that hemorrhages lives .
In late June 1965 , ABC Radio aired a special " Dialogue And Decision " .
Hosted by a young Ted Koppel , the program tries to give some background ( and try to make sense ) out of a war that was quickly spiraling out of control with seemingly no solution at hand .
Sounds familiar , does n't it ?
by Jessica Thomas , Personal Trainer
The biggest reason people can’t find motivation to lose weight is due to unrealistic goals .
Expecting overnight success at a diet or exercise plan simply is n’t realistic .
When desired weight loss goals are n’t reached quickly , most people assume they have failed .
To lose weight successfully , it ’s better to focus on reaching your goals over time , and to realize that there will be small setbacks along the way .
Many people tend to focus on their shortcomings , but if you accept yourself as you are it will be easier to focus more on your positive side and work towards becoming slim and attractive .
Weight Loss Motivational Techniques
Why do you want to lose weight ?
If you ’re struggling with being overweight , you need to ask yourself this question .
For example , are you getting married and need motivation to lose weight for the wedding ?
Are you simply trying to get into your favorite pair of jeans again ?
Do you have a serious health problem that requires you to lose weight ?
Have you tried healthy things like drinking green tea to lose weight ?
Once you determine why you want to lose weight , it will be easier to set a goal and get motivated to work towards it .
One of the biggest reasons for weight loss failure is that dieters often set unrealistic goals .
Many of us want to shoot for the moon , but we tend to get overwhelmed by the day - to - day realities of sticking with a diet plan .
That ’s why it ’s important to chart your progress in a weight loss journal .
Seeing incremental improvements like a pound lost or an inch gone from your waist line can boost your motivation and keep you on the path .
Setting realistic and achievable goals has the advantage of focusing your mind on the here and now .
A goal is like a promise to yourself .
Wanting to keep the promise is what creates motivation .
If the goal is too hard to achieve , you may give up .
For example , if you say to yourself , “ I have to lose 10 pounds this week ! ” then you are setting yourself up for failure before you ’ve even begun .
“ Self - sabotage ” happens when you set goals that are not realistically achievable in the short or medium - term .
Of course , motivation to lose weight fast is important , but it ’s the process itself that you should be focused on .
For this reason , you need to take small steps toward your long - term goal .
As you achieve each small step it gives you the forward momentum to take your motivation a step further .
Before you know it , you ’ve achieved bigger goals than you ever thought you could .
Visualize Your Weight - Loss Goal
One of the best ways to accomplish a goal is to visualize it actually happening .
Successful athletes are known to visualize their goals on a regular basis .
Diet counselors also say that one of the best ways to remain motivated to lose weight is to visualize your body after your weight loss goals are achieved .
For example , imagine yourself a year from now .
After sticking with your weight loss and exercise plan , how will you look and feel 12 months from now ?
How might your life be different after you lose the weight for good ?
Imagine yourself fit , healthy and with more self - confidence .
Try to create a picture in your mind of how your life is going to be better if you lose the weight , and worse if you do n’t .
Carry this picture with you until you have a clear sense of purpose .
When that purpose is there , you will find that you have the motivation to lose weight that you ’ve been searching for .
Remember that the deeper purpose that motivates you is the fundamental step to weight loss success .
Sure , there are lots of famous quotes on motivation to lose weight , but at the end of the day , it has to come from within you .
Decide clearly on what your purpose and goal is , and you will find yourself moving towards it slowly but surely .
A weight loss success story will be yours to tell if you learn to live in the moment , and take pleasure in achieving small , daily goals .
This is one of the most basic and important weight loss tips you will ever receive .

Today should be a historic moment for the field of astronomy .
With a single data release , the team behind NASA 's Kepler instrument has nearly doubled the number of extrasolar planets we 're aware of , including many that fall between the sizes of Earth and Neptune , a class of planets that was poorly represented in our existing collection .
Instead , NASA 's handling of the announcement appears to have been very confused , and attention will likely focus on the candidate planets that were left out : 400 objects that are even smaller than the ones being announced .
The decision to hold back on the most Earth - like objects had been made months ago .
The intent is to allow the project scientists the chance to confirm these are not false positives and to have priority in publishing on the exoplanets .
These candidates are mentioned only once in a draft paper that describes the data that is being released .
Referring to Earth 's radius as Re , the draft states , " those [ stars ] with the small - size candidates ( ie , those with radii less than 1.5 Re ) , are among the 400 withheld targets and are thus not among those considered here . "
That controversy aside , NASA 's handling of the data release has been positively bizarre .
Word of the hundreds of new planets in the data release appears to have been first disclosed by The New York Times .
A NASA video describing the data appeared briefly on YouTube , but was then pulled , while two draft papers that describe some of the results appeared in the arXiv last night .
But , despite the apparent publicity , NASA has remained silent .
There have been no releases about the data , and NASA 's Kepler mission page still lists its planet count as an anemic five .
It 's not clear what exactly is going on with the space agency .
Fortunately , there are the draft papers in the arXiv to rely on .
One of them describes five systems that appear to be hosts to multiple planets ( one with at least three , the rest with at least two ) .
All of these appear to be very heavy planets — the smallest , at a minimum , is five times the mass of Earth — but three of them are fairly compact , with radii that are less than three times that of Earth's .
Most of them have orbital periods of less than 20 days , so the authors expect that we 'll be able to observe changes in orbital dynamics of some of these systems as these heavy bodies exert gravitational pulls on each other .
But it 's the full catalog of objects that Kepler appears to be tracking that 's really jaw dropping .
Prior to these results , we were aware of 460 exoplanets , most of them big .
The typical planet identified by transit observations ( the method used by Kepler ) was about 13 Re .
The data that has been released includes about 100 planets that are somewhere between two and four Earth radii — and that 's excluding up to 400 smaller objects .
Kepler 's total exoplanet candidate list ( including those 400 ) is over 700 .
The bias towards large planets in our existing catalog was at least partially a product of the fact that bigger objects are easier to detect .
But the Kepler data seems to put to rest any question of whether it was also the product of a real bias towards the formation of heavy planets .
In the area that Kepler 's imaging , the authors conclude :
Small candidate planets with periods less than 30 days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than 30 days and that the ground - based discoveries are sampling the large - size tail of the size distribution .
Note that for a substantial range of planet sizes , a 1 / R2 curve fits the Kepler data well .
Assuming the false positive rate and other biases discussed above are independent of planet size for planets larger than two Earth radii , this implies that the frequency of planets decreases with the area of the planet .
In other words , for at least those planets close to their host stars , there seem to be a lot more Earth analogs than super - Jupiters .
Kepler will continue to train its 95 megapixel eye on over 150,000 stars within its study area for several years more .
As time goes on , it 's more likely to spot and validate transits of planets further from the host stars , including some that may be able to play host to water in its liquid form .
Hopefully , NASA will have its house a bit more in order as the future data comes in — and when the 400 systems currently being withheld are released this coming February .

Pianist Lang Lang surprised his audience in a San Francisco concert when he performed the encore on his iPad .
He used the Magic Piano iPad application from Smule in the performance .
While I had seen this application before and knew that it was a serious music application , not only a toy , it had never crossed my mind that a professional pianist would use it in a concert .
I do n’t know why , as almost all music these days has at least a couple of electronic instruments playing .
I guess we do live in interesting times for every one .

As you may know , I ’ve been doing a lot of researching and thinking about post Firefox 4 Home Tab during my internship here at Mozilla .
I ’ve taken the research I ’ve conducted , my colleagues thinking , experience and ideas , along with my own experience and ideas and put together some wireframes .
These sketches represent some very basic directions that we could take with the Home Tab .
It ’s important to note that these concepts represent some very basic and rough ideas of what the home tab could look like in the future .
These are in no way absolute directions , but rather provide some jumping off points for future work .
That being said , let ’s frame these concepts a bit better .
I ’ve been thinking about the word “ Home ” and it ’s meaning for a while .
So , what does it mean and how am I using it ?
Home : a place to store my stuff .
I define home here as a place to store my stuff .
This is a very basic definition and certainly does not cover all uses of the word but I ’ve found it adequate for my research .
I ’ve also done some research looking at current ‘ start ’ pages on the web , as well as some academic research .
Currently most of these ‘ start ’ pages allow you to collect things , put your things in ‘ boxes ’ , they allow for customization , and usually have some sort of quick access links .
But , … they still do n’t understand me !
What we really need is a better way to organize and collect my online data , all of it .
We need a way to help me find stuff I ’ve put online , stuff my friends have put online , and general online trends .
We need a way of representing the relationships between these things .
We need to better understand people ’s locations and how that effects browsing habits .
Furthermore , we need a way for me to discover new things , not just random things ( which is entertaining at times ) , but things that matter to me .
I ’ve also identified some keywords that I think are important in going forward with my research : Personal , Fast , Digestible , Easy , Stable , Findable , Discoverable , and Delightful .
With this basic framing in place we can now begin to explore this design space via some concepts .
( Please note that I did not wireframe all my ideas , concepts , and sketches but rather only a subset of these )
Sessions & Discover
The Sessions & Discover concept illustrates many ideas .
First , you have a basic session restore feature that allows you to save and restore browsing session with ease .
The sites feature is basically a location aware list of your favorite bookmarks .
The Links feature is a listing of all the links , photos , videos , etc that you have shared across the web ; this makes finding these links much easier as they are likely pretty important to you .
Next up we have the Discover feature .
This feature is a way for Firefox to show you things that you are interested in that you might not have discovered yet .
For instance , if you were big into photography , like me , Firefox might ‘ know ’ this by your browsing history , bookmarks , etc .
Firefox could then easily find other websites and applications that you are likely to be interesting to you .
On the very right is the Contacts feature .
This feature collects all of your contacts from across the web and lets you know who is online in a open , non-platform binding manner .
Many of these features are included in other concepts below .
Drawers
The Drawers concept includes features such as Sites , Links , and Contacts .
Furthermore it features a Downloads section which lists all of your downloads for greatly findability .
History is located on the left side of the browser and slides out , as a drawer , to list your browsing history .
Additionally a Discover drawer is located on the right which also slides out and shows things that you could discover .
WordPress
The WordPress concept takes many of the above features and puts them in a very familiar WordPress like layout .
This would allow for a more detail per individual feature while still being navigatable .
Furthermore , this concept features a Personal Search which allows you to search across all of your personal items , history , links , etc .
Post in the Middle
The Post in the Middle concept shows many of the same features as the concepts above .
Additionally , this concept features a quick post area that allows for quickly posting to a blog ; as well as a simple ToDo list .
Spokes
The Spokes concept is a way to show the relationships of your data to you .
You could click on the Sites icon to see your bookmarks , or click on Contacts to see a listing of friends ; from there you could dive deeper to take a look at what links you have shared with a particular friend , or what links they have shared with you .
Left Nav
The Left Nav is a concept that shows greater details for each feature while still providing easy , very common , navigation .
Grid
The Grid concept is a way to show lots of information in an overview like state .
Individual items could be drilled down into to see more detail and information .
Furthermore , this concept has a Web Clips feature which would allow you to ‘ clip ’ a certain part of a website and have it shown and updated on your home page ( shopping for prices , game scores , etc ) .
The Events feature shows you events in your local area that you might be interested and could also pull information in from various calendars .
As a Site
The As a Site concept shows what Firefox Home Tab could look like as a website .
This could allow you to use a friends computer , but log into Firefox and have access to all of your data .
Timeline
The Timeline concept shows your history , discovery items , and trending topics in a timeline view .
This view shows history along a timeline as well as showing ‘ future history ’ , Discovery towards the front .
This allows for a great mental model of things that you might be interested in going to , but have not yet visited .
Individual favicons would be displayed along the top of the line if a topic / website is trending across the web or below the line if a topic / website is more personal to just you .
Each favicon could be clicked to see more information .
Additionally , a slider along the bottom of the page allows for different zoom levels to get a broad or vary narrow view of your personal timeline .
Hitchhiker ’s Guide
The Hitchhiker ’s Guide concept is directly inspired from the book interface of the movie .
This provides a delightful way of exploring your personal information gathered from across the web .
Feedback , Critique , and Future Directions
I presented these ideas and concepts to the Firefox UX team , of which I ’m a proud proud member !
My colleagues gave me great feedback , critique , and suggestions .
Some feedback that I recieved was that there was n’t always a clear visual hierarchy to these designs , there was a desire to see other firefox content within these concepts , that clips and contacts are great , worry about how to show different web applications ( not app tabs ) , a worry about Links vs Sites , thoughts on how to scale these ideas to other devices , thoughts on sharing things via the browser , comments on how to make Firefox Home Tab more personal , as well as how to show that things are private and secure , and much much more .
Future directions include iterating on these and other ideas , ideating on my colleagues great feedback and critique , and getting more public feedback .
Furthermore , I wish to explore more design inspiration for future interfaces .
I also wish to further think about how concepts might scale to other devices , and how to make the home tab much more personal .
It has been approximately six months since we launched the Chromium Security Reward program .
Although still early days , the program has been a clear success .
We have been notified of numerous bugs , and some of the participants have made it clear that it was the reward program that motivated them to get involved with Chromium security .
We maintain a list of issued rewards on the Chromium security page .
As the list indicates , a range of researchers have sent us some great bugs and the rewards are flowing !
This list should also help answer questions about which sort of bugs might qualify for rewards .
Today , we are modifying the program in two ways :
The maximum reward for a single bug has been increased to $ 3,133.7 .
We will most likely use this amout for SecSeverity - Critical bugs in Chromium .
The increased reward reflects the fact that the sandbox makes it harder to find bugs of this severity .
Whilst the base reward for less serious bugs remains at $ 500 , the panel will consider rewarding more for high - quality bug reports .
Factors indicating a high - quality bug report might include a careful test case reduction , an accurate analysis of root cause , or productive discussion towards resolution .
Thanks to everyone who contributes to Chromium security , and here ’s looking forward to our first elite entrant !
UPDATE : We 've had a few questions about whether we pay rewards in cases where the bug comes to us via a vulnerability broker .
Bugs reported in this way are not likely to generate Chromium rewards .
We encourage researchers to file bugs directly with us , as doing so helps us get started sooner on fixes and removes questions about who else may have access to the bug details .
We 'd also remind researchers that we do n't necessarily require a working exploit in order to issue a reward .
For example , evidence of memory corruption would typically be sufficient .

One of the prevailing themes at the Computex conference this week is the coming onslaught of Android - based tablets .
The iPad is leading the tablet charge -- selling more than two million units in less than two months since its initial launch , but some of the Android tablets could be formidable challengers to Apple 's de facto tablet dominance .
Let 's take a look at five things that may make Android - based tablets better business tools , and better mobile computing platforms for business professionals than the Apple iPad .
These factors should be cause for Apple to be concerned about the Android invasion .
1. True Multitasking .
The iPad and Android - based tablets are each built on a smartphone mobile OS foundation , but a tablet is not a smartphone .
The larger form factor and unique functionality of the tablet demand a multitasking interface capable of running apps in the background .
Apple has unveiled that iPhone OS 4.0 will include multitasking , but it is still a limited multitasking approach built around specific scenarios and APIs .
Google 's Android OS provides true multitasking .
2. Less Restrictive App Market .
Apple boasts nearly 200,000 apps , so there is certainly no shortage of utilities for the iPhone and iPad platforms .
However , Apple has an arcane and strict approval process that many developers find frustrating .
What angers developers even more is when Apple changes the rules after the fact and removes previously - approved apps from the app store .
Developers are not as likely to invest significant time and effort creating apps that Apple may or may not approve , and may subsequently ban even after they 're approved .
3. Adobe Flash .
Do I even need to say anymore ?
The battle between Apple and Adobe over the exclusion of the ubiquitous Flash technology from the iPhone and iPad platforms is as public as it is heated .
There are passionate views on both sides , and there are some valid points for why Apple wants to avoid Flash .
Still , Flash is popular and forms the backbone of much of the content currently on the Web , so Flash compatibility stands out as a defining feature of non-iPad tablets .
4. Hardware Diversity .
Variety is the spice of life .
One person may think that a 9 - inch tablet is perfect , while another may feel it's too bulky and opt for the smaller Dell Streak .
The thickness and weight of the tablet may be the most important factors to one person , while the next person may be willing to trade some size and weight for more storage capacity , or more USB or SD memory card ports .
The iPad is the iPad .
You can choose 3G , or not 3G , and what storage capacity you want , but there is really only one hardware platform to choose from .
Android tablets will provide business professionals with a wide variety of form factors and features to meet their unique needs and preferences .
5. Carrier Diversity .
Like the hardware platform , businesses and business professionals also need options when it comes to the carrier providing wireless connectivity for the device .
The Apple iPad , like the Apple iPhone , is locked in to AT&T .
Business professionals that do not wish to do business with AT&T , or are already engaged in a long - term wireless contract with a competing carrier may be reluctant to activate service with AT&T .
The recent changes eliminating unlimited data plans for the iPad - - unveiled only two months after the iPad was launched , might also turn some users off .
Android tablets may be offered from a variety of carriers , giving businesses some choice in determining the provider with the best coverage , or best pricing , to meet their needs .
The iPad has a significant headstart .
Most of the Android tablets will not hit the street until later this year .
If Apple maintains its current pace and continues to march toward selling 10 million iPads in 2010 , there will be nearly 10 million tablet customers that will already be invested in Apple .
Many business professionals will hold out , though .
Either they do n't like Apple , or they do n't like AT&T , or they simply feel the iPad does n't meet their needs .
Apple should be concerned about the Android invasion , and aggressively working to develop an iPad 2.0 that incorporates at least some of these features , and includes some innovations to raise the bar and continue to blaze new tablet trails .

Image caption Red kites were fitted with satellite tags for the schools project
A red kite has been found dead at a wind farm which RSPB Scotland had objected to because of concerns the turbines were a threat to rare birds .
The bird was one of three kites , adopted by primary schools , which the BBC Scotland news website reported last week as having gone missing .
The raptor was found at Fairburn wind farm , near Dingwall .
Its injuries included fractures and bruising .
Scottish and Southern Energy said it was also probing the death at its site .
Last Friday , BBC Scotland reported how three kites were missing from RSPB Scotland 's Eyes to the Skies project .
Pupils had nicknamed the satellite - tagged kites Tweety Pie - the one found at the wind farm - Sky and Ruby .
The RSPB was investigating the deaths of the other two birds - one which " perished in unusual circumstances " and the other in an accident .
Scottish and Southern Energy said it had notified the authorities as soon as the kite was found .
WHOA .

That 's a pretty nifty feature .
Alright , this 3D Stereo thing is pretty cool , but unfortunately , I can not see it .
Orz I just cannot ... and it really hurts my eyes when I try .
I love the art you 've been posting lately .
It 's like something from a dystopic science fiction novel / movie and I love the feel of that .
I like the sort of glowy lighting here .
It makes it look like the scene is underground or some kind of lower level .
Makes me want to look up and around and see more .

Aretha Franklin Sings “ America The Beautiful ” At Wrestlemania
Back in 1987 , the WWF invited Aretha Franklin to kick off Wrestlemania 3 in Detroit by singing “ America The Beautiful . ”
It ’s tough to think of a more American moment than that .
Happy 4th of July !
While the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ( FCIC ) held a series of panels over the last two days in order to investigate the cause of the financial crisis , two panels on Thursday wound up focusing more on mortgage fraud and the government ’s attempt to circumvent it .
Thursday ’s panels , which included Eric Holder , U.S. Attorney General , spoke of the attempts the state and federal government were taking to prosecute mortgage fraud .
Holder noted that the FBI is currently in the process of investigating over 2,800 cases of mortgage fraud , an increase of more than five times from 2004 .
Of those cases , 1,842 involved more than $ 1 million in losses .
As of November , federal charges relating to mortgage fraud were pending against 826 defendants .
Reverse mortgage fraud was alluded to in the written testimony of Lanny Breuer , Assistant Attorney General , Criminal Division , but was not specifically a focus of the inquiry or any of the panelists .

During the panels , an interesting issue was raised by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers .
Both attorney generals complained that the federal government had impeded their attempts at investigating mortgage fraud — especially on a larger scale .
Suthers , in his written remarks , wrote , “ With respect to the few laws we did have back in 2005 , we were largely powerless to enforce those laws against national banks and their lending affiliates and subsidiaries due to the aggressive stance federal regulators took to preempt state law , even with respect to predatory lending and deceptive advertising . ”
Wrote Madigan , “ In fact , in response to aggressive actions at the state level , federal regulators took unprecedented steps to shield national lenders and their subsidiaries from state enforcement and from the growing number of state anti-predatory lending laws on the books .
The states have been leaders in enacting regulation to address the worst abuses in the mortgage industry . ”
These issues were expanded upon during the panel testimony .
Alleged Madigan , “ In the years preceding the crisis , federal regulators often showed no interest in exercising their regulatory authority , or worse , actively hampered state authority . ”
It remains unclear what recommendations will emerge as a result of the FCIC ’s investigation .
Their report is due on December 15 , 2010 .

Flickr 's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo
Date Published : Sep. 28 , 2009 Advisory ID : MOCB-01
Advisory URL : http://netifera.com/research/flickr_api_signature_forgery.pdf
Title : Flickr 's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability Remotely Exploitable : Yes
1. Vulnerability Description
Flickr is almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing application in the world .
As of June 2009 , it claims to host more than 3.6 billion images .
In order to allow independent programmers to expand its services , Flickr offers a fairly comprehensive web - service API that allows programmers to create applications that can perform almost any function a user on the Flickr site can do .
The Flickr 's API consists of a set of callable methods , and some API endpoints .
To perform an action using the Flickr 's API , you need to select a calling convention , send a request to its endpoint specifying a method and some arguments , and will receive a formatted response .
Many methods require the user to be logged in .
At present there is only one way to accomplish this .
Users should be authenticated using the Flickr Authentication API .
Any applications wishing to use the Flickr Authentication API must have already obtained a Flickr 's API Key .
An 8 - byte long ' shared secret ' for the API Key is then issued by Flickr and cannot be changed by the users .
This secret is used in the signing process , which is required for all API calls using an authentication token .
In addition , calls to the flickr.auth .* methods and login URLs pointing to the auth page on Flickr must also be signed .
For more details , please read the Flickr Authentication API Spec [ 1 ] .
This advisory describes a vulnerability in the signing process that allows an attacker to generate valid signatures without knowing the shared secret .
By exploiting this vulnerability , an attacker can send valid arbitrary requests on behalf of any application using Flickr 's API .
When combined with other vulnerabilities and attacks , an attacker can gain access to accounts of users who have authorized any third party application .
Additionally , if an application uses PHPFlickr >= 1.3.1 , an attacker can trick users of that application to visit arbitrary web sites .
This may apply for other Flickr 's API libraries and applications as well .
2. Vulnerable Web Services
A lot of other web sites provide API service whose architecture is the same as Flickr 's API .
They are potentially vulnerable .
We do n't have a complete list , but here are some notable web sites : * DivShare http://www.divshare.com/
* iContact http://www.icontact.com/
* Mindmeister http://www.mindmeister.com/
* Myxer http://www.myxer.com/
* Remember The Milk http://www.rememberthemilk.com/
* Scribd http://www.scribd.com/
* Vimeo http://www.vimeo.com/
* Voxel http://www.voxel.net/
* Wizehive http://www.wizehive.com/
* Zooomr http://www.zooomr.com/
Please note that we have n't tested these web sites .
They are included here because they describe the same signing process in their API documentation .
3. Vendor Information
An initial notification was sent to Yahoo !
Flickr on Sep. 5 , 2009 .
A copy of this advisory was sent to Yahoo !
Flickr on Sep. 13 , 2009 .
Yahoo !
Flickr replied on Sep. 14 , 2009 to acknowledge the vulnerability .
Yahoo !
Flickr sent us an email on Sep. 23 , 2009 to say that they were going to deploy a fix in the same week .
An initial notification was sent to the vendors listed in Section 2 on Sep. 17 , 2009 .
Another copy of this advisory was sent to them on Sep. 24 , 2009 .
Here are the responses from some of them :
* Remember The Milk said that they have investigated and confirmed that the Remember The Milk API is not vulnerable to this particular known issue .
* Vimeo tried to fix the issue by making sure that the first parameter after sorting is always api_key and failing if it is n't .
This fix does n't work because we can make the first parameter be api_key and still append new data to the request .
No other vendor provided details about their plans to deploy fixes .

5. Technical Description
In Section 5.1 we introduce Flickr 's API request signing process and its vulnerabilities .
In Section 5.2 we describe the length - extension attack against Merkle - Damgård hash .
In Section 5.3 we describe our attack against Flickr 's API .
In Section 5.4 we discuss some exploitations , and finally in Section 5.5 we suggest some solutions that may help to fix the vulnerability .
5.1 Flickr 's API Request Signing Process
Flickr requires that all API calls using an authentication token must be signed .
In addition , calls to the flickr.auth .* methods and the URLs that bring users to the application authorization page must also be signed .
The process of signing is as follows .
*
Sort your argument list into alphabetical order based on the parameter name .
* e.g. foo=1 , bar=2 , baz=3 sorts to bar=2 , baz=3 , foo=1 * concatenate the shared secret and argument name - value pairs * e.g. SECRETbar2baz3foo1 * calculate the md5 ( ) hash of this string * append this value to the argument list with the name api_sig , in hexadecimal string form , e.g. api_sig=1f3870be274f6c49b3e31a0c6728957f
There are two vulnerabilities in this signing process :
As there are no delimiters between the keys and values , the signature for " foo=bar " is identical to the signature for " foob=ar " ; moreover , the signature for " foo=bar&fooble=baz " is the same as the signature for " foo=barfooblebaz " .
See [ 2 ] for a similar vulnerability of Amazon Web Service .
As MD5 is vulnerable to length - extension attack ( see Section 5.2 ) , one can append arbitrary data to the request yet still can generate valid signature without knowing the secret key .
When combining with the first vulnerability , one can easily forge any request on behalf of any Flickr application .
5.2 Length - Extension Attack On MD5
In short , the length - extension attack on one - way hash construction is that you can , given h( m ) and len( m ) , you are able to compute h( m||pad( m ) ||m ' ) for any m' ( || stands for concatenation ) , even if you do n't know the entire m .
This attack works on all Merkle - Damgård hash ( see [ 4 , 5 ] ) such as MD0 - MD5 and SHA0 - SHA2 .
This is also called " message extension " or " padding " attack ( see [ 6 ] ) .
The rest of this section describes how this attack works on Flickr 's API 's MD5 signature .
What follows is technical .
You may want to skip reading it until you need it .
MD5 ( [ 3 ] ) follows the Merkle / Damgård iterative structure , where the hash is computed by the repeated application of a compression function to successive blocks of the message .
( See Figure 1 . )
For MD5 , the compression function takes two inputs — a 128 - bit chaining value and a 512 - bit message block — and produces as output a new 128 - bit chaining value , which is input into the next iteration of the compression function .
The message to be hashed is first padded to a multiple of 512 bits , and then divided into a sequence of 512 - bit message blocks .
Then the compression function is repeatedly applied , starting with an initial chaining value and the first message block , and continuing with each new chaining value and successive message blocks .
After the last message block has been processed , the final chaining value is output as the hash of the message .
Figure 1 . Merkle - Damgård hash construction ( copied from Wikipedia )
According to [ 7 ] , because of the iterative design , it is possible , from only the hash of a message and its length , to compute the hash of longer messages that start with the initial message and include the padding required for the initial message to reach a multiple of 512 bits .
( See Figure 2 . )
Applying this to Flickr 's API request signature , it follows that from MD5 ( SECRET||m ) , one can compute MD5 ( SECRET||m ' ) for any m ' that starts with m||p , where p is the Merkle - Damgård padding on SECRET||m .
To compute p , one just needs to know the length of SECRET||m , which is easy to calculate in Flickr 's API 's case .
In other words , from the signature of m , one can forge the API signature of m||p||x for any x , without even knowing the shared secret key , and without breaking MD5 in any sense .
Figure 2 . Length - extension attack on MAC = MD ( KEY||msg ) ( copied from [ 9 ] )
5.3 Our Attack
As described in Section 5.2 we require a message m and its signature to produce a longer message with a valid signature .
It is easy to obtain a request signed by the target third party application provider .
Flickr and many other Web 2.0 sites allows users to share data with third party applications without divulging the user 's credentials .
Users are transported to the Flickr web site where they are asked whether he / she wants to allow the application to access their data .
To achieve this the application providers ask the user to follow a link like this :
http://flickr.com/services/auth/?api_key=[api_key]&perms=[perms]&api_sig=[sig]
The api_key 16 bytes value identifies the application asking for permissions and api_sig is the signature of the request calculated using the secret shared between the application 's developer and Flickr .
This link is called login URL and is also a signed message which is all we need to perform the attack .
And we start working on our message forgery code , let 's see what we have : Message : SECRETapi_key [ api_key ] permsread ( sorted and concatenated without ' &= ' )
Signature : [ api_sig ]
Length : Length of Message + Length of SECRET
SECRET is the shared secret that Flickr and application owner do n't want to share with us and that we do n't need anyway .
Although the length of the padding is always between 9 and 64 bytes we need to know the exact size of the hashed data to reconstruct the sequence used as padding because this value is included in the ending 64 bits .
Based on the API documentation we can assume that the secret is 16 bytes .
We can append anything to the request and calculate its signature but we must keep the same prefix including the padding , fortunately we have a simple way to avoid that prefix being a limitation .
We can use the first char of the first variable as a variable name and all the rest of the original request including the hash padding as its value :
a=pikey[api_key]permsreadapi_sig[api_sig ][ padding ]&api_key=[api_key]&perms=delete&new_key=new_value ...
The annoying padding that includes non alphanumeric values and always contains null bytes becomes part of a variable that will be ignored .
The only limitation is that we cannot use new variable names that after sorting fall before the ' a ' variable but this is not a problem in practice because ' a ' is the first letter of the alphabet and there is n't any numeric API parameter name being used .
5.4 Exploitations
There are many ways one can exploit this vulnerability for fun and profit .
Below are what we have come up with .
Others may have better ways to exploit this vulnerability .
Please note that what we write here apply only for Flickr 's API .
This vulnerability may become much more - or - less dangerous in the context of other Flickr copycat API services .
However , it would be up to those who have more time and / or interest than us to test these services .
First off , an attacker can send arbitrary yet valid requests on behalf of any third party application .
This can be exploited to send requests using commercial API key which is AFAWK the same as non-commercial keys at the moment but this may change in the future .
This may also make the application be blocked by Flickr if the attacker sends abusive requests that violating TOS of Flickr 's API .
It is important to stress that this vulnerability alone does n't give an attacker immediately access to accounts of Flickr users , but being able to send arbitrary requests on behalf of any application brings him much closer to that goal .
In order to compromise the account of an user , the attacker needs to capture a ' frob ' or an ' auth_token ' from that user .
He can do that by attacking either the third party application or the user using techniques such as network sniffing or ARP / DNS spoofing or as simple as phishing .
Google may help too , as always .
Additionally , if an application uses PHPFlickr >= 1.3.1 , an attacker can trick users of that application to visit arbitrary web sites .
The login url accepts an undocumented ' extra ' parameter which is passed back by Flickr to the calling applications after the users finish authorizing the application .
PHPFlickr >= 1.3.1 will automatically treat the ' extra ' parameter as an URL , and redirect the users to it .
So if users click on a link like this :
http://www.flickr.com/services/auth/?a=pi_key[api_key]permsdelete[padding]&api_key=[api_key]&perms=read&api_sig=[api_sig]&extra=http://evil.com
where api_key belongs to some third party application using PHPFlickr , they 'll be immediately redirected to http://evil.com if they have already authorized that application .
This may lead to phishing or browser exploitation attacks .
You can see how this works by following these steps ( this may not work anymore if Yahoo ! has fixed the issue ) : * Authorize Preloadr which is an application that uses PHPFlickr >= 1.3.1 .
You can do that by access this link :
http://www.flickr.com/services/auth/?api_key=44fefa051fc1c61f5e76f27e620f51d5&extra=/login&perms=write&api_sig=38d39516d896f879d403bd327a932d9e
* Then click on this link :
http://www.flickr.com/services/auth/?a=pi_key44fefa051fc1c61f5e76f27e620f51d5extra/loginpermswrite%80%60%02&api_key=44fefa051fc1c61f5e76f27e620f51d5&extra=http://vnsecurity.net&perms=write&api_sig=a8e6b9704f1da6ae779ad481c4c165a3
would redirect you to http://vnsecurity.net.
This vulnerability may apply for other Flickr 's API libraries and applications as well .
Developers often use this ' extra ' parameter to implement a dynamic callback mechanism .
This may lead to total users ' accounts compromise if the developers also pass the ' frob ' they acquire from Flickr onto the ' extra ' URL .
Some sites include the original user 's request URL as ' extra ' value , which allows attackers to get signed login URLs containing arbitrary strings in the ' extra ' field .
5.5 Suggested Fixes
This attack could be detected and blocked using the padding bytes as signature , so a short term workaround is to deny all API calls containing 0x80 or 0x00 .
But filtering 0x80 or 0x00 would stop applications from sending requests containing Unicode text , so you may consider our next suggestion .
A long term solution is to switch to some other secure MAC implementations such as HMAC - SHA1 ( see [ 8 ] ) .
As most of the programming languages used both in the server and client side to work with web services provide access to HMAC functions , there is n't a good reason to use the message digest algorithms directly to generate a precarious signature .
The extension problem can be solved using a secure HMAC implementation but also is important to conserve the query structure in the signing input string .
As suggested by Alex Sotirov , we want to stress that some sites have a similar API that 's not vulnerable to our attack because they put the SECRET at the end rather than the beginning .
Facebook is one example , see http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Verifying_The_Signature .
Please note that although Facebook signing scheme is not vulnerable to length - extension attack , we do not recommend it because it may be vulnerable to other known attacks ( see [ 10 ] ) .
6. Conclusion
Length - extension attack on MAC implementation based on MD hash construction has been known in crypto academic community as early as 1992 ( see [ 6 ] ) .
After 17 years , however , we still have a large number of systems vulnerable to this simple attack .
What is even more surprising is the fact that we were the first to identify this vulnerability in such popular system like Flickr .
Since August 2009 we have been carrying out a research in which we test - run a number of identified practical crypto attacks on random widely - used software systems .
To our surprise , most , if not all , can be attacked by one or more of well - known crypto bugs .
This case is just one example .
We hope that publishing this vulnerability and other future results from our research would encourage the security community in taking a more serious look at crypto bugs in software system which is as pervasive as SQL Injection or XSS in early 2000 .
We hope you enjoy reading this advisory as much as we enjoy writing it .

Security costs for Pope ’s visit could run into hundreds of millions
Police forces in Lothian and Borders and Strathclyde in Scotland are reeling at a prediction that the cost of security for the Pope ’s visit to Glasgow could be as much as £ 70 million .
Terrorism expert David Capitanchik , from Robert Gordon University , in Aberdeen , says that the security operation for the Pope ’s Mass in Bellahouston Park could be on a par with that required for the G8 summit which was held in Gleneagles – and that cost £ 72 million .
Mr Capitanchik told the Scottish Daily Express : “ Strathclyde Police do not have the resources for this .
They do not have the number of officers needed for the huge counter - terrorism operation and to protect the large numbers of people in Glasgow from everyday crime at the same time . ”
The Scottish police forces , which are already facing substantial cutbacks , now say that central Government must provide more money for the event , but the Cabinet Office is insisting that the costs must come out of “ existing police budgets ” .
Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society , said : “ This is a massive amount of money to expect struggling local police authorities to find .
And we should remember that this is only for the first day .
When the Pope arrives in England , the security costs are likely to spiral into hundreds of millions of pounds as he holds giant masses in the Midlands and Hyde Park in London .
This needless spree has been dreamed up without any care for the cost which hard - pressed taxpayers will have to stump up . ”
Now senior Scottish civil servants will meet Foreign Office officials next week to try to negotiate money from central government to pay for the security .
An SNP spokesman said : " This week , the Scottish Government was invited , for the first time , onto the main UK planning group for the Papal visit , which we very much welcome .
Obviously , as a State Visit , there would be an expectation that Westminster would have a prime responsibility for security costs .
Strathclyde Police Authority chairman Stephen Curran said : " The outcome of these discussions is critical given the policing budget is already under considerable pressure . "
A Cabinet Office spokesman declined to discuss Thursday 's meeting , but said : " The Scottish Government and UK Government are working together closely , including on finance , to make this visit a success . "
But Scottish
Tory community safety spokesman Bill Aitken said : " It is concerning that , 10 weeks prior to this event , no funding arrangements have been agreed .
What has everybody been doing ?
Should the Scottish Government not have been making the appropriate noises earlier ? "
The Tablet reports today that the beatification ceremony is likely to be shifted from Coventry Airport to the former Longbridge car factory .
It also quotes Chief Constable Meredydd Hughes , the policing national coordinator for the UK papal visit , as saying : “ Security inside venues ( including crowd control and safety ) would normally be met by the event organisers , with minimal numbers of police officers being deployed . ”
He confirmed that the cost of policing , including personal protection for the Pope during the trip , would be met out of existing budgets .
At the time of the visit ’s announcement , the cost was set at £ 15 m ( excluding security ) with the Church setting itself a target contribution of £ 6.75 m .
It is understood that , so far , the Church has only raised £ 2.4 m from a mixture of donations and pledges .
They hope to raise a further £ 1 m by the national collection that took place on 23 May , although there were reports that the distribution of the relevant gift aid envelopes ( necessary to secure a charity tax subsidy that is presumably part of the target contribution of £ 6.75 m ) went awry .
After the appointment of Lord ( Chris ) Patten as government co-ordinator of the event , presumably to bring some control over the mounting chaos , the Church has confirmed that despite speculation of cancellations , the religious event in Bellahouston Park will go ahead as planned , although the Royal Parks are still saying that the Hyde Park event has not been confirmed .
Terry Sanderson said : “ We have written to Lord Patten requesting that no further taxpayers ’ money be pumped into this totally overblown and unnecessary event .
In a week when the Government has told us that it needs to make unprecedented cuts in public and welfare spending that will last for decades , the amount of taxpayer money that is being flung at this indulgent State visit is obscene . ”
Mr Sanderson said he did not hold out much hope that Lord Patten would listen and feared that the public purse is going to be opened to meet the shortfall .
Mr Sanderson commented that when the Pope had visited Germany , a minister there had jokingly remarked that it would have been cheaper to fly everyone who wanted to see him to Rome .
The way things are going , the same could apply here .

The trouble is that a large majority of users want custom menus and no two menus are the same .
There are tons of plugins that fix this problem in their own way .
Even some theme developers have integrated menus systems into their themes .
Unfortunately , all of these solutions are different .
We have n’t had a standard to go by , at least until now .
WordPress 3.0 will introduce a new navigation menu system .
Sure , there are some limitations with this system .
However , with a set standard , new plugins will likely emerge to fill in the gaps .
In this tutorial , I ’ll walk you through the features of the new system and how to build this into your theme if you ’re a developer .
# What the menu system offers
In WordPress 3.0 , you ’ll gain another admin screen under your Appearance menu called Menus .
In the screenshot below , I ’ve highlighted four key elements of the page .
Theme Locations :
If your theme supports nav menus , it ’ll register new locations for you to add your custom - created menus .

Individual Menus :
This is where the names of your menus will appear after you ’ve created them .

Add Menu Items :
There ’ll be several meta boxes containing pages , other post types , categories , other taxonomies , and custom links to your menus .

Menu Items :
Once you ’ve added menu items to your menu , they will appear under the menu for your configuration .
Each menu item can has its own configuration section too .
Once the item has been added to the menu , you can open it and edit its attributes , which are standard things you might want to change about any menu .

# Registering a menu for a theme ( theme location )
To associate specific menus with locations within our themes , we need to register these locations .
Otherwise , we wo n’t know which menu goes where .
There are two functions we can use for this :
register_nav_menu( ) : Registers a single theme location .
: Registers a single theme location .
register_nav_menus ( ) :
An array of locations we want to register .
In this example , we ’ll register a single menu called Primary Menu from our theme ’s functions .
php file .
add_action ( ' init ' , ' register_my_menu ' ) ; function register_my_menu( ) { register_nav_menu ( ' primary - menu ' , __( ' Primary Menu ' ) ) ; }
primary - menu is the slug we ’ll use to identify the menu in code .
Primary Menu is the label we ’ll use to identify the menu in the admin .
Building off that example , we ’ll create multiple menus , which is not much different than registering a single menu .
add_action ( ' init ' , ' register_my_menus ' ) ; function register_my_menus ( ) { register_nav_menus ( array ( ' primary - menu ' => __( ' Primary Menu ' ) , ' secondary - menu ' => __( ' Secondary Menu ' ) , ' tertiary - menu ' => __( ' Tertiary Menu ' ) ) ) ; }
# Displaying a nav menu
There are two ways to display a nav menu .
One is by calling wp_nav_menu ( ) within a theme template file .
The other is by using the Navigation Menu widget .
Displaying a menu within a theme template
Most themes will call a menu from their header .
php template , but menus can be placed anywhere .
The simplest form of calling a nav menu in a theme will look like this :
<?php wp_nav_menu( ) ; ?>
That will load the first menu the user created or fall back on a standard page list if no menus exist .
We want to have a bit more control than that though .
Let ’s call our menu from the previous section ( Primary Menu ) .
<?php wp_nav_menu ( array ( ' theme_location ' => ' primary - menu ' ) ) ; ?>
You ’re allowed even more control . wp_nav_menu( ) has several parameters you can use when displaying a menu .
theme_location :
The menu to call that is associated with the specific theme location .
: The menu to call that is associated with the specific theme location .
menu :
Call a specific menu ID , slug , or name .
: Call a specific menu ID , slug , or name .
container :
The element that wraps around the list .
The default is div but can be changed to nav if you ’ve moved on to HTML 5 .
: The element that wraps around the list .
The default is but can be changed to if you ’ve moved on to .
container_class :
The CSS class of the container .
: The class of the container .
menu_class :
The CSS class given to the unordered list .
This defaults to menu .
: The class given to the unordered list .
This defaults to .
fallback_cb :
A function to call in the event that no menu items have been given .
By default , wp_list_pages ( ) will be called .
: A function to call in the event that no menu items have been given .
By default , will be called .
before :
Text that is displayed before the link text but within the link .
: Text that is displayed before the link text but within the link .
after :
Text that is displayed after the link text but within the link .
: Text that is displayed after the link text but within the link .
link_before :
Text that is displayed before the link .
: Text that is displayed before the link .
link_after :
Text that is displayed after the link .
: Text that is displayed after the link .
depth :
How many levels the menu should display , which is useful for things like drop - down menus .
This is set to 0 ( any level ) by default .
: How many levels the menu should display , which is useful for things like drop - down menus .
This is set to ( any level ) by default .
walker :
Allows a custom walker PHP class to be defined to create the menu .
: Allows a custom walker class to be defined to create the menu .
echo :
Whether to display the menu or return it for use in PHP .
This defaults to true and displays the menu .
Displaying a menu using the Navigation Menu widget
By default , WordPress will give you a simple menu widget that will allow you to select any of your custom menus to display .
All you need is a widget - ready theme .
Since using widgets is fairly self - explanatory and the new widget is simple , I ’m going to use this opportunity for a little shameless self promotion .
For those of you that use my Hybrid theme , you know you have the coolest widgets ever because they give you complete control .
Version 0.8 will have a much more advanced Navigation Menu widget that overwrites the WordPress default .
Here ’s a look at what controls you ’ll have .
# Styling nav menus
I wo n’t be covering how to style menus here .
That ’s a tutorial in and of itself , and there are tons of different ways to style menus .
I do have a couple of tips though .
Use the current - menu - item class to style a menu item whose page is currently being viewed .
This will allow you to highlight the item so the reader will know which page they ’re on .
Here ’s an example from one of my style.css files :
# primary - menu li.current - menu-item a { background : # fff url ( images / primary - menu-active.png ) repeat-x 0 0 ; border - top : none ; border - bottom : 2 px solid # fff ; }
A solid base to start with is the Superfish jQuery plugin .
It allows some subtle , but cool , JavaScript functionality and fixes drop - downs in Internet Explorer 6 without having to resort to hacks .
Here ’s a screenshot of a menu I ’ve been working on for a new theme .
At this point , you should know everything you need to know about handling menus in WordPress .
But , if you continue reading , I have a few more tips that you can use .
# Collapsible menus
Let ’s suppose you only want a menu to appear when a user has added menu items .
This can allow for a variety of layouts .
In the screenshot below , I ’m using two menus .
But , this allows for up to four different layouts .
The trick here is to make sure there ’s no fallback called .
Let ’s return to our original menu ( Primary Menu ) and the code for it .
<?php wp_nav_menu ( array ( ' theme_location ' => ' primary - menu ' , ' fallback_cb ' => '' ) ) ; ?>
What I ’ve done is simply tell WordPress that I do n’t want my menu to fall back to another menu if the user has n’t given the menu any items .
# Checking if a theme location has a menu
Update : Props to Andrew Nacin for adding the has_nav_menu ( ) function after reading this section of the article .
WordPress currently has no conditional tag to check if a menu has been set to a specific theme location .
WordPress has a conditional tag called has_nav_menu( ) to check if a menu has been set to a specific theme location .
Let ’s suppose we ’re creating a container with a menu and a search form .
But , if no menu is set for the theme location , we do n’t want either to appear .
In the screenshot , you can see that neither appear in one scenario and both appear in the other .
When you call your menu by theme location , you can first check to see if a menu is associated with the location .
Note that we ’re checking the theme location slug and not a menu name or ID .
<?php if ( has_nav_menu ( ' primary - menu ' ) ) { ?> < div class =" nav - container " > <?php wp_nav_menu ( array ( ' theme_location ' => ' primary - menu ' ) ) ; ?> <?php get_search_form ( ) ; ?> </div > } ?>
# Allowing more menu containers
Optimizing the On - Screen Keyboard
Windows
Phone devices are pretty much entirely touch - based .
While some device flavors may contain a hardware keyboard that you can use , the primary way for you to input text is by tapping on the virtual , on - screen keyboard : [ the full , default keyboard is shown ]
There is nothing special you need to do to bring up this keyboard .
Simply set focus on a TextBox element that is used to receive text input , and your on - screen keyboard will automatically appear .
By default , the full keyboard will be displayed .
What this tutorial will show you is how to optimize the keyboard that appears for the type of information a user would be inputting instead .
Getting Started
Make sure you have everything up and running to do Windows Phone development , and go ahead and create a new Windows Phone project in Expression Blend .
What we need is to insert a TextBox that will allow our application to receive key input .
To insert a TextBox control , display your Asset panel and search for TextBox .
As you are typing , your TextBox will appear almost immediately : [ find your TextBox control in your Assets panel ]
Double - click on the TextBox to insert it into your application .
Feel free to tweak the width and height as necessary , but do n't worry about going overboard : [ insert your TextBox in your application ]
Now that you have your TextBox inserted , hit F5 to launch the emulator / device and to see what your application actually looks like .
If you set focus on your textbox , you will see your on - screen keyboard appear just you saw in my introduction earlier .
Choosing the Right Keyboard Layout
By default , the keyboard that appears is very general and unoptimized for any one particular type of data .
You may find that it is better to optimize the on - screen keyboard for the type of text a user would inputting in this particular TextBox .
For example , a TextBox that is used to receive a phone number may not need all of the alphabetical keys : [ the numerical keypad is displayed ! ]
To specify what kind of keyboard to display , make sure your TextBox is selected in Expression Blend .
In your Properties Inspector , look at the Common Properties category : [ the treasure is buried in the Common Properties category ]
The property that controls what kind of input to optimize your keyboard for is the InputScope property .
Click on the drop - down next the InputScope property to see all of the optimized layouts that you can pick from : [ pick a layout from your InputScope property ]
The number and types of keys displayed depend entirely on which layout you choose for your InputScope .
For example , if you select Number , your on - screen keyboard will be optimized to display numerical keys only .
Go ahead and select a layout that you want to optimize for to set your InputScope property : [ once your InputScope is set , you are good to go ! ]
Once your InputScope property has been set , that is all you need to do .
The next time you preview your application , setting focus on the TextBox will display a keyboard whose layout is optimized based on the layout you specified for InputScope !
Conclusion
While this is very simple , specifying the InputScope may be one of the nicest things you can do for people when you require text input .
Because the on - screen keyboard is small to fit on the screen , showing only the keys that you need is something that your users would be thankful for !

MEXICO CITY ( AP ) 
The bodies of 20 to 25 people , apparently victims of drug gang violence , were recovered from an abandoned silver mine in an area of southern Mexico popular with international tourists , a federal police official said Sunday .
The bodies appear to have been tossed over time down about 300 feet into the abandoned mine , which is near Taxco , a city in the state of Guerrero that is known for its silver jewelry and other items .
The area , dotted by hundreds of mines , is popular with tourists from the United States and elsewhere .
Federal Police Commissioner Facundo Rosas said a suspect told the authorities about the mass grave , and they began pulling bodies from the mine late Saturday .
Guerrero is plagued by drug violence among rival gangs , and marked by brazen attacks on the police and soldiers engaged in a crackdown on traffickers .
The law is the law .
If we unquestioningly accepted that maxim , imagine where we would be today .
Jim Crow would be alive and well , rivers and skies would be polluted , and women would n’t be allowed to vote .
Yet such is the mindset of many of those who criticize Proposition 19 , the marijuana regulation and taxation initiative on the November ballot .
In his July 18 Times Op - Ed article , UCLA public policy professor Mark A.R. Kleiman declares that state legalization “ ca n’t be done . ”
He points out , correctly , that if the initiative is successful , the federal marijuana prohibition laws will remain in place .
What he assumes , incorrectly , is that federal agents will swarm into California , busting farmers and arresting distributors and shopkeepers , to say nothing of the garden stores that sell them equipment and supplies , the accountants who do their books and the municipal tax officials who delight in assessing and collecting the new tax revenues .
Kleiman might well have uttered , “ The law is the law . ”
But the law is neither absolute nor infallible , and that ’s why Californians can — and should — legalize , regulate and tax marijuana - related commerce .
The federal - state dynamic concerning marijuana is not complicated .
Under our system of federalism , both the states and the feds may prohibit commerce in marijuana , but neither is required to do so .
Similarly , during alcohol prohibition ( 1920 - 33 ) , commerce in alcoholic beverages was prohibited not only by federal law ( the Volstead Act ) but by the laws of most states .
In 1923 , New York repealed its state prohibition laws , leaving enforcement , for the remaining 10 years , entirely to the feds .
California voters overwhelmingly did the same thing in 1932 , one year before national prohibition was repealed .
Let ’s think this through .
If Proposition 19 passes , two important balls roll into the feds ’ court .
The first is that the sole responsibility and expense of enforcing marijuana prohibition will be shifted to them .
After Nov. 2 , marijuana “ offenders ” could be arrested only by federal agents , prosecuted only under federal law , and sentenced only to federal detention .
If the feds undertook this , cases involving simple possession cases and small - time marijuana businesspeople , usually relegated to state courts , would flood federal courthouses .
But even with a drastic increase in funding for federal enforcement , such activity would barely put a dent in California ’s marijuana trade , and would fail to stifle California ’s policy change , as the federal government has failed to do since the first medical marijuana laws were passed 14 years ago .
Moreover , justifying the invasion into a state ’s province to undermine the will of the voters at such great expense to taxpayers would be highly questionable , especially in the current economic climate , not to mention a political climate that is at best lukewarm on prohibitionist policies .
The second ball is even more significant .
Voter approval of Proposition 19 would shift to the feds the responsibility and burden of justifying marijuana prohibition in the first place .
Now , the Washingtonians who have never questioned decades of anti-pot propaganda can explain to the people of California why we cannot be trusted to determine our state ’s marijuana policies .
Let them endorse the prohibition laws ’ usefulness as a tool of oppressing minorities .
Let them celebrate how minor marijuana violations cost people their jobs , their housing , custody of their kids , and entrap them permanently in vast criminal justice databases .
Let them justify the utter hypocrisy of the legal treatment of alcohol and tobacco , as compared with the illegal treatment of marijuana .
Let them tell us how many more people will have to be prosecuted and punished before marijuana is eradicated , how much that will cost , and where the money will come from .
Proposition 19 ’s success in November would put the feds in a quandary , yes , but it is a quandary of their own making .
Unlike alcohol prohibition , which required a constitutional amendment , Congress could fix this easily with a simple amendment to the Controlled Substances
Act allowing conduct legal under state law and respecting the right of states to regulate and tax the cannabis industry .
After all , determining what is a crime is traditionally handled at the state level ; indeed , federal prosecutions of drug possession make up a miniscule portion of overall drug arrests .
Instead of hewing to a misguided and unworkable federal hegemony in this area , encouraging innovation at the state level would be a more rational federal policy .
And to be clear , legal scholars have long disagreed with Kleiman ’s conclusion that the feds must and will intervene to try to quell state action in this area .
States need not shrink from countering federal policy on marijuana .
California can show leadership in driving needed reforms , as it has before .
In other words , the law need not be the law if you ’re willing to stick your neck out .
Cautious academics and politicized public employees will always embrace the status quo , joined by risk - averse politicians who misconstrue a lack of constituent “ noise ” on this issue as satisfaction with current law , not fear .
But voters know better .
Not only can Californians regulate and tax marijuana , we should .

3G Watchdog – Keeping An Eye On Your Data Usage
Today I ’ll write about the application which saves me money by constantly keeping eye on my Internet data usage ( 3G , Edge , GPRS ) .
This nifty app comes from Richard Gruet whom I ’d like to say thanks for making this application !
Let ’s start with the review .
This is the welcome screen :
As you see – it shows ( in % and MB ) how much I ’ve spent of my monthly quota .
If I keep my current usage constant I will use only 21.6 % of my quota , so I ’ll be fine ( I believe no one likes to pay those monthly overages ) .
Also , on this screen you see how much data is received ( downloaded ) and transmitted ( uploaded ) and , of course – total usage .
Then we have a quick look on daily , weekly and monthly usage .
More than enough data for the welcome screen !
Let ’s see what happens when I press Settings button :
As you see from the pictures above – 3G Watchdog is fully customizable .
There is more , much more !
3G Watchdog is a wonderful application and it is a must for every Android phone !
It accurately monitors your data usage ( 3G , GPRS , Edge ) and warns you when you ’re near your quota .

It did not attract much media attention other than a few tweets , but perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the Ministerial news conference on Wednesday launching Bill C - 32 was the comments from Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore on the possibility on bringing a three - strikes and you 're out ( or " graduated response " ) system to Canada .
While some have encouraged the government to move in that direction in recent months , Moore slammed the door shut on that possibility .
According to Moore :
One of the proposals that was suggested was the idea that Canada would have a three strikes rule , which is what they have in France .
We do n’t agree with that .
I do n’t think a three strikes rule is in the best interests of consumers .
Which is what , consumers would receive three notices or three allegations of impropriety and then their internet would be cut off .
It would be devastating for individual Canadians , bad for consumers , because now , access to the internet is part of our everyday lives , not just for movies and for songs , but for doing banking , for taking care of your mortgage , for communicating with your kids , for communicating with family across the country .
This is an essential part of our economy , so we disagreed with the idea of a three strikes rule .
This is good news , particularly given comments this week from Bloc MP Carole Lavallée , who seemingly thinks three strikes is too generous .
She urged the government to adopt a two strikes and you 're out policy .
Update : I received an email from Ms. Lavallée this afternoon indicating that the Canoe story did not fully capture her views .
She says that three strikes is an option that should be discussed , but that she did not put it forward as a firm solution .
IT TOOK 120 eggs to hold it together and four burly men to flip it , but a Sydney cafe has set a record by making the world 's largest burger .
The whopping beef burger cooked up at Ambrosia On The Spot , in Sydney 's Randwick , tipped the scales at 95.5 kg , making it the largest ever created .
The previous record was held by an 84kg burger made in the US .
Owner Joe El - Ajouz said the burger would not be a regular feature on the cafe 's menu , considering it took him almost 24 hours to create and three months to plan , but he was delighted with the results .
" I 've always wanted to break a world record and this is a bit of fun and a marketing tool to get people in here and get them talking , " Mr El - Ajouz said .
The burger required 81 kg of mince , 120 eggs , 16 tomatoes , 120 cheese slices , 2kg of lettuce , 21kg of bread and half a kilo of barbecue sauce .
Mr El - Ajouz 's wife Iman said the trickiest part was flipping the patty , which took 12 hours to cook through .
Once the meat was cooked , the burger was lovingly assembled by the cafe 's staff , then put on display .
Last night , it was being cut up for staff and supporters to sample .
The Times and Sunday Times will start charging for their online content from tomorrow .
News International unveiled new - look Times and Sunday Times websites and introduced online registration in late May as a precursor to introducing pay - only online access .
From tomorrow , web users who are not already subscribers to the print editions of the two papers will have to pay £ 1 for a day 's access or £ 2 for a week - long subscription .
However , as an introductory offer , any customer who registers will get access to both websites for 30 days for just £ 1 .
News International said that the iPad edition of the Times , which costs £ 9.99 a month , would continue to be charged separately .
" We have been very pleased with the response from readers since the launch of the new websites for The Times and The Sunday Times in May , " said Rebekah Brooks , chief executive of News International .
" The new sites showcase our award - winning journalism in a very visual way , giving readers exclusive content and interactivity so that they can get even more from the news .
We believe the new sites offer real value and we look forward to continuing to invest and innovate for readers . "
When News International outlined its pay strategy in March , Brooks indicated that its red - top titles , the Sun and News of the World , would also move behind a pay wall at some point .
" This is just the start , " she said .
" The Times and the Sunday Times are the first of our four titles in the UK to move to this new approach . "

Highlights of Commonwealth Games
Found Thousands of Condoms in CWG Village - Rubbery problem
The Commonwealth Games Village is confronting a civic problem again .
It is not the dirty loos or spit - stained bathrooms , but choked drains , which are now causing problems .
And this time , the athletes themselves are to blame .
When some toilets used by the athletes were found clogged , plumbers were called in to clean them .
They found that thousands of used condoms , which had been flushed down , were clogging the system .
Blast , Light , Dance & Hooting on Open Ceremony of CWG , 2010
Drummers beat out a countdown to the opening as a vast helium balloon rose towards the sky .
Organisers are seeking to shake off a run-up dogged by construction delays , corruption scandals and concerns over health and safety .
Fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships are on standby .
About 100,000 police and paramilitary officers were deployed as shops and businesses closed for the day .
About 80,000 police on duty have been reinforced by 17,000 paramilitary troops to counter the danger of an attack by extremists .
India feeling proud for winning note on Commonwealth Games Hockey
India 's 3 - 2 win against Malaysia did not matter as much as the three points that came with the result as it provided the hosts a solid start to their men's hockey campaign in the Commonwealth Games here Tuesday , so says coach Jose Brasa .
' Malaysia had other opportunities to score and we were also not good inside the ' d ' , ' said Brasa while pointing out that one of the major differences between the two teams was the number of ' field players ' he had for substitutions .
On penalty corner specialist Sandeep Singh 's absence from the field for the first 27 minutes , Brasa said : ' We played our best team , but later we played Sandeep for much of the second half .
It had to do with our rotation of players so that everyone was fresh . '
Kailash Kher performing at Common Wealth Games closing ceremony
The sensational Sufi singer Kailash Kher will be giving an astounding performance in the closing ceremony of common wealth games which will be held on 14th October at Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium , Delhi .

' Volunteers of the Metro Citizens ' Forum have also been instructed to be more vigilant and devote their time at the stations whenever possible . ''
Assistant Station Manager - the grade of Metro official will also be posted at the control room of the Commonwealth Games Committee for better coordination and all types of controls .
Athletes focus on practice ahead of Commonwealth Games
Athletes got down to training on Wednesday for the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi , putting aside concerns about poor accommodation and a dengue fever epidemic that have embarrassed the hosts .
Hundreds of athletes from around the world poured into the Indian capital , host for the Oct. 3 - 14 multi-sports event .
Competitions kick off on Oct. 4 . Teams from the 71 nations that are members of the Commonwealth are all due to be in place at the Games Village by Thursday , the Commonwealth Games Federation said in a statement .
The Indian authorities , criticised for providing filthy accommodation and shoddy contruction of some of the venue sites , are working around the clock to clean up the Games Village to house up to 8,000 athletes and officials .
Security has been ramped up with some 100,000 police , including sniper units , guarding the Games , in one of the biggest ever security crackdowns on the capital .
Plan of the apes : Security staff deploy langurs
Security officials at the Commonwealth Games are n't monkeying around anymore , deploying langurs at several venues in New Delhi to keep smaller simians from causing any trouble .
Langurs are a common type on monkey in south Asia , and because they are large and fierce they are often used in India to keep other monkeys in check in public places .
The New Delhi Municipal Council said it will put 10 langurs on duty outside several venues starting Wednesday , but that number will increase in the days leading up to Sunday 's opening ceremony .
" The additional langurs will take care of the games venues and other important areas , " the council told the Press Trust of India news agency .
Spotting monkeys in Delhi is not uncommon .
The animals roam through buildings throughout city , often causing havoc as they scamper through hospitals and government offices .
" Delhi CWG were doomed from start "
Legendary American athlete Michael Johnson joined the chorus of sports personalities who have criticised the Delhi Commonwealth Games .
The specially - built Games village for the multi-sport event , which starts on Sunday , was slammed last week as nations from around the world hit out at the poor state of its cleanliness and drainage .
Johnson , now a BBC television commentator , feels that the decision to stage the Games in October , outside the mainstream season for athletics , traditionally the event 's central attraction was a wrong decision .
" This edition of the Commonwealth Games was doomed from the start , " Johnson wrote in his column in a British newspaper .
Narcotics Control Bureau seeks help to choke drug flow during CWG
To prevent the flow of Delhi narcotics during Commonwealth Games when a large numbers of foreigners are expected , the Narcotics Control Bureau has decided to seek the help of agencies like the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Customs .
The Narcotics Control Bureau Delhi unit and headquarters at a recent meeting with the heads of other agencies , mooted and forwarded steps to prevent peddlers from selling narcotics to foreign tourists .
It will be a curse for our so coming commonwealth games .

Q&A FROM AUTISM STUDY Q&A FROM AUTISM STUDY
A study published in Nature answers some questions about autism 's genetic roots but raises many others .
USA TODAY 's Liz Szabo asked experts to explain .
Q : Will the study help doctors diagnose autism ?
A : Yes .
Within a few years , children may be able to take a blood test to predict their risk of developing autism , says coauthor Louise Gallagher of Trinity College Dublin .
Q : Will the study help to develop new drugs for autism ?
A : Doctors hope so .
The study points out new genetic targets , says co-author Anthony Monaco of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in the United Kingdom .
Drug companies are likely to test drugs that are already " on the shelf " to see whether any existing chemicals might correct some of these newly discovered genetic flaws .
Creating hundreds of new autism drugs for each genetic problem would n't be practical , says study co-author Stephen Scherer .
But he notes that many of these defects are clustered on the same communication pathways involved with how brain cells talk to each other .
So researchers may be able to create a drug that targets an entire pathway , correcting defects along that line .
Q : Does the study explain why diagnoses of autism are 10 times more common today than a decade ago ?
A : No , says Bryan King of Seattle Children 's Hospital , who was n't involved in the study .
Autism now occurs in one in every 110 children , according to Autism Speaks .
Q : So why are autism diagnoses rising ?
A : The trend could be related to an increase in premature birth , older parents and use of assisted reprodutive technologies , which increase the risk of autism .
It 's possible that increased awareness has led to more diagnoses even if the real rate has n't changed that much , King says .
AUTISM AT A GLANCE AUTISM AT A GLANCE Autism is an umbrella name for a family of disorders that begin in childhood , last a lifetime and disrupt a person 's social and communication skills .
Prevalence
• 1 in 110 U.S. children is diagnosed with autism .
Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism .
• 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have an autism spectrum disorder Diagnosis
• Less than a decade ago , the disease was diagnosed at age 3 or 4 .
Now it is routinely diagnosed at 2 .
• Symptoms range from mild to severe .
Many people with autism display rigid routines and repetitive behaviors .
Treatment
• There is no single treatment for children with autism .
Most respond best to structured behavioral programs .
Cost
• Lifetime cost of caring for a child with autism : $ 3.5 million to $ 5 million
• Annual U.S. cost : $ 90 billion Source : Autism Society of America and Autism Speaks HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS
Scientists have found dozens of new autism - related genes , according to a study that eventually could help doctors develop better ways to diagnose and treat the condition .
Yet the study , published online Wednesday in Nature , also suggests that the genetic roots of autism are quite complicated .
Unlike children with cystic fibrosis , whose disease is caused by defects in a single gene , people with autism may share little in common genetically , says study co-author Stephen Scherer , who compared the DNA of nearly 1,000 children with autism with nearly 1,300 children who do n't have autism .
But even the most common genetic changes in his study were found in only 1 % or less of patients , Scherer says .
That suggests that " most individuals with autism are probably genetically quite unique , " says Scherer of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , one of 120 scientists from 11 countries working on the study , called the Autism Genome Project .
As co-author Stanley Nelson of the University of California - Los Angeles describes it : " If you had 100 kids with autism , you could have 100 different genetic causes . "
Taken together , these genetic changes could explain up to 20 % of cases of autism , says Hakon Hakonarson , director of Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia 's Center for Applied Genomics , a co-author of the study , which was funded by Autism Speaks and the National Institutes of Health .
Researchers focused on a type of genetic change called " copy number variations , " places where DNA has been either inserted or deleted .
Because genes include instructions for making proteins , that can lead to an overdose of a protein , an underdose , a total absence of protein or a malfunctioning one , Hakonarson says .
But much about autism remains a mystery , including the cause of the other 80 % of cases , says Bryan King , an autism expert at Seattle Children 's Hospital .
Study authors say they need to study the genes of many more children to get more precise answers about autism 's genetic roots .
But doctors may one day be able to use these findings to offer parents an early genetic test to help predict children 's risk of autism , says co-author Louise Gallagher of Trinity College Dublin .
The study also could lead to new drugs , because it points out new genetic targets , says co-author Anthony Monaco of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in the United Kingdom .

Shutterstock Salty Water
A mere difference in salinity can drive electricity generation
During lectures , Bert Hamelers displays two photos side by side :
One is of the Hoover Dam , a thundering cascade of water .
The other is of the River Rhine flowing gently into the North Sea .
It might not seem intuitive , but each system has comparable power - generating capacity , says Hamelers , an assistant professor at Wageningen University , in the Netherlands .
The Hoover Dam already generates enormous amounts of hydroelectricity every day .
Scientists could extract just as much power by harnessing the entropy created when the Rhine 's fresh waters mix with salty waters , he says .
In Environmental Science and Technology ( DOI : 10.1021/es100852a ) , Hamelers and colleagues introduce a new technology to convert into electricity the entropy created when two solutions of different salt concentrations come together .
Hamelers ' technology is one of several emerging to produce electricity from salinity differences .
Unlike other approaches , however , it does n't rely on auxiliary components , which can boost cost and complexity .
For instance , a competing method known as capacitor - double - layer expansion ( CDLE ) harnesses electricity from the flow of salt ions over porous carbon electrodes , but it requires an external battery to jumpstart the cycle .
In contrast , Hamelers ' technology derives its charge from an ion-exchange membrane , which converts the flow of sodium and chloride ions into electricity as fresh and saline water alternately flow across it .
The membrane is sandwiched between the same porous electrodes used in CDLE .
Hamelers calls his device a membrane - modified supercapacitor flow cell .
Doriano Brogioli , a researcher at the Italian National Agency for New Technologies , Energy and Sustainable Economic Development , in Rome , who developed CDLE in 2009 while working at Milano - Bicocca University , explains that CDLE and Hamelers ' technology both use porous electrodes , which , when immersed in salt solutions , store charge as capacitors do .
Given that they 're made of activated carbon — which has a surface area of roughly 1,000 square meters per gram — the electrodes behave as supercapacitors , with strikingly high energy density , Brogioli says .
CDLE and Hamelers ' technology have different pros and cons , Brogioli says .
“ Membranes are more expensive , " he says , " but the dependence on batteries makes CDLE more sensitive to leaking currents . "
Hamelers proposes as a first application that his technology be deployed to generate electricity where rivers flow into the sea .
But other scenarios are possible , he says : scientists could tap into salinity differences generated by evaporating salt solutions or into industrial processes that generate brine .
" We 're now looking at ways to generate higher power density , perhaps by stacking membranes on top of each other , " he says .
" This is going to be a new source of energy and it offers a lot of creative freedom to think of ways to make the technology better . "
You know that ominous figure people always talk about , that one staggering number — $ 1.3 billion these days — that represents the cost to develop and market a drug ?
It is , to be sure , way too high and unsustainably so .
The billions of dollars that have been invested to discover the next generation of blockbusters have , for the most part , failed to bear fruit .
In 2009 , the industry spent some $ 65 billion in R&D .
That same year 34 new drugs and biologics were approved .
Even if one considers that the 2009 drugs were developed in the 10 years prior , the numbers are telling since the industry was spending some $ 26 billion a year in R&D in 2000 .
Divide that by 34 and the very crude , very unscientific allocation per drug is some $ 765 million .
Math games aside , the point is that everyone in the industry recognizes things just ca n’t go on this way .
I ’ve lost count of the number of times I have heard a very senior biotech and pharmaceutical executive admit that “ the model is broken . ”
There is a lot of blame to go around : executives bemoan investors ’ reluctance to fund their companies while companies , and investors , complain the FDA has become too unpredictable and is not approving drugs at the rate it used to .
The growing sense of futility is having a chilling effect on the whole ecosystem of drug discovery .
Often , the $ 1.3 billion figure is used to illustrate how hard the business is and to help justify the large investment incurred to make drugs .
That ’s because the figure takes into account not just the one success but all the failures .
For each FDA approval there is , on average , one Phase III failure and many more drugs in preclinical and early human tests that do n’t make it .
All that money spent and lost is clumped together with the money that was invested in the one success .
But a failure is a failure is a failure .
The scenario often portrayed to the public is that there are hundreds of drug candidates whose promise dwindles as studies progress , simply because it is discovered that , sadly , they just do n’t work as initially thought .
This is certainly true of many drug candidates , but not all .
A lot of drugs that might actually have made it die because of decisions poorly made , or human error .
Inexperience can play a major role when it comes to these failures , and the biotechnology industry , by virtue of being comprised of so many small , new companies , is especially vulnerable to that .
One 2008 analysis published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery found that 95 % of the industry ’s Phase III failures in 2006 and 2007 were products originating from biotechnology companies .
During the period analyzed in the article , 65 drugs seeking approval experienced regulatory setbacks and 16 of those had 3 - month delays .
The vast majority of products with delays came from biotech companies .
The authors ventured that “ many of these delays may have resulted from poor quality NDA submissions , rather than from flaws in the drugs themselves . ”
Sounds like a harsh assessment , but it appears as though it ’s fairly accurate , at least based on a conversation I recently had with Greg Dombal , managing partner at Halloran Consulting Group , which helps life sciences companies with regulatory and quality assurance issues .
I met Dombal last week , at the dinner to kick - off Xconomy ’s XSITE summit , and some of the things he said were truly surprising .
He says , for example , that about three quarters of the life sciences companies his group sees “ have some fundamental gaps in competence . ”
In a “ solid ” 30 - 40 percent , he says , some of the issues can be found at the “ C level ” — meaning the chief executive , chief operating officer , and other top executives .
Dombal , who ’s had extensive experience in regulatory affairs at various companies , later gave me more examples during a phone conversation .
One was of a company that … Next Page »

Gil Hoffman and Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report .
With tensions running high between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Israel Beiteinu , the sponsors of a key bill opposed by Netanyahu were optimistic on Saturday night that the measure , designed to curb the premier ’s ability to extend the building moratorium in the settlements , would pass its first legislative hurdle .
One day after Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman realized that he had been left in the dark about a key meeting between Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , the bill ’s sponsors were assured by the foreign minister ’s party that it would receive their support in Sunday ’s meeting of the Ministerial Committee for Legislation , and thus become a government bill .
Even after Netanyahu met with Lieberman on Friday in an effort to calm things down , Israel Beiteinu did not rescind its threat to support the bill , which would require Knesset approval of any future building freeze .
In the course of the meeting in Jerusalem , Netanyahu and Lieberman reportedly agreed to work in cooperation from now on , but Lieberman remained critical of the government ’s alleged efforts to appease Turkey .
“ This is a matter of practice , and not a personal issue .
A decision like this must be made logically , in cooperation with all of the professional elements , ” Lieberman told Netanyahu .
The foreign minister reportedly also said that it would damage Israel ’s international standing to apologize to Turkey or to compensate those hurt on theprotest ship on May 31 .
Later on Friday , during an interview with Channel 1 news , Netanyahu said that “ it was a mistake not to update the foreign minister regarding the meeting , ” but emphasized that relations between the two men had not been damaged by the incident .
“ I explained the circumstances of the meeting to Lieberman , the mistake was corrected and we continued onward .
The coalition is not in danger , ” he said .
Netanyahu told the station he rejected the notion that Israel would pay any form of compensation to Turkey or to the families of the nine Turkish citizens who were killed in the boarding of theas it sought to break the IDF blockade on Gaza .
“ These announcements bear no relation to what occurred [ in the meeting ] , ” said Netanyahu .
“ Israel will not apologize that its soldiers defended themselves .
” The prime minister stated that the secret meeting between Ben-Eliezer and Davutoglu was a positive step towards repairing the Israel - Turkey relationship .
“ It is not in the interest of Israel , or even Turkey , that this relationship continue to deteriorate , ” said Netanyahu .
But on the eve of the Ministerial Committee for Legislation ’s meeting the tensions between Lieberman ’s faction and the prime minister seemed to remain .
The anti-freeze bill ’s sponsors – MKs Carmel Shama ( Likud ) and Uri Ariel ( National Union ) – reiterated that they had received assurances from Israel Beiteinu that the faction ’s ministers would support the bill .
In addition , they expressed hope that a new campaign attacking the 10 - month building moratorium had done its part to push right - wing Likud ministers , including Education Minister Gideon Sa’ar , to vote in favor of the bill despite the prime minister ’s opposition .
Sources close to the bill said that they had been surprised over the weekend that they had not been pressured by the prime minister to withdraw the measure , which would make it very difficult to extend the building freeze , despite the known opposition of the premier to the legislation .
Despite the sponsors ’ optimism , a key Knesset official said he believed Shama ’s bill would not be able to pass the Knesset , even though it nominally had the support of many Likud MKs .
The Labor Party is almost certain to oppose it , as are pro- Netanyahu elements within the Likud , which together would deny it a majority in the plenum .
Should Israel Beiteinu make good on its threats , the prime minister ’s troubles would not end with the one problematic bill .
Israel Beiteinu also said late last week that it intends to end the current legislative delay on issues like conversion and civil unions for couples , and party officials will instigate confrontations with the Labor Party on diplomatic issues that were previously avoided .
The North Korean regime has been thwarted in apparent plans to use the World Cup as a means to boost the image of leader Kim Jong - il 's heir apparent Kim Jong - un .
Radio Free Asia on Tuesday claimed the plans were scuppered when what seem to have been muddle - headed instructions from Kim senior himself to the national team lead to a devastating rout in South Africa .
Quoting a source , RFA reported that after watching the match against powerhouse Brazil , in which North Korea recorded a respectable 1 - 2 loss with a tight defense strategy , Kim Jong - il said that although the team played the first half well , it lost because it only focused on defense in the second half .
He then gave orders for the team 's defenders to be positioned forward and even specified where each defender should be standing in the field .
According to the source , Kim " gave orders twice " to a responsible official dispatched to South Africa during the game against Portugal on June 21 .
The orders were delivered to North Korea manager Kim Jong - hun and implemented in the game .
Despite the widening gap in the score , the North Koreans team stuck to their hopeless strategy and lost 0 - 7 .
North Korea had pinned high hopes on its World Cup team , the first in decades .
The entire team was awarded the highest honors given for an athlete in North Korea in November last year , and Kim Jong - un is said to have visited the training center several times to encourage the players and listen to their concerns .
The decision to broadcast the match against Portugal live came against that background .
A North Korean defector who was formerly a senior sports official said , " Although the North Korean leadership would have wanted at least one victory in the World Cup since they made it for the first time in 44 years , which could have been a huge propaganda push for Kim Jong - un , Kim Jong - il 's interference ruined it all . "
North Korea have been told by Fifa that Kim Myong - won will only be able to play as a goalkeeper in the World Cup and not in his usual role as a striker .
The North Korean coach , Kim Jong - hun decided to name only two regular goalkeepers in his squad with Kim , who plays for Amrokgang , as the back - up .
It was seen as an attempt to boost the nation 's attacking options as they prepare to face Brazil , Ivory Coast and Portugal in Group G .
However , the move has backfired spectacularly after Fifa confirmed that Kim will only be allowed to play as a goalkeeper , not as an outfield player .
Unless there is an injury , no changes will be permitted to their final squad .
In a statement , world football 's governing body said : " The squad lists that the teams had provided to Fifa by 1 June 2010 are final and can no longer be changed .
On the final lists must be no more than 23 players , three of whom shall be goalkeepers .
" The only exception is in the case of a serious injury of a player in the list of 23 , who could be replaced up until 24 hours before the first match of the team in the competition .
" The three players listed as goalkeepers can only play as goalkeepers during the World Cup and cannot play outfield .
This will be communicated to the teams in the team arrival meetings and will be enforced on match days . "
The statement added : " Kim Myong - won will not be allowed to play as an outfield player if he has been put on the list as a goalkeeper . "
“ Segregation . ”
It ’s a powerful word because it evokes powerful feelings .
Hearing the word “ segregation ” instills in our minds images of violence , exclusion , and a bitter hatred of innocent men for no reason beyond the color of their skin .
We remember a time when little boys and girls could n’t ride the bus together or sit at the same lunch table for fear of being shouted down , bullied , or even arrested .
We know it represents a dark , evil , and unforgivable period in American history .
Or do we ?
Perhaps not , if we listen to local NAACP leader and spokesman Rev. William Barber , who was arrested today on charges of trespassing while screaming and pleading with fellow activists to rebel against the Wake County public schools ’ recent decision to resegregate .
This would be a compelling tale of a brave man resisting police state oppression , if he were correct that the schools are resegregating at all .
Unfortunately for the good reverend ’s cause , they are not .
Actually , the Wake County School Board is relaxing government controls that previously forced students to attend schools far away from their homes based only on their parents ’ socioeconomic status .
The bizarre and somewhat authoritarian policy of redistributing thousands of students to new schools every year , which encumbered students ’ social development and caused abnormally long bus rides , was created with the intention of improving school performance through increased racial diversity .
It is unclear whether there was any reason at the time to believe that racial diversity would cause students or teachers to become smarter .
However , it is abundantly clear now that the plan has not worked .
In 2007 - 2008 , an abysmal 18 % of Wake County public schools met the already lax standards of adequate yearly progress under No Child Left Behind .
That is not the mark of a successful government program .
Now the School Board has voted to eliminate much of the harsh policies that forced redistributing students across great distances , instead focusing its efforts on neighborhood schools to avoid long bus rides .
The obvious benefits of this are multi-faceted and substantial .
Consumption of gasoline will decline , providing schools with a small but precious way to save money in a time of across - the - board budget cuts .
Carbon emissions will be slashed , as well .
Most importantly , parents will have greater choice in where to send their children to school , and children will enjoy shorter bus rides and a more stable base of friends as they can attend the same school year after year , if , of course , that is what they want .
The School Board ’s decision is an invaluable step forward in the movement to put parents back in charge of how their children are raised .
The emotional issue of racial segregation is a fraud , a scapegoat set up to distract debate away from the real issue of school choice and throw advocates of freedom into an un-winnable game while busy - body school assignment officials try to retain some semblance of usefulness .
Concerned parents cannot defend themselves against the accusation of being racist because the accusation is made without evidence , and therefore cannot be refuted with evidence .
What they can do – and what we all must do – is stand our ground and never waiver in asserting our right to choice and freedom , not long bus rides and bureaucratic control .

WASHINGTON - Sen. John McCain found out once again that pop culture trumps policy every time .
Earlier this month , McCain , R - Ariz. , was getting ready to deliver a major June 10 speech on Iran to a National Endowment for Democracy conference when Brooke Buchanan , his Senate spokeswoman , mentioned to him that reality - show diva Nicole " Snooki " Polizzi had unexpectedly dropped his name .
The star of MTV's " Jersey Shore " griped that President Barack Obama had put a 10 percent tax on tanning - bed bills .
She speculated that McCain , Obama 's opponent in the 2008 White House race , would n't support such a tax " because he 's pale and he would probably want to be tan . "
An amused McCain decided to shoot Polizzi a Twitter message .
" I said , ' Oh , why do n't we tell Snooki that we would n't , but we better put in there that I recommend you use sunscreen , ' " McCain , who has battled skin cancer , recalled last week .
" Kaboom !
It 's on the ( bottom - of - the - TV - screen cable news channel ) crawl for days . "
The intense , sustained national coverage of McCain 's June 9 " Snooki " tweet completely eclipsed his Iran speech , he said .
" I can't tell you how much hard work was put into that speech , and I still think it was one of the finest speeches that I 've ever given , " McCain said , laughing .
In other developments :
��The Federal Election Commission has tossed a December complaint alleging that broadcasting giant Clear Channel Communications gave former Rep. J.D. Hayworth an illegal corporate " in-kind " contribution by allowing him to continuously bash McCain and discuss a possible GOP Senate campaign while he was a talk - show host on Clear Channel - owned Phoenix radio station KFYI - AM ( 550 ) .
Hayworth 's afternoon KFYI program ended Jan. 22 and he officially announced his primary challenge to McCain on Feb. 15 .
Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods , now a McCain campaign adviser , unsuccessfully argued in his complaint that Hayworth was a de facto Senate candidate even while on KFYI 's payroll .
In a written statement , Hayworth said the " baseless complaint " was part of a " pattern of fear and intimidation regularly practiced by the senator . "
Brian Rogers , a McCain campaign spokesman , responded : " The fact that Congressman Hayworth entered the race after leaving the radio is proof that he intended to run all along and was using his show as a campaign platform . "
��If McCain had won the presidency , how would he have handled the disastrous BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico ?
McCain acknowledged that second - guessing is always easy , but he said he probably would have met with top BP executives sooner and directed the federal government to take control of the situation earlier .
" Some would argue that he ( Obama ) has never been in a decision - making role , and this is an indication of that , " McCain said .
��Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick , D - Ariz. , is working to secure a National Scenic Area designation for Sedona 's landmark red rocks .
" That also would bring jobs because that 's going to bring more tourism to that area , " she told The Republic last week .
" It 's so beautiful .
Every time you look at those red rocks , it 's spectacular . "
Earlier this month , Kirkpatrick and Sedona Mayor Rob Adams made their pitch for her bill at a hearing before a House Natural Resources subcommittee .

LONDON — Officials announced this week that the country 's ongoing financial crisis would necessitate the closure of a mysterious seaside village operated by the British government since 1967 .
" In light of the current economic downturn , it is unwise to maintain this secret locale any longer , " said a man identified only as Number Two , referring to the bucolic village whose sole aim appeared to be the recovery of desirable information from former intelligence agents .
" Plus , the cost of maintaining human chessboards , outdated penny - farthings , and our state - of - the - art escapee - retrieval sphere just proved too much .
We would have closed this whole place down years ago had it not been for one particularly uncooperative resident . "
The man refused to directly answer any questions about the village , instead using surreal imagery and oblique references before ending the press conference with a quiet and ominous " Be seeing you . "

EKOS
Support for the federal Liberal party has sunk to its lowest level in more than a year with the Conservatives taking a 10 - point lead over their political rivals , a new EKOS opinion poll suggests .
The poll , released exclusively to CBC , suggests that 34.4 per cent of respondents would vote for the Tories if an election were held today , compared with 23.9 per cent for the Liberals .
In recent weeks , the Liberals had narrowed the Tory lead to three to four percentage points .
But over the past week , the Liberals have taken a nearly seven - point drop in support .
According to the poll , the Conservative Party is leading in every region except for Quebec and in Atlantic Canada , where they are tied with the Liberals , who are losing ground in some key areas and not leading in any region .
In Ontario , the Liberals are 13 percentage points behind the Tories , where they had previously been on par or slightly ahead .
The Liberals ' numbers fell as Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been in the spotlight of late as host of the G8/ G20 summits in Huntsville , Ont. , and Toronto and attending events with Queen Elizabeth during her trip to Canada .
The drop in support comes as Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff is set to embark on a cross-Canada " Liberal Express " summer bus tour .
Harper plans to spend his summer at Harrington Lake , the official country residence of the prime minister .
Support for the New Democratic Party , the Green Party , and the Bloc Québécois has remained stable over the past few weeks with the NDP at 17.9 per cent , the Green Party at 11.2 per cent , and the Bloc at 10.5 per cent , the poll suggested .
The random survey of 1,166 Canadians aged 18 and over was conducted June 30 to July 6 and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .
Now you pay for prison parties :
Tory minister says taxpayer must fund balls and comedy workshops for criminals
A Tory minister has provoked fury with an astonishing declaration that taxpayers should fund comedy workshops and party nights for prisoners .
Crispin Blunt also set out how he planned to scrap harsh indefinite sentences for the country 's most depraved criminals .
The prisons minister was immediately accused of damaging the Conservatives ' reputation as the party of law and order .
Mr Blunt revealed he had overturned a ban on publicly funded jollies for prisoners - brought in following condemnation of a horror - themed fancy dress party for women inmates , including seven convicted killers .
The restriction , which explicitly ruled out events likely to outrage the public , had also been a response to revelations that an Al Qaeda terrorist was given lessons on how to be a stand - up comic while at a high - security prison .
But Mr Blunt branded the guidance , introduced in 2008 , ' damaging and daft ' and revoked it .
He also indicated an end to sentences which allow judges to lock up indefinitely thousands of the country 's worst offenders - including rapists , paedophiles and murderers .
Controversial : Crispin Blunt has overturned a ban on publicly funded jollies for prisoners
Known as Indeterminate Sentences for Public Protection - or IPPs - they ensure the worst criminals are kept behind bars for life unless they prove that they are no longer a threat to the public .
However , Mr Blunt said too many IPP sentences , brought in under Labour , were handed out , adding that locking people up and throwing away the key was ' not the answer ' .
The disturbing moves follow the announcement by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke that thousands of offenders will be given community sentences instead of short jail terms .
Former Justice Secretary Jack Straw , who introduced the ban on unacceptable events , condemned the impact on victims and said the law - abiding public would be ' incredulous ' .
In a speech to prison reform groups , Mr Blunt , 50 , also claimed - astonishingly - that in overturning the ban he was acting in the spirit of Winston Churchill .
He even quoted a speech the famous war leader gave 100 years ago , in which he advocated cultural events for inmates .
But Churchill , a noted prison reformer , was arguing simply that inmates should be able to hear performances from military bands or lectures from prominent public speakers .
Mr Blunt said : ' We recognise that arts activities can play a valuable role in helping offenders to address issues such as communication problems and low self - esteem and enabling them to engage in programmes that address their offending behaviour .
' I confess before getting this job I was not aware of Prison Service Instruction number 50 of 2008 [ the guidance which banned inappropriate events ] , though was vaguely conscious of some row in the tabloids about offenders being recorded as enjoying themselves .
' As a measure it was typical of the last administration 's flakiness under pressure .
PRISONS MINISTER & CHURCHILL
Prisons minister Crispin Blunt cited Winston Churchill in support of his plans to stop indeterminate prison sentences .
He said the wartime leader showed ' humanity towards the offender ' when he was Home Secretary a century ago .
Yet while some of Churchill 's views were comparatively liberal by the standards of his time , his broader approach to crime and punishment hardly chimes with that of the current coalition .
Where the Government plans to cut sentences for many hardened criminals such as burglars , Churchill was mainly interested in ending the imprisonment of children .
For adults , he was explicitly in favour of retaining solitary confinement and penal servitude .
For ' tramps and wastrels ' , he proposed ' proper Labour Colonies where they could be sent for considerable periods and made to realise their duty to the state ' .
A supporter of eugenics , he was in favour of sterilising ' moral defectives ' .
in the same year as his prison reforms , Churchill authorised the dispatch of troops to quell striking miners , although the measure proved unnecessary .
A life - long supporter of the death penalty , he once remarked that ' the only capital decision with which i have been dissatisfied during my tenure was about a man I reprieved ' .
' At the slightest whiff of criticism from the popular press , policy tended to get changed and the consequence of an absurd overreaction to offenders being exposed to comedy in prison was this deleterious , damaging and daft instruction .
‘ I'm pleased to have marked the actual day of the 100th anniversary of Churchill 's speech on Tuesday by rescinding it . '
Mr Blunt 's proposed abolition of IPP sentences - which could come into effect in a matter of months - will be welcomed by Left - wing prison reform groups who have described them as ' ferocious and unjust ' .
But it will raise concerns that killers and child abusers could be given softer punishments and be released earlier .
Those currently serving IPP sentences include Tracey Connelly , the mother of Baby P .
Backbench Tory MP Douglas Carswell said : ' I think Tory ministers have to decide pretty quickly , are they there to run the Criminal Justice System in the interests of those who work for it or are they there to run it in the interests of the law abiding of the country ?
' If they carry on running the Criminal Justice System in the interests of those who work in it and their leftist agenda then I do not think they can survive as the party of law and order for very much longer . '
The ban followed a party at Holloway Prison in 2008 , reportedly funded by prison authorities with £ 500 .
The party - goers dressed in masks and fake blood .
When pictures were published , Tory frontbencher Edward Garnier said : ' Any family of a victim of one of these people is going to be appalled and disgusted . '
Just two months later it emerged Zia Ul Haq , a convicted terrorist , was sent on an eight - day ' comedy workshop ' .
Emma Boon , of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said lifting the ban on parties was an ' insult ' to taxpayers .
' Prisoners are already detained at great expense and the last thing law - abiding taxpayers want is to hear about them enjoying parties , paid for from the public purse , ' she said .
Tory who talks like a Left - winger
Famous niece : Crispin Blunt is Devil Wears Prada star Emily Blunt 's uncle
By rachel quigley
Until now Crispin Blunt has been overshadowed in the fame stakes by his niece - Emily Blunt , the Golden Globe winning actress and star of the film The Devil Wears Prada .
But now he is making headlines himself , unkind observers might suggest he has been spending too much of his time with Emily 's chums in the liberal arts establishment .
What else could explain the abrupt conversion of this apparently conventional Tory into a radical prison reformer , whose every speech is peppered with the language of the Left ?
With sharply pressed suit and coiffed hairstyle , Mr Blunt is every inch the retired Army captain .
And his Tory credentials appear as impeccable as his appearance .
He attended Wellington College , Durham University and Sandhurst , where he won the Queen 's Medal .
After switching from the Army to politics , he pursued - until now - an unremarkable career on the Opposition front bench .
Even in the expenses scandal he was a moderate performer , claiming just £ 400 to repair a water wheel .
The 50 - year - old lives with wife Victoria , with whom he has two children , and is a keen cricketer , having played for the Lords and Commons team .
After attending the Royal Military Academy , he was commissioned into the 13th / 18th Royal Hussars ( Queen Mary 's Own ) in 1979 and served with distinction until 1990 as a troop leader , operations officer , and armoured reconnaissance squadron commander .
Following an unsuccessful bid for parliament in 1992 and a stint as a special adviser on Defence and Foreign Affairs , he finally entered the Commons in 1997 .
As Reigate MP he holds one of the safest Conservative seats with a 13,000 majority .
The only hint of insurrection in his past was his resignation from the shadow cabinet in 2003 in protest at the then party leadership of Iain Duncan Smith .
All then went fairly quiet until the election , and his elevation to junior bag carrier in the Justice Department .
From there on , it has been attention - seeking all the way .
Just weeks into the job he threw a bomb into sentencing policy by backing anonymity for men accused of rape .
Then yesterday , with apparent gusto , he lobbed more grenades in the direction of two key elements of criminal justice policy , then stood back and watched them explode .
By dropping a ban on prisoner parties and abolishing IPP sentences , he appears intent on antagonising both the public and members of his own party .
Is he polluted by the presence of so many Liberal Democrats in the Coalition ?
Or is he just following the controversial lead set by his boss Justice Secretary Ken Clarke , who has set his face against the old Tory mantra that ' prison works ' .
Mr Clarke has already enraged many on the Right with his stated desire to reduce the prison population , review the need for short sentences and his recent claim that locking up criminals has no link to the falling crime rate .
The ConservativeHome website has got hold of a copy of August 's GQ , in which Matthew d'Ancona , a commentator who is close to the Tory leadership , speculates on the runners and riders who might succeed David Cameron .
The piece comes at a mildly vulnerable time for Cameron , as his failure to win the election outright is demonstrated every day by moves that the Tory right considers consessions to the Lib Dems ( the latest of these being over next year 's controversial AV referendum ) and the Prime Minister is unlikely to be thrilled at it .
Here are some extracts :
George Osborne ( 8/1 according to Ladbrokes ) : " The more Osborne behaves like a man who expects no further promotion , the more focused he seems in his absolute determination to slash the deficit and take the political heat , the more he looks like a potential leader .
I have long thought he is up to the job , but am struck by how many MPs have come around to that view since he became Chancellor . "
Michael Gove ( 5/1 ) : " He would have a strong claim to be the candidate of the Tory modernisers in the post - Cameron world , but has credibility on the right , too , as the architect of the government 's radical plan for ' free ' schools liberated from the dead hand of town - hall control . "
Boris Johnson ( 5/1 ) : " His public distaste for the coalition talks was a barely coded signal to party and public alike , as was his invitation to Cameron to use London under Mayor Boris as a model for the new government 's spending cuts strategy .
These minor provocations -- always carefully surrounded by rich praise for Cameron -- certainly infuriate the PM and the Chancellor .
The question is when and how Boris makes his move .
As another former MP for Henley , Michael Heseltine , used to say of his own chances against Thatcher , he has one bullet in his revolver .
As soon as Boris heads back to the Commons -- especially if he decides not to seek a second term as mayor , or stands down midterm to fight for a seat -- his every move will be interpreted feverishly as a Churchillian step towards the top job .
So timing is all . "
Jeremy Hunt ( 20/1 ) : " Something tells me that the man to watch is Jeremy Hunt , the new Culture Secretary , a man so ambitious he squeaks when he walks .
He manages to be charmingly moderate and yet not a member of the Cameroon gang .
He is telegenic , gaining in presence by the month , and fizzing with ideas .
If Hunt can build up a back - bench following in the next few years , he will hard to beat . "
To this , I would only add that one should still consider David Davis to be in the running ; Liam Fox is likely to fancy it ; and of course , if Westminster were n't victim to insane ageism , Kenneth Clarke would still be recognised as the Tory politician with the most reach to the electorate ( would he have won outright in May ? ) .
Interestingly , d'Ancona also appears to entertain the possibility that Boris Johnson , perhaps Cameron 's most dangerously ambitious rival , will not stand for a second term as London mayor .
As I have long suspected , despite recent speculation to the contrary .
Let the debate begin .
I think people are blowing this out of proportion .
It does n't mean just girls , it can mean guys to .
If you like girls and they come up and talk to you , they obviously like you and the ball is in your court , but when you talk to them , you dont know if youll succeed or fail .
Even the most charming man isnt 100 % sure when approaching a woman .
Its a gamble .
CHARLOTTE , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - A government program to bail out banks at the height of the financial crisis has so far turned a profit , according to a report by investment bank Keefe , Bruyette & Woods Inc .
The Capital Purchase Program , part of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , has generated an average return of 10 percent on the initial investment in 61 banks that have fully repaid the aid , said the report , issued on Wednesday .
“ Its pretty clear that unless the economy just craters , the bank portion of TARP will be profitable , ” said Fred Cannon , bank analyst with Keefe , Bruyette and Woods .
About $ 137 billion , or two - thirds of the initial government investment , has been paid back , with $ 65 billion still to be repaid , the report said .
The often controversial program injected taxpayer funds into 707 banks nationwide in an effort to prop up the financial system at the height of the crisis in 2008 and 2009 .
The KBW study found the U.S. Treasury has received $ 13 billion in earned income and $ 2.3 billion in posted losses in the program so far .
Six banks produced a return on investment for the government greater than 20 percent , according to the study .
Most major U.S. lenders repaid their government bailout aid in 2009 and early 2010 .
The remaining participants in the program are mostly smaller community and regional banks .
The program currently has $ 65 billion in outstanding investments in 632 U.S. banks , with $ 4 billion in reported missed interest payments .
Cannon said he estimates the bank portion of TARP to ultimately return about 5 percent on the government ’s initial investment , even if the economy continues to be sluggish .
“ It can slip a bit , but I think it would take a huge dip to create losses in this program , ” he said .
Under the terms of the program , U.S. Treasury received quarterly dividend payments from the banks and warrants that could be converted to common stock .
TARP was originally scheduled to shut down on October 3 , 2010 , but it is expected to be shuttered earlier as part of sweeping U.S. financial reform .
Look !
It 's the E - reader from that ... from that other company !
Last week , Amazon trimmed the price and improved the features of its flagship Kindle DX product and now it 's apparently Sony 's turn .
As of today , the Reader Pocket Edition is $ 149 ( down from $ 169 ) , the Touch Edition is $ 169 ( down from $ 199 ) and the Sony Daily Edition ( the DX's primary competitor ) is now $ 299 , down from $ 349 .
That 's quite a bit cheaper than even the Kindle DX 's new pricetag of $ 379 , and it tells us everything we need to know about Sony 's position in the e-reader market :
It 's losing .
The price cuts on the Pocket Edition and the Touch Edition should keep them competitive against hardware from Barnes and Nobles ' Nook ( or the Kindle 2 ) , but the fact that Sony is giving ground at the highest end of the market says nothing good about the company 's mindshare in the E - Reader market .
Products at the high end of any market are n't just there for sale ; they serve as ambassadors and symbols of brand strength .
When leveraged successfully , the result is a brand like Sony 's Triniton technology .
Customers come to associate the name with higher quality or a better experience .
They 're also willing to pay more money for the product , which translates into higher margins for the manufacturer .
The last thing you want to do in any field is be forced to compete on price .
It works , to some extent , but it 's unsustainable in the long run .
Either a company runs out of costs to reduce , or it inevitably begins sacrificing quality in the name of keeping a razor - thin margin high enough to stay in business .
The reason Sony is n't talking much about these price changes is because the company does n't want to admit it 's being shoved out of yet another market .
It 's not clear how Sony ranks compared to Barnes and Noble or some of the other players in the market , but it 's safe to bet there 's just one company Sony is seriously trying outmaneuver .
Amazon , meanwhile , may be facing real competitive pressure for the first time thanks to Apple 's iPad , but it 'll be a few quarters before we 've got evidence on how much the two companies are competiting with each other .
There 's room , theoretically , for multiple E - book readers at the top of the market , but Sony has yet to demonstrate how it intends to get there .

We 're starving for a new science - fiction drama that does n't substitute special effects for real character - based storytelling .
So we 're very hopeful for Mark Romanek 's understated English drama , based on Kazuo Ishiguro 's novel Never Let Me Go .
Watch the film 's first trailer .
It 's hard to talk about this film without completely giving away its big surprise .
Just know there 's a twist that is gradually revealed in Ishiguro 's novel .
But the meat of the story is the relationship between the three students : Ruth , Tommy , and Kathy .
The book follows these three students through the eyes of Kathy [ Mulligan ] .
Indeed their ulta- strange , super - secluded , and seemingly idyllic private school Hailsham , is preparing them all for something — but what ?

Here 's the spoiler FREE synopsis :
As children , Ruth ( Knightley ) , Kathy ( Mulligan ) and Tommy ( Garfield ) , spend their childhood at a seemingly idyllic English boarding school .
As they grow into young adults , they find that they have to come to terms with the strength of the love they feel for each other , while preparing themselves for the haunting reality that awaits them

Here is the spoiler FILLED Wikipedia synopsis of the novel .
Look away if you want to stay unspoiled :
The novel describes the life of Kathy H. , a young woman of 31 , focusing at first on her childhood at an unusual boarding school and eventually her adult life .
The story takes place in a dystopian Britain , in which human beings are cloned to provide donor organs for transplants .
Kathy and her classmates have been created to be donors , though the adult Kathy is temporarily working as a " carer , " someone who supports and comforts donors as they are made to give up their organs and , eventually , submit to death .
Many people have called this the thinking person 's The Island .
But really , it 's so much more .
The deep terror , paired with the innocent curiosity and blind faith these characters have , is soul - crushing .
We 're very excited that these three actors were picked to star in this intense picture , and we 're interested in what Romanek , the director of One Hour Photo , will do with Ishiguro 's novel .
Hello everyone :-)
I liked this structable , BUT I have a question about quantities !.
I am guessing that the recipe is American , as " gallons " are not used anywhere else anymore .
So to confuse the question even more , IS the 3/4 gallon , US gallons , or Imperial gallons ?
I Have seven hives available , and at the moment all the Ironbark trees are in flower , and Im getting about 60 kilos of pure honey a week ( a kilo is 2.2 lbs imperial weight ) .
I dont over strain my honey ( just a mesh grill ) and dont use heat anywhere in the process , not even to uncap the cells , ( a stainless steel carving knife is used ) .
I will keep you posted on my first mead brew , ( I mostly make beers ) after I get some feedback on quantity .
Best regards

LIVERPOOL face an agonising 48 - hour wait to discover the extent of the hamstring injury suffered by World Cup winner Fernando Torres .
The Reds ’ striker pulled up sharply moments after he had played a part in the build up to Andres Iniesta ’s winning goal against Holland in Johannesburg ’s Soccer City last night .
It was initially feared that Torres would face a lengthy lay - off , as the television images showed him in tears and beating the ground in frustration .
However , he was able to take part in Spain ’s celebrations – he even posed with a Liverpool scarf draped over his shoulders – and it is understood he walked out of Soccer City briskly , without any need for assistance .
With Spain flying back to Madrid for a glorious homecoming , Liverpool were not expecting to hear from either Spain ’s medical staff or Torres today .
Torres is now officially on a three - week break from the club , along with the other players who were involved in the dramatic conclusion to the 19th World Cup final .
While there was joy for Torres and Pepe Reina , the emotions experienced by Dutch pair Dirk Kuyt and Ryan Babel were of complete despair ; Kuyt – who was substituted with 20 minutes left of normal time – was “ devastated ” that his dream of becoming a World Champion had ended in such fashion .
Kuyt – who had enjoyed a fine individual tournament – at least made a point of embracing both Reina and Torres , as the Dutch side formed a guard of honour for the Spanish as they made the their way back on to the pitch with the trophy .
There was also complete despair for Everton ’s representative in the World Cup final – John Heitinga was sent off for a second bookable offence in extra time .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and her misbegotten immigration law , SB1070 , may be popular with Arizonans looking for a handy scapegoat right now , but they may not be so popular a little down the road , after they 've completely destroyed what 's left of the state 's economy .
KPHO -TV in Phoenix , for instance , found that her fearmongering about " headless corpses " was driving tourists away from the state in droves :
Veronica and Richard Schultz have owned the guest ranch for the past 14 years .
The operation ’s close proximity to the border used to be a selling point for guests .
Now , it ’s more of a repellent .
“ We ’ve definitely lost guests and we 've had guests call us .
We ’ve had friends call us from all over the country and say , ‘ Hey , are you safe ? ’ ” Richard Schultz said .
Between the economy and boycotts related to Arizona ’s tough new immigration law , SB 1070 , tourism in the state is down 10 percent .
The Shultzes said state politicians are not helping matters .
Every day on cable news , anchors and reporters are discussing an invasion at the border , headless bodies in the desert or a rash of kidnappings .
During this election cycle , Arizona politicians are touting the potential dangers of illegal immigration .
Gov. Jan Brewer is one of the loudest voices .
She has made several statements to the national media , the validity of which CBS 5 Investigates could not confirm .
The governor told one media outlet that almost all illegal immigrants are bringing drugs across the border .
U.S. Border Patrol officials said that statement is false .
Brewer also said law enforcement officials have found decapitated bodies in the desert .
Calls to all of Arizona ’s border county medical examiners revealed no decapitated bodies have been reported to them .
You 've also gotta love how , when asked about her rhetoric in the segment above , Brewer simply fled .
She must be getting her lessons in media relations from Sharron Angle .
Then there was the LA Times piece reporting how Latinos are fleeing the state in droves -- and how it 's killing businesses :
No one has measured the effect of SB 1070 on businesses , or the number of immigrants it has prompted to leave Arizona .
But merchants say the repercussions are clear — not just in how it 's prompted many families to leave the state , but scared others enough to curtail their regular activities .
" The economy 's already bad , but on top of it [ SB 1070 ] is like a bullet in the head to us , " said Osameh Odeh , 35 , whose Eden Wear clothing store was empty one recent afternoon .
" People do n't come out of their houses anymore . "
Of course , we not only predicted this outcome , we reported on its early manifestations already awhile back .
You know the political price for this may be a steep one -- considering that wrecking the economy is not usually a popular outcome .
Even Judge Bolton 's ruling , staving off the law 's enactment , can't prevent these outcomes .
And it could n't happen to a nicer bunch of people .
The Washington Times published an article Tuesday on the Senate Armed Services Committee ’s recent move to repeal a ban on private funding for abortions on military bases .
The story contained several misleading and unfortunate claims from anti-abortion members of Congress .
The paper then followed up that article with an editorial today in which the paper itself that takes many of those claims to a new level .
First , some background :
The ban on abortions in military facilities was first put into place in 1988 with an internal Department of Defense memorandum and then was signed into law by President Bush the same year .
In 1993 , President Bill Clinton reversed the policy by executive order , but Congress intervened two years later to codify and reinstate the ban .
The current ban does not allow women to obtain abortions on military bases even if they pay with their own money , and only permits it if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or if the woman ’s life is at risk .
However , many women are afraid to say they have been raped for fear of reprisal from their unit .
Even when stationed in countries where abortion is legal , servicewomen frequently do not have access to abortions for a number of reasons , including lack of adequate local health facilities , lack of trained medical personnel or being stationed in remote or hostile areas .
Additionally , women who travel for abortions must ask their commanding officer for permission to travel and detail the reasons for leaving the base .
While the Washington Times editorial board may think they know what is best for all pregnant servicewomen and their families , a servicewoman facing an unintended pregnancy should have the same rights and opportunities to make the right decision for her circumstances as the rest of us .
The amendment passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee ( attached to the National Defense Authorization Act and introduced by Sen. Roland Burris [ D - Ill . ] ) , would simply repeal the dangerous ban on abortions in military facilities and allow U.S servicewomen to use their own money to get the health care they need .
Contrary to what the members in Congress interviewed in Tuesday ’s Washington Times story claimed , the amendment would not require the Department of Defense to pay for abortion services .
( The amendment would also allow health care professionals a right to refuse to perform an abortion . )
Comprehensive medical care should not be denied to any member of our armed services , including those stationed far from home .
We must no longer prohibit our women in uniform from exercising their fundamental right to make health care decisions for themselves simply because of their military service and where they have been stationed .

Apple CEO
Steve Jobs has been busy in recent days responding to customers emails , many of which have been addressing signal issues on the company 's new iPhone 4 .
Boy Genius Report shares a new conversation between Jobs and a customer on the issue containing several interesting aspects .
First , it appears that contact was initiated by an Apple engineer who reached out to the customer after seeing a YouTube video regarding the issue posted by the customer .
The engineer reportedly informed the customer that Apple does not consider it a problem and asked him not to post any additional videos .
The customer followed up with an email expressing frustration at the situation and sent a copy to Jobs , who responded , " No , you are getting all worked up over a few days of rumors .
Calm down . "
With the customer arguing that the situation is much more than just rumors , Jobs again replied , claiming that the customer is " most likely in an area with very low signal strength . "
Unappeased , the increasingly agitated customer continued to press the issue by claiming that the entire country must have low signal strength .
Not willing to give up the fight , however , Jobs replied yet again to claim that the customer " may be working from bad data " and reiterate his earlier suggestion that customers should " stay tuned . "
Jobs also noted that Apple is " working on it " , although it remains unclear exactly how the company is planning to address the issue .
Jobs also sent one final message , encouraging the customer to " retire , relax , enjoy your family .
It is just a phone .
Not worth it . "
Update :
The final quote was actual written by " Tom " rather than Steve Jobs , according to an update by Boy Genius Report .
Additionally , AppleInsider reports that it had also been approached by the customer regarding the story , with the customer requesting an unspecified amount of money for the rights to publish it .
Update 2 : Apple PR says fake emails .

This could possibly be the worst case of plagiarism in politics , yet .
The Denver Post has uncovered a $ 300,000 case of it in GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott McInnis 's past .
Although GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott McInnis presented his " Musings on Water " for publication as original works , portions are identical and nearly identical to an essay on water written 20 years earlier by now - Colorado Supreme Court Justice Gregory J. Hobbs .
A Clemson University expert who reviewed McInnis ' work next to Hobbs ' essay called it a clear case of plagiarism of both words and ideas .
McInnis ' water articles were a required part of his two - year fellowship at the Hasan Family Foundation in 2005 and 2006 .
The former congressman , who left office in 2004 , was paid $ 300,000 to do speaking engagements and " research and write a monthly article on water issues that can be distributed to media and organizations as well as be available on the Internet . "
Totaling 150 pages over 23 installments , the articles discussing state water policy are devoid of footnotes , endnotes or other forms of attribution .
One of those installments has four full pages that are " nearly reprinted verbatim " from the Hobbs essay .
McInnis is n't commenting , but his spokesperson says he recognizes there are similarities , " but blamed a researcher . "
A researcher who was involved despite the fact that Foundation granting him fellowship stipulated that the work was intended to be done " solely by Mr. McInnis , and not in concert with anyone else , " according to a statement from the Hasan Family Foundation .
So he took $ 300,000 to steal someone else 's work , and then blames the theft on someone else , despite the fact that the only name that appeared on McInnis 's work was his own .
How Republican of him .
London , England ( CNN ) --
Two nine - month - old twin girls were in a serious condition in hospital on Monday after being mauled by a fox as they slept in their London home , according to police .
The two girls were attacked in their upstairs bedroom at a house in Hackney , east London , after the fox apparently entered the house through a door left open because of the heat while the twins ' parents watched television downstairs , police said .
" Officers and the London Ambulance Service attended and found two nine - month - old girls with injuries , " a Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN .
" Both babies were taken to an east London hospital where their condition is described as serious but stable . "
A fox caught in a trap placed at the rear of the property by local environmental officers was destroyed early on Monday , the spokesman said .
" On Sunday night a neighbor informed environmental health officers that an animal could be heard in one of the traps , " he said .
" A vet was called to establish if it was safe to move the animal .
It was determined it was not and the fox was humanely killed by the pest controller ...
The traps will remain in situ for the time being . "
The twins , Lola and Isabella Koupparis , are being treated at London 's Royal Free Hospital .
The twins ' four - year - old brother , who was also asleep upstairs , was not hurt , the UK's Press Association said .
The girls ' mother , Pauline Koupparis , told the BBC she had gone to check on the twins after hearing " a funny cry , not a normal cry " from the bedroom .
" It was quite muffled but very pained .
I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella 's cot , I thought she had a nosebleed .
" I put on the light , I saw the fox , it just looked at me and it was n't even scared of me .
I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood . "
Foxes are a common sight throughout London , especially in Hackney which backs onto the green spaces of Hackney Marshes , the Lea Valley Regional Park and the new Olympic site .
A neighbor of the family told PA : " We 've all got foxes at the bottom of our gardens .
Some people have got two or three living in their garden .
They 're all as bold as brass .
You walk out into the garden and you have to shoo them away . "
Of the twin girls , she said : " They 're beautiful little babies , really beautiful . "
Michael Parra , another neighbor , said police had warned residents not to leave doors open in the summer weather .
" We see a lot of foxes around here .
They 're always in our garden .
Something should be done about them .
I would love to get them out of here .
They 're really a nuisance and a danger .
They 've terrorized our garden . "
A Hackney Council spokesman said the council did n't have dedicated environmental officers to deal with foxes but had called in a private contractor over the incident .
He said the council usually received " one or two phone calls a month " from people concerned about foxes going through their trash .
" We have never had reports in the past of foxes attacking residents , " the spokesman told CNN .
" All the expert advice we have had suggests that shocking incidents like this are incredibly rare , and our thoughts are with the children and their family . "
Viagra and hearing loss
Research shows that Viagra and similar drugs increase your risk of sudden hearing loss , tinnitus and dizziness .

Viagra and hearing loss
https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/47446-Viagra-hearing-loss
If you take Viagra or another similar medication for erectile dysfunction , be aware that you 're at an increased risk of developing a hearing condition known as sudden sensorineural hearing loss .
Erectile dysfunction drugs and hearing loss
Talk to your doctor right away if you
experience hearing loss after taking
Viagra or a similar drug .
Any of the dozen or so drugs that belong to the class of medications known as PDE - 5 - inhibitors are linked to sudden hearing loss .
The more common ones include Viagra , Cialis and Levitra .
Some researchers have dubbed this " Viagra deafness . "
In the limited research that has been done on this problem , hearing loss typically occurs in one ear only and within one day of taking one of these drugs .
About a third of the time , the hearing loss is temporary .
The evidence
One of the first alarm bells was a 2007 case report , published in The Archives of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery , about a man who experienced sudden hearing loss in both ears after taking Viagra .
That prompted the FDA to monitor for similar cases of men experiencing sudden hearing loss in one or both ears , sometimes accompanied by tinnitus , or a ringing in the ears , after taking one of these drugs .
Then , a larger study found a similar link :
Men who reported use of PDE - 5i medications were twice as likely to also report hearing loss as were men who had not used the drugs .
However , the study could not prove cause and effect .
These types of drugs are linked to several other side effects , including vision problems , headaches and upset stomach .
The findings prompted the Federal Drug Administration to send out a new warning , and more information was added to drug labels .
For example , the patient label for Viagra includes the following : " Sudden loss or decrease in hearing , sometimes with ringing in the ears and dizziness , has been rarely reported in people taking PDE5 inhibitors , including Viagra .
It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the PDE5 inhibitors , to other diseases or medications , to other factors , or to a combination of factors .
If you experience these symptoms , stop taking Viagra and contact a doctor right away . "
More :
Which drugs cause hearing loss ?
What are the symptoms of sudden hearing loss ?
The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders defines sudden sensorineural hearing loss as an unexplained , rapid loss of hearing either all at once or over a few days .
Seek help right away
Sudden hearing loss is considered a medical emergency — do not delay treatment .
It is important to tell your treating physician that you take a medication linked to sudden hearing loss .
If you have erectile dysfunction and are prescribed one of these drugs , be sure to talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks associated with the use of a PDE - 5i .
And become your own best advocate for healthy hearing by discussing any hearing loss you think you might be experiencing with a hearing healthcare professional .

Eclipse Community Survey Shows Open Source Dev Trends
What platforms and tools are open source developers using in 2010 ?
A new study from the Eclipse Foundation provides a few clues .
The Eclipse Foundation study compiled responses from 1,696 developers and provides insights into current open source development practices .
Among the findings in the Eclipse report is that developers are increasingly turning to Linux as a platform for both deployment and development .
For the 2010 report , 32.7 percent of survey respondents reported that they used Linux as their development operating system .
The 2010 figure is an increase over the 2009 study when 26.9 percent of respondents identified Linux as their development platform operating system of choice .
Overall , Windows remains the top development platform in Eclipse 's study at 58.3 percent , which is a decline from the 64.3 percent reported for 2009 .
Among the respondents that use Linux for development , Ubuntu was the leading distribution at 18.3 percent followed by Fedora at only 4.7 percent .
The increasing use of Linux by Eclipse developers is n't necessarily the result of a drive by Eclipse towards the Linux desktop .
" I actually think it is more a sign that Linux is gaining adoption on the desktop , " Ian Skerrett , director of marketing at the Eclipse Foundation , told InternetNews.com .
" Eclipse is improving the Linux tools experience , but I do n't think this drives the decision on which operating system developers use on their desktop . "
From a deployment perspective , Linux is the leader at 44 percent with Windows trailing at 39 percent .
In terms of the Java application servers that developers are using , respondents identified Apache Tomcat as the leader at 33.8 percent , followed by JBoss at 10.5 percent and IBM Websphere at 5.1 percent .
Oracle 's open source MySQL database was the primary database used by the Eclipse survey respondents , coming in at 31.8 percent .
Oracle 's namesake proprietary database was in second place at 21.6 percent .
The Eclipse survey also found that Oracle database users were more likely to use Windows as their development desktop whereas MySQL users were more likely to use Linux .
Two years after making the claim , a team of astronomers says it holds bragging rights to releasing the first ever direct picture of an alien planet orbiting a sunlike star .
Most of the more than 400 known extrasolar planets , or exoplanets , have been found using indirect detection methods , such as looking for changes in starlight as a planet 's gravity tugs on its host star , or as the planet passes in front of the star .
Unveiled in September 2008 , a picture from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii shows a direct view of a star system dubbed 1RXS 1609 .
At the time , astronomers did n't have enough data to say for sure that the bright dot near the star was in fact an orbiting world and not just an object in a chance alignment , as seen from Earth .
Several other teams have made and confirmed direct pictures of exoplanets , including a 2004 picture of the planet Fomalhaut b— also orbiting a sunlike star — which was released a few months after the shot of 1RXS 1609 .
Using more observations and new pictures from Gemini , the team studying 1RXS 1609 has now confirmed that their original picture does in fact show a planet circling the young star .
" From the start we suspected that the two were gravitationally bound , but it was just a matter of patiently waiting and watching long enough to see some motion , " said team leader David Lafrenière , an exoplanet researcher at the University of Montreal in Canada .
" Now we finally have the data to say that the planet and star are indeed bound and travel together through space at the same direction and speed . "
Picture Shows Unusually Far-Out Planet
The new data also helped astronomers refine estimates of the mass and orbital distance of the pictured planet .
After studying the unique properties of light from the system , Lafrenière and colleagues concluded the planet is about eight times more massive than Jupiter , making it a relative lightweight among known exoplanets .
The object orbits roughly 31 billion miles ( 50 billion kilometers ) away from its host star — about 330 times the distance between Earth and the sun .
By contrast , the dwarf planet Pluto orbits , on average , about 3.6 billion miles ( 5.8 billion kilometers ) from the sun .
The finding suggests the planet in the 1RXS 1609 system is the smallest known world orbiting at such a vast distance from its stellar host .
