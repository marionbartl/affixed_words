The Democratic - led House failed to block " enhanced interrogation "
Michael Mukasey said giving details might suggest that political pressure could sway law enforcement decisions .
The tapes were said to show techniques such as water - boarding , which simulates drowning .
The CIA denies torture .
Meanwhile , Republican Senators have blocked a bill restricting the interrogation methods the CIA can use .
The House of Representatives passed the bill on Thursday before passing it to the Senate .
Among its provisions the bill would restrict the use of water - boarding , regarded as a form of torture by many human rights advocates .
Stunned
In letters to the House and Senate committees investigating the destruction of the interrogation tapes , Mr Mukasey said he saw no need to appoint a special prosecutor into the issue .
" I am aware of no facts at present to suggest that department attorneys cannot conduct this inquiry in an impartial manner , " he wrote .
" If I become aware of information that leads me to a different conclusion , I will act on it . "
His decision was criticised by Republicans and Democrats , who said Mr Mukasey was hampering congressional oversight of the justice department .
" We are stunned that the justice department would move to block our investigation , " the joint leaders of the House Intelligence Committee said in response .
Earlier in the week CIA director Michael Hayden told the committee that he had no prior knowledge of plans to destroy the tapes and that his organisation " could have done an awful lot better " in keeping Congress informed on the issue .
He said last week that the tapes of the interrogations of two alleged al - Qaeda operatives had been destroyed because they were no longer of intelligence value and to protect the identities of agents .
The destruction of the recordings has provoked concern among some lawmakers and human rights groups .
" It smells like the cover - up of the cover - up , " said Democratic Rep Jane Harman , who chairs the House Homeland Security subcommitee on intelligence .
" The destruction of these tapes appears to be a part of an extensive , long - term pattern of misusing executive authority to insulate individuals from criminal prosecution for torture and abuse , " the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement said .
This week , NASA 's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) showed off three key findings contained in five years of data :
( 1) New evidence that a sea of cosmic neutrinos permeates the universe
(2) Clear evidence the first stars took more than a half - billion years to create a cosmic fog
( 3) Tight new constraints on the burst of expansion in the universe 's first trillionth of a second
" We are living in an extraordinary time , " said Gary Hinshaw of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Ours is the first generation in human history to make such detailed and far - reaching measurements of our universe . "
WMAP measures the composition of the universe .
The top chart shows a pie chart of the relative constituents today .
A similar chart ( bottom ) shows the composition at 380,000 years old ( 13.7 billion years ago ) when the light WMAP observes emanated .
The composition varies as the universe expands : the dark matter and atoms become less dense as the universe expands , like an ordinary gas , but the photon and neutrino particles also lose energy as the universe expands , so their energy density decreases faster than the matter .
They formed a larger fraction of the universe 13.7 billion years ago .
It appears that the dark energy density does not decrease at all , so it now dominates the universe even though it was a tiny contributor 13.7 billion years ago .
WMAP measures a remnant of the early universe - its oldest light .
The conditions of the early times are imprinted on this light .
It is the result of what happened earlier , and a backlight for the later development of the universe .
This light lost energy as the universe expanded over 13.7 billion years , so WMAP now sees the light as microwaves .
By making accurate measurements of microwave patterns , WMAP has answered many longstanding questions about the universe's age , composition and development .
The universe is awash in a sea of cosmic neutrinos .
These almost weightless sub-atomic particles zip around at nearly the speed of light .
Millions of cosmic neutrinos pass through you every second .
" A block of lead the size of our entire solar system would n’t even come close to stopping a cosmic neutrino , ” said science team member Eiichiro Komatsu of the University of Texas at Austin .
WMAP has found evidence for this so - called " cosmic neutrino background " from the early universe .
Neutrinos made up a much larger part of the early universe than they do today .
Microwave light seen by WMAP from when the universe was only 380,000 years old , shows that , at the time , neutrinos made up 10 % of the universe , atoms 12 % , dark matter 63 % , photons 15 % , and dark energy was negligible .
In contrast , estimates from WMAP data show the current universe consists of 4.6 % percent atoms , 23 % dark matter , 72 % dark energy and less than 1 percent neutrinos .
Cosmic neutrinos existed in such huge numbers they affected the universe ’s early development .
That , in turn , influenced the microwaves that WMAP observes .
WMAP data suggest , with greater than 99.5 % confidence , the existence of the cosmic neutrino background - the first time this evidence has been gleaned from the cosmic microwaves .
Much of what WMAP reveals about the universe is because of the patterns in its sky maps .
The patterns arise from sound waves in the early universe .
As with the sound from a plucked guitar string , there is a primary note and a series of harmonics , or overtones .
The third overtone , now clearly captured by WMAP , helps to provide the evidence for the neutrinos .
The hot and dense young universe was a nuclear reactor that produced helium .
Theories based on the amount of helium seen today predict a sea of neutrinos should have been present when helium was made .
The new WMAP data agree with that prediction , along with precise measurements of neutrino properties made by Earth - bound particle colliders .
Another breakthrough derived from WMAP data is clear evidence the first stars took more than a half - billion years to create a cosmic fog .
The data provide crucial new insights into the end of the " dark ages , " when the first generation of stars began to shine .
The glow from these stars created a thin fog of electrons in the surrounding gas that scatters microwaves , in much the same way fog scatters the beams from a car ’s headlights .
" We now have evidence that the creation of this fog was a drawn - out process , starting when the universe was about 400 million years old and lasting for half a billion years , " said WMAP team member Joanna Dunkley of the University of Oxford in the U.K. and Princeton University in Princeton , N.J. " These measurements are currently possible only with WMAP . "
A third major finding arising from the new WMAP data places tight constraints on the astonishing burst of growth in the first trillionth of a second of the universe , called “ inflation ” , when ripples in the very fabric of space may have been created .
Some versions of the inflation theory now are eliminated .
Others have picked up new support .
" The new WMAP data rule out many mainstream ideas that seek to describe the growth burst in the early universe , " said WMAP principal investigator , Charles Bennett , of The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Md. " It is astonishing that bold predictions of events in the first moments of the universe now can be confronted with solid measurements . "
The five - year WMAP data were released this week , and results were issued in a set of seven scientific papers submitted to the Astrophysical Journal .
For further information , see http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov.
Prior to the release of the new five - year data , WMAP already had made a pair of landmark finds .
In 2003 , the probe 's determination that there is a large percentage of dark energy in the universe erased remaining doubts about dark energy 's very existence .
That same year , WMAP also pinpointed the 13.7 billion year age of the universe .
Additional WMAP science team institutions are : the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics , Columbia University , University of British Columbia , ADNET Systems , University of Chicago , Brown University , and UCLA .
Dirk Nowitzki insisted Monday that he does n't know yet if he can make one of his trademark fast recoveries from the leg injuries he suffered in Sunday 's crunching fall against San Antonio .
All he knows for sure , at this stage , is that he 's extremely fortunate .
" It 's a little disappointing now , but I think the good thing is [ that ] it could 've been a lot worse , " Nowitzki told reporters in Dallas after being diagnosed with a moderate high left ankle sprain and a mildly sprained left knee .
" I was really lucky .
Something more could have happened to my knee or the leg could have been broken .
I think this is the best - case scenario .
It could have been a season - ending injury or even career - ending .
So I 'm definitely trying to see the positive side . "
Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said Sunday that the club was initially bracing for a two - week absence , but after an MRI confirmed the injuries , an official timetable for Nowitzki 's return was not announced Monday .
Sources close to Nowitzki , however , told ESPN.com that the 29 - year - old remains hopeful of returning in less than two weeks , even though stiffness in the ankle and the knee has required Nowitzki 's left foot to be placed in a protective boot .
Given Nowitzki's history of fast returns from numerous ankle injuries , it 's not inconceivable that he could be back in the lineup sometime next week .
But Nowitzki noted that the high ankle sprain is " not really a normal ankle sprain , " which makes it tougher for him to make projections .
" I really do n't have any experience with this , " Nowitzki said .
" This is fairly new to me .
And with the knee , I 've never really had knee problems .
So I 'm just going to take it day by day .
I really do n't know how long it 's going to take .
A week ?
Two weeks ?
I have no idea . "
Asked if he 's fairly certain that he 'll at least be back before the playoffs , given his reputation for durability after never missing more than six games in any of his previous nine regular seasons , Nowitzki said : " I 'm hoping .
Usually I 'm good with recovering from injuries .
I know I 'm not 20 any more , but I still feel young , my body feels young .
So hopefully I can recover pretty quick . "
Fresh off a 67 - win season that led to Nowitzki 's first MVP award , Dallas is clinging to the seventh seed in the West after the 88 - 81 defeat to San Antonio dropped its record to 0 - 8 against teams with a winning record since the Jason Kidd trade .
Three of the Mavericks ' next five games , furthermore , are against teams directly below them in the standings : Denver and Golden State .
" I think this is a great challenge , " Kidd said .
" We feel that we still have a lot of the pieces to be successful .
We know that it 's not going to be easy . "
Of course , even one game without Nowitzki is a major blow for the Mavericks , as evidenced by their 113-98 loss to Houston earlier this month when Nowitzki was serving a one - game suspension for a flagrant foul on Utah 's Andrei Kirilenko .
Nowitzki crumpled to the floor and clutched his left leg in agony with just over three minutes to go in Sunday 's third quarter after attempting to block a shot by San Antonio 's Ime Udoka .
Nowitzki's leg appeared to bend and twist awkwardly after Udoka 's right leg came down on Nowitzki's as they landed .
Nowitzki started reaching for his ankle and then grabbed his calf , slapping the floor repeatedly .
He put a hand on his head , then did n't move while team doctor Tarek Souryal and athletic trainer Casey Smith worked on his lower leg .
The arena was silent until Nowitzki sat up .
Nowitzki had 11 points and seven rebounds at the time , with San Antonio leading 56 - 54 and 3:18 left in the period .
A shell - shocked Cuban walked out of American Airlines Center with two fingers aloft to reflect the initial two - week fears .
Nowitzki was reminded by local reporters on Monday that Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens suffered a similar high ankle sprain that required three weeks of constant rehabilitation -- and some time in a hyperbaric chamber -- to make it back for the playoffs .
One difference , though : Nowitzki has not needed crutches in the immediate aftermath of his injury ; Owens did .
" I 'm going to ice my butt off for the next couple of days and hopefully I can be out there as soon as I can , " Nowitzki said .
" I do n't even want to think that we 're not going to make the playoffs .
If it 's best to stay [ in Dallas while the team goes to Denver on Wednesday ] and get treatment and sleep in whatever chamber I need to sleep in , I 'll do that . "

The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense
The CIS Critical Security Controls are a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today 's most pervasive and dangerous attacks .
A principal benefit of the Controls is that they prioritize and focus a smaller number of actions with high pay - off results .
The Controls are effective because they are derived from the most common attack patterns highlighted in the leading threat reports and vetted across a very broad community of government and industry practitioners .
They were created by the people who know how attacks work - NSA Red and Blue teams , the US Department of Energy nuclear energy labs , law enforcement organizations and some of the nation 's top forensics and incident response organizations - to answer the question , " what do we need to do to stop known attacks . "
That group of experts reached consensus and today we have the most current Controls .
The key to the continued value is that the Controls are updated based on new attacks that are identified and analyzed by groups from Verizon to Symantec so the Controls can stop or mitigate those attacks .
The Controls take the best - in - class threat data and transform it into actionable guidance to improve individual and collective security in cyberspace .
Too often in cybersecurity , it seems the " bad guys " are better organized and collaborate more closely than the " good guys . "
The Controls provide a means to turn that around .
SANS Supports the CIS Critical Security Controls with Training , Research and What Works
To support information security practitioners and managers implement the CIS Critical Security Controls , SANS provide a number of resources and information security courses .

The SANS " What Works " program highlights success stories in cybersecurity - real examples of how real security teams have made measurable improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of their security controls .
While most of the press coverage focuses on breaches and other security failures , there are thousands of cybersecurity leaders quietly working hard and make advances against threats while enabling business and mission needs .
SANS expert John Pescatore interviews the end user and decision maker and produces a Q&A formatted case study and a live webcast that allows security practitioners to take advantage of lessons learned and accelerate their own cybersecurity improvements .

PARANORMAL QUIZ PARANORMAL QUIZ WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
It was bad enough when the TV and lights inexplicably flicked on at night , Misty Conrad says .
When her daughter began talking to an unseen girl named Nicole and neighbors said children had been murdered in the house , it was time to move .
Put Conrad , a homemaker from Hampton , Va. , firmly in the camp of the 34 % of people who say they believe in ghosts , according to a pre-Halloween poll by The Associated Press and Ipsos .
That 's the same proportion who believe in unidentified flying objects — exceeding the 19 % who accept the existence of spells or witchcraft .
YOUR STORY : What are your views of the supernatural ?
Forty - eight percent believe in extrasensory perception , or ESP .
But nearly half of you knew we were about to tell you that , right ?
Conrad , now 40 , lived in Syracuse , Ind. , when her family was scared from the house they rented .
" It kind of creeped you out , " she recalled this week .
" I needed to get us out . "
To put the roughly one - third who believe in ghosts and UFOs in perspective , it 's about the same as , in recent AP - Ipsos polls , the 36 % who said they are baseball fans ; the 37 % who said the U.S. made the right decision to invade Iraq ; and the 31 % who approve of the job President Bush is doing .
A smaller but still substantial 23 % say they have actually seen a ghost or believe they have been in one 's presence , with the most likely candidates for such visits including single people , Catholics and those who never attend religious services .
By 31 % to 18 % , more liberals than conservatives report seeing a specter .
Those who dismissed the existence of ghosts include Morris Swadener , 66 , a Navy retiree from Kingston , Wash .
He says he shot one with his rifle when he was a child .
" I woke up in the middle of the night and saw a white ghost in my closet , " he said .
" I discovered I 'd put a hole in my brand new white shirt .
My mother and father were not amused . "
Three in 10 have awakened sensing a strange presence in the room .
For whatever it says about matrimony , singles are more likely than married people to say so .
Fourteen percent — mostly men and lower - income people — say they have seen a UFO .
Among them is Danny Eskanos , 44 , an attorney in Palm Harbor , Fla. , who says as a Colorado teenager he watched a bright light dart across the sky , making abrupt stops and turns .
FLASHBACK : Women more likely to believe in paranormal " I knew a little about airplanes and helicopters , and it was not that , " he said .
" It 's one of those things that sticks in your mind . "
Spells and witchcraft are more readily believed by urban dwellers , minorities and lower - earning people .
Those who find credibility in ESP are more likely to be better educated and white — 51 % of college graduates compared to 37 % with a high school diploma or less , about the same proportion by which white believers outnumber minorities .
Overall , the 48 % who accept ESP is less than the 66 % who gave that answer to a similar 1996 Newsweek question .
One in five say they are at least somewhat superstitious , with young men , minorities , and the less educated more likely to go out of their way to seek luck .
Twenty - six percent of urban residents — twice the rate of those from rural areas — said they are superstitious , while single men were more superstitious than unmarried women , 31 % to 17 % .
The most admitted - to superstition , by 17 % , was finding a four - leaf clover .
Thirteen percent dread walking under a ladder or the groom seeing his bride before their wedding , while slightly smaller numbers named black cats , breaking mirrors , opening umbrellas indoors , Friday the 13th or the number 13 .
Generally , women were more superstitious than men about four - leaf clovers , breaking mirrors or grooms prematurely seeing brides .
Democrats were more superstitious than Republicans over opening umbrellas indoors , while liberals were more superstitious than conservatives over four - leaf clovers , grooms seeing brides and umbrellas .
Then there 's Jack Van Geldern , a computer programmer from Riverside , Conn .
Now 51 , Van Geldern is among the five % who say they have seen a monster in the closet — or in his case , a monster 's face he spotted on the wall of his room as a child .
" It was so terrifying I could n't move , " he said .
" Needless to say I survived the event and never saw it again . "
The poll , conducted Oct. 16 - 18 , involved telephone interviews with 1,013 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .

Of course now that Google ’s PageRank update is over , everyone that can flip their site for a good profit , is taking the opportunity .
Blogging Fingers recently sold for $ 6000 , and now One Man ’s Goal is on Sitepoint with a current bid of $ 6400 .
It is very interesting to see so many great sites sell long before they have shared the full breadth of their knowledge .
Had Darren Rowse given up on Problogger .net and just sold it , I doubt we would all be talking about him so much today .
Here is some of the text from the sale :
After much thought , I ’ve decided to sell my high - profile blog OneMansGoal .
Com .
This blog is a true gem , and it is already causing quite a splash at only 4 months old .
I ’ll get into the traffic and the revenue a little later , but I want you to know how truly magnificent this blog is .
After only 4 months of blogging ( I was completely new to the blog scene ) , I ’ve managed to earn a PR4 and quite a few high quality backlinks .
These backlinks include some of the biggest blogs in the make money online niche such as Problogger .
Net and Entrepreneurs - Journey .
Com ( among many others ) .
I am selling the blog because I have a new project in mind that I believe will be a big earner for me .
Rather than neglecting One Man ’s Goal and it ’s family of loyal readers , I ’d rather sell it to someone who can give it the attention it needs .
I might be persuaded to stay on as a paid blogger if you would like .
Also , if you need me to , I will stay on for a period of two weeks until you get settled and running smoothly ( free of charge ) .
It will be interesting to see if this trend continues .
The good news is that most sites , once they are sold , even if the author stays on for a while , the transition usually creates a drop in traffic .
That drop , in my experience , can be as much as half , so that makes my work in rising up the ranks of this niche that much easier .
Wired publishes photographs of Abu Ghraib
GRAPHIC : INCLUDES NUDITY AND DEATH
The following images , published today at Wired.com , have been compiled so viewers can see them in their entirety without having to reload pages .
Wired obtained them from an expert defense witness in the Abu Ghraib case , psychologist Philip Zimbardo .
Zimbardo speaks tomorrow at a conference , delivering a talk that reflects on his book , " The Lucifer Effect : Understanding How Good People Turn Evil . "
Read about it here .
In their publication , the magazine wrote , " Many of the images are explicit and gruesome , depicting nudity , degradation , simulated sex acts and guards posing with decaying corpses .
Viewer discretion is advised . "
Perhaps the most comprehensive multimedia compilation of images from the troubled US prison in Iraq is available at Salon.com , which published 279 photos and 19 videos in 2006 .
RAW STORY has traditionally published more graphic images than the American press , in an effort to expose the true dark toll of war .
Our 2005 article , " The American Iraq , " documented photographs taken by former Iraq vets .
The accompanying graphic photographs taken by veterans of the Iraq war -- which most of American has not seen -- are available at UnderMars.com .
These images are also graphic , and show photographs of Iraqis killed by bombings and US troops .
GUANTANAMO BAY , Cuba–A U.S. Special Forces soldier injured in the battle where Omar Khadr was captured says he was shocked to learn the Canadian teenager was n't the only person alive in an Afghan compound when a grenade fatally wounded another soldier .
Layne Morris , a former U.S. Green
Beret who was blinded in one eye during the 2002 firefight in Afghanistan and forced to retire from the army , said he always maintained Khadr was the sole survivor in the compound .
" That was a total shock to me .
Everyone had told me from the get - go that there was only one guy in there , " Morris said in a telephone interview from his Utah home yesterday .
A document inadvertently released to reporters here Monday disclosed that after the grenade was thrown , a U.S. operative killed another suspect and then shot Khadr twice in the back .
The revelation casts doubt on the Pentagon 's assertion that Khadr threw the grenade that fatally wounded Delta Force soldier and medic Christopher Speer .
Khadr , now 21 , is charged with " murder in violation of the laws of war " for Speer 's death in addition to attempted murder , conspiracy , spying and providing material support to terrorism .
Morris had been airlifted from the battle scene before Speer was injured , but said other soldiers involved in the firefight had told him Khadr was the only one who could have tossed the grenade .
The five - page classified document , however , states that an unidentified operative reportedly saw someone with an AK - 47 beside him , moving and " moaning " after the grenade was thrown .
He shot him in the head , killing him .
" When the dust rose , he saw a second man sitting up facing away from him leaning against the brush .
This man , later identified as Khadr , was moving ... ( the operative ) fired two rounds , both of which struck Khadr in the back . "
It appears no one witnessed Khadr throwing the grenade , but that the operative concluded Khadr was responsible based on his position and the trajectory of the grenade .
Khadr was 15 during the firefight and has been held in U.S. custody for almost six years .
This is the Pentagon 's third attempt to try Khadr after charges were twice dismissed – first by the U.S. Supreme Court , which deemed the process illegal , and then by a military judge , who ruled he did n't have jurisdiction to hear the case .
Up until this week it had been the military commission process itself that has been on trial – with Khadr 's lawyers and international civil rights groups challenging the legality of the commissions at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
But with this first official account of the firefight , and as Khadr 's trial nears , the prosecution 's evidence is also being called into question .
Canada 's opposition parties pressed Prime Minister Stephen Harper this week to intervene on Khadr 's behalf , insisting the Toronto man be rehabilitated rather than prosecuted .
But Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier maintained the government 's hands - off approach to the Khadr case yesterday , telling reporters in Ottawa that U.S. officials have assured Canada Khadr is " well treated over there . "
Khadr 's trial is scheduled to start in May although it 's likely his defence lawyers will ask for an extension .
In addition to having to prove Khadr was responsible for Speer 's death , the prosecution must show Khadr provided support for Al Qaeda and conspired with its members .
Khadr is also being held accountable for the deaths of two Afghan soldiers , according to his charge sheet .
Although he's not charged with their murders , it 's alleged he conspired with others to kill them .
Guantanamo's chief prosecutor , U.S. Army Col. Lawrence Morris , said they will prove Khadr " shared the criminal intent of those who did the shooting . "

Layne Morris said despite the new information released this week he is n't concerned about the coming trial or conflicting reports of what happened on July 27 , 2002 .
He said he believes there is evidence to show it was Khadr 's job to throw the grenades during the battle , while the other men in the house used their AK - 47s .
" Omar was the grenade man , " he said .

Apple
I walked into my local AT&T Wireless store on Saturday fully expecting and prepared to get a Blackberry 8820 .
My Blackberry 8800 died while I was in London last week , and both Visa and American Express tried to protect me from fraud by disallowing my attempts to order a new phone over the web .
Hence , my face - to - face visit with AT&T .
Unfortunately for Research in Motion , maker of the Blackberry , the in - store price for the 8820 was the same as the iPhone .
I deliberated for all of three seconds and walked out with the iPhone .
My reason was simple : I needed something that would sync consistently with my Mac .
My Blackberry - to - Mac sync has been hit or miss for the past year ( though I 've been testing a beta of the new PocketMac and it is quite good ) and I 'm fed up .
I just want something that works .
The iPhone " just works , " and then some .
I thought I would n't be able to type on the iPhone without tactile feedback .
I was wrong .
I 'm actually faster on the iPhone than I ever was on the Blackberry , and that 's with only an hour of " training . "
I thought I would miss a host of things with my Blackberry , but I have n't .
Instead , I 've been blown away by the innovative use of gestures and the user interface .
I resisted the iPhone for a year or so , but looking back it was inevitable that I 'd end here .
It is the best - designed phone that I 've ever seen or used .
It 's not perfect :
It aggravates me that I can't create SMS groups so that I can blast groups of friends ( the Blackberry also lacked this ) , though I can simply save a " conversation " with a group and use it to send out group texts .
I also could do without the clever ( but time - consuming ) graphics that accompany the deletion of an email , for example .
Plus , the lack of Flash makes the full - blown browser a bit less " full - blown " ( though I hear Flash is on its way ) .
But all its good points make up for these negatives .
The iPhone is an amazing device .
It was inevitable that I 'd find my way to it , just as it's inevitable that it will continue to take more and more market share , eventually breeding lower - end devices that will change the way we use mobile " phones . "
The iPhone is designed too well to be anything less than inevitable .
Is the music industry dying ?
An anecdote in a recent Economist perfectly summed up the problems facing the major music labels .
After EMI , the smallest of the Big Four , invited a teen focus group to its London headquarters in 2006 , it wanted to give the teens something for their time .
The response is worth quoting in full .
At the end of the session the EMI bosses thanked them for their comments and told them to help themselves to a big pile of CDs sitting on a table .
But none of the teens took any of the CDs , even though they were free .
" That was the moment we realised the game was completely up , " says a person who was there .
Given the years of declining revenues at the major labels and the constant stream of stories in the mainstream press about music 's decline , you'd be forgiven for thinking that the music industry 's pallbearers are already lined up and waiting in the hallway .
But music is n't on its deathbed yet ; in fact , people are listening to more artists than ever before , on more white earbuds than ever before , in more places than ever before .
They 're just not paying as much .
Do n't put all the blame on file - swapping , either , or chalk the problems up to an inability to " compete with free . "
Digital music sales soared in 2007 , and in fact , the total number of " units " moved during the year increased over 2006 .
eMusic , the number two music download service in the US behind iTunes , doubled its own projections for the Christmas season , pushed out 10 million tracks in the month of December , and added 50,000 new paying customers in the last six months .
And all of this happened without the four major labels even offering DRM - free tracks online .
Now that Sony BMG has finally capitulated , 2008 is poised to be the year digital goes so mainstream that even your parents use it .
All that good news means that music is alive and well — but it does n't mean that things are rosy at the major labels .
Let 's run the numbers from 2007 , then do a case study on eMusic 's recent results to see just what kind of success can be had in the digital download world by competing with free .
Major label blues
Revenues at the four major labels ( Warner , EMI , Sony BMG , and Universal ) have been on a slow decline throughout the decade .
From 2002 - 2006 , the majors ' revenue declined by 11 percent even as movies held steady at the box office and video games grew .
Despite the downturn , the chart below makes clear just how large the major label music business truly is .
Data sources : RIAA , MPAA , The NPD Group
Things have gotten bad enough that the labels themselves are demanding change even from their trade groups .
EMI has recently been pushing both the IFPI and RIAA to restructure their operations , for instance , and all four labels have tried to adjust to a new world by dropping DRM and launching innovative programs like " Comes With Music . "
Is the downturn due to people not paying for music , though ?
Hardly ; it 's due in large part to people not paying for CDs .
Again , looking at data from 2002 - 2006 , we can see that CD sales have seen sharp decreases in all but one year , with 2006 having the sharpest drop of the bunch ( 2007 may have been worse ) .
Data source : RIAA
But unit sales have actually been rising over the last few years , with 2007 being another strong year .
Reuters recently reported that overall unit sales rose 14 percent in 2007 , with digital sales jumping by 45 percent .
Data sources : RIAA , Nielsen Soundscan
What 's happening is obvious ; consumers are making far more purchases than ever before , but are often choosing to grab only selected tracks rather than complete albums .
The album may not be dying in a general way , but it has certainly lost its importance as the primary way that buyers in the digital era get their music .
Bands with a track record of putting out uneven albums wo n't be able to milk that strategy for massive profits anymore , nor will any labels that nurture such acts .
That has translated into a grim situation at the major labels .
Warner Music 's stock price is down more than 70 percent from its IPO price in 2005 .
EMI , recently acquired by private equity firm Terra Nova , was appalled by some aspects of the business it had acquired .
In a recent interview with the Financial Times , new EMI boss Guy Hands asked rhetorically , " Can you imagine what would happen if most consumer industries over - shipped by 20 per cent ?
Can you imagine any consumer industry having 10 per cent of employees as middle management ?
Can you imagine only 6 per cent of staff in production ? "
Things are so bad that EMI has been spending $ 50 million a year just to destroy CDs it could n't sell , and has announced plans to lay off as many as 2,000 employees .
The situation is reminiscent of a Tim O'Reilly essay from 2002 in which he pointed out that " File - sharing networks do n't threaten book , music , or film publishing .
They threaten existing publishers . "
The same holds true of music .
As long as the demand is present , there are huge opportunities to make money by giving consumers what they want — but that 's no guarantee that existing business models will continue to support companies .
It 's often said that it's hard to compete with free , and that may be true for some segments of the population .
( Are college kids ever really going to cough up much cash ? )
But for most adults who do n't get off on breaking the law or on stiffing artists , it 's easy enough to compete with free .
Make something that 's faster , more reliable , with better metadata and album art , and a huge DRM - free selection .
Throw in charts , some editorial staff , and some community features , and money is there to be made .
Even as the majors have found their revenues declining , indie - focused companies like eMusic are growing rapidly .
Ars talked to eMusic CEO David Pakman to get some insight into how his company fared in 2007 .

The issue of online privacy is a legal and ethical battleground
Two respected privacy campaigners have praised the user protection measures of a controversial online advertising system about to be deployed in the UK .
The tools , developed by US firm Phorm , track users ' online surfing habits .
BT , Virgin and Talk Talk have signed up to trial the technology .
Campaigner Simon Davies said : " We were impressed with the effort that had been put into minimising the collection of personal information . "
Mr Davies and Gus Hosein were invited by Phorm to assess its privacy protection measures .
The two work with campaign group Privacy International but their work for Phorm was done as part of a new privacy start - up , 80/20 Thinking Ltd.
Phorm has said its tools anonymise the data it collects and that users can opt out via their Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) at any stage .
Behavioural advertising through monitoring a user 's web habits is an ethical and legal minefield

Life blog Phorm answer your questions
But almost 1,000 people have signed a Downing Street online petition saying the system , called Webwise , breaches customers ' privacy .
The Information Commissioner 's office has said it has contacted Phorm to find out more information about how the system works .
In a statement , a spokesman for the office said : " We are currently reviewing this information .
We are also in contact with the ISPs who are working with Phorm and we are discussing this issue with them . "
Mr Davies told BBC
News : " Phorm does advance the whole sector of protecting personal information by two to three steps .
" The problem is that may not be good enough for consumers . "
He added : " Behavioural advertising is a rather spooky concept for many people . "
Randomised number Phorm works by placing a cookie on a user 's machine that contains a randomised identifying number .
That cookie tracks websites visited and draws conclusions about a user 's behaviour in order to target more relevant adverts .
If firms say this " enhances the user experience " , if that is true and users want it , then make it opt in
Simon Davies , Privacy International
The ISPs and companies who sign up to the scheme take a cut of advertising revenue .
Phorm has said the data collected is 100 % anonymous and no profile of the user is ever created , so that no - one could " reverse engineer " the information in order to establish identity .
The company 's website also states that the IP address of a computer , the unique identifying number of a machine online , is not stored , nor are search engine queries .
But the firm does " collect " search terms used , as well as keywords on web pages , which has concerned some web users .
There is also concern that users ' web surfing habits are being handed to a third - party company .
Speaking to Radio 4's iPM programme , Phorm chief executive Kent Ertugrul said : " It 's a choice .
If people think it 's not a choice they will feel it is being rammed down their throat and will react very , very badly to it .
" I understand that and I would too [ react badly ] .
The very first you will see when you go online after it has been deployed is a full - page notice and at that point if you are not happy , you can opt out .
" If you find that was n't enough , in the banner spaces as people are browsing you will see banner ads saying that Webwise is on .
" So if you do n't want it , you will be able to click on these ads and switch them off . "
' Informed consent '
On its website , Phorm 's chief executive Kent Ertugrul , said Phorm ignored form fields on websites , numbers with more than three digits , e-mail addresses and secure web pages .
Mr Davies said the onus would be on Internet Service Providers to ensure customers had enough information about the scheme in order to have " informed consent " .
He said unless ISPs were extremely clear they could run foul of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) .
" RIPA is pretty clear that the provision for notification for consent , and informed consent , have to be extremely clear , " he said .
A spokesman for BT said it was confident that Phorm met all applicable regulations and laws .
' Consumer benefits '
Later this month , 10,000 BT customers will be invited to take part in a trial of Phorm .
The BT spokesman said Phorm offered consumers two benefits .
" Customers will receive more relevant advertising and will get warnings if any of the websites they visits are known to be phishing sites . "
He said research BT had carried out had shown that customers did want more relevant advertising as a result of their surfing habits being tracked online .
" We have gone to considerable lengths to ensure our customers privacy is guaranteed , " he added .
Mr Davies said he remained opposed to services which required users to opt out .
He said : " If firms say this " enhances the user experience " , if that is true and users want it , then make it opt in .
" That will also avoid all sorts of legal problems . "
The spokesman for BT said the firm had made no decision about whether a wider deployment of Phorm would be opt in or opt out .
There has also been criticism that the ISPs have signed up to work with a company that was accused of pushing spyware while it was trading under the name 121 Media .
The company distributed a pop-up advert system called PeopleOnPage which collected broswing habits in order to target adverts .
Mr Ertugrul said : " People were unable to distinguish between spyware and adware .
" We went public as the only adware company .
The association between free adware and spyware was so strong ... that it threatened our core long - term values .
" We unilaterally shut down all of our revenues on that .
Nobody pushed us to do that . "

Yeah , but that 's only because as a society we 've become effete and lost the will to try new things just for the hell of it .
In the 60's they were trying things like nuclear propulsion , and they were walking on the moon .
Then , something horrible happened in the early 70's .
I grew up then , and I could FEEL it .
I 'm still trying to figure out exactly what it was , but I think what it was , was a generation of kids who grew up with television instead of playing with gizmos , and who got into power and then just turned our society into a big mess of paperwork and lawyering , because paperwork was all they 'd ever learned to do .
When I look at the physiology research done in the 60's , it takes my breath away .
The creativity of it !
The things they did !
I find my " new " ideas all the time in papers done in the 1960's , but they never went anywhere ( perfusion of organs with fluorocarbones to cool them , for example ) .
One guy ( the same guy in fact ) , before heart lung machines , repaired the hearts of babies by surgically cross-connecting them to the circulation of adult humans , who volunteered in order to save a life .
Where has that kind of courage gone ?
Where are the Yeagers and the Goddards and the Microbe Hunters ?
How come the heros of our movies are no longer Micky Rooney or Spencer Tracy playing Thomas Edison , or Paul Muni playing Erlich or Pasteur , instead Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison and Woody Harrelson playing Larry Flint ?
And movies whose heros are lawyers .
Arggh .
I do n't care if it is Tom Cruise or John Travolta .
And the rest of the movies seem to be re-creations of 60's TV shows .
Paperwork and lawyering .
Fixing and improving and advancing society by talk - talk , not building .
A lawyer president and his lawyer wife .
Crises of power that do n't involve spy planes and sputniks , but incredibly complicated and desceptive word defintions and complicated tax frauds .
You think we 're not preparing to go to Mars because SF is too optimistic ?
Sure .
But it was optimistic about whether or not the can - do engineering of the 40's and 50's , done by the kids who'd grown up playing with radios and mechanics in the 20's , was going to continue .
Needless to say , it did n't .
I 've seen a late 1950 's book of science fair projects for teenagers that include things like building your own X - ray machine and cyclotron ( no , I 'm not kidding -- it can be done ) .
There are rockets in there , and cloud chambers , and all kinds of wonderful electronics stuff .
But we did n't go that way .
Instead , we turned our children into little Clintons , and our society into a bunch of people sitting at PCs , entering data about social engineering , not mechanical engineering .
So instead of going to Mars , we went instead to beaurocratic Hell .
Enjoy , everybody .
It really could have been different .
Nature did n't stop us -- WE stopped us .

Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama intensified their populist economic appeals on Monday in an effort to attract support from economically struggling voters in Ohio and Texas , which are taking shape as potentially decisive contests in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Mrs. Clinton , campaigning in Wisconsin but looking forward to the big state primaries on March 4 , issued a 12 - page compendium of her economic policies that emphasized programs that aid families stressed by high oil prices , home foreclosures , costly student loans and soaring health care premiums .
In public appearances and in her economic manifesto , she took aim at common targets of populist appeals , including overpaid hedge fund managers , oil company profits , drug company subsidies and trade agreements that she says encourage companies to export jobs .
Many of her applause lines reprise the rhetoric employed by former Senator John Edwards , who dropped out of the presidential contest late last month after running on an explicitly populist economic message .
“ We need tax breaks for the middle class , not for the wealthy and the well - connected , ” Mrs. Clinton said at St. Norbert College in De Pere , Wis. , Monday morning .
“ We ’re going to rein in the special interests and get the $ 55 billion in giveaways and subsidies they ’ve gotten under Republicans back into your pockets . ”
She referred to the “ two oilmen in the White House ” and proposed multi-billion - dollar windfall profits tax on the oil industry to finance development of alternative energy sources and creation of “ green jobs . ”
WASHINGTON
The debate dominatrix knows how to rattle Obambi .
Mistress Hillary started disciplining her fellow senator last winter , after he began exploring a presidential bid .
When he winked at her , took her elbow and tried to say hello on the Senate floor , she did not melt , as many women do .
She brushed him off , a move meant to remind him that he was an upstart who should not get in the way of her turn in the Oval Office .
He was so shook up , he called a friend to say :
You would not believe what just happened with Hillary .
She has continued to flick the whip in debates .
She usually ignores Obama and John Edwards backstage , preferring to chat with the so - called second - tier candidates .
And she often looks so unapproachable while they ’re setting up on stage that Obama seems hesitant to be the first to say hi .
With so much at stake , she had to do it again in Vegas , this time using her voice , gaze and body language to such punishing effect that Obama looked as if he had been brought to heel .
It was a mesmerizing display , and at an event that drew the highest television ratings of any primary debate this year .
The momentum Obama had gained from a vivid speech at the Jefferson - Jackson Day dinner in Iowa drained away by the end of the first half - hour .

The government 's top foreign policy advisers were as inept as their US counterparts in failing to see that removing Saddam Hussein in 2003 was likely to lead to a nationalist insurgency by Sunnis and Shias and an Islamist government in Baghdad , run by allies of Iran , the Guardian has learned .
None of Whitehall 's " Arabists " warned Tony Blair of the difficulties which have plagued the occupation .
The revelation undermines the British claim that it was US myopia which was to blame for the failure to foresee what would happen in postwar Iraq .
" Everyone was unprepared for the aftermath , " a former ambassador , who served in the region at the time , told the Guardian .
" To my shame I was in the complacent camp [ in the Foreign Office ] .
We underestimated the insurgency .
I did n't hear anyone say , ' It 'll be a disaster , and it 'll all come unstuck ' .
People felt it was a leap in the dark but not that we were staring disaster in the face . "
Privately , and in rare cases publicly , British ministers and officials have blamed the chaos of the occupation on blunders in Washington , pointing the finger particularly at Donald Rumsfeld , who was sacked as defence secretary in 2006 .
The Guardian 's researches reveal that Britain 's analysts were equally wrong .
Christopher Segar , who took part in Whitehall 's Iraq Policy Unit 's prewar discussions and later headed the British office in Baghdad immediately after the invasion , said : " The conventional view was that Iraq was one of the most Western - oriented of Arab states , with its British - educated , urban and secular professionals .
I do n't think anyone in London appreciated how far Islamism had gone . "
Officials alone cannot be blamed .
Ministers failed to ask serious questions .
Blair never called on the experts for detailed analysis of the consequences of an invasion , officials say .
He saw the war as Iraq 's liberation and felt any postwar problems would pale in the face of Iraqi delight .
Opposition parties urged the government last year to authorise a full - scale independent inquiry into Whitehall 's prewar discussions , but Blair refused to .
Gordon Brown has taken the same line .
The two men claim it would be wrong as long as British troops remain in Iraq .
The Conservatives will renew their calls for an inquiry in a House of Lords debate on Iraq on Thursday .
The latest revelations are likely to increase pressure on the government .
Lord Hurd , former foreign secretary , said last night : " Blair and his colleagues sent British troops to kill and be killed in Iraq without proper planning ...
An inquiry is certainly needed to make sure this cannot happen again . "
In the absence of a public inquiry , the Guardian interviewed a range of recently retired officials who now feel freer to talk about the crucial pre-invasion period .
Contrary to the conventional view that the occupation 's problems stem mainly from failure to plan for postwar Iraq , they say there was plenty of planning , from how to react to mass refugee flows and a humanitarian crisis to the fallout from a sharp rise in the world price of oil .
The real failure , they concede , was one of political analysis .
Officials did not study how Iraqis would react to an occupation and what political forces would emerge on top once Saddam was removed .
One British diplomat who was based in the region and kept a special watch on the Shia Islamists admitted he did not foresee their postwar rise .
" The issue of secularism versus religion was discussed but none of the leaders of Sciri seemed very strong , " he said , referring to the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , a Shia grouping close to Iran .
" I do n't think anyone could have formed a view of the relative appeal of Sciri and [ the other main Shia bloc ] Dawa . "
He added that the maverick Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , whose Mahdi army has constantly defied occupation forces " was unheard of " .
Yet in post - invasion Iraq the two Islamist groupings , Sciri and Dawa , became the biggest electoral parties .
One reason for the weakness of British expertise was that , unlike France , Germany and Italy , Britain had not had an embassy in Baghdad since 1991 , which meant fewer diplomats with direct knowledge of the country .
At the urging of Jack Straw , then foreign secretary , Blair held a brief meeting with six British academic specialists in November 2002 .
It was never repeated .
Charles Tripp of the School of Oriental and African Studies , and author of the standard work , A History of Iraq , said that apart from this meeting in Downing Street , " I can't remember participating in any meaningful seminar on Iraq with the Foreign Office . "

Google 's planned takeover of rival DoubleClick for $ 3.1 billion would harm European citizens through greater intrusion of privacy , the EU 's top consumer lobby BEUC said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Darren Staples
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Google Inc ’s planned takeover of rival DoubleClick for $ 3.1 billion would harm European citizens through greater intrusion of privacy , the EU ’s top consumer lobby BEUC said on Thursday .
“ The Google / DoubleClick merger would harm consumer welfare by creating a structure that almost certainly will be less respectful of user privacy , ” BEUC said in a letter to the European Commission this week .
Last month , the European Union ’s executive European Commission -- the bloc ’s top competition watchdog -- opened an in - depth probe into the proposed takeover , saying it would raise competition concerns in online advertising .
Google , which uses consumer queries to choose advertisements which appear on Web surfers ’ screens , wants to buy DoubleClick to increase its clout in tailoring advertisements to consumer activities .
“ Post merger , Google will have the ability and incentive to engage in significantly more intrusive user tracking and profiling than exists today , ” BEUC said .
The lobby group also said that the merger would place the online advertising market in jeopardy because the combined company will dominate both major “ pipelines ” for online advertising -- for search ads and non-search ads .
“ There are many ways in which Google , post - merger , could push up prices for advertisers , ” BEUC said .
The higher prices for advertisements would likely be passed on to consumers , the lobby group said .
The Commission has until April 2 , to take a final decision on whether the proposed transaction would significantly impede effective competition .
Obama camp slams Clinton ‘ lunacy '
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe argued to reporters Wednesday that the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign has virtually no hope of moving ahead in the delegate count after the climactic Texan and Ohio primaries two weeks from now .
“ This is a wide , wide lead right now , ” Plouffe said on a conference call following Sen.
Barack Obama ’s blowout win in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday .

“ I am amused when he Clinton campaign continues to say : ' Well , it ’s essentially a tie . '
I mean , that ’s just lunacy .
We have opened up a big and meaningful pledged delegate lead .
They are going to have to win landslides from here on out to erase it . ”
Showing a new aggressiveness and focus on Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) as the likely Republican nominee , the Obama campaign held a conference call with foreign policy adviser Susan Rice to “ respond to Sen.
McCain ’s foreign policy attacks on Barack Obama . ”
Rice called the argument that Obama lacked experience " specious . "
" He 's shown the judgment that 's necessary , and that 's what we need , " Rice said .
The Clinton campaign on Wednesday opened a new website , The Delegate Hub , to push its case about delegate counting .
Plouffe said Clinton aides “ keep offering alternative theories for why they can win the nomination that have nothing to do with the votes that are happening in these contests . ”
“ Now , when they do n’t like the delegate math they rewrite the rules — and I gotta tell you , voters are tired of that , ” he added .
“ In order for them to begin to really erode the pledged delegate lead , they probably need to win both of these states by well over 20 points , ” Plouffe said .
“ We would encourage you all to ask the Clinton campaign in great detail , state by state , how they would intend to erase this pledged delegate lead ... . "
Nevertheless , Plouffe said Obama will campaign ferociously in Texas and Ohio as well as the other two states voting on March 4 — Rhode Island and Vermont .
“ We have no doubt what we ’re in store for , ” he said .
“ We know these are going to be a challenging couple of weeks — a lot of negative attacks flying and attempts to disrupt us . ”

It is no exaggeration to say that in 2011 America ’s social compact , already frayed by the right ’s decades - long assault on its essential elements , is in danger of coming apart .
Ad Policy
The Great Recession was caused by the depredations of Wall Street and enabled by a political class captive to its greed .
Those same forces have conspired to deprive the recession ’s victims — millions of ordinary Americans who have lost jobs , homes and hope — of comfort and justice .
Where is the outrage ?
The truth is , it is hard to find — at least on a scale commensurate with the magnitude of the betrayal we have endured .
True , the Tea Party ’s calls to slash an additional $ 100 billion from an already crimped 2011 budget elicited jeers across the leftish blogosphere .
And next to the GOP ’s spreadsheet of cruelty , President Obama ’s blueprint for 2012 appears relatively gentle and sane , with its targeted investments in infrastructure and cuts to fossil fuel subsidies .
But let ’s not forget the human context in which this budget debate is occurring : 25 million unemployed , 50 million without health insurance , 44 million living in poverty .
That Obama ’s plan was greeted with barely a grumble from his liberal base — surprising even the White House , which , according to the New York Times , had braced for a backlash on its left flank — reflects our diminished expectations , not only of Obama but of society .
It is time , as Stéphane Hessel reminds us in this issue , to regain a sense of outrage .
In the first English translation of a cri de coeur that has topped bestseller lists for months in France , the 93 - year - old former diplomat and hero of the French Resistance recalls the ideals of that movement — which not only struggled against Fascism but for “ a true economic and social democracy ” — and urges a new generation to seek their fulfillment .
“ The worst possible outlook is indifference that says , ‘ I ca n’t do anything about it ; I ’ll just get by , ’ ” he writes .
“ Behaving like that deprives you of one of the essentials of being human : the capacity and the freedom to feel outraged .
That freedom is indispensable , as is the political involvement that goes with it . ”
In the United States today , one need look no further than our state legislatures to find ample cause for outrage .
As Robert Pollin and Jeffrey Thompson detail , states struggling with dropping revenues and spiking demand for social services are not contemplating such reasonable measures as raising taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent of households , who collected a breathtaking 65 percent of income gains between 2002 and 2007 .
Instead , state officials — including many newly elected Republicans , but also some Democrats — are taking aim at the benefits and jobs of hospital nurses , schoolteachers , firefighters — public servants who are the backbone of the middle class .
And that ’s not all .
The public sector unions — the last redoubt of organized labor , the first of “ five pillars ” of Democratic strength , according to right - wing guru Grover Norquist — have been marked for destruction by a longstanding right - wing campaign now coming to fruition , as Jane McAlevey reports .
States like Wisconsin , where Republicans won a “ trifecta ” — control of the governor ’s office and both chambers of the statehouse — are moving to take away the fundamental right of government workers to engage in collective bargaining .
The stakes could hardly be higher for unions and for all progressives .

It 's easy to get caught up in the buzz and media hype surrounding Enterprise 2.0 , but some of this is worth your attention .
For the CIO , these five things are something to keep on your personal " innovation radar " :
MORE ON E2.0
An Introduction to Enterprise 2.0
Forrester Report : CIOs See Value in Web 2.0
Is the Enterprise Afraid of Web 2.0 ?
Web 2.0 : A Community in Denial
1. " Blogs Away " With New Communication Techniques
Department newsletters and " From the desk of " e-mails are quickly becoming outdated ways of communicating what is on an executive 's mind .
Getting your ideas out there , vetting them and branding yourself is what blogging is all about — and more and more CXOs are taking advantage of this important Web 2.0 innovation .
2. Social Networking — It 's Not Just for Kids !
How people relate online continues to evolve , and the latest incarnation is Facebook .
It 's an innovation that is worth keeping your eye on , and it has major implications for collaboration , online company directories and how the current generation entering the workforce expects to interact .
This last consideration is probably the single biggest reason you need to take Facebook seriously .
In addition , E2.0 social networking innovators like Facebook are on the leading edge of application integration — using mash - up technology to introduce new functionality quickly .
At the core are software from Google ( like AJAX and Google Mashup Editor ) and Microsoft products ( like Popfly and Silverlight ) .
3. Unified Communications
The latest new buzzword that is often said in the breath following " Enterprise 2.0 . "
No doubt , Voice over IP ( VoIP ) phone systems have come of age .
They bring with them functionality like e-mail / voice - mail integration , ease of use and maintenance , and computer / phone integration that only a call center manager could love .
Microsoft 's Office Communication Server and Cisco's Unified IP phones are leading the charge in one of the most watched changes of the guard since the Bolsheviks wiped out the Romanovs .
4. A Rolling MOSS Gathers No Stones
" Three 's the charm " continues to be the mantra for Microsoft Product releases , and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server ( MOSS ) contributes to that folklore .
First introduced in 2001 as SharePoint Team Services , then as SharePoint Server in 2003 , the much more mature and ready - for - prime - time Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is making major inroads within large corporations as the base for collaborative applications .
Not unlike the early years of Lotus Notes , MOSS provides a framework for quick and easy applications that integrate data and workflow in a browser - based front end .
And like Notes , it can be viewed as either a challenge to manage for IT shops or an important innovation catalyst for business processes .
CIOs can't afford to miss this tidal wave , or they 'll get swept under .
5. AAA : Anytime , Anywhere , Anybody
Underneath many Enterprise 2.0 technologies is the expectation that pervasive mobility allows unlimited access through handheld devices .
Innovations like Apple 's iPhone , 3G high - speed cellular wireless access and 802.11n Wi-Fi are leveraging Enterprise 2.0 technology to truly make the mobile office ride on two feet .
There is no place to hide , unless you press the Off button ....
Jack Santos is an executive strategist at the Burton Group and has more than 28 years of IT executive leadership specializing in bridging the gap between business needs and technological opportunity .
Italy 's highest appeals court has ruled it is a criminal offence for Italian men to touch their genitals in public - a judgment that has far - reaching implications for superstitious males .
Anyone who has seen a hearse go past in Italy , or been part of a discussion in which some terrible illness or disaster is mentioned , will know it is traditional for men to ward off ill luck with a quick grab at what are delicately called their attributi .
The practice has become increasingly frowned on , but Io mi tocco i ( I touch my ) is a common phrase , equivalent to crossing fingers .
The judges of the court of cassation suggested those seeking luck should return to the privacy of their homes before letting their hands stray trouserward .
The court was ruling on the appeal of an unnamed 42 - year - old workman from Como near Milan .
In May 2006 , he was convicted of indecent behaviour for " ostentatiously touching his genitals through his clothing " .
His lawyer said it was merely a " compulsive , involuntarily movement , probably to adjust his overalls " .
The third penal division of the Rome court was having none of it .
It said that public genital - patting " has to be regarded as contrary to public decency , a concept including that nexus of socio-ethical rules requiring everyone to abstain from conduct potentially offensive to collectively held feelings of decorum " .
The judges said such actions risked generating " awkwardness , disgust and disappoval in the average man " , unexpectedly perhaps failing to mention the average woman .
The workman was ordered to pay a € 200 ( £ 152 ) fine and € 1,000 costs .
Apple has acknowledged to InformationWeek that it has received reports of MacBook hard drive failures and is looking into the problem .
Seagate was not immediately available for comment , but Apple spokesman Cameron Craig said the company was aware that there might be a problem .
" We 've received a few reports that some MacBook consumer notebooks may have hard drive issues , and we 're looking into it , " he said .
UK data recovery firm Retrodata earlier this month discovered a flaw in the some hard drives employed in Apple 's MacBook and MacBook Pro computers .
The firm 's analysis at that time had indicated that Seagate hard disks in the models with firmware 7.01 were unusually prone to read / write head failures that caused physical gouges in the hard drive platter , making recovery impossible .
Jamaica Plain residents Joseph Porcelli and Dan Goldsbury are on a mission to reduce waste - one paper cup at a time .
The spark came when Porcelli noticed two friends drinking coffee at a neighborhood grocery store - City Feed and Supply in Jamaica Plain - out of mugs they had brought from home .
Why not get the whole community to do the same ?
Porcelli thought .
He teamed up with Goldsbury , a like - minded neighbor , and together they launched the Mug Project , with the simple goal of encouraging people to use mugs , not disposable cups .
Residents of the same JP apartment building , both men had been bothered by the trash created by paper and styrofoam cups .
" One week at work , I just noticed that I had four to five cups stacked on top of each other .
I said ' Oh my God , that 's a lot of waste , ' " said Porcelli , a program coordinator for the Boston Police Department .
For Goldsbury , a teacher at Citizen Schools , using a mug was a daily habit .
When he moved to the Boston area , he looked for people who were holding mugs in the morning coffee line .
" Using my mug is always second nature , but working downtown and seeing how an urban community acts was contrary to the way I grew up , " said Goldsbury , who grew up in Vermont .
" There would be 20 to 30 people in line and I 'd be the only one with a mug .
I 'd ask myself , ' Why is that ? '
They have mugs on the shelves , but people hardly give them a second look . "
Porcelli and Goldsbury launched the Mug Project in November 2007 under the umbrella of Neighbors for Neighbors , a community group in Jamaica Plain that hosts social events and forms groups and projects to get neighbors involved .
The pair set up a website , mugproject.com , where people create profiles and start discussions on how they 're incorporating mugs into their daily routines .
They also created a YouTube video narrated by a roving mug who is shocked upon discovering another mug in bed with a stash of used disposable coffee cups .
" The ultimate goal is to have people examine their behavior as consumers , and to modify it , " Porcelli said .
He wants people " to do the things that they enjoy and to do it responsibly . "
City Feed and Supply , where Porcelli grabs his morning cup , has become a gathering spot for the project .
City Feed was already offering a 25 - cent discount on coffee to customers who brought mugs , but the project has helped increase participation , said manager Jeff Morin .
" Now that we 've stepped it up and actively spread this , more people are bringing mugs , " Morin said .
International Paper estimated that 14.4 billion paper cups were discarded by Americans in 2005 - and that does n't include styrofoam .
Through the website and word of mouth , the Mug Project has attracted attention beyond Jamaica Plain .
People from around the country , including New York , Oregon , and Tennessee , have posted comments asking their friends and families to use mugs .
Porcelli and Goldsbury hope this grass - roots approach will spread their message nationwide , but for now , Porcelli sees Jamaica Plain as a fitting place to begin the project .
" I think everywhere is a good spot for this , but Jamaica Plain in particular because people are already sort of thinking on those lines .
I think people move to Jamaica Plain because they want to live in a community that is diverse , that 's vibrant , that 's accepting and responsible , " Porcelli said .
Outside of City Feed and Supply , Porcelli and Goldsbury encourage people to bring mugs everywhere they go - whether to their local coffee shop or to their office .
Since June , Ula Cafe in Jamaica Plain has been offering 25 cents off speciality drinks to people who bring in a mug .
Porcelli and Goldsbury also plan to create a how - to guide about incorporating mugs at college campuses , churches , in the workplace , and at corporations such as Fidelity and Target .
And they hope to set up meetings with big coffee businesses like Dunkin ' Donuts and Starbucks , asking them to provide or boost cost incentives to people who bring their own mugs .
At Peet 's coffee , Goldsbury discovered that he was only charged for a small cup of coffee when he used a mug , and at Starbucks , customers receive 10 cents off their purchase when they bring a mug .
Porcelli and Goldsbury also plan to spread the word by creating mugs with the logo " Ask me about my mug , " and will host a Super Bowl Mug Party on Feb. 3 at the Milky Way Lounge and Lanes , where people will drink from reusable containers .
" We 've learned something that we can do every day that 's very simple and part of our routine , " Porcelli said .
" It does make a difference . "

Mexican marine mammal may have two years left .
The vaquita is often ensnared in fishermen 's nets .
C. Faesi / Proyecto Vaquita ; courtesy O. Vidal / WWF - Mexico
The world ’s most critically endangered marine mammal — a porpoise that lives off the western coast of Mexico — is closer to extinction than previously believed , says a new study .
Only an estimated 150 individuals of the species , called a vaquita , survive in its sole habitat in the upper Gulf of California , according to an article1 published online this week in Conservation Biology .
Researchers and environmental groups are launching a multinational drive to save the remaining animals .
“ This is the best political opportunity we have ever had to try to save them , ” says co-author Lorenzo Rojas - Bracho , a marine mammalogist in Ensenada , Mexico .
“ If it does n’t work , the vaquita will go extinct . ”
There is roughly a two - year window in which to save the animal , the team estimates .
The vaquita ( Phocoena sinus ) frequently becomes entangled in the nets of fishing boats .
In 1999 , researchers estimated2 there were 567 vaquitas left in the northern Gulf of California .
Mexican biologist Armando Jaramillo - Legorreta , lead author of the new report , says that the rising number of fishing boats is killing the porpoises at a rate of at least 40 a year .
A population of about 100 must be saved for sufficient genetic diversity , the team says .
Previous attempts to create no-fishing zones and buy out fishermen in the vaquita 's habitat have failed .
But now the environmental groups WWF , Nature Conservancy and Conservation International have joined forces in a $ 10 million pledge .
In the short term they will use the funds to buy up boats and nets that kill the vaquita , while also seeking to develop more sustainable fishing practices .
The Mexican government has also allocated about $ 4 million this year for the vaquita , including developing alternative economic opportunities for local fishermen .
Mexico 's president , Felipe Calderón Hinojosa , has joined the push to save the animal .
But fishing industry advocates sometimes speak openly of wiping it out .
The vaquita 's plight echoes that of other marine mammals .
Last year , for instance , an international team of researchers declared the Chinese river dolphin , the baiji ( Lipotes vexillifer ) , extinct in the Yangtze River , after a belated effort to save it .
But the vaquita rescue is different , researchers say , because the upper Gulf of California remains a relatively healthy ecosystem — unlike the polluted and heavily trafficked Yangtze .
“ The problem is known , and a remedy is available , ” says Barbara Taylor , a co-author on the article who is a mammalogist at the US Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla , California .
“ The question is whether there is the political will to make it happen . ”
Earlier programmes to alter fishing practices in the region have proven difficult to implement ; last year , $ 1 million from the government that ostensibly paid regional fishermen not to fish instead went to buy new boats and motors , scientists say .
This year , the Mexican government is allocating about $ 1 million to help enforce the no-fishing regulations .
Conservation agencies are also supporting the effort .

For the long term , economic researchers at the Mexican National Ecological Institute in Mexico City , and the Sustainable Fisheries Group at the University of California at Santa Barbara , are studying how to provide alternative opportunities for the fishermen .
“ We want to introduce incentive - based fishing management , ” says biologist Susan Anderson , director of the Nature Conservancy ’s northern Mexico programme .
Whether that is enough to save the vaquita remains to be seen .
There are a lot of ways to honor the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. Ron Paul ’s supporters turned MLK day into a fund - raising opportunity .
With majestic and swelling music on a You Tube clip , supporers of Ron Paul kicked off the “ Free at Last 2008 ″ Web site and his supporters responded by donating $ 1.85 million on the King anniversary — an amount that more cash - strapped candidates would envy .
This is the third holiday that Mr. Paul supporters have turned into a one - day “ money bomb , ” as they have dubbed these efforts .
Mr. Paul ’s supporters used Nov. 5 – Guy Fawkes Day in England – to raised more than $ 4.2 million in a single day .
Another “ money bomb ” on December 18th , the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party netted $ 6 million for Mr. Paul .
In a YouTube video , Mr. Paul likens himself to Mr. King .
It features video of Mr. King ’s famous “ I Have a Dream ” speech and then shows Mr. Paul repeating some of the same phrases in campaign events .
“ Rosa Parks was one of my heros , ” said Mr. Paul , who is later seen ringing a bell and raising his hands “ Evita ” style at the top of a staircase .
“ Martin Luther King is a hero .
They practiced the Libertarian principle of civil disobedience and nonviolence . ”
The video then has Mr. Paul exclaiming that his next big fund - raising day would be the King birthday , followed words that say : “ Two Great Men . . . Once Great Message . ”
While the music builds to an ear - blasting crescendo , the video nears its end with the slogan : “ Remember Martin Luther King .
Donate to Ron Paul. Let Freedom Ring . ”
Quietly , the voice of Reverand King comes on saying “ Free at Last ” as the video fades to black .
The U.S. Supreme Court has taken up the issue whether the executive branch can detain people indefinitely merely by declaring them to be suspected terrorists or illegal enemy combatants .
The case is a habeas corpus issue and , therefore , of the utmost importance .
Without the protection of habeas corpus , government can lock away anyone on the basis of unsubstantiated charges as the Guantanamo detainees have been for nearly six years .
Reporting on the Court ’s deliberations about Odah v. U.S. and Boumediene v. Bush , Tom Curry , a national affairs writer for MSNBC , reports that Justice Stephen Breyer suggested to U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement that the executive branch could indefinitely hold people such as those in Guantanamo prison if Congress were to pass “ some special statute involving preventive detention and danger , which has not yet been enacted . ”
According to Curry , Senators Dianne Feinstein and Arlen Specter regard a preventive detention statute as a possibility worth considering .
Pray that Curry has misunderstood Breyer .
A different interpretation of Breyer ’s remarks is that the justice was telling Bush ’s solicitor general that in the absence of a preventive detention statute there is no legal basis for holding the detainees .
If there were such a statute , the case before the court would be its constitutionality .
Support for the latter interpretation comes from House Judiciary Committee member Jerrold Nadler ( D - N.Y . ) .
Rep.
Nadler thinks
Breyer was merely “ thinking out loud , ” not “ floating an idea ” and inviting Congress to pass an unconstitutional statute .
Nadler believes that Breyer was telling Clement that as there is not even a preventive detention statute , the executive branch has no basis for holding the Gitmo detainees .
That Feinstein , Specter , Jon Kyl , and other U.S. senators think it is “ worth considering ” for Congress to overturn habeas corpus , the greatest bulwark against tyranny , indicates how much the U.S. constitutional tradition has been lost .
The importance of the case seems to be completely over the heads of the media , who appear to be looking for a technical solution that permits people accused without evidence to be held forever .
The American press apparently believes that the U.S. government can make no mistake or behave improperly and that the detainees are actually , in Sen .
Kyl ’s words , “ a danger to our troops . ”
It is a “ danger ” that the Bush regime has been unable to prove even with torture and secret evidence .
Half of the detainees have had to be released .
According to news reports , the regime has been able to create cases against only 14 of those remaining .
After all the years of illegal detention , harsh treatment , and denial of access to attorneys , the Bush regime has come up with 14 cases , and they are probably fabricated .
Where is the rule of law when hundreds of people can have years stolen from their lives ?
It is uncertain how the court will decide the case .
Bush ’s solicitor general has told the justices that they should trust the executive branch to correctly balance “ the interests of the prisoners ” with the administration ’s ability to “ prosecute the global war on terror . ”
In other words , it is Waco all over again .
The executive branch runs roughshod over the U.S. Constitution and then demands , “ trust us , ” which means do n’t take away any of the illegitimate power that the executive branch has claimed and exercised or hold anyone accountable for abusing executive power .
Unfortunately for the future of liberty in America , a number of the Republican justices see the issue as one of the separation of powers .
The Republican justices or most of them are , or were , members of the Federalist Society , an organization of Republican lawyers committed to increased power for the executive .
These Republican justices will be inclined to decide the case in the interest of executive power .
The Federalist Society is a product of a past time when Republicans were said to have “ a lock on the presidency ” but could not get their agenda into law because the Democrats had a lock on Congress .
Republican frustrations manifested themselves in attempts to heighten the president ’s powers so that a Republican agenda could prevail over a Democratic Congress .
Like generals who fight the last war , the Federalist Society is stuck in its assault on the separation of powers in the interest of “ energy in the executive . ”
Many Federalist Society members join for social reasons and for networking , as the society provides the pool of attorneys for Republican appointments to the federal bench and for Department of Justice appointees .
Many members mistakenly think that the society stands for “ original intent , ” but as their real interest is career - driven , they do n’t pay much attention to the society ’s assault on the U.S. Constitution .
Kings exercised the power to throw into dungeons people who offended them or whom they regarded as a threat .
Once arrested , a person could be locked up forever without charges or evidence brought before a court .
Habeas corpus was an English invention that provides quick release of a person unlawfully held by orders of the executive .
The Bush regime has made the most determined assault the Anglo - American world has seen on the principle of habeas corpus .
The previous assault was by Stuart kings who destroyed their rule by proclaiming the “ divine right of kings . ”
Now Americans are faced with Bush / Cheney and the solicitor general of the U.S. Department of Justice ( sic ) , Paul Clement , proclaiming the divine right of President Bush and his Justice ( sic ) Department .
We must all pray that there are not enough Federalist Society members on the Supreme Court to uphold a Benthamite ruling of preventive detention .
Jeremy Bentham ( 1748 -1832 ) was the Englishman who renewed the assault on liberty , which centuries of English reforms had created .
Bentham believed that tyranny was no longer a problem , because people were empowered by democracy to control the government .
He argued that any restraint placed on government ’s powers would limit the ability of government to do good .
To protect citizens from crime , Bentham favored the preventive arrest of everyone whose social class , bone structure , or other chosen indicator suggested a proclivity toward crime .
“ The greatest good for the greatest number . ”
The Bush regime is comprised of modern - day Benthamites .
Their agenda is to overthrow the civil liberties that make law a shield of the people instead of a weapon in the hands of the state .
As anyone can be declared a suspect , the weapons that Bush would use to fight “ the global war on terror ” would soon be turned on the American people .
Without habeas corpus , there is no liberty .
Es nimmt nur einen Moment in Anspruch
Es ist nur allzu einfach sich in der Routine zu verlieren .
Wir beginnen schnell damit die Sekunden und Minuten herunter zu zählen , anstatt uns voll und ganz dem Genuss des gegenwärtigen Augenblickes hinzugeben .
Und all das nur um am Ende wieder bei den trivialen , langweiligen und alltäglichen Aktivitäten unseres Lebens anzukommen .
Gelegentlich aber geschieht etwas ganz besonderes .
Ein flüchtiger Blick , eine versehentliche Berührung oder ein erwidertes Lächeln :
Es sind diese Momente des Lebens die uns etwas mehr als sonst aufzeigen , etwas anderes .
In unseren Gedanken gehen wir daraufhin oft dazu über diesen Momenten Leben einzuhauchen , stellen uns vor was gewesen sein hätte können , hätte man sich des Momentes bemächtigt .
Stellen
Sie sich nun aber einmal vor was wäre , wenn Sie plötzlich zum Autor dieser , ihrer eigenen Momente werden könnten ?
Sie könnten die Schmetterlinge im Bauch wiederbeleben , die Lust an jeder Faser ihres Körpers aufkommen fühlen .
Und plötzlich fühlten
Sie nicht nur mehr was es bedeutet zu leben , sondern was es heisst neu zum Leben erweckt zu werden .

The blistering critique , by Brigadier Nigel Aylwin- Foster , who was the second most senior officer responsible for training Iraqi security forces , reflects criticism and frustration voiced by British commanders of American military tactics .
What is startling is the severity of his comments - and the decision by Military Review , a US army magazine , to publish them .
American soldiers , says Brig Aylwin- Foster , were " almost unfailingly courteous and considerate " .
But he says " at times their cultural insensitivity , almost certainly inadvertent , arguably amounted to institutional racism " .
The US army , he says , is imbued with an unparalleled sense of patriotism , duty , passion and talent .
" Yet it seemed weighed down by bureaucracy , a stiflingly hierarchical outlook , a predisposition to offensive operations and a sense that duty required all issues to be confronted head - on . "
Brig Aylwin- Foster says the American army 's laudable " can - do " approach paradoxically led to another trait , namely " damaging optimism " .
Such an ethos , he says , " is unhelpful if it discourages junior commanders from reporting unwelcome news up the chain of command " .
But his central theme is that US military commanders have failed to train and educate their soldiers in the art of counter - insurgency operations and the need to cultivate the " hearts and minds " of the local population .
While US officers in Iraq criticised their allies for being too reluctant to use force , their strategy was " to kill or capture all terrorists and insurgents : they saw military destruction of the enemy as a strategic goal in its own right " .
In short , the brigadier says , " the US army has developed over time a singular focus on conventional warfare , of a particularly swift and violent kind " .
Such an unsophisticated approach , ingrained in American military doctrine , is counter - productive , exacerbating the task the US faced by alienating significant sections of the population , argues Brig Aylwin - Foster .
What he calls a sense of " moral righteousness " contributed to the US response to the killing of four American contractors in Falluja in the spring of 2004 .
As a " come - on " tactic by insurgents , designed to provoke a disproportionate response , it succeeded , says the brigadier , as US commanders were " set on the total destruction of the enemy " .
He notes that the firing on one night of more than 40 155 mm artillery rounds on a small part of the city was considered by the local US commander as a " minor application of combat power " .
Such tactics are not the answer , he says , to remove Iraq from the grip of what he calls a " vicious and tenacious insurgency " .
Brig Aylwin- Foster 's criticisms have been echoed by other senior British officers , though not in such a devastating way .
General Sir Mike Jackson , the head of the army , told MPs in April 2004 as US forces attacked Falluja : " We must be able to fight with the Americans .
That does not mean we must be able to fight as the Americans . "
Yesterday Colonel William Darley , the editor of Military Review , told the Guardian : " This [ Brig Aylwin - Foster ] is a highly regarded expert in this area who is providing a candid critique .
It is certainly not uninformed ...
It is a professional discussion and a professional critique among professionals about what needs to be done .
What he says is authoritative and a useful point of perspective whether you agree with it or not . "
In a disclaimer he says the article does not reflect the views of the UK or the US army .
Colonel Kevin Benson , director of the US army 's school of advanced military studies , who told the Washington Post the brigadier was an " insufferable British snob " , said his remark had been made in the heat of the moment .
" I applaud the brigadier for starting the debate , " he said .
" It is a debate that must go on and I myself am writing a response . "
The brigadier was deputy commander of the office of security transition for training and organising Iraq 's armed forces in 2004 .
Last year he took up the post of deputy commander of the Eufor , the European peacekeeping force in Bosnia .
He could not be contacted last night .
前回 はConsumerサイトを実際に作る際のプログラミングに関してお話ししましたが、今回はOpenIDに関するセキュリティについて考えてみます。
今回取り上げるトピックとしては、
通信経路のセキュリティモデル
OpenIDに対するセキュリティ上の脅威
OpenID IdPのReputation（評価）
などを段階的に説明していきます。IdPの構築方法を知る前にOpenIDプロトコルのセキュリティに関して熟知しておきましょう。
OpenIDプロトコルにおける通信経路のセキュリティ
ここまで詳細に解説してきませんでしたがOpenID認証プロトコルのフェイズにおいて、どのようにセキュリティ上の安全性を担保しているかを解説しましょう。
まずはassociateモードを正常に実行するSmartモードの場合です。
Consumerはユーザーから のClaimed Identifierを受け取ると、associateのキャッシュが存在しない場合は新規にIdPに対してassociateモードのリクエストを行います。第3回で「associateモードは、ConsumerとIdP間で共通鍵を共有するために行う手続きです」と説明しましたが、ここでConsumer—IdP間で共通鍵を共有する手続きを行っています。ここで大事な点は、Consumer—IdP間（さらにUserAgentを介したリダイレクション）でのメッセージのやりとりには必ずHMACを付与して、そのメッセージが改ざんされていない妥当なものであることを確認できるようにしています。
HMAC とはkeyed - Hashing for Message Authentication Codeの略で、受信者、送信者ともに同じハッシュ関数と秘密鍵を用いて生成されたコードのことです。HMAC-SHA1ならばハッシュ関数のSHA1を用いたものとなります。
図 1 HMAC とは
このHMACですが 、OpenID Authentication 1.1で はHMAC-SHA1を用いることになっています。さらにいうと、HMACはOpenID認証プロトコルでは2つの使われ方があります。
・checkid_setup／checkid_immediateモードの際に使われるConsumerが生成したIdPへのリダイレクト先URLに付与する署名 ここではConsumerの秘密鍵を用いたHMACが使われる ・id_resモードでIdPから返される認証結果文字列トークンの署名
IdPの秘密鍵を用いたHMAC（Smartモード時）
前者の方は、再 びConsumerにリダイレクトされた際に自身の秘密鍵とともに確認すればよいので特に問題はありませんが、後者は認証結果文字列を受け取った際、事前にIdP側の秘密鍵をConsumerが知っていないと確認のしようがありません。もうお分かりかと思いますが、この後者のHMACの照合のために、事前にIdP側の秘密鍵をConsumerに伝える手段としてassociateモードが存在するのです。
こ のassociateモードで使われている共通鍵の共有手続きはどのようなもので、果たして安全なものなのでしょうか。
Diffie-Hellman鍵共有プロトコルを知る
associateモードで使われている共通鍵の共有方法はDiffie-Hellman（デフィー・ヘルマン）鍵共有（または鍵交換）プロトコルと呼ばれる方式です。この方式は事前に特別な秘密鍵などを共有することなしに盗聴の可能性のある通信路を使っても、秘密鍵の共有を可能にする暗号プロトコルです。
このプロトコルの要点だけを解説します。
まず通信を行いたい2者はおのおの、 公開鍵と秘密鍵を用意し、公開鍵のみ交換する
互いに自分の秘密鍵から生成されるデータを他方に渡すと、渡された方は自分の秘密鍵と相手から渡されたデータを用いて共通鍵を生成できる
という仕組みです 。
図 1 DH鍵共有のイメージ
いまいちピンとこない方もいるでしょうから、実際にPerlのDiffie-Hellman鍵共有を実装したモジュールを用いて実例を出しましょう。
#!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; use Crypt:: DH;sub default_dh { my $ dh = Crypt : : DH->new ( p => 8995127215884267541995034125870655 , g => 2 ) ; $ dh -> generate_keys ; return $ dh ; } my $ cdh = default_dh ( ) ; my $ sdh = default_dh ( ) ; printf ( " [ consumer ] pub : %s , sec : %s
" , $ cdh - > pub_key , $ cdh - > priv_key ) ; printf ( " [ server ] pub : %s , sec : %s
" , $ sdh -> pub_key , $ sdh - > priv_key ) ; printf ( " shared secret ( 1 ) : %s
" , $ cdh->compute_secret ( $sdh -> pub_key ) ) ; printf ( " shared secret ( 2 ) : %s
" , $ sdh->compute_secret ( $cdh -> pub_key ) ) ; リスト1 Perlによ るDiffie-Hellman鍵共有を実装したモジュール例
実行結果は次のようになります（実行時によって値は異なります）。
$ perl dh.pl [ consumer ] pub:7802933889436668690536359939538944 , sec : 1867083868630338106918631918411838 [ server ] pub:4449244932917301413656781299646464 , sec : 635847400798390060708440216901066 shared secret(1):8768538400044258590443590051168256 shared secret( 2):8768538400044258590443590051168256 リスト2 サンプルスクリプトを実行した結果
Consumer 、Serverともに異なる秘密鍵、公開鍵ですが、互いに相手の公開鍵を用いて、同じ共通鍵を生成できているのが分かると思います。Diffie-Hellman鍵共有では事前にp値、g値というのを互いに公開していることが前提になります。p値は十分大きい素数で、g値は2以上の自然数です。また生成される公開鍵、秘密鍵は実行ごとにランダムに選ばれます。
この方式では、仮に通信経路で公開鍵が傍受されようともアルゴリズムの性質上、そこから生成される共通鍵を解くのは相当困難という方式なので、まずConsumer—IdP間での通信経路は安全性が確保されているといえます。
OpenIDがLWPx ::ParanoidAgentを使う理由
さて、HMACやDiffie-Hellman鍵共有によって一見メッセージのやりとり自体の安全性は高いと思いたくなります。しかしちょっと待ってください。実はまだ危険な点があります。
あなたがConsumerだとして、まさにassociateしようとしている相手が本当に正しい相手かどうか確認できているでしょうか。あるいはClaimed Identifierの確認のために実際にユーザーのURLへアクセスしますが、そのホスト名は正確なIPへ正引きできているでしょうか。
そのような危険性に対して神経質なアクセスを行うのがLWPx::ParanoidAgentです。OpenIDの仕様上でも使うことを推奨しています。またホワイトリスト形式やブラックリスト形式にも対応しているので、詳しくはCPANのオンラインドキュメントを見てください。

A report published last week by Citibank , and so far unremarked on by the media , proposes " genuine difficulties " in increasing the production of crude oil , " particularly after 2012 " .
Though 175 big drilling projects will start in the next four years , " the fear remains that most of this supply will be offset by high levels of decline " .
The oil industry has scoffed at the notion that oil supplies might peak , but " recent evidence of failed production growth would tend to shift the burden of proof on to the producers " , as they have been unable to respond to the massive rise in prices .
" Total global liquid hydrocarbon production has essentially flatlined since mid 2005 at just north of 85 m barrels per day . "
The issue is complicated , as ever , by the refusal of the Opec cartel to raise production .
What has changed , Citibank says , is that the non-Opec countries can no longer answer the price signal .
Does this mean that oil production in these nations has already peaked ?
If so , what do our governments intend to do ?
Nine months ago , I asked the British government to send me its assessments of global oil supply .
The results astonished me : there were n't any .
Instead it relied exclusively on one external source : a book published by the International Energy Agency .
The omission became stranger still when I read this book and discovered that it was a crude polemic , dismissing those who questioned future oil supplies as " doomsayers " without providing robust evidence to support its conclusions .
Though the members of Opec have a powerful interest in exaggerating their reserves in order to boost their quotas , the IEA relied on their own assessments of future supply .
Last week I tried again , and I received the same response : " The government agrees with IEA analysis that global oil ( and gas ) reserves are sufficient to sustain economic growth for the foreseeable future . "
Perhaps it has n't noticed that the IEA is now backtracking .
The Financial Times says the agency " has admitted that it has been paying insufficient attention to supply bottlenecks as evidence mounts that oil is being discovered more slowly than once expected ... natural decline rates for discovered fields are a closely guarded secret in the oil industry , and the IEA is concerned that the data it currently holds is not accurate . "
What if the data turns out to be wrong ?
What if Opec 's stated reserves are a pack of lies ?
What contingency plans has the government made ?
Answer comes there none .
The European commission , by contrast , does have a plan , and it's a disaster .
It recognises that " the oil dependence of the transport sector ... is one of the most serious problems of insecurity in energy supply that the EU faces " .
Partly in order to diversify fuel supplies , partly to cut greenhouse gas emissions , it has ordered the member states to ensure that by 2020 10 % of the petroleum our cars burn must be replaced with biofuels .
This wo n't solve peak oil , but it might at least put it into perspective by causing an even bigger problem .
To be fair to the commission , it has now acknowledged that biofuels are not a green panacea .
Its draft directive rules that they should n't be produced by destroying primary forest , ancient grasslands or wetlands , as this could cause a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions .
Nor should any biodiverse ecosystem be damaged to grow biofuels .
It sounds good , but there are three problems .
If biofuels can't be produced in virgin habitats , they must be confined to existing agricultural land , which means that every time we fill up the car we snatch food from people 's mouths .
This , in turn , raises the price of food , which encourages farmers to destroy pristine habitats - primary forests , ancient grasslands , wetlands and the rest - in order to grow it .
We can congratulate ourselves on remaining morally pure , but the impacts are the same .
There is no way out of this : on a finite planet with tight food supplies , you either compete with the hungry or clear new land .
The third problem is that the commission 's methodology has just been blown apart by two new papers .
Published in Science magazine , they calculate the total carbon costs of biofuel production .
When land clearance ( caused either directly or by the displacement of food crops ) is taken into account , all the major biofuels cause a massive increase in emissions .
Even the most productive source - sugar cane grown in the scrubby savannahs of central Brazil - creates a carbon debt which takes 17 years to repay .
As the major carbon reductions must be made now , the net effect of this crop is to exacerbate climate change .
The worst source - palm oil displacing tropical rainforest growing in peat - invokes a carbon debt of some 840 years .
Even when you produce ethanol from maize grown on " rested " arable land ( which in the EU is called set - aside and in the United States is called conservation reserve ) , it takes 48 years to repay the carbon debt .
The facts have changed .
Will the policy follow ?
Many people believe there 's a way of avoiding these problems : by making biofuels not from the crops themselves but from crop wastes - if transport fuel can be manufactured from straw or grass or wood chips , there are no implications for land use , and no danger of spreading hunger .
Until recently I believed this myself .
Unfortunately most agricultural " waste " is nothing of the kind .
It is the organic material that maintains the soil 's structure , nutrients and store of carbon .
A paper commissioned by the US government proposes that , to help meet its biofuel targets , 75 % of annual crop residues should be harvested .
According to a letter published in Science last year , removing crop residues can increase the rate of soil erosion a hundredfold .
Our addiction to the car , in other words , could lead to peak soil as well as peak oil .
Removing crop wastes means replacing the nutrients they contain with fertiliser , which causes further greenhouse gas emissions .
A recent paper by the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen suggests that emissions of nitrous oxide ( a greenhouse gas 296 times more powerful than CO2 ) from nitrogen fertilisers wipe out all the carbon savings biofuels produce , even before you take the changes in land use into account .
Growing special second - generation crops , such as trees or switchgrass , does n't solve the problem either : like other energy crops , they displace both food production and carbon emissions .
Growing switchgrass , one of the new papers in Science shows , creates a carbon debt of 52 years .
Some people propose making second - generation fuels from grass harvested in natural meadows or from municipal waste , but it's hard enough to produce them from single feedstocks ; far harder to manufacture them from a mixture .
Apart from used chip fat , there is no such thing as a sustainable biofuel .
All these convoluted solutions are designed to avoid a simpler one : reducing the consumption of transport fuel .
But that requires the use of a different commodity .
Global supplies of political courage appear , unfortunately , to have peaked some time ago .

The last I heard , the right was feeling quite pleased with itself because there was some evidence to suggest the traffic for the top liberal blogs was trending down , while the traffic for the top conservative blogs was trending up .
This item , relying on SiteMeter data from the end of December , argued , “ It has long been understood that the largest liberal blogs have generally produced more web traffic than the largest conservative blogs ....
After surveying the traffic stats of many major political blogs , I found that web traffic for several major liberal blogs either declined sharply or stayed the same while major conservative blogs saw a sharp increase in traffic . ”
Now , apparently , the right is prepared to argue the opposite — liberal blogs are more popular — but with a rationalization to explain the phenomenon .
Erick Erickson , editor of the popular conservative megablog RedState , conceded that progressives currently enjoy an advantage over conservatives online — though he attributed it to an asymmetry in free time , since conservatives “ have families because we do n’t abort our kids , and we have jobs because we believe in capitalism . ”
I ’m not quite sure how best to respond to something like this — it ’s unusually unhinged , even by the standards of the far - right blogosphere — though I think Matt Stoller is on the right track by relying on simple mockery : “ Now , being a doctor who performs abortions is in fact a job , so one might find conflicting narratives in Erick ’s quote .
And if the way to use the internet well politically is to up the number of abortions , then the GOP is kind of fu**ed . ”
I did n’t want to spend Super Bowl Sunday thinking about the very bad things that are happening across America , but when you ’re in the judicial reform movement , you get things sent to you that most people cannot even imagine .
At least , not until it happens to them or to one of their family members .
I got another one this Sunday morning .
I ’m sorry to ruin your day , but I ’m compelled to act .
I ’m compelled to fight against the horrors of tyranny and oppression .
Tag , now you ’re it .
If you ’re brave enough to face reality , then read on .
If not , remember , if you ’re not part of the solution , you ’re part of the problem !
I wish that sticking your head in the sand could save you , but it wo n’t .
So , I ’ve got a couple of questions for you .
What happens when the votes are " counted " in secret on machines ?
Do the people have the power to control the government or do those who control the machines have that power ?
Do the people have the power to remove bad governors or do the machines that those governors control just keep them in office ?
Would the governors do things that they would not do if the people had the power to vote them out of office ?
Have you ever heard the saying , power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely ?
What happens when those in power are not accountable to the people ?
Do the governors do things that the citizens would not tolerate ?
Do they do things that governors would not do if the people had the power to hold them accountable ?
What happens when the press fails to report on abusive inhumane conduct by those in positions of authority ?
The people are kept in the dark , and when most do not know , the people are kept from rising up and demanding accountability .
When the press ignores government misconduct , the governors do things that they would not dare to do if the press covered it , instead of covering it up , because if enough people know about outrageous conduct , no gatekeeper for the establishment can keep the people from rising up and demanding change !
There are still a few courageous journalists who will bring abuses of power to the attention of the public .
Following is some courageous coverage by one local news team .
I hope that they do n’t get fired like Steve Wilson and Jane Akre did after trying to expose the serious danger to our health from injecting dairy cows with high levels of growth hormone to boost milk production .
After you watch this , ask yourself why this is not being covered by FOX , CNN , ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC , PBS , and the BBC .
Is this not newsworthy , or do they just want to keep people in the dark ?
Does the big corporate media really report and let us decide , or do they cover up abuse by our governors so that the people do not rise up and challenge their power and demand reform ?
Watch these videos and see for yourself , but beware this local news coverage of POLICE HELPING A VICTIM is VERY DISTURBING and NOT FOR CHILDREN to see .
I do commend these brave journalists for showing it though .
They are true journalists , remnants of the free press .
They deserve our greatest respect !
( Watch these two videos , then read the rest of the article to get the big picture before checking all of the other links . )
Please note that You Tube took down all copies of these videos of local news coverage of police officers brutally strip searching a victim of an attack , but others have put them back up .
Will You Tube try to cover up this police brutality again ?
First coverage of Police Helping Victim

Follow up coverage of Police Helping Victim http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw8GIyF91Xk
Notice that those in power say they followed procedure when it is abundantly clear that they did not .
Anyway , when is victimizing a victim who reports a crime ever acceptable ?
Notice how the gatekeepers all tell the press that they did not know about this incident , yeah right ?
Even if they did just find out , how much do they need to see to know that the treatment that this innocent victim suffered is horribly wrong ?
How long do they need to " investigate " before they can make a statement or take any appropriate action ?
This type of brutal inhumane treatment happens all of the time across America now .
Innocent victims and suspects are treated as you saw above .
It ’s common to be treated and held as shown above , and I have heard of numerous reports of people being held for days in a cold cell in the nude , even without food and water , in order to get a plea bargain out of an innocent person .
You ’ve got to fill those private prisons , keep fleecing the taxpayers to keep the victims , oh that ’s right criminals , under control .
It must be working , right ?
We ’ve got the lowest crime rate in 30 years , right ?
Yeah , that ’s the ticket , let ’s just keep repeating that things are much better and safer now to keep the public happy .
Do n’t do the crime if you ca n’t do the time , or is it do n’t be a victim of a crime or a witness to a crime if you do n’t want to do the time ?
Like another leader in the judicial reform movement says , " There are those who believe in America ’s justice system and those who have experience with it . "
I ’d give Jon full credit for that perfect picture of our " justice " system , but he ’s still a licensed member of the Bar , so they would probably come right after him for speaking out even though it was just me repeating his words .
The courageous attorneys who are representing this innocent victim will most likely be attacked by the Bar association now , too , but remember that they took a valiant stand against injustice !
They should be saluted , not attacked .
But , the Bar works for those in power to control attorneys , to keep us from taking action to hold government accountable .
Are you thinking well , that ’s just one case where the officers just got out of control , maybe they had a bad day , their boss is just covering up for his staff , it ’s expected , and those who are supposed to take action when such criminal misconduct occurs are just finding out about it , they ’ll take action after they " investigate " it .
If so , here ’s more news about our out of control governors and their efforts to cover up beating a 14 year old boy to death because he was n’t cooperating enough .

Why is there only one existing species of modern man and woman ?
Have we artifically classified ourselves as somehow so unique , and thus , separated ourselves from the rest of ' biologica ' , in a convoluted way that does not define ' human ' as common to this world ' ?
If not , then why only one extant ' human ' ?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_taxonomy
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human
Humans and great apes , gorillas , and chimpanzees , nearest ' like kinds ' living on this planet , cannot naturally interbreed , thus , regarding biological speciation , are recognized as different species .
That 's pretty easy .
But , apparently , even giraffes , for instance , come in specific ' flavors ' .
Science calls this process , ' speciation ' .
In everyday usage , a species is often defined as a ( group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring , " and , that is good enough ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species).
Science , of course , has been thinking about this for a long time and has subdivided the definition ever more finely .
About those giraffes : http://funtasticus.com/20080130/giraffe-baby/
( I 've thrown this into the mix just for the ‘ cuteness ’ factor for your entertainment .
Compare the human vs giraffe eyeball , size , yikes ! ) .
It seems now , however , because of a recent taxonomy reclassifcation , six , or , maybe even up to eleven species of giraffes are roaming around .
http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2007/12/giraffe_species.php
So , giraffes , who , as a group , to me at least , look pretty much alike , and , are , in fact , not a single specie , at all , ( which , no doubt , must make Friday night happy hour at the local giraffe pub , pretty frustrating ) .
Good thing this is not part of the human condition .
If , as Albert Einstein liked to refer to God : ' The old one ' , created this huge amount of diversity in the biological world , so many , very similar , '' species ' , exist , why not us ?
Of course there have been other ' hominid ' and human species in our prehistoric past climbing through the tree of evolution , whatever .
But , oddly onnly one remains -- for us -- but not for the rest of the creatures on ' Noah 's Ark ' .
Why ?
Again begging the question :
Why , now , in our time , is there still only ' one ' living human specie ?
Your thoughts always welcome .

It used to be that to become pope , you had to sit pantsless in a horseshoe - shaped chair and let a couple of cardinals see if you had the goods .
If you passed , they 'd yell " Testiculos habet et bene pendentes ! "
( He has testicles , and they hang well ! )
It 's true , in those days it took balls to become pope .
Back then , the Papacy was reserved for the hardasses , guys you would n't mess with -- the gangsters , the demon - summoners , the corpse - digger - uppers .

5 Alexander VI ( 1492 -1503 )
Alexander VI blazed the trail for Biggie Smalls , Kingpin and Jabba the Hutt as obese badasses who did n't let their man-boobs and tendency to sweat while they ate stop them from amassing a huge fortune , slaughtering their enemies , and getting sweatily busy with the ladies .

Any story you 've ever heard about crooked popes started with this guy .
He bought the papacy with four mule loads of silver .
He nailed Rome 's most eligible bachelorettes .
He made his 17 - year - old bastard son an archbishop .
He started wars , poisoned cardinals and took their money , and probably ate live frogs while feeding people to the Rancor .
His greatest accomplishment -- as a host if not as a pope -- was the Banquet of Chestnuts held in 1501 .
This sounds nice enough until you learn that the chestnuts were merely a pretext to have a pack of naked hookers crawling around the ground collecting them .
But that was n't the evening 's only nut - related activity .
Trained observers were present to keep track of the total number and quality of the party - goers ' ejaculations .
That 's exactly the kind of information you need when a bishopric comes open .

His ham - stuffed corpse could n't fit in the coffin and began belching sulfur .
His successor forbade anyone from saying prayers for his lardy soul .
Finally , almost 400 years later , he was reborn as Aleister Crowley ( at least that 's what he said ) , who shocked the world by ... taking a lot of drugs and drawing naked pictures of himself .
Never confuse “ smart sounding speech ” with real communication .
“ A loquacious Antartic fowl entered a libations establishment … ” does n’t pack the same punch as “ A penguin walks into a bar … ” when you ’re telling a joke .
And the guy who wins the debate will always be the one who connects with the audience in the most fundamental , feisty way .
Facts wo n’t win , carefully constructed diatribes wo n’t win , and even being right wo n’t win .
Nope .
The winner will always be the dude who cracks the crowd up , and delights their ear with unexpected language .
Thus , I have never offered a plain old seminar before .
Instead , I host “ Copywriting Sweatshops ” and “ License To Steal Workshops ” ( where I teach you how to literally rip - off my best ads for your own nefarious use ) .
There is real pleasure in a well - turned phrase .
All the top writers and marketers I know are constantly on the look - out for cool , off - beat , riveting word play we can use in our copy .
But it ’s also important to give credit where it ’s due .
People rip me off all the time , and it rankles me most when they claim they made up original phrases I ’ve penned .
Karma usually takes care of the little thieving bastards ( I love how that works ) … but it is also important for me not to take credit for phrases that are n’t originally mine .
There are plenty of words to go around … excellent words , too , combined in unique and startling ways … so there ’s no need to ever get greedy .
I tell you all this because , for a few hours last week , I thought I ’d hit the motherlode of invented phrases while talking with my pal Rich Schefren .
I mis -heard him at one point , and thought he ’d said “ fraudcasting ” when he actually said “ broadcasting ” .
( It was late , he ’d been up for days putting the finish on his latest manifesto , and he was starting to slur . )
What a great word !
It is rare when you come up with a slight change in the original phrase like that , to arrive at something so obviously and clearly askew … and so powerfully charged with shock value .
Alas , it ’s not mine to claim .
A quick Google search brought up multiple references for “ fraudcasting ” ( and yeah , some dude has the URL , though he does n’t seem to quite know what to do with it ) .
Still , though … it seems not to have slithered into common useage yet .
And yet , it should .
Because fraudcasting is out there .
And it ’s nasty .
I ’m referring to the increasing number of Big Damn Corporations engaging in actual fraudulent activity online .
Let ’s be clear here :
My trusty beat - to - shit Webster ’s dictionary defines “ fraud ” as “ the intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value or surrender a legal right ” .
Bar room translation :
The Man wants to cheat you out of money by gaining your trust … and then shitting on it .
Sorry for the harsh wording there … but that ’s what ’s going on .
And it ’s poisoning the Web for all of the decent entrepreneurs and small biz owners out there .
Here ’s the story :
It ’s no secret that The Man loathes the freedom and easy democratic access of the Web .
He prefers a non -level playing field , like television , where he wins just because he has more money than you .
And boy , is The Man ever pissed off that guys like you and me can just throw up a blog and get heavy readership … and more attention than he can with all his expensive commericials and sponsorships .
( Well , the opportunity to get more attention is there , if you ’re smart , anyway .
And that ’s enough to get The Man all itchy and upset . )
Every so often , some corportate honcho will get a brainstorm like : “ Hey !
Let ’s just make up our OWN damn blog … and cash in on this stupid Web thing - a - mah - hootie by duping people into believing we ’re just like them , only we ’ll really SELL them shit !
Get me the Creative Department … ”
The evidence : Sony did a fake blog , using repulsive phony rappers to stir up cravings for their new versioin of Playstation .
Wal - Mart heavily pushed a completely fictional blog by completely fictional RV folks touting the beneficent wonders of Wal - Marts everywhere .
( ” Please let these marvelous big box stores into your community !
Only good things will happen , we swear ! ” )
McDonalds even floated a bullshit blog , until they got busted .
And that ’s the punch line , really .
They ALL got busted … because The Man does n’t even begin to understand the new order of things online .
Real bloggers have real power .
And they ’re not amused by cynical attempts to take advantage of this wonderous new tool we all share on the Web .
Right now , regular old bloggers are doing the fact - checking and investigative journalism that the professional journalists are ignoring .
And this is changing the game on multiple levels .
Word spreads fast .
YouTube has become a judge / trial / jury wasteland for phonies — just ask AOL ( who refused to let a dude cancel his account ) , Jet Blue ( videoed lying to passengers during interminable waits on the tarmac ) , Dell and other corporations stung by the new online Robin Hoods out there shuttling their grievances past all the usual ( and “ Man-controlled ” ) paths for complaining , straight to the huddled masses yearning to be set free of bullshit .
Fraudcasting .
It ’s like broadcasting , except you ’re lying like a rug .
And , for now , chances are good you ’ll get busted if you try it .
But do NOT be lulled into thinking this is the way it will always be .
This “ truth will out ” environment is absolutely unique in human history .
Throughout the long trudge toward the freedom we now enjoy , MOST of your ancestors who have spoken out against The Man were promptly crushed like bugs .
And in MOST of the world today , that ’s still the case .
Get straight on this .
The reason Google — for example — has permanently soiled its reputation is because they folded up their principles of privacy and freedom when dealing with China … and people are in jail because of it .
They went for the easy cash , and people got hurt .
You can not take any freedom for granted .
When you do , The Man will pounce and strip it away from you .
And if you think it ca n’t happen here , you ’re delusional .
There is NO guarantee the Web will continue to be as unregulated and free as it is today .
Remember — it does n’t run on magic , but on very real networks that can easily be hijacked by the Powers That Be , and subjugated completely .
Many of the fraudcasting episodes of corporations were exposed not by mainstream media , but by regular dudes who cared deeply about truth .
But we ’re relying on the utter cluelessness of The Man in most of these cases .
Politicians routinely get caught with email they thought they ’d “ deleted ” ( cuz they ca n’t get their brains around the idea of “ deletion ” not being permanent ) that ruin thier careers .
Corporate beasts get busted because they treat blogging like some stupid , irrelevant geekoid hobby .
They do n’t get it .
Yet .
But they soon will .
( Side note : With just a touch of self - abusing irony , Big Biz could get the results they seek — a little good PR , some thumbs - up word - of - mouth buzz , even sales .
I do n’t know if Jack In The Box has a blog , but if he does , I ’ll bet it ’s funny , ironic and readable .
And is n’t trying to fool or defraud anyone . )
Anyway , that ’s the larger picture .
For entrepreneurs and small biz owners , it ’s important to understand how blogs can fit into a real marketing model .
First rule :
Do n’t bullshit your readers .
The Web is crawling with scams and lies and nonsense ( both small - time and corporate ) … and that ’s an opening for smart marketers .
BE that guy who tells the truth , and EARNS the trust of your readers , every time you post .
The Web is entertaining … it ’s informative … and it ’s a snakepit of propoganda and fraud .
Getting the attention of people interested in what you offer is the hardest part of your gig .
Holding onto that attention is your main job .
It ’s okay to sell stuff online .
That ’s how the economy works .
But pulling a “ Blair Witch ” kind of trick is risky , because people are getting paranoid and touchy about the increasing amount of fraudcasting out there .
It ’s neither unique nor amusing anymore .
When the noise of the market reaches ear - splitting levels , you ’ll gain more listeners if you speak softly and tell the truth , as simply and eloquently as possible .
Stay frosty ,

Top 10 Strangest Deaths Of All Times
Cellphone Rings In Courtroom , Judge Gets Pissed , Jails Everybody ( 46 People )
Russia 's Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Yuri Baluyevski looks at his watch before a meeting with European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana ( R ) in Brussels May 11 , 2007 .
Baluyevski said on Saturday Moscow could use nuclear arms pre-emptively if under serious threat , his comments marking no change in defense policy but underlining a renewed military confidence .
REUTERS / Thierry Roge
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s armed forces chief said on Saturday Moscow could use nuclear arms pre-emptively if under serious threat , his comments marking no change in defense policy but underlining a renewed military confidence .
Interfax news agency quoted Chief of Staff Yuri Baluyevski as saying also that Russia , rebuilding defenses under President Vladimir Putin after the decline of the immediate post - Soviet years , must guard against “ excessive militarization ” of society .
He said Russia was not going to attack anyone .
“ But we believe all our partners in the international community should understand clearly and have no doubts that in order to protect its and its allies ’ sovereignty and territorial integrity , Russia will use its armed forces , including nuclear weapons , and it can do it pre-emptively , ” he told a scientific conference in Moscow .
In Soviet times , military doctrine stated Moscow would not use nuclear arms first in any confrontation with the West .
With the decline of its conventional forces in the 1990s , Moscow dropped this element of its policy .
President Vladimir Putin , who signed a new doctrine into force in 2000 as acting president , must step down after an election in March likely to be won by his choice of successor , First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev .
Western analysts will be looking for any changes of nuance in defense and other policy , though Putin is expected to maintain strong influence .
Moscow is currently at odds with the West over U.S. plans to develop a missile defense shield it fears could make it vulnerable to U.S. missile attack .
It also resists Western moves that could lead soon to the breakaway of the Kosovo region of Russian ally Serbia .

For a decade now , Hollywood acting has been slowly , steadily poisoned by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum .
This week , I was watching the hypnotically horrible new Coen brothers movie , No Country For Old Men , and I could n't shake off the sense there was something different , something thrilling and vivid , about the performances of all the lead actors : Tommy Lee Jones , Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin .
It was only after half an hour of awe that I realised what it was .
They can all move their faces .
Today , most actors in most movies have deliberately paralysed faces , incapable of registering anything .
An ocean of Botox and collagen has been jabbed into the most famous faces on earth – leaving the audience feeling disconnected without knowing why .
Yet in this movie , the lines and crevices on the forehead of Tommy Lee Jones are as rugged as the Texas desert his sheriff character patrols .
With imperceptibly tiny movements of these crags of skin , he can convey pain and panic and grief .
Similarly , Javier Bardem 's portrait of a blank - eyed psychopath works precisely because we can see that his sagging face is capable of more than blankness .

The majority of Hollywood stars are simply incapable of doing this .
I do n't just mean people like Melanie Griffiths , who have been left looking like Salvador Dali nightmare scenes ; I mean the top - of - the - billing big stars who are still revered as greats .
I 'm thinking of one famous actress who claims that her face remains unlined because of the care she takes in looking after it .
A decade ago , she was an impish , clever performer skipping towards greatness .
Today , she has been jabbed and stabbed into a simulacrum of perfection – so her face can do nothing .
It can not register pleasure or pain ; it can only remain in a frozen rictus , fitting for a performance in high - end adverts and no more .
Almost every American movie I see now contains a cast in the same poisoned state .
Sure , Hollywood actresses have always altered their appearances : in the 1930s , several starlets swallowed tapeworm eggs to lose weight .
But the procedures of the Nineties and Noughties are more disabling , in acting terms , than those of the past .
In the 1940s , Rita Hayworth had a few minor cosmetic procedures : she had electrolysis on her hairline to give her a more exaggerated widow 's peak .
( The studio though it made her look " more exotic " . )
Marilyn Monroe had work on her chin-line .
But they did n't do anything that would alter their abilities to move their faces – and act .
Botox is much more extreme for an actor .
It does n't just tighten or alter skin ; it paralyses nerves .
In Sarah Churchwell 's brilliant book The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe , there is a small story that shows how important the tiny , almost unreadable facial signals rendered impossible by Botox are to big screen acting .
In the 1956 movie Bus Stop , Marilyn was cast opposite Don Murray , a much - garlanded stage actor breaking into the movies for the first time .
When he shot scenes with her , he concluded that she was a dead , dismal actress , because she did n't seem to be doing anything in their scenes but standing there limply .
Later , Dame Sybil Thorndike had exactly the same reaction .
But when they saw the rushes , they realised Marilyn was the only one among them who knew how to act for the camera : she had tiny , toned - down facial responses that were sure to melt the boy in the 22nd row .
If Marilyn had been Botoxed , she would have been turned into precisely the clothes - shop dummy Murray and Thorndike thought she was .
Collagen is just as bad : if a face has puffed - up , immobile lips , its capacity for basic expression is largely gone .
This is , I 'm sure , one reason why British actresses have been doing so well at the Oscars for the past 10 years : they have n't been facially paralysed .
Helen Mirren , Judi Dench and – this year , in the achingly sad Away From Her – Julie Christie have accepted the potential richness that comes from worry - lines and crows ' feet .
They use them .
They know they suggest depth and richness and life .
Of course , this Botox - bind leaves actresses who are hitting the Hollywood - elderly of 40 in a cruel position .
If they refuse to have the face done , they can't get cast .
But if they have the face done , they can't act .
They are trapped by our creepy desire to have any sign of ageing banished from our sight - lines , even on the cinema screen .
Alfred Hitchcock once said , " The greatest special effect is a close - up of the human face . "
Botox has stripped this effect from the movies – and left our films frozen .

The Clinton campaign puts out a response from Maggie Williams , which does n't respond to the question of whether a staffer was circulating the photo of Obama in Somali garb , but takes issue with the Obama campaign 's embrace of the issue :
Enough .
If Barack Obama 's campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive , they should be ashamed .
Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely .
This is nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country today and to attempt to create the very divisions they claim to decry .
We will not be distracted .
Nine hundred thirty thousand , one hundred eighty minutes .
That ’s how you measure the total running time “ Rent ” will have played on Broadway when , as the producers said on Tuesday , it closes after its evening performance on June 1 , making it the seventh - longest - running Broadway show in history .
But the length of its run is not nearly as significant as the kind of show it was .
An East Village rock version of Puccini ’s opera “ La Bohème , ” “ Rent ” brought a youthful energy  and young theatergoers  to Broadway , to a degree not seen since “ Hair . ”
It also brought with it a real - life story so affecting that it would have overwhelmed the musical itself had the substance of the musical not been so intertwined with the story of its creation .
On the night of the final dress rehearsal at the New York Theater Workshop , the nonprofit theater in the East Village where the musical began , Jonathan Larson , the 35 - year - old composer and librettist , died of an aortic aneurysm .
He had been working for seven years on the musical , which includes portraits of his friends and the artists and addicts in his neighborhood , young people on the edge of poverty and in the shadow of AIDS , battling the coming wave of gentrification in the name of “ La Vie Bohème . ”

The show opened in February 1996 , two and half weeks after Mr. Larson ’s death .
Critics were ecstatic , Broadway landlords were battling to play host to an uptown transfer , and everyone in town , including celebrities like Steven Spielberg and Anna Wintour , was scrambling to get tickets to a 150 - seat Off Broadway theater in the East Village .
Already a theater phenomenon , “ Rent , ” directed by Michael Greif , exploded onto Broadway two months later , on April 16 , 1996 , turning members of its mostly obscure cast into stars .
It went on to win four Tony Awards , including best musical , and the Pulitzer Prize .
The Met 's latest poster campaign urges Londoners who spot " unusual " activity to ring the police and let them know .
Examples include someone taking pictures of CCTV cameras or acting out of the ordinary .
After all , these are dangerous times , and we all must be vigilant .
Contrast this for a moment with an earlier dangerous time : the Blitz .
Bombs rained down upon London on a near - daily basis , killing , maiming and laying waste to whole neighbourhoods ( one American friend recently described a trip around east London where his hosts pointed to every car park and said , " Of course , that was bombed in the Blitz " – and came away with the impression that Hitler had dropped car parks on Hackney ) .
Back then , the government 's message to the people was n't " Take your shoes off " or " place your liquids in this bag " .
Instead , King George 's printer stuck up millions of royal red posters bearing the legend " KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON . "
The approaches are markedly different - eternal ( even fearful ) vigilance , versus a reassured , Zen - like calm .
Which one makes us more secure ?
There 's the rub .
Verifying the security of a system is a tricky business .
Even during the second world war , when secrecy over codes was paramount , Alan Turing 's team at Bletchley Park broke the German cipher and began listening to practically every Nazi communiqué .
How did they outsmart the German mathematicians who designed Enigma ?
Bletchley spotted a mistake and used it to crack the system wide open .
Mistakes happen all the time in mathematical ventures , which is why science relies on peer review .
As Bruce Schneier says , " Anyone can design a security system so smart that he can't outsmart it " .
Until security is subjected to peer review , you can't know whether it 's proof against the whole world , or just the people who are dumber than you are .
Even though our lives increasingly defined by security measures , we can't know whether they are working without public peer review .
Unfortunately , today 's security cheerleaders have regressed to a more superstitious era , a time from before Bletchley Park 's wizards won the second world war .
The public is n't supposed to take photographs of CCTV cameras in case this knowledge can be used against them ( despite the fact that surely terrorists can memorise their locations ) .
We can't mention terrorist attacks at the airport while we 're being subjected to systematic anti-dignity depredations ; your bank wo n't let you open an account with a passport – you need to supply a laser - printed utility bill as well ( " to prevent money laundering " … you can just hear Osama 's chief forgers gnashing their teeth for lack of a piece of A4 ) .
The superstitions that grip airport checkpoints and banks are themselves a threat to security , because the security that does not admit of examination and discussion is no security at all .
If terrorists are a danger to London , then the only way to be safe is to talk about real threats and real countermeasures , to question the security around us and shut down the systems that do n't work .
If you 're worried about money - laundering , your bank should have real anti-laundering systems in place .
If you 're worried about bombings , you need a security system that works even when the locations of the CCTV cameras are public .
If you 're worried about identity theft , then the government had better have a bloody good plan for " revoking " your fingerprints and retinas should a bad guy figure out how to copy them .
If you want your plane to be safe in the sky , you 'd better know what new security you gain by removing your shoes and shedding your liquids while still taking to the sky with your highly explosive laptop battery and a huge bottle of duty free whiskey .
We live in a world of threats that transcend our instincts and intuitions .
Staying safe in the face of phishing attacks , viruses , identity theft , RFID skimming , and yes , even terrorists , requires that the public itself be security conscious .
We can't rely on the authorities to defend us against attacks that outstrip their capacity to adapt to them .
Remember , the same police force that 's plastering London with signs exhorting us to " let experienced officers decide what action to take " is the same police force that gunned down a Brazilian for wearing an overcoat , and shut down Soho when a Thai restaurant burned its chilli sauce , releasing spicy smoke .
Security literacy can only be acquired through continuous practice and evaluation .
The more our society punishes those who question security , the less secure we all become .
The medicine - registration leaflet of herbal remedies provide unexpected amusement .
Outside politics , one wonders , can less be said in more formal - sounding words ?
I ’m one of those people who enjoy bitters .
Not just rock shandy , not just sweet Jägermeister .
Not just the light aromatic aperitif - style stuff , but heavy stomach bitters , as an after - dinner or night - cap digestif .
The stronger , the better .
There ’s nothing quite like sipping a small glass of Fernet - Branca , Unicum or Underberg along with a tall glass of ice water .
Jurgen Gothe , an upstanding member of the Canadian cognoscenti , writes a fine paean to all things bitter , in All hail Fernet - Branca , the foulest liqueur on Earth .
Hail , indeed .
So it was with some pleasure that I discovered , in my local pharmacy , a concoction known as Schweden - Bitter , made by PharmaNatura , “ the natural medicine company ” .
Despite its relatively low price ( compared to , say , Fernet - Branca ) , it compares pretty well to digestif bitters you ’d find in the better bars or liquor stores around town .
It ’s less smooth and rounded , perhaps , but look , this is supposed to be medicine .
Forget castor oil .
This is the stuff I ’d feed to moaning brats complaining about mysterious stomach pains to get off the homework hook .
Still , Schweden - Bitter is n’t a scheduled drug , or anything .
So it was with some surprise that I discovered a package insert , just as the law requires of real medicine .
Apparently , it is classified in the pharmacopoeia as “ A. 34 Other ” .
Seeking somewhat greater clarity , I turned to the pharmacological action , which is described thus :
This preparation is designed to correct imbalances within the unhealthy body and so enables the organism itself to overcome the disease condition .
The constituents in their indicated form work accordingly .
Okiedokey , then .
Glad we cleared that up .
A friend , who ’ll remain nameless , said : “ You see , that makes perfect sense to me . ”
But then , I ’ve long ago given up arguing with them about what does and does n’t make sense .
There ’s more .
After all , this is a very official and quite formal medicine registration notice , as required by Act 101/1965 .
Side - effects and special precautions : None known .
Known symptoms of overdosage and particulars of its treatment : None .
Now I ’m no doctor , and I have no clue what any of the 20 curiously - named herbs from which this “ ethanolic extract ” is distilled might do to a person , in great quantities .
And to be fair to the makers , it is not recommended to exceed the maximum dosage of a teaspoonful four times a day .
But I do know what a concoction that contains 40 % alcohol per volume could do , and I can guarantee you , this piece of paper is n’t going to get me off the hook if I have a few tots of this good stuff and get behind the wheel .
I ’m also fairly convinced alcohol has symptoms of overdosage ( though I am , of course , entirely innocent of the particulars of its treatment ) .
Now , let ’s assume a tot of this stuff to be equivalent to a standard drink , which is about right , given the alcohol content .
Based on the information on alcohol overdose kindly published by John Brick , Ph.D. , M.A. , F.A.P.A. , of the Rutgers University Centre for Alcohol Studies ( when I grow up , that ’s where I want to work ) , consuming a bottle ( 500 ml ) of this stuff in four hours has a 50 % chance of killing a 90kg man .
I ’d think death is a fairly significant symptom of overdosage , though I can see why they ’d omit the particulars of its treatment .
Now , for that tot I just photographed .
Your health !
Despite dire warnings like the one above about the imminent release of cell phone numbers to telemarketers that continue to be circulated via e-mail year after year , cell phone users do not have to register their cell phone numbers with the national Do Not Call registry before a soon - to - pass deadline to head off an onslaught of telemarketing calls .
The panic - inducing e-mails ( which circulate especially widely every January or June , since many versions of the warning list the end of those months as a cut - off date for registering cell phone numbers with the national Do Not Call registry ) grew out of a misunderstanding about the proposed creation of a wireless directory assistance service .
Cell phone numbers have generally been excluded from printed telephone books and directory assistance services .
However , since after the use of cell phones burgeoned in the early 2000s ( to the point that many people no longer maintained landline phone service ) , several national wireless companies ( AllTel , AT&T Wireless , Cingular , Nextel , Sprint PCS , and T - Mobile ) banded together in 2004 and hired Qsent , Inc. ( since purchased by TransUnion ) to produce a Wireless 411 service .
Their goal was to pool their listings to create a comprehensive directory of cell phone customer names and phone numbers that would be made available to directory assistance providers .
Someone made the wild leap of reasoning that the proposed creation of a cell phone directory was the equivalent of “ giving cell phone numbers to telemarketers ” and began the chain of wildly inaccurate e-mails warning cell phone users to register with the National Do Not Call List in order to prevent this fate .
This warning was overblown , for a couple of major reasons :
The Wireless 411 service was to be strictly “ opt - in ” — that is , cell phone customers would be included in the directory only if they specifically requested to be added .
The phone numbers of wireless customers who did nothing would not be included , those who chose to be listed could have their numbers removed from the directory if they changed their minds , and there was no charge for requesting to be included or choosing not to be included .
be included , those who chose to be listed could have their numbers removed from the directory if they changed their minds , and there was no charge for requesting to be included or choosing not to be included .
The Wireless 411 information was not to be included in printed phone directories , distributed in other printed form , made available via the Internet , or sold to telemarketers .
It would be made available only to operator service centers performing the 411 directory assistance service .
All of these points have been summed up in numerous media articles , such as the following from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel :
There is a grain of truth in the message making it believable , but it ’s wrong on two counts :
Not all cell phone numbers will be listed in the national directory planned for 2006 .
And telemarketers will not have access to the directory .
It is illegal for marketers using auto - dialers and most do  to call wireless phone numbers .
Here ’s the truth : A national directory will be compiled , but numbers will be included on an opt - in basis .
If a cell phone subscriber does nothing , the number will not be listed .
When the directory is ready , it will be available only as part of the existing 411 directory service , accessed by calling in and asking for a specific number .
It will not be published in a book or on the Internet .
And it will not be sold to telemarketers .
Cell phone subscribers can list their numbers on the do - not - call registry if they choose , but there is no deadline to get on the list , as the e-mail messages now circulating suggest [ . ]
Cellular users can choose to register their cell numbers with the national Do Not Call registry as an additional measure of protection , although FCC regulations already in place outlaw most types of telemarketing calls to cell phones .
( The CAN SPAM Act of 2003 prohibits unsolicited commercial messages to wireless phones , and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 prohibits any calls to cell phones that employ auto - dialers or any artificial or prerecorded voice messages . )
There is not ( and never has been ) a deadline to list one ’s phone number with the national Do Not Call Registry — it can be done at any time .
( Contrary to previous statements , the FTC announced in October 2007 that Do Not Call registry entries will not expire after five years , so those who signed up when the registry went into effect in June 2003 will not have to register again in 2008 . )
Unfortunately , customers have little recourse against telemarketers who willfully ignore the Do Not Call Registry and violate other restrictions against placing calls to cell phones .
Violators can be reported to the FCC , but that organization has limited resources to investigate and take action regarding the thousands of cases reported to them daily .
In March 2013 , the FTC published “ The Truth About Cell Phones and the National Do Not Call Registry , ” in response to recirculating rumors about the national do not call database , cell phones , and telemarketers :

Over two years , tiny cameras placed deep underground recorded the comings and goings of a wild badger family .
While the animals have been well studied outside of their setts , until now , little has been known about their behaviour while underground .
Never - before - seen behaviour was filmed , including the badgers diligently making their beds each evening before leaving the setts for a night of foraging .
The crew also captured newborn cubs on camera , as well as grooming and fighting between the older animals .
The footage was recorded for a BBC Natural World wildlife programme .
About 300,000 badgers live across Britain , their tracks and trails criss - cross the countryside , yet they are rarely seen .
Andrew Cooper , producer of Badgers - Secrets of the Sett , said : " Before we began filming , I knew that there was a gap in our knowledge about badgers .
" When I spoke to one badger expert , I said to him : ' How much do we know about their life underground ? ' , and he simply held up a blank piece of paper .
" This is the first time we have had the opportunity to see real detail down there . "
Badger ' slobber '
It took the team six months to prepare for filming , which took place in the Devon countryside .
High - resolution , waterproof cameras , measuring less than 8 cm ( 3in ) in length , microphones and more than a kilometre of cabling were fed into the badgers ' tunnels and chambers , which can be four or five metres deep .
Mr Cooper said : " The most difficult thing was putting the cameras in underground and then trying to get them into a position so we could see what they had got going on down there . "
Even once the cameras had been manoeuvred into place , the team still faced several setbacks .
" Mice and squirrels conspired to nibble through various bits of exposed cables , and plants grew in front of the cameras , " said Mr Cooper .
" The badgers would also come and lick the cameras or sniff them - one cub even tried to chew a camera . "
The producer added : " Badger slobber all over the lens did n't do much for the vision . "
Fear of thunder
During the many months of filming , the team managed to record these highly social , nocturnal creatures as never seen before .
Mr Cooper said : " One day , there was a huge thunderstorm .
There were five badgers in this one chamber , all piled on top of each other .
And right in the foreground of the camera , a cub of about six or seven months old sat .
" There was a huge clap of thunder - you could hear it rolling down the tunnels and around the chambers - and this little cub pulled its paws up over its ears .
The images were riveting . "
Their idea of spatial awareness just through touch , sound and smell must be quite extraordinary
Andrew Cooper
Pitch - black lives
The team also discovered that the creatures were very clean and tidy while underground .
Before leaving their sett for an evening of foraging , they would " make their beds " by raking up their bedding and leaving it in a fluffy pile in the middle of the chamber .
The crew also managed to film the creatures fighting .
Mr Cooper explained : " During the summer months , the young males got fractious .
" Daylight lasts a long time , the nights are very short , and consequently they are itching to go outside . "
Consequently , he said , the badgers would start moving around in the chambers and fights would break out .
All of this action took place in complete darkness , infra-red lights meant it could be captured on camera .
The producer added : " Their idea of spatial awareness just through touch , sound and smell must be quite extraordinary . "
The Devon badger family still remain under surveillance - and can be seen on the Wildlink website 's badger - cam .
Badgers - Secrets of the Sett is on BBC Two on Friday , 15 February , at 2000 GMT and is repeated on BBC Two on Saturday , 16 February at 1740 GMT .
Drunken College Girls Immortalize Their Nights on Facebook A growing number of young women are posting images of their debauchery online .
LONDON , February 19 , 2008 --
When is it time to say no to the next tequila slammer ?
How about this ?
" You 've already had a couple of bottles of Chardonnay over dinner , your make - up is smeared all over your face " ( # 18 ) .
Or this ?
" You 've become convinced that dancing with your arms overhead , shaking your ass , and yelling WOO HOO is truly the sexiest dance move EVER " ( # 3 ) .
Does this all sound too familiar ?
Well , this is advice from a ( tongue - in - cheek ) list of " 30 reasons girls should call it a night , " a very popular Facebook group with almost 180,000 members .
Here viewers can find 5,000 photos of girls in states of drunken debauchery : vomiting , inadvertently flashing their underwear , passed out in a bush , or answering a call of nature — outside .
It appears that drunken antics are no longer a source of acute embarrassment for girls ; in fact boasting to the world on social networking sites is a way to gain social standing among one 's peers .
However , there are double standards involved when you fall on the wrong side of the gender divide , as group moderator Jasmine Kalimullah , a communications major at SUNY College at Oneonta , explained to ABC News .
" I do n't know why it is acceptable for guys to drink and not females , " she said .
" Possibly because boys have always been expected to be mischievous , so when they drink and act out , they are just boys being boys .
Females , on the other hand , are supposed to be dainty and ladylike .
" Is it changing ? " she asked .
" I really do n't know , I hope it is changing .
I think it 's unfair to have a double standard . "
Lady Lushes Becoming More Common ?
However , so commonplace are drunken girls that the Oxford English Dictionary found it necessary in 2001 to include the newly coined noun " ladette " , which describes a " boisterous , heavy - drinking young woman ; a young woman with a lifestyle that is more characteristic of that of some young men , usually involving heavy drinking and boisterous behavior . "
Amanda Simpson , from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs , told the " Stop making fools of yourselves ! " discussion group that she has no problem with those drinking to excess , but that she does take issue with advertising one 's drunken stupidity .
" I drink , I party , I live it up , " Simpson wrote in a post to the group .
" I do NOT , however , take photos of myself in drunken , compromising positions and then plaster them on public internet forums where any %*$ ?!^ % off the street may see them , including , but not limited to : Parents , Bosses , Potential employers , grad school or college admissions staff , Internship directors . "
Provocative Photos May Mean Professional Suicide
But many photos on the site are accompanied by full names and the colleges they attend , showing a blatant disregard for the fact that potential employers could be viewing their drunken exploits .
A study by the networking firm Viadeo recently found that one in five employers now uses social networking Web sites , such as Facebook and MySpace , to research information on job candidates and to view how they project themselves .
Almost two thirds said their recruitment decisions were influenced by the contents of an individual 's profile , while a quarter said that they had changed their mind and decided not to hire someone because of what they found online .
Graduates at Yale University are being warned that keeping what may be considered a " cool " profile on Facebook could cost you your next job .
Philip Jones , director of Yale 's undergraduate career services , told ABC News that he advises graduates to clean up their profiles .
" We 've seen the results of not doing it , and shared our war stories with students , " he said .
Doctors : Behaviors Could Be Dangerous
Although it may seem to some like good clean fun , many doctors are far from convinced of any merits to the site .
They believe it is making fun of a very real problem facing not only college girls but women or men of any age .
" Brain damage , trauma injuries and the increased risk of infection by sexually transmitted diseases are long - term consequences of binge drinking , " Dr. Fulton T. Crews , professor of pharmacology and psychiatry at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill , told ABC News .
" Education on responsible drinking and healthy life habits are important to help young individuals avoid these long - term consequences . "
Data from several national surveys indicate that about half of college drinkers engage in heavy episodic consumption .
Binge drinking is typically defined as consuming five or more drinks in a row for men , four or more for women .
About 1,700 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die each year from unintentional alcohol - related injuries , including motor vehicle crashes .
And more than 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are victims of alcohol - related sexual assault or date rape , according to the American Psychiatric Association .
So that " 30 reasons " list may provide friendly advice for those who need to be told when to call it a night .
OXNARD , Calif . 
Hundreds of mourners gathered at a church here on Friday to remember an eighth - grade boy who was shot to death inside a junior high school computer lab by a fellow student in what prosecutors are calling a hate crime .
In recent weeks , the victim , Lawrence King , 15 , had said publicly that he was gay , classmates said , enduring harassment from a group of schoolmates , including the 14 - year - old boy charged in his death .
“ God knit Larry together and made him wonderfully complex , ” the Rev. Dan Birchfield of Westminster Presbyterian Church told the crowd as he stood in front of a large photograph of the victim .
“ Larry was a masterpiece . ”
The shooting stunned residents of Oxnard , a laid - back middle - class beach community just north of Malibu .
It also drew a strong reaction from gay and civil rights groups .

Updated : 8:39 AM WASHINGTON  The Florida Democratic
Party plans to move forward with a June 3 vote - by - mail primary to restore the state 's role in the presidential race , a top state Democrat said Wednesday .
State Sen. Steven Geller said a formal announcement would come Thursday or Friday .
Unless national party leaders " are willing to write off the state of Florida in the general election , we have to do something that seats our delegates , " he said .
Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Karen Thurman has sent a draft proposal to state and national party leaders and has asked for feedback by Friday .
The mail ballot would cost $ 10 million to $ 12 million , Thurman said , and be conducted by " reputable election management companies " and overseen by " a recognized accounting firm . "
If there 's consensus agreement , Thurman said in the memo , the state party will begin in earnest on Monday getting the mail - in vote going .
" We have re-examined every potential alternative again , " Thurman wrote in her memo .
" Online one stands out as fair , open , practical and feasible at this time .
We are positive that a combination vote - by - mail and in - person election can be conducted in the time available – but only if Democratic leaders support the plan . "
National party officials stripped Florida and Michigan of their delegates to this summer 's national convention in Denver to punish the states for moving their primaries before Feb .
5 . Florida lost 211 delegates , Michigan , 156 .
Hillary Rodham Clinton won the January primaries in both states , but no delegates were awarded .
Neither Clinton nor rival Barack Obama campaigned in either state in deference to party rules .
Florida is moving ahead despite objections from its members in the U.S. House .
David Goldenberg , chief of staff to Rep. Alcee Hastings , said the state has n't had enough time to prepare for a mail - in vote .
House members also were concerned that ballots would not reach low - income voters who may change addresses frequently or residents who spend only winter in the state , he said .
Hastings supports Clinton .
Florida Sen. Bill Nelson , also a Clinton supporter , countered that a mail - in election is the " most practical and fair way " to resolve the dispute .
On Wednesday , Clinton said the state should honor the results of the original voting or " hold new primary elections . "
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said he had " real deep concerns " whether the state has time to prepare a mail - in vote .

The US arm of Wikileaks , a website that makes it easy for whistleblowers to leak documents , has been cut off after hosting evidence that claimed a bank located in the Cayman Islands engaged in money laundering and tax evasion .
Dynadot , the US - based company that hosted Wikileaks ' main site , not only severed wikileaks.org from the net ; it also agreed to lock the domain name so it can't be transferred to another provider .
A federal judge in San Francisco signed off on the agreement on Friday ( 15 Feb ) .
The agreement came in a lawsuit brought by bank Julius Baer , the parent company of the accused Cayman bank .
After trying unsuccessfully to get Wikileaks to remove the documents , Swiss - based Julius Baer went after Dynadot , which according to this copy of the court order , agreed to roll over in exchange for the suit against it being dismissed .
Dynadot also agreed to turn over records related to Wikileaks , including " IP addresses and associated data used by any person , other than Dynadot , who accessed the account for the domain name " .
Wikileaks allows whistleblowers to post documents anonymously - at least when its webhost is n't coerced into turning over IP addresses and other information most customers would consider confidential .
According to this piece from Wired News , Wikileaks was unable to argue its position on the matter at a Friday court hearing because it only learned of the hearing a few hours before it started .
Astonishingly , US District Judge Jeffrey
White of the Northern District of California signed off on the stipulation , anyway .
The episode is another reminder that an organization 's security is only as good as the security of the people who provide its internet connection .
Wikileaks claims that it is an " uncensorable Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and analysis " .
But this is true only if its webhosts can be trusted not to pull the plug on its customers or divulge sensitive client information .
In this case Julius Baer quickly realized it could n't silence Wikileaks , so it went after a weaker link in the chain , which evidently was much less willing to put up a fight .
Wikileaks was founded in 2006 by people from a host of countries , including the US , Taiwan , Europe , Australia and South Africa .
It has generated headlines by hosting documents exposing several high - profile scandals , including those related to the collapse of the UK's Northern Rock bank and to prisons in Iraq and and Guantanamo Bay .
The site says it has posted more than 1.2 million documents .
According to Julius Baer , a former vice president called Rudolf Elmer posted the documents , which purport to show that the Cayman Islands bank helped customers hide assets and launder funds .
The contested documents remain available on Wikileaks websites hosted in other countries , including in here in Belgium and here in India .
The site says here that over the past few days it has also withstood a 500 Mbps denial - of - service attack and a fire to its uninterruptible power supply .
Of course , there 's no evidence that Julius Baer was behind either the attacks or the fire .
But it 's clear that Wikileaks has n't been silenced , at least for now .
Hey , maybe there really is something to these claims about being uncensorable . ®
What makes you suddenly dart into the bakery when you spy chocolate - frosted donuts in the window , though you certainly had n't planned on indulging ?
As you lick the frosting off your fingers , do n't blame a lack of self - control .
New research from Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine reveals how hunger works in the brain and the way neurons pull your strings to lunge for the sweet fried dough .
Krispy Kremes , in perhaps their first starring role in neurological research , helped lead to the discovery .
In the study , subjects were tested twice -- once after gorging on up to eight Krispy Kreme donuts until they could n't eat anymore , and on another day after fasting for eight hours .
In both sessions , people were shown pictures of donuts and screwdrivers , while researchers examined their brains in fMRI's .
When the subjects saw pictures of donuts after the eating binge , their brains did n't register much interest .
But after the fast , two areas of the brain leaped into action upon seeing the donuts .
First , the limbic brain -- an ancestral part of the brain present in all animals from snakes to frogs to humans -- lit up like fireworks .
" That part of the brain is able to detect what is motivationally significant .
It says , not only am I hungry , but here is food , " said senior author Marsel Mesulam , M.D. , the Ruth and Evelyn Dunbar Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Feinberg School and a neurologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital .
Next , the brain 's spatial attention network shifted the hungry subject 's focus toward the new object of desire -- in this case the Krispy Kremes .
" If we did n't have this part of the brain , every time you passed by a bakery you would have no control over your eating , " explained Mesulam , who also is director of the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer 's Disease Center at the Feinberg School .
" If your nerve cells fired every time you smelled something edible , then you 'd eat all the time , not just when you 're hungry . "
" There 's a very complex system in the brain that helps to direct our attention to items in our environment that are relevant to our needs , for example , food when we are hungry but not when we are full , " said Aprajita Mohanty , lead author of the paper and a post - doctoral fellow at the Feinberg School .
The study was published on - line last week in the journal Cerebral Cortex .
Mesulam noted the research demonstrates how our brain decides what to pay attention to in a world full of stimuli -- not just sweets .
" If you are in a forest and you hear rustling , the context urges you to pay full attention since this could be a sign of danger , " he said .
" If you are in your office , the context makes the identical sound less relevant .
A major job of the brain is to match response to context . "
The study helped Mesulam understand his own behavior .
" Now I know why I can't resist walking into the bakery some days when I smell fresh scones , " he said .

Evidence for a Subsurface Ocean on Titan
25 March 2008
Identification of Titan surface features in radar images obtained by Cassini over a period of a few years shows the position of these features to deviate from their expected coordinates when assuming a constant spin rate for the moon of ~ 15.95 days ( with Titan phase - locked in its ~ 15.95 - day orbit around Saturn ) .
Two independent methods to derive Titan 's spin rate from the Cassini radio observations have unambiguously proven the current spin rate to be faster than the synchronous spin rate by about 0.36° per year .
The results are reported by Lorenz , R.D. et al. in the 21 March issue of Science .
Apart from the moon 's deviation from synchronous rotation , Lorenz et al. also find an acceleration in Titan 's spin rate .
Both these results are explained by the authors as due to Titan not being a solid body rotator , but rather its crust is detached from the solid core by a subsurface ocean at a depth of at least 100 km .
In this scenario the affect of motions in Titan 's massive atmosphere ( ~1.5 bar at the surface ) on the crust is more profound .
Changes in atmospheric circulation due to seasons ( caused by Saturn 's ~ 29.5 - year orbit around the Sun ) lead to changes in the exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and the surface .
Lorenz , R.D. et al. show that the observed value for Titan 's spin rate could be reproduced by an existing model ( Tokano , T. et al. [ 2005 ] ) of the interaction between the crust and the atmospheric circulation patterns , provided that the crust is indeed detached from the moon 's core .
The evolution of Titan 's spin rate in this model - albeit with a necessary refining to match the observations - predicts a peak value between 2008 and 2010 after which the spin rate should decrease again as it oscillates around the synchronous spin rate , following seasonal changes in Titan 's atmospheric circulation .
Future Cassini observations could verify these predictions .

There ’s a very good Economic Letter from the Dallas Fed about the housing crisis , which explains a lot about how the mess happened .
In short : lenders began making lots of dubious loans in large part because they were able to slice and dice the loans and sell them off to investors who did n’t know what they were buying .
My only fault with the letter is that it does n’t emphasize the extent to which borrowers were also suckered in .
But here ’s what I do n’t quite understand : how could people have been convinced that all this made sense ?
The dot - com bubble I sort of understand : there was a brand - new technology , nobody knew how it would work commercially , and it was possible to imagine that every startup was the next Microsoft .
But housing is housing ; banks have been making mortgage loans for generations .
Why was anyone willing to believe that all the rules had changed ?
According to the Dallas Fed report , here ’s what happened :
Two crucial developments spurred nonprime mortgages ’ rapid growth .
First , mortgage lenders adopted the credit - scoring techniques first used in making subprime auto loans .
With these tools , lenders could better sort applicants by creditworthiness and offer them appropriately risk - based loan rates .
By itself , credit scoring could n’t have fostered the rapid growth of nonprime lending .
Banks lack the equity capital needed to hold large volumes of these risky loans in their portfolios .
And lenders of all types could n’t originate and then sell these loans to investors in the form of residential mortgage - backed securities , or RMBS — at least not without added protection against defaults .
The spread of new products offering default protection was the second crucial development that fostered subprime lending growth .
So a bit of financial engineering — with no new technology , no reason to think that the fundamentals of housing had changed — led to a gigantic financial bubble .
Wow .
I guess hype really does spring eternal .
Busta Rhymes Takes Offense
Featured 03/27/2008
Some photojournalists make the mistake of letting Busta Rhymes overhear them call him ignorant .
Depression May Be Contagious , Experts Say Experts say a person 's moods can affect his or her partner 's risk of depression .
March 28 , 2008  -- Ron and Carol Rossetti had a storybook romance .
The two were high school sweethearts , went to prom together and married after college .
" He was like the fun in my life , " Carol Rossetti recalled .
" But had I known the ride I was going to be in for , I 'm not sure I would have signed up for it . "
Not too long after they were married , Ron would get into terrible tempers , Carol recalled , or become very depressed .
Later on , as his business grew more successful , Ron would spend money lavishly on cars : A Lotus , a Viper , a Porsche , a Hummer .
Ron Rossetti's erratic behavior took a toll on his wife .
" I was just really unhappy , " Carol said .
" I was wanting to find the answer without giving up the marriage . "
Carol Rossetti's discontent may be no surprise to many people whose spouses suffer from mood disorders .
Ron was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his late 30s , and while the news explained some of his behaviors and brought Carol a measure of relief , his wife Carol was in an unusual and vulnerable position .
Spouses are at high risk for depression when one party has a clinical disorder like depression or bipolar disorder , because they spend a large amount of time with them and are emotionally invested in their well - being .
" Was she depressed ?
Absolutely , " Ron said .
" Look what she had for a husband .
…
Was it a Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde ? "
Some studies show that if one spouse is depressed , the other can become depressed , and that up to 40 percent of people whose spouses have bipolar disorder get clinical depression .
That 's according to Dr. Igor Galynker , director of the Family Center for Bipolar Disorder at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine .
Natural Born Mimics
" We can mimic other people 's facial expressions , " Galynker said .
" When we mimic other people 's facial expressions , we also can adopt the mood that these people are in .
It affects us , even on a superficial level . "
But such mimicry can go beyond the superficial and become emotional .
Studies in which monitors track brain activity while a subject is shown smiling or frowning faces show that the areas associated with happy or sad emotions are active when the subject is presented with the corresponding face .
This ability to tune in to other people 's feelings , or empathize , can be useful , but it can also get a person in trouble if they are around someone who has depression .
" If a genetic predisposition exists , and a person is surrounded by people with a behavior , that may give rise to or create an environment that would fertilize that behavior , " said Steven Lappen , a writer and frequent public speaker who has bipolar disorder .
Lappen , 58 , was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 and said his manic and depressive episodes during his 20 - year marriage made his wife feel invisible and caused her to withdraw from him , behaving as if she , too , was depressed .
" I was so blocked up , I could n't respond to her overtures , " Lappen said .
" Outside of the marriage , she was n't depressed .
She was able to tap into her vitality and vibrancy . "
Lappen and his wife eventually divorced , and he later remarried a woman who also has bipolar disorder .
" The good news is that we both have bipolar disorder ; the bad news is that we both have bipolar disorder , " Lappen said , adding that their implicit understanding of the clinical nature of each other 's moods made for a smoother relationship .
Clinical Condition ?
But experts are quick to point out that clinical mood disorders are not contagious per se .
Depression and bipolar disorder are complex , rooted in genetics and subtle brain chemistry .
Experts point out that these disorders cannot infect people nearby the way a virus could .
" A depressed person will not give you the same clinical disorder by contagion .
They 're just too complex for that , " said Ian Gotlib , professor of psychology and director of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Laboratory at Stanford University .
" It is rare that you yourself will develop that same psychiatric disorder . "
But a person with depression or other disorder can have a tremendous effect on those around them .
Studies on college roommates show that when one person has depression , the other roommate can develop similar behaviors and feel more down .
" It 's not the mimicry , it 's the stress of being around them , " Gotlib said .
" The mood stuff happens , but it 's not clinical . "
Coping strategies are critical when dealing with a depressed spouse .
" If the caregiver believes the behavior is caused by the illness , they are less likely to be affected , " Galynker said .
" If they think the behavior is the result of a character flaw , they are more likely to be affected because then they also place blame on themselves . "
Carol Rossetti never thought she had a clinical condition , but she eventually became so unhappy with her husband that they separated .
" When I left him after 34 years of marriage , I did n't think we'd get back together , " Carol said .
" I was perfectly fine not being with him . "
But Ron quit his job and went through therapy to get his disorder under control , and after a year of separation , the Rossettis came together again .
Now both Ron and Carol know how to maneuver around Ron 's episodes .
" The last ½ to two years have been the most worry - free of my life , " Carol said .
" Now he 's a born - again bipolar person . "
NBC Universal 's CEO Jeff Zucker is n't a sucker : the CEO of one of the world 's largest broadcasting giants says he knows that the war on piracy is failing .
Rather than look for new business solutions to this aging issue , however , Zucker wants to see the US government step in and create what can only be called a new intellectual property regime to stop piracy .
For Zucker , the war on piracy is a resource game , and all that 's needed are more resources .
Zucker appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box program ( webcast ) yesterday to discuss his views on piracy in the wake of a report that claims that more than $ 58 billion is lost to piracy right now ( we are attempting to obtain the actual study , but the Institute for Policy Innovation has yet to release it ) .
Zucker introduced the study at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference .
On CNBC , Zucker said that the problem of piracy is " actually growing , " and " we 've done nothing to combat it in a way that 's stemming any of those [ piracy ] numbers . "
" This is the new face of economic crime in this country , " he said .
Piracy , Zucker argued , goes far beyond the entertainment world , as it affects health care with counterfeit pharmaceuticals , and " counterfeit airplane parts , " he said .
" Law enforcement needs greater resources , greater penalties that will get in the way of those pirates . "
Perhaps Zucker will be pleased by today 's RIAA verdict , which granted the RIAA a precedent - setting victory and $ 220,000 in damages .
The RIAA plans to use the case to promote what happens when you engage in file sharing and do n't settle .
Fear , the RIAA hopes , will scare people straight .
At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference , Zucker was also rallying the troops around the notion that more enforcement will fix the problem .
As Anne Broache at News.com reports , Zucker said that intellectual property theft should be the center of attention at all levels of government , all the way up to the White House .
The government should create a central intellectual property task force to coordinate enforcement , and also manage a grant and subsidy program aimed at getting state and local governments involved in the effort .
Zucker also trotted out the view that all internet service providers should help stop piracy by installing filtering software .
This is a reiteration of the position Rick Cotton , NBCU 's general counsel , submitted to the FCC earlier this year , which we reported on extensively here .
It boils down to this : content producers like NBCU seem to resent ISPs , because they know that ISPs have the ability to generally shape traffic .
They mistake this for an ability to filter content for copyrighted works and thus argue that ISPs are " hiding " behind the Safe Harbor provisions of the DMCA .
In this way , what Zucker , et al. imagine is really a major overhaul to the country 's intellectual property laws , and one which would tip the balance even further away from consumers , towards Big Content .

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( CNN ) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain received much - needed boosts from New Hampshire Tuesday .
Clinton , coming off a disappointing third - place finish in Iowa , rebounded to overcome rival Sen. Barack Obama in the state 's Democratic primary .
Supporters at her headquarters chanted " comeback kid " as the results came in .
Clinton trailed Obama by 9 points in recent polls .
On the Republican side , McCain easily won his party 's primary .
The results mark a resurgence for the Arizona senator , whose campaign was all but written off this summer .
What do the results mean ? »
Clinton and McCain embraced their comeback positions in addressing supporters Tuesday night .
" Over the last week , I listened to you , and in the process I found my own voice , " Clinton said to a crowd of young supporters .
Watch Clinton thank New Hampshire »
" Now together , let 's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me . "
McCain , a 71 - year - old , four - term senator , was met by a crowd shouting , " Mac is back . "
Watch McCain celebrate his win »
" I 'm past the age when I can claim the noun ' kid , ' no matter what adjective precedes it , but we sure showed them what a comeback looks like , " he said .
McCain pinned his win on " one strategy " -- telling the people of New Hampshire what he believes .
Watch a slideshow of the candidates ' speeches »
" When the pundits declared us finished , I told them , ' I 'm going to New Hampshire , where the voters do n't let you make their decisions for them , ' " he said .
" ' I 'm going to New Hampshire , and I 'm going to tell people the truth . ' "
Female voters and older voters helped hand Clinton the Democratic win , according to exit polls .
In Iowa , Clinton lost out to Obama among women 35 percent to 30 percent .
In New Hampshire , however , 45 percent of female Democratic primary voters picked Clinton , compared to 36 percent who went for Obama .
Older voters also overwhelmingly outnumbered younger voters , a proportion that benefited Clinton .
Sixty - seven percent of Democratic primary voters were over the age of 40 , and they were breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama .
McCain overcame former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to seal the win in New Hampshire with 37 percent of the vote .
Romney had led most polls in Iowa and New Hampshire before the votes there and held a 12 - point lead in New Hampshire shortly before Christmas .
He finished second , as he did in Iowa , five points behind McCain .
Romney won Saturday 's Wyoming caucus .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- winner of the Iowa caucuses -- finished third with 11 percent .
Voters who supported McCain and those who supported Romney differed significantly on what issues they feel are most important , exit polling showed .
Forty - six percent of those who supported McCain ranked the war in Iraq the most important .
Meanwhile , voters who supported Romney overwhelmingly felt immigration was the most important issue .
McCain has been a staunch supporter of the war in Iraq , but co-sponsored failed immigration reform legislation that drew the ire of many conservatives in his party .
Romney has been taking a tough stance on immigration .
McCain bested Huckabee , a one - time Baptist minister , among New Hampshire voters who said a candidate 's religious beliefs matter a great deal , according to CNN exit polls .
While Huckabee won overwhelmingly among those voters in Iowa , in New Hampshire , 35 percent went to McCain while 31 percent went to Huckabee .
The religious voters made up 14 percent of all Republican primary voters in New Hampshire -- much less than in Iowa .
Huckabee and Romney called McCain to congratulate him Tuesday night .
" I 'll fight to be back in this state and others , " Romney told supporters .
Watch Romney congratulate McCain »
Huckabee , who earlier said a third - place finish would be " huge " for him , also promised to return to New Hampshire .
" After we secure the nomination , we 've got to come back here and make sure we carry New Hampshire . "
Obama , the junior senator from Illinois , congratulated Clinton and praised " all the candidates in this race " as " patriots who serve this country honorably . "
But Obama assailed critics who he said doubted his campaign and said the record numbers of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire showed " there is something happening in America . "
" For most of this campaign , we were far behind , " he said .
" We always knew our climb would be steep .
But in record numbers , you came out and you spoke up for change . "
Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina painted himself as the candidate of the voiceless after tracking a distant third in the Democratic primary .
Noting that there are " two states down , 48 states to go " in primary and caucus voting , the 2004 vice presidential nominee said that only about 1 percent of Americans had voted so far and that the other " 99 percent deserve to be heard . "
Watch Edwards describe where he goes next »
With 95 percent of precincts counted , Clinton had 39 percent of the vote to Iowa caucus winner Obama 's 37 percent .
Edwards had 17 percent .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson had 5 percent , and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich had 1 percent .
With 95 percent of Republican precincts reporting , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani had 9 percent and Texas Rep. Ron Paul had 8 percent .
Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson received 1 percent of the vote .
Watch Paul say he will continue to fight »
New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch predicted a record turnout for the first - in - the - nation presidential primary .
He said he expected half a million people to vote .
The Democratic race now will focus on upcoming contests in Nevada and South Carolina , and could easily stretch past " Super Tuesday " on February 5 .
The next GOP contest with delegates at stake is on January 15 in Michigan , where Romney 's father was governor in the 1960s .

All About New Hampshire • Democratic Party • Republican Party
The other day , I asked : “ What if some sort of larger formal organization of education - and outreach - oriented LP members was created ? ”
While my reason for asking the question primarily dealt with trying to provide a solution to longstanding debate within the Libertarian Party , it was also partially prompted by Brad Spangler ’s call to dissolve the LP .
Social Memory Complex has now added a similar viewpoint ( emphasis added ) :
Perhaps Brad Spangler ’s call for the dissolution of the Libertarian Party would indeed be the best way to ensure that libertarians maintain their radical credentials and do n’t get swallowed up in the institutional identity of statist politics .
Personally , I have n’t quite decided whether dissolving the LP would , in fact , assist the cause of liberty .
Too many , including yours truly , u-turned on the road to serfdom as a result of that organization , however status quo they may in fact be .
Perhaps the answer is for us radical libertarians to work harder to build an alternative institution to the LP that can expedite getting people out of the suffocating political process .
I agree that the LP often does serve the valuable purpose of u-turning ( pardon the neologism ) people “ on the road to serfdom , ” but there are two other factors which I sometimes do n’t think are understood by certain radicals :
To most Americans I know , simply being involved with the Libertarian Party is considered an act of extreme radicalism already .
Many of us ( including some self - described radicals ) actually have a goal of substantial electoral victory — in our lifetime .
This does n’t mean “ watering down ” libertarianism , but recruiting decent candidates and running effective campaigns .
For the meantime , I ’ll continue to stand by my earlier quote :
My friend Brad forgot one key group of people :
There are those of us who would prefer to pursue electoral strategies but do n’t have the stomach to work within the major parties , at least for any prolonged period of time .
Many of us find neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party reformable .
To use some of Spangler ’s logic , the Ron Paul presidential campaign has underscored this point .

A crumbling ice shelf along the West Antarctic Peninsula has become the latest polar poster child for global warming .
This week , researchers in the United States , Britain , and Taiwan released images of long stretches of ice shearing away from the shelf .
What started with the loss of a relatively thin , 26 - mile - long iceberg at the end of February cascaded into the loss of 160 square miles of ice by the end of last week .
Its erosion wo n't affect sea levels .
Like an ice cube in a filled cup , it 's already in the water .
And the handful of glaciers that feed into the shelf , called the Wilkins Ice Shelf , are small .
Still , researchers say , the event represents a marker .
The region has seen unprecedented rates of warming during the past 50 years .
Two of the 10 shelves along the peninsula have vanished within the past 30 years .
Another five have lost between 60 percent and 92 percent of their original extent .
Of the 10 , Wilkins is the southernmost shelf in the area to start buckling under global warming 's effects .
" Wilkins is a stepping stone in a larger process , " says Ted Scambos , a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo. , who discovered the breakup in satellite images .
" It 's really a story of what 's yet to come if the mainland of Antarctica begins to warm . "
So far , the shelf has lost about 3 percent of its total extent , which covers an area more than twice the size of Rhode Island and is up to 820 feet thick .
But all that sits between the shelf 's new seaward edge and a vast expanse of much weaker shelf ice is what researchers dub a " thread " of strong ice .
And Wilkins 's erosion is happening faster than researchers projected .
" In 1993 , we predicted that this was going to be a vulnerable ice shelf , " says David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey .
" But we got the time scales completely wrong .
We were saying 30 years at that time , and now it 's happened within 15 . "
Glaciologists are concerned about Antarctica 's ice shelves because most of them represent brakes of solid ice that slow the glaciers ' flow to the sea .
Without those brakes , the glaciers would surge , calve into icebergs , and significantly raise the sea level .
The region of greatest concern is West Antarctica , which includes the peninsula .
Using satellites , scientists have been tracking snowfall , ice loss , and changes in the region 's gravity field to gauge the amount of mass the continent 's two large ice sheets are gaining or losing .
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is separated from its eastern sibling by a long chain of mountains , so gains or no change in mass for the continent as a whole may still mask significant changes on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .
Recent studies have added to a growing body of evidence that key glaciers flowing from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are thinning at rates not seen since the last ice age .
For instance , for the past 4,700 years , the Pine Island Glacier has thinned at a rate of about 1 - 1/ 2 inches a year , according to a team of scientists from Britain and Germany .
That rate is similar to those of other major glaciers in the region .
But between 1992 and 1996 , Pine Island Glacier thinned at an average rate of 63 inches a year .
Their results appear in the March edition of the journal Geology .
Meanwhile , a team led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 's Eric Rignot published satellite radar data showing that while East Antarctica 's ice sheet lost virtually no mass between 1992 and 2006 , the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was losing 132 billion tons of ice a year by the end of that period .
Scientists attribute the losses to warmer air and ocean temperatures , which melt the glacier 's shelves from above and from below .
But the Wilkins Ice Shelf is a different breed in the way it forms , explains Dr. Vaughan .
Although it 's been stable for as long as scientists have been able to reach the continent and study it , the shelf scientists see crumbling today appears to have formed either between the Roman era and the Medieval Warm Period or with the onset of the Little Ice Age .
Indeed , he adds , " it 's kind of a come - and - go ice shelf " compared with the other vanishing shelves , which have been stable far longer .
Wilkins appears to have started as seasonal sea ice that gradually thickened , Dr. Vaughn adds .
Shelves built of glacial ice are stout , because the weight of each succeeding winter 's snow has compressed the layers beneath until the glacial ice becomes solid .
By contrast , Wilkins and a handful of ice shelves like it are more porous .
Over centuries they too thickened with each winter 's snowfall .
The weight of the new snow , however , drives a preceding year 's layer under water before the upper layers build enough weight to squeeze the tiny nooks and crannies out of it .
The task now is to tease out the precise mechanisms triggering the recent collapse , researchers say .
By figuring out the breakup mechanism in detail , scientists should be able to improve the models they use to anticipate the behavior of other ice shelves as climate and ocean conditions continue to change , Dr. Scambos says .
Breaking complete from the standard design for laptops , these concepts are a nice change , aesthetically and technologically .

BBC World Service in Nepal
The refugees arrived in Nepal after being stripped of their nationality ( Pic : Jasleen Sethi )
The refugees are ethnic Nepalese forced out of Bhutan in the 1990s by the government , which was concerned with the rising influence of a sizeable Hindu minority in the Buddhist country .
Bhutan and Nepal have been at loggerheads ever since over how to solve the problem .
The refugees have now been presented with the option of resettlement abroad - with 60,000 being given the opportunity to live in the US .
But this has caused divisions among the refugees , with supporters of the move threatened with intimidation and violence .
Mahindra - not his real name - told BBC World Service 's The World Today programme how a mob of 40 people came to his hut armed with knives , calling him an American agent .
" My mum was dragged to the ground ; my clothes were torn , ripped up with knives , " he said .
" They did this because I support resettlement to America . "
Slave rumours
Mahindra added that he was himself only 11 years old when he was forced to leave Bhutan ; now he has a nine - year - old child .
Some of the refugees need care for diseases such as goitre ( Pic : Jasleen Sethi )
" So I say , let refugees decide their own fate and destiny . "
Mahindra is based at Beldangi Refugee Camp , home to some 20,000 refugees .
There , the children sing about returning to a motherland they have never seen - Bhutan .
And many feel it will spell the death of their dream to return home if the refugees accept a move abroad .
As a result , a number of rumours are spread - that the flights out are to various extents a trick , with some people believing they will be used as slave labour on arrival in the US .
Reports back
Tek Nath Rijal , the self - appointed leader of the Bhutanese refugees , is an outspoken critic of resettlement .
The refugees have survived entirely on international aid for 17 years ( Pic : Jasleen Sethi )
He argued instead that he believes those being attacked are Bhutanese agents , working on behalf of the government to persuade people to resettle - meaning that Bhutan would not have to take them back .
" Instead of pressurising the Bhutan government , they are helping them , " he added .
But in the camp , refugees simply feel confused , with the undecided facing more threats .
A man was shot in the latest violence .
As the first of them settle in America , their reports back will determine the likely future of those they leave behind .

123456 , 123 , 123123 , 01234 , 2468 , 987654 , etc 123abc , abc123 , 246abc First Name Favorite Band Favorite
Song first letter of given name then surname qwerty , asdf , and other keyboard rolls Favorite cartoon or movie character Favorite sport , or sports star Country of origin City of origin
All numbers
Some word in the dictionary Combining 2 dictionary words any of the above spelled backwards aaa , eee , llll , 999999 , and other repeat combinations
Common Extensions
Some sites force you to have passwords with both numbers and letters .
For example bob 's password is football , and the site asks him to add some numbers to it to make it valid .
Here 's what people usually add .
Their year of birth / marriage / graduation ( or expected grad ) from HS or college 007 0 - 9 69 000 , 111 , 4444 or other long combinations 123456 , 123 , 123123 , 01234 and other retarded combinations
Years are usually added in different ways : football85 , football1985 , football04 instead of football4 .
There 's also the possibility of sub-connections like football_04 and football - 84 .
Many sites require both numbers and letters so these are a more likely occurance since people tend to want to have the same pass for everything .
My opinion on an Ideal password
Mixed numbers and letters over 8 characters long .
Memorize it once , use it forever .
How long it takes to hack a password
If they have hacked and downloaded the entire database it 's 10000 times faster than if they send requests guessing your passwords on certain websites .
Most decent comps can check easily thousands possibilities per second .
Most decent sites have captchas now which prevent brute force guesses .
Words in the Dictionary
If they steal a sites database you can get hacked fast , even if you use foreign words .
The open office english spellcheck has around 70,000 words .
Apps like passwordspro on my 2
Ghz cpu can check around 4,000,000 md5 possibilities a second , allowing to to breeze through several dictionaries , including possible variations like all uppercase / lowercase and backwards words .
The latest nvidia cards with a coda gpu brute forcer can easily exceed 200 million md5s a second .
Numbers
If you have an all numbers password it 's much faster to crack than if it were mixed .
Instead of having a massive array of words in memory and selecting an index from it , or even worse reading from disk every few seconds in a buffer , having a number just requires the computer to do what computers do fastest , count .
At 2
Ghz my comp can check every number up to 14 million in 2 minute for salted md5s , making it possible to have a weak 8 character password .
Adding 0s to the front of the number can help , but not really .
A second pass with any number of 0s can be done afterwards .
Maybe if you made it your zipcode + your best friends number or something VERY long it would be strong enough .
All Random letters
Every possible combination of 3 letter words is only around 17000 while every possible 4 letter word combination is 456976 .
It grows exponentially every time you increase just one letter .
Most sites recommend 8 characters or more for a strong password .
Adding just 1 character to your password helps expontentially .
No dictionary words !
Why hackers usually do n't care about your Computer
Contrary to popular belief most malicious hackers do not give a damn about giving you trojans or making your stupid windows computer crash .
Then why are there so many trojans in p2 p networks ?
Because of retarted script kiddy teenagers and nigerians that fancy themselves hackers using prebuilt trojan software .
Hackers target servers .
Why ?
Massive bandwidth .
Mail servers with proper mmx records that validate spam checks
The possibility for phising .
Most servers are unattended meaning it can be months before the person finds out there 's a malicious script bombing emails or phising people .
Exploitation of social networks .
They can get a lot of credit card numbers or bank account information email bombing thousands of emails on a hijacked server rather than waiting to find a credit card number amongst all the instant messages and random typing you / your kids type throughout the month .
Sure there 's been a lot of home PCs infected , but usually this is the result of very efficient viruses that replicate and spread in - mass .
Most people have decent antivirus software for hackers to want to waste their time flooding trojans .
Some hackers use hijacked home PCs as DDoS zombies , but other than that you 're more likely just to get spyware that floods you with ads .
How hackers usually obtain your password
Most malicious hackers just wait for security update news .
Whenever some forum or cms software like drupal , vbulletin , phpbb or invision board releases a security update , they try and find what the discovered exploit was .
They google search for forums that may have the affected system and use the exploit .
Forums can give tons of emails / passwords .
The ones who are skilled enough and actively attempt to discover the exploits are more rare .
Even worse is when the skilled programmers make simple automated exploit programs for script kiddies to use without even understanding the code .
This is where the majority of the attacks come from , losers that use programs made by hacker and call themselves hackers .
It 's super rare that you would be targeted or your password has been hacked from large sites like google , hotmail or myspace .
Most of the big sites have capchas and DDoS protection , which cripples speed , It 's more likely they hacked some other site that you long forgot about and found you conveniently use the same password for all your accounts including your email .
From there they find even more passwords ..
Most people get hacked from phising attempts or other forms of social engineering rather than real hackers , although they can use XSS vulnerabilities to help trick people .
People also get trojans from opening email extensions and downloading pirate stuff off p2 p without a decent antivirus .
Hackers with skills enough to find open ports / exploit them and get shell access are much more rare than people claim .
Common Types of Webhacks
SQL Injection
By far the most common serious error web programmers have is not validating user input well .
Usually SQL injections are used to get username / passwords or other information in the database by adding a UNION statement to a select query .
Despite it 's name its more rare to get an exploit where you can actually inject or insert data into the database since most programmers are n't stupid enough to use GET requests for insert , most hackers are more lazy when it comes to spoofing post requests , and it's a lot more tricky or impossible to add insert , create or drop queries to injected strings .
Local File Inclusion
Many web apps load modules or plugins through get or post variables .
Lets say I use ?loadplz=file.php if I wanted to load / home / jimmy / htdocs/file.php a malicious person could say ?
loadplz= ../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd to try his luck for some unshadowed password goodness .
Many times the NULL byte exploit is used to trick input validation .
It is often used to include any CMS or Forum configuration files to get MySQL access .
Remote File Inclusion
Yikes , a lot of web apps have forms where you can upload pictures , texts or files
Some have admin control panels that only the admin of the site can access but then there 's no input validation on the upload forms .
Some just do n't validate the type of file you upload , meaning you can upload malicious code that does anything within the limits of the JIT compiler privileges .
Logged in User Exploits
Many sites often do n't validate the data you want to modify or delete is yours .
They only check if you 're logged in .
Sites that use Ajax are especially prone to overlook possible input validation problems .
How are passwords stored in a website
Most are stored as md5 hashes .
If your password is stored without encryption you are screwed if the site gets hacked .
It does n't matter how long your password is .
Sites like thepiratebay and stage6 have gotten their passwords stolen , do n't think it can't happen to big sites .
You can tell if a site encrypts your password by using their password recovery form .
If it gives you your password your password is not encrypted .
If it asks you to enter a new one or it generates a password for you , it has your password encrypted .
You should never purchase anything from sites that do n't encrypt your password , they may keep your credit card information or other sensitive data without encryption following their php for dummies guide
Dangers of md5
Sites like milw0rm and plain - text have millions , maybe billions of precomputed hash values in what are called rainbow tables .
People can enter hashes in limited quantities to put on queue for cracking .
md5 is a one - way hash , meaning it can't be decrypted .
Instead , they try every possible combination in a limited range .
Encrypting many possibilities and comparing them to the original hash is extremely slow .
Rainbow tables make it so that the possibilities are encrypted only once and the resulting hashes are saved into massive files called a Rainbow table .
From there the real hashes are compared to all the possibility hashes in the rainbow table .
This avoids recalculating the hashes for every possibility for every user but in exchange costs a lot of overhead loading the file into memory and comparing from memory .
The time - memory trade off is worth it .
Other sites are just searchable databases of hashes .
You still should be ok if your pass is over 8 characters long .
Some sites do double md5s or concatenate md5 encrypted passwords with an encrypted " salted " value , then encrypt the whole thing again .
Because the salted value is different for each user , precalculating millions of hashes in rainbow tables would have to be done one user at a time , making it a worse option that brute forcing it .
Brute force attacks use word lists separated by line breaks which are widely available around the net and can be easily created , they can also check all possible combinations for certain ranges and character sets .
Making your password case sensitive helps exponentially , specifically ^+26 lol , but it makes typing a pass a bit more inconvenient and not all sites support it .
I 'm sure my prog is n't the most efficient possible and there are way faster comps out there so be careful .
Web Exploiters vs Program Crackers
People who exploit website vulnerabilities are not always the same as those who crack and keygen commercial software and games .
The two require a few different skill sets .
Web hacking requires mastery knowledge of the http protocol , cookies , php , asp , SQL , and the methods user input is usually validated .
The skill is gained from a lot of practice writing safe web - apps and observing the exploits found often in others .
Program crackers on the other hand usually have very intimate knowledge of assembly and non-JIT compilers .
They use a debuggers to find exactly where in the program a certain procedure is executed in order to modify it .
They are also apt in modifying and exploiting unvalidated user input in the memory with buffer overflows .
Browser plugins are often the target to buffer overflow exploits .
I 'm not saying some people do n't have both skill sets .
What is hacking
Contrary to popular belief and the Hollywood culture , hackers are just people that can manipulate things on a bits and bytes level .
They 're excellent programmers and the majority do not engage in illegal activity .
Making something do what it was n't intended to is exploiting , not hacking .

On March 8 , pianist Yosuke Yamashita donned a fireproof suit and played a burning piano on a beach in Ishikawa prefecture .
The improvised jazz performance went for about 10 minutes until the flames rendered the piano silent .
This video shows a few excerpts .
Yamashita 's performance was a reenactment of a similar one he gave in 1973 , which was made into a short film by Japanese director Kiyoshi Awazu .

Rails has been getting a lot of flack lately , instead of the usual hype .
Zed Shaw , author of Mongrel , recently blew his top off against the Ruby on Rails community leaders and said that Rails is a ghetto .
Zed is getting a lot of attention from this explosive rant but this is not the first time a prominent developer / blogger has spoken out against the Rails framework and it ’s leadership .
Before Zed went AWOL on the Rails community , Derek Sivers of CD Baby switched back to PHP after working with Rails for two years without releasing a product .
Perhaps the first notable negative article regarding Rails ’ performance was a five question interview with Twitter developer Alex Payne .
Since then there has been many more potty mouthed articles against Rails and its infallible dear leader , better known by his initials DHH , such as Imploding Rails , Jesus DHH , and the Uncle Ben Principle , 10 Areas Where Rails Fails , Ruby , Rails and RSpec burned a day off my lifespan , and How to ruin a Rails project .
So why all the Rails bashing ?
Most Rubyist and Railist will brush off and dismiss such comments as coming from Java playa hatin’ developers , but this is not the case , these articles are written from the perspective of fellow Ruby on Rails hackers , developers , and contributers .
The experience of these Ruby on Rails developers remind me of the testimonials of people that escaped from a Peoples Temple cult ; they been to the other side and it is not as green as it was portrayed , especially if you do not adhere without question to the opinionated papal bull - shit of the core Rails church leaders .
I think some of the comments that Rails nay sayers are trying to address is that the Rails community is itself falling into the trap of eating it own dogma .
But I am not a Rails heretic , so instead of paraphrasing , let me quote some of the most interesting remarks from the aforementioned articles .
Any discussion about Rails with ultimately lead to it ’s performance .
Running on Rails has forced us to deal with scaling issues – issues that any growing site eventually contends with – far sooner than I think we would on another framework .
— Five Question Inverview
None of these scaling approaches are as fun and easy as developing for Rails .
All the convenience methods and syntactical sugar that makes Rails such a pleasure for coders ends up being absolutely punishing , performance - wise .
— Five Question Inverview
Consider that Rails is the Love Child of Web 2.0 and Disillusioned Web 1.0 Developers , whole shops and corporate departments are adopting Rails as a way to push their applications into production more rapidly – what happens when they try to scale these apps and get “ Twitter ’d ” ?
— Imploding Rails
The main Rails application that DHH created required restarting ~400 times / day .
That ’s a production application that ca n’t stay up for more than 4 minutes on average .
— Rails is a ghetto
The greatest thing about Ruby on Rails is neither Ruby nor Rails , the best aspect of Rails is that it questioned the ‘ best practices ’ ( or worst nightmares ) of the current state of web development with its philosophy of Convention over Configuration and Do n’t Repeat Yourself principle .
Ruby and Rails is not the next best thing , it is just the missing link to the next best programming language and framework , or at least this is the logic of some PHP developers …
Is there anything Rails can do , that PHP CAN ’T do ?
The answer is no .
— 7 reasons I switched back to PHP
Rails was an amazing teacher .
I loved it ’s “ do exactly as I say ” paint - by - numbers framework that taught me some great guidelines . …
But the main reason that any programmer learning any new language thinks the new language is SO much better than the old one is because he ’s a better programmer now !
— 7 reasons I switched back to PHP
Zed ’s great rant opus against the Rails elite provided insight from an insider ’s point of view , although he complains as he was an outsider .
Zed did not mince words and especially goes nuclear against ThoughtWorks and Dave Thomas .
This is exactly what makes Rails a ghetto .
A bunch of half - trained former PHP morons who never bother to sit down and really learn the computer science they were too good to study in college .
— Rails is a ghetto
They [ Rails community ] were all a bunch of little ghetto fabulous princesses trying to make it in this tiny little Rails world and not enough brains between them all to make it happen .
— Rails is a ghetto
When you combine stupid businesses with stupid people using a stupid framework based on a big fat fucking lie on a shitty platform you get the perfect storm of dumbfuck where a man like me ca n’t find work .
— Rails is a ghetto
Sorry guys , but having a 1:4 code : test ratio is not focusing on code quality .
It ’s focusing on test quality .
— Rails is a ghetto
He [ Dave Thomas ] basically had full access to the code and the people who wrote Rails and a direct line to DHH and still could n’t write a decent book on writing a Rails application .

Personally , I love dingbats because ( most of the time ) I convert them to vectors in Illustrator and use them as very large elements in some cases .
All you have to do is use the font in Illustrator and then go to Type > Create Outlines , and Bam .
You got yourself a vector to work with .
Here are some dingbat fonts that I thought you might enjoy .
BECK : Let me ask you , because I got — I get so much e-mail on this , and I think a lot of people do , and I`ve only got a couple of seconds .
They say Glenn , you and the media , you`ve got to wake up .
Barack Obama`s making people faint and cry and everything else .
And he`s drawing people in .
There are people — and they said this about Bill Clinton that actually believe he might be the anti-Christ .
Odds that Barack Obama is the anti-Christ ?
HAGEE : No chance .
He has a lot of charisma .
There`s a media love affair with him right now .
He is a very formidable political person .
I believe the best leader for America in the future is John McCain .
BAGHDAD , Nov 6 ( Reuters ) - Iran has helped to " rein in " Shi'ite militias blamed for fuelling Iraq 's sectarian violence , Iraq 's foreign minister said on Tuesday , calling it a positive development ahead of a planned new round of security talks .
Hoshiyar Zebari's comments in a telephone interview with Reuters follow a noticeable softening in the language used by U.S. officials to describe Iran 's role in Iraq in the past week .
Washington has repeatedly accused Tehran of supplying rockets , mortars and roadside bombs to Shi'ite militias in Iraq as well as offering training on how to use them , a charge Tehran denies .
But in recent days U.S. officials have spoken of a drop in the number of armour - piercing bombs that Washington says Iran has supplied to militias , and noted Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr 's call on his Mehdi Army to observe a six - month ceasefire .
" Iran has been instrumental in reining in the militias and the Mehdi Army by using its influence , " Zebari said .
" Part of the security improvement was their control of the militias .
We see this as a positive development . "
While U.S. officials have hinted at a link in the sharp drop in violence in Iraq to what they see as Iran 's sway over the militias , Zebari 's comments appeared to be the first by a senior Iraqi government official on the issue .
He hailed an announcement by the U.S. military earlier in the day that it planned to free nine Iranians in its custody , saying it was a confidence - building measure that would encourage more productive talks between Iran , Iraq and the United States on improving security in Iraq .
" We have tried very hard with the American military and the ( U.S. ) embassy to release them .
We are very pleased now that a decision has been made , " he said .
" We believe it will help enhance confidence in dialogue between Iran , Iraq and the United States on Iraq security and will make ( for ) more useful and substantive talks . "
He said a security sub -committee set up earlier this year that includes representatives of Iraq , the United States and Iran would meet again soon .
Both Washington and Tehran have indicated their willingness to attend the talks .
Zebari said the Iraqi government would continue to lobby for the release of Iranians still being held by U.S. forces , a sensitive political issue that has raised tensions between Iraq and Iran , which has demanded they be freed .

Russia had halved Ukraine 's gas supply in a dispute over debts
Gazprom had cut supplies to Ukraine by half this week , in a dispute over Ukraine 's debts to Gazprom ( £ 770 m ) and a new contract .
The dispute raised concern that gas supplies to Europe would be hit as much of its supply passes through Ukraine .
But Naftogaz said that supplies to Europe had not been interrupted by its disagreement with Gazprom .
The chief executives of the two companies held talks on Wednesday to hammer out a deal .
" Today Gazprom CEO Aleksey Miller and Naftogaz Ukrayiny CEO Oleh Dubyna held talks by telephone , in the course of which agreements have been reached to resolve the crisis with the supply of gas to Ukraine , " Gazprom spokesman , Sergey Kupriyanov , said on Russian television .
Ukraine has agreed to pay for gas supplies for January and February of this year .
But Gazprom said talks continued on other issues .
Gazprom cut supply twice this week , first on Monday by 25 % then again by 25 % on Tuesday .
A previous row between the two sides saw Russia cut gas to Ukraine in 2006 .
It also hit exports to Western Europe and affected diplomatic relations between Brussels and Moscow .
The alarm in the Colorado Convention Center employee ’s voice was verging on panic .
“ That room is packed so tight it ’s not even funny , ” he shouted into a radio Friday night as the Segway he was riding hummed and swerved down a wide carpeted hallway .
The crowd for Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul was so large it surprised his own organizers .
They were forced to hurriedly open partitions to double the size of the ballroom space minutes before Paul ’s scheduled appearance in the Four Seasons Ballroom .
When that was n’t enough hundreds of people stood rimming the hall that sits 1,536 .
“ I ’m just totally dumbfounded , ” Paul said as he began his speech before a raucous sign - waving crowd .
“ The enthusiasm seems to be growing .
Freedom is popular . ”
Many of his supporters boldly predicted he would win more delegates in the state then front runners Sen.
John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney even though Paul has yet to win a majority in any state primary .
“ He ’s real strong in Colorado , ” said Vince Holcomb , 45 , a massage therapist from Centennial .
“ Ron Paul is a lot higher in the polls than the mainstream media publicize . ”
Full - bearded John Wiens , 57 , of Loveland , decked out in a Revolutionary War -era fifer ’s outfit complete with a tri-cornered hat and knickers , played “ Yankee Doodle Dandy ” on his flute before the Texas Congressman entered the hall .
The crowd chanted : “ Ron Paul Revolution ; Taking back our Constitution . ”
Paul said he is so well - received in Colorado because people in the state share his love of personal liberties , his quest to “ return to constitutional principles ” and his belief that government needs to be dramatically reduced .
“ There ’s no reason why we ca n’t do quite well right here , ” Paul said during a press conference that preceded his campaign speech .
“ I would say we ’re in pretty good shape . ”
Paul , who celebrated his 51st wedding anniversary Friday night , was a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force during the 1960s and has delivered more than 4,000 babies .
He has five children , 18 grandchildren and one great grandchild .
Paul says he plans to end welfare for illegal aliens and “ birthright citizenship . ”
He says he has never voted to increase taxes , is against regulating the Internet and opposes the Iraq war .
“ We do n’t have to start a brand new revolution , ” Paul told the crowd .
“ All we have to do is restore the original Constitution . ”

Junk mail rarely brings you something you want , but for one homeowner it has led to a lawsuit landing on his doormat .
Paul O'Brien is being sued by a woman who says she trapped her hand in his letterbox while posting mail .
Joy Goodman , a cake decorator in her late 40s , is seeking damages for personal injury and loss of earnings .
She claims the top of her right index finger was severed by his letterbox and she can no longer do her intricate job .
Scroll down for more ...
Mr O'Brien , 44 , from Morley , Leeds , vowed to fight the claim , branding it " a joke " .
The self - employed engineer said : " When I received a solicitor 's letter I thought someone was having a laugh .
" I actually told them they had sent it early - April Fool 's Day is still six weeks away .
" I just cannot believe someone who came on to my property uninvited , to put junk mail through my door that I did n't want , can now sue me because she hurt herself .
" I do not even know what the woman posted to me .
I never read my junk mail .
" When I get junk mail I usually just scoop it all up and throw it in the bin . "
The divorced father of two was out when Mrs Goodman claims she was hurt at the door of his four - bedroom detached new - build house .
She returned two days later and , finding him out , spoke to a neighbour and left contact details for him to get in touch with her .
The next he heard from her was when he received a letter from her solicitors saying she was claiming damages .
It read : " We understand that the circumstances of the accident are that our client was delivering a leaflet to your house when your letterbox snapped back on to her right index finger .
" As a result of this , our client suffered from personal injury and loss . "
The letter did not state how much compensation she was pursuing , and asked only for his acknowledgement .
Scroll down for more ...
Mr O'Brien said : " It said they could claim against my house insurance .
But if they pay out , my premiums will go up .
" Either way it will be me who ends up footing the bill .
I am going to tell them to challenge it .
" I did n't invite this person on to my property and there is nothing wrong with the letterbox - I have n't altered it or done anything to it .
" It 's just like every other letterbox on this estate .
It 's the one that came with the house .
I asked the Royal Mail if they had had any problems with it .
" They said they had n't and that in any case their staff are trained to make sure they do n't get hurt while delivering .
" It seems like we 're becoming more and more like America .
Everyone wants compensation . "
Mr O'Brien now has a poster in his window that reads : " No salespersons , No junk mail . "
Mrs Goodman declined to comment , saying only : " It is in the hands of my solicitors . "
A neighbour of Mr O'Brien said : " This is absolutely crazy .
I might put a sign up too .
That could have happened to any one of us . "

Brattleboro Vermont Votes to Indict Bush and Cheney
Measure Passes 2012 to 1795 in Heavy Voting UPDATE 7:45 pm EDT .
Brattleboro becomes one of the first cities , perhaps the first , in the United States to indict President Bush and Vice President Cheney for " crimes against the constitution . "
The measure listed below , was voted on today in Brattleboro Vermond .
Turnout was heavy , nearing 50 % and activists were out in strength to help get people to the polls .
The measure is symbolic since neither Bush nor Cheney have nay plans to visit Vermont soon .
However , candidate Dobson from Maine introduced a similar measure in Kennebunkport , Maine ( see below ) which may come up for a vote in the summer .
This was reported to Michael Collins by Maine U.S. Senate Candidate Laurie Dobson who was supporting the election by taking exit polls today in Brattleboro .
*************
The second American Revolution may begin in Brattleboro , Vermont should it becomes the first city in the United States to formally indict George W. Bush and Dick Cheney for “ crimes against the Constitution . ”
The town votes on the following resolution Tuesday , March 4 , 2008 :
" Shall the Selectboard instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution , and publish said indictment for consideration by other municipalities ?
And shall it be the law of the Town of Brattleboro that the Brattleboro Police , pursuant to the above - mentioned indictments , arrest and detain George Bush and Richard Cheney in Brattleboro if they are not duly impeached , and extradite them to other authorities that may reasonably contend to prosecute them . "
Barry Aleshnick is a Brattleboro resident and one of a small group of activists campaigning for passage of the initiative .
In an interview on the evening of March 2nd , he said the failure of Congress to act on impeachment inspired the Vermont effort .
Aleshnick described how Kurt Daims started the process by developing the resolution .
At the outset , “ Daims stood alone on streets gathering signatures , ” according to Aleshnick .
Others joined the effort and they ’re now working together to gain passage in Tuesday ’s vote .
Aleshnick observed that Bush acts “ like he ’s above the law ” when he invades nations for no reason ” and engages in torture around the world .
The local initiative is one readily available alternative available to citizens to hold Bush and Cheney accountable for “ criminal behavior ” in the absence of congressional action , he said .
Aleshnick is “ optimistic about passage of the resolution . ”

U.S. Senate Candidate Submits Charges against Bush in Kennebunkport , Maine
U.S. Senate candidate Laurie Dobson , ( Ind. ) , charged Bush and Cheney with “ crimes against the Constitution ” in Kennebunkport , Maine , summer home to the Bush family .
Dobson recently attracted national attention by proposing a moratorium on foreclosures , an approach later adopted in a restricted form by Democratic presidential candidates John Edwards and Hillary Clinton .
In her February 26 , 2008 submission , Dobson specified the crimes to the Board of Selectmen : ” I , Laurie Dobson , am convinced that these individuals have committed war crimes . ”
The action will be considered for a vote at the next town meeting a few months out .

Other State and Local Efforts to Indict and Impeach Bush
On Feb. 19 , 2008 , a resolution was presented to New Hampshire ’s House of Representatives calling for impeachment .
While the committee voted against recommending it to the full house , 11 - 5 , the bill will be voted on in March .
Reports from the hearing indicated a large crowd supportive of the amendment to the surprise of legislators .
The Vermont Senate passed a resolution calling for impeachment that passed 16 to 9 in the state senate in April 2007 .
This was the culmination of 40 Vermont town governments passing pro impeachment proposals starting in April 2006 when Newfane , Vermont Selectboard member Dan DeWalt introduced and helped pass a resolution calling for impeachment based on the war in Iraq and resulting deaths .
In early 2007 , a formal resolution of impeachment was introduced in the Illinois State Assembly .
This was based on the rules for the House of Representatives written by Thomas Jefferson .
These rules allow state legislatures and grand juries to issue a formal referral for impeachment , one the U.S. House ore Representatives must consider .
The rules , Section 603 state that :
“ Inception of impeachment proceedings in the House : … there are various methods of setting an impeachment in motion : by charges made on the floor on the responsibility of a Member or Delegate ; by charges preferred by a memorial , which is usually referred to a committee for examination ; by a resolution dropped in the hopper by a Member and referred to a committee ; by a message from the President ; by charges transmitted from the legislature of a State or territory or from a grand jury …
” House Rules Manual , Thomas Jefferson
Illinois representative Karen Yarborough offered the resolution which focused on violating civil liberties and torture .
It called for the immediate removal of Bush and Cheney .
It was referred to committee and killed by the Assembly leadership .
Of the various efforts to start impeachment proceedings , the Illinois resolution had the best chance by invoking the Rules of the House or Representatives .
These rules contain an injunction which makes clear that a “ proposition to impeach is a question of high privilege in the House and at once supersedes business otherwise in order under the rules governing the order of business . ” ( House Rules Manual , Thomas Jefferson )
******
Current Action Stems from anti Patriot Act Effort – 400 Cities Say No Tyranny
Grassroots efforts initiated in cities to impeach Bush are an extension of efforts begun by the Bill of Rights Defense Committee ( BORDC ) against the Patriot Act .
More than 400 cities have passed resolutions calling for a refocus on civil liberties and repeal of all or part of the Patriot Act , passed by Congress .
In 2002 , Ann Arbor , Michigan and Denver , Colorado became the first two cities to pass resolutions objecting to the act .
Davis , California and Wichita Falls ,
Texas were the most recent in 2007 .
While these resolutions do n’t focus on impeachment or indictment , they accuse the president and Congress of passing legislation counter to the intent and words of the Constitution , a charge specified by Brattleboro resolution .
With the president ’s disapproval rating at 78 % and approval down to 19 % , the effort in Brattleboro may be just an affirmative vote away from sparking city and town based effort throughout the country to do what Congress wo n’t do , end the reign of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .

It 's essential for some jobs , handy for most , but do n't be fooled — the personal computer can be a job ender .
Even as you read this story , you should probably be asking yourself :
Am I actually allowed to browse online and read news stories at the office ?
The parameters for computer use at work ( and even at home ) are often confusing .
We communicate , network , watch our TV shows , do our grocery shopping , and get our news on our computers .
But it 's no free - for - all .
Employees should know exactly what their employer 's policies are for E-mail and Internet usage , because workers are losing their jobs after computer - based missteps .
Here are five ways to log on and lose your job :
Blog it up .
Blogger Chez Pazienza worked as a producer at CNN's American Morning until mid-February , when Pazienza says his boss informed him that the company discovered his name attached to blog posts written without CNN 's approval .
Pazienza was fired soon after .
Pazienza runs Deus Ex Malcontent , where he writes about Oprah and President Bush with equal abandon .
He had n't identified himself as a CNN employee on the blog , but CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin says company policy is that employees must first get permission to write for a non-CNN outlet .
Levin did n't elaborate , noting that the company does not comment on personnel matters .
There 's even a term for being fired because of a blog — it 's called being " dooced . "
While some blogging advocates say a well - executed blog can boost your career by presenting your best side to the HR executives Googling you , there are limitations .
Dooce.com founder Heather Armstrong writes on her site that she lost her job a year after beginning the blog for writing entries that involved colleagues .
She now tells site visitors , " Be ye not so stupid " and offers parameters for safe blogging : " Never write about work on the Internet unless your boss knows and sanctions the fact that you are writing about work on the Internet . "
Play a way .
Solitaire , that ever seductive way to while away the hours , is probably not a great choice for the workplace .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg caught sight of a solitaire game on a city employee 's computer screen in 2006 and fired him .
" I expect all city workers , including myself , to work hard , " Bloomberg said then .
Richard Bayer , an economist and chief operating officer of the Five O'Clock Club , an outplacement and career coaching organization , says employees who use a company computer for personal matters on company time — whether playing solitaire or checking on their 401 ( k ) 's — are essentially stealing from their employer .
" It 's a new , 21st - century form of theft , " Bayer says , adding that a couple of personal E - mails each day are within reason .
Look at pics .
Yes , those kind of pics .
Think about this :
Nearly one third of bosses have fired workers for misusing the Internet , according to a recent study by the American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute .
Eighty - four percent of those employers said the reason was the viewing , downloading , or uploading of inappropriate or offensive content .
The Washington , D.C. , city government recommended the termination of nine employees in January for allegedly looking at pornography sites at work .
The key here is privacy — as in , tell yourself you have none .
The computer system belongs to the company , and courts have consistently sided with employers when it comes to computer - related terminations , says Nancy Flynn , executive director of the ePolicy Institute .
Post your pics .
Social networking may quickly gain an air of formality .
The mayor of tiny Arlington , Ore. ( population nearly 500 ) , grabbed headlines recently after she was recalled by voters .
Among other issues , the residents were sharply divided over the propriety of photos of the mayor dressed in her underwear that were posted to her MySpace page .
Employers are beginning to monitor social networking sites , Flynn says .
Not only do companies fear employees posting proprietary information , but they also do n't want to find photos of the boss dancing on the table drunk at the holiday party .
Opinions posted that run contrary to company values can also get employees into trouble .
Write R-rated E-mails .
More than a quarter of employers have sent an employee packing for E- mail - related offenses , according to the American Management Association / ePolicy Institute survey , and 62 percent of those said it was for inappropriate or offensive language .
When you write , just assume that someone inside the company is reading it .
Most of the 43 percent of companies that monitor E - mail do it automatically , but 40 percent have live human beings reading and reviewing it .
ICELAND gives its citizens the best chance of a prosperous and fulfilled life according to the UN 's annual human development index .
This ranks 177 countries on measures of health , wealth and education .
Icelanders ' longevity has allowed the country to overhaul Norway and claim first place this year .
America , despite being wealthy , drops four places to 12th .
The bottom 24 countries are in sub-Saharan Africa .
Violence , poor governance and HIV / AIDS are mainly to blame .
Iraq and Afghanistan do not produce enough data to be included .
AFP
Oddly enough , this is n't the first time we 've seen product proudly designed in Cupertino erupt , but it 's pretty safe to say this story could have had a much more tragic ending .
Reportedly , an iPod nano owner recently awoke to a blaring fire alarm around 2:00 AM , only to find his beloved PMP wrapped in flames on the bedroom floor .
Thankfully , the fire was tiny enough to be extinguished without any major trouble , and no substantial damage of property or human flesh was tallied .
As of now , we 've no idea if the unit simply exploded or if surrounding circumstances are at least partly to blame , but you can bet your bottom dollar that be sleeping with one eye open ( and on our media players ) tonight .
[ Thanks , Sandy ]
Update :
The Acid3 test is now final , I ’ve updated the blog post to reflect this .
The new news on the block is that the upcoming Acid 3 test is in the oven , starting to get baked .
Traditionally , the Acid test has served as a way to get browser vendors in line by testing them on really - annoying edge cases .
This can , sometimes , get people tied up in knots but it actually serves as a devious way of getting people to meet a large part of a spec .
For example , in order for a browser to have some weird padding / margin test case solved – in CSS – they must also have a working box model .
So while an Acid test may not , explicitly , test for a working box model , it will be done implicitly ( by testing edge cases that result from it ) .
With that in mind , it ’s time to take a look at Acid 3 which primarily focuses on technology that I find to be interesting : ECMAScript and the DOM .
Let ’s dig in and see what exactly is being tested – specifically , relating to ECMAScript .
Array Elisions – Making sure that stuff like [ , , ] has a length of 2 and [ 0 , ,1 ] has a length of 3 .
– Making sure that stuff like has a length of 2 and has a length of 3 .
Array Methods – Doing an unshift with multiple arguments .unshift ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) , joining with an undefined argument . join ( undefined ) .
– Doing an unshift with multiple arguments , joining with an undefined argument .
Number Conversion – Banging against .toFixed ( ) , .toExponential ( ) , and .toPrecision ( ) – especially with decimals and negative numbers .
– Banging against , , and – especially with decimals and negative numbers .
String Operations – Negative indicies in substr . substr ( - 7 , 3 ) , character access by index " foo " [ 1 ] ( part of the ECMAScript 4 spec ) .
– Negative indicies in substr , character access by index ( part of the ECMAScript 4 spec ) .
Date – Making sure that certain method calls result in NaN results ( like d.setMilliseconds ( ) , with no arguments ) and also enforcing +1900 year offsets .
– Making sure that certain method calls result in NaN results ( like , with no arguments ) and also enforcing +1900 year offsets .
Unicode in Identifiers –
You ca n’t use escaped Unicode in identifiers , for example : eval ( " test.i\\u002b= 1 ; " ) ; ( that should throw an exception ) .
– You ca n’t use escaped Unicode in identifiers , for example : ( that should throw an exception ) .
Regular Expressions – /[ ]/ matches an empty set , / [ ] ) ] / should throw an exception , backreferences to non-existent captures , and negative lookaheads /(?! test ) ( test ) . exec ( " test test " ) .
– matches an empty set , should throw an exception , backreferences to non-existent captures , and negative lookaheads .
Enumeration – Make sure that object properties are enumerated in the correct order , make sure that you ’re able to enumerate properties of certain names ( toString , has OwnProperty , etc. ) .
– Make sure that object properties are enumerated in the correct order , make sure that you ’re able to enumerate properties of certain names ( toString , has OwnProperty , etc. ) .
Function Constructors –
The user should be able to set custom constructors on the .constructor property , .constructor should not be enumerable , and .prototype.constructor should be deletable .
– The user should be able to set custom constructors on the property , should not be enumerable , and should be deletable .
Function Expressions – ( function test ( ) { ... } ) ( ) ;
You should be able to call the function by name , within the function itself , you ca n’t directly overwrite the function name ( only with a function - scoped variable ) , and ‘ test ’ is n’t leaked into the parent scope .
– You should be able to call the function by name , within the function itself , you ca n’t directly overwrite the function name ( only with a function - scoped variable ) , and ‘ test ’ is n’t leaked into the parent scope .
Exception Scope – Variables within the catch ( ) {} should interact with the catch arguments primarily , followed by variables in an outer scope .
– Variables within the should interact with the catch arguments primarily , followed by variables in an outer scope .
Assignment Expressions – s = a.length = " 123 " ; – a.length has a return value of 123 ( the number ) which is assigned to ‘ s ’ , rather than the correct result of the string “ 123 ” .
– – a.length has a return value of 123 ( the number ) which is assigned to ‘ s ’ , rather than the correct result of the string “ 123 ” .
Encoding – encodeURI ( ) and encodeURIComponent ( ) must gracefully handle null bytes .
All - in - all it ’s a comprehensive smattering of weird ECMAScript edge cases – you ’re bound to find at least one that fails in your favorite browser - of - choice .
I ’m sure we ’ll see many more test cases coming in , in the upcoming days in weeks .
I ’m looking forward to seeing the final results – and the competitive heat that ’s been applied to CSS - spec implementors being applied to ECMAScript implementors .
For kicks , here ’s the current results in a bunch of major browsers ( including the correct reference rendering ) .
These are the preliminary results of the UNCOMPLETED Acid 3 test in UNCOMPLETED versions of major browsers – take with a grain of salt .
Go here to view the final version of this test .

Amadou Diouf , an immigrant from Senegal , says U.S. agents injected him with drugs against his will as he was about to be deported in February 2007 .
Raymond Soeoth , pictured here with his wife , will receive $ 5,000 and be allowed to stay in the U.S. for at least two years .
He and another immigrant who made similar claims sued the government , leading to a change in policy that sharply restricts the way such drugs are used against detainees .
Diouf , who came to the United States from Senegal to get a college education , said he went through something no immigrant should have to endure .
But in the end , he 's satisfied with the outcome .
" To the extent that whatever happened to me is not going to happen to other people , it was well worth it , " he told CNN by phone earlier this week .
Diouf spent nearly two years in detention for overstaying his student visa , and in late February 2007 was put on a plane for deportation .
Diouf said he had a federal stay of his deportation in his hand on the plane , but his U.S. government escorts did n't care .
See Diouf 's stay of deportation document
He was wrestled to the ground and injected through his clothes , he said .
At the time , the federal agents said they administered the drugs to sedate him because he would n't follow their orders , a claim Diouf denies .
" That was a horrible experience , " he said .
" That experience alone was worse than the two years that I stayed in detention . "
Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached a settlement with Diouf and Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia on Monday .
As part of the agreement , Diouf will receive $ 50,000 ; Soeoth gets $ 5,000 and will be allowed to stay in the United States for at least two more years .
Just last month , ICE changed its policy and in the future must seek a court order for authority to administer drugs to people being deported .
Soeoth 's medical records indicate one of the drugs used on him was called Haldol -- which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses -- although he had no history of mental illness .
It 's not clear what drug was injected into Diouf .
The government did not admit wrongdoing or apologize in its settlement .
Drug Facts 
Haldol is a drug used to treat psychotic disorders and symptoms such as hallucinations , delusions and hostility " to control muscular tics of the face , neck , hands and shoulders "
 Side effects of the drug can include seizures , tremors , irregular heartbeat , difficulty breathing and other symptoms
Source : National Institutes of Health
" The settlement does not constitute an admission of any wrongdoing or liability by the government , " ICE spokeswoman Lori Haley told CNN .
" We agreed to settle the litigation because the agency believes that the resulting agreement is in the best interest of the government . "
She added that the settlement and new policy underscores " our commitment to maintaining safe , secure and humane conditions for those in our custody . "
Ahilan Arulanantham , an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who represented Diouf and Soeoth , called the settlement a " tremendous victory . "
" What happened here is really awful by any measure , " he said in a telephone interview .
" Here we have routine immigration cases -- people with no sense of danger , no violent pasts or anything -- and the government was actually forcibly drugging them .
And that 's really awful . "
The government has previously acknowledged that 56 people facing deportation received psychotropic medications in 2006 and 2007 .
" Now , they 're not going to do that .
We 're very , very happy about that , " Arulanantham said .
Although the government did n't admit wrongdoing in this case , Arulanantham said the settlement and new policy are about as close to an apology as one can get .
John Torres , the director of ICE 's detention and removal operations office , said in a government memo dated January 9 that the new policy on forcible injections means agents can no longer request a medical escort to " administer involuntary sedation to facilitate an alien 's removal " unless the government first obtains a court order .
" There are no exceptions .
Emergency or exigent circumstances are not grounds for departures from this policy , " he said in the memo .
Diouf had attended California State University , Northridge , and later married a U.S. citizen .
He was detained on March 29 , 2005 , for overstaying a student visa .
Diouf , whose deportation to Senegal is on appeal , said his perception about America as a great country has not changed despite what happened .
" I do want to stay , " he said .
Soeoth , a Christian minister from Indonesia , and his wife recently lost their immigration appeal and were within days of being deported when the settlement was reached .
He and his wife are still seeking political asylum .
" If we do n't have the opportunity to stay in the U.S. , this gives us time to find another country that will take us , " he said in a written statement .
" From the first time we talked about filing this case , we did n't want other people to have to go through the same experience .
I feel like we won because the government changed its policy . "

The Obama campaign is unique in the amount of energy and innovation that it has spawned on the web : people like Farouk Olu Aregbe and Tamer Abouzeid who changed the way people think about the Facebook ; Meredith Segal , who in 2006 founded the Facebook group that was to become the official student wing of Obama 's campaign ; citizen ad creators like lovingj ; independent bloggers like sage
reader of Think on These Things ; assorted Kossacks and MyDD diarists ; and , yes , Phillip de Vellis and Joe Anthony .
But until now , all of these independent efforts have lacked a central meeting place .
There has n't been a central blogroll or a place to recognize those efforts .
Sponsored by and affiliated with the Facebook group One Million Strong for Barack , One Million Strong was founded with three main goals in mind :
1 . To serve as a gathering place for Obama supporters in the blogosphere .
2 . To bridge the gap between the blogosphere and the energy for Obama on the Facebook .
3 . To provide a forum for discussion of progressive policy , politics , and activism .
Mapping the Obama Blogosphere
While there have been some previous efforts to set up blogrolls , we 'd like to develop the most thorough and engaging --- the most useful --- blogroll of active Obama supporter blogs on the web .
I will also be doing regular round - ups of news and commentary on Obama 's campaign around the blogosphere .
More than that , I hope to review and profile various bloggers and online grassroots efforts .
We have hired a Salesforce expert to help us to manage our interaction with current and future interested parties .
We figured if businesses flock to this cloud based platform to increase their users productivity , improve data quality , and automate manual processes , while also being able to adapt quickly to a company 's or organization 's changing requirements , why not us .
Our expert is also able to customize Salesforce crm apps to our specific needs as well as offer well - developed , integrated cloud - computing applications .
Any customization is easy to scale and maintain on the Force.com platform using Salesforce as the engine .
So as we grow our Salesforce org will scale and adapt appropriately .
We feel we are in good hands as far as the IT aspect is concerned .
If there are active blogs that we 've missed , please feel free to add a comment in this thread or to send us an email at admin@onemillionstrong.us .
Feel free , of course , to cross post your blog entries here in the diaries .
Let others know what you 're working on .
Make yourself at home .
Help Us Be Helpful
Lastly , this is meant to be a community resource .
That means that if you have any suggestions about additional features , about our mission or about the direction of this blog , please feel free to leave your comments .
We want to know how we can be more helpful .
Second , however , that also means that there is a communal responsibility to keep the discussion threads clean and respectful , to be just and responsible in our criticism of other candidates .
Excessive bashing of Obama or the Democratic Party will not be tolerated .
Anyway , welcome to One Million Strong !
Let me know if you have any questions .

Voting was smooth in my area of Arlington Heights ( IL ) but it has been so for the last 12 years at least .
Today , no more than a 30 minute wait ( but others have seen as long as 1 hr , 20 min. at our location ) .
I really hope Dan Seals can ride Obama 's coattails into office .
We 'll post another open thread tonight for results , but meanwhile , how is it going for you today ?
Here is what the Obama 's have been doing this morning .
I wonder why they look so happy ?
Or maybe one of them said something humorous just before the snap .
What web resources are you looking at tonight to watch the results ?
I 'm using greenpaper 's poll close times along with this great graphic from the Swing State Project based on Green Papers data .
Other than that I 'm following Nate 's projections and Al 's projections and DemConWatch .
I think all of these websites have been among the best through this election .
Not having cable TV , I might have PBS on if Brooks and Shields do n't hog too much of the time .

Studs Terkel Will be Missed
by : jlarson
Sat Nov 01 , 2008 at 04:49:26 AM
CDT
At age 96 , Studs Terkel died on Friday .
He became a national treasure and an icon of Chicago by chronicling the lives and struggles of regular folks .
He was a distinctly skilled interviewer .
He was a listener .
Many remember his WFMT radio show after which he signed off with his Woody Guthrie inspired line , " Take it easy , but take it . "
I last saw him in person at a Chicago anti-invasion protest in October 2002 .
He was sharp and feisty as he commented on Bush 's distinct lack of wisdom about invading Iraq .
He spoke about how when George Bush prayed to God , God responded , " George , you 're a dull boy ! " .
He praised the people there for using their minds and not following the hysteria .
At the same rally people heard a speech from a Chicago politician with a lot of B's and A's in his name .
We will miss Stud 's commentary on the election if that politician wins on Tuesday .
Studs spoke at more than one of these rallies and similar content to what I heard is available here :
I think this is my favorite Studes Terkel story , from an interview last year :
" I 'm known around the block as a writer and broadcaster , " Terkel tells me , " but also as that old guy who talks to himself .
I never learnt to drive .
Why should I have ?
The bus was there .
So one day I 'm on the corner alone , waiting for the 146 .
I 'm talking to myself , finding the audience very appreciative .
Then other people arrive ; I talk to them too .
This one couple ignore me completely .
He 's wearing Gucci shoes and carrying The Wall Street Journal .
She 's a looker .
Neiman Marcus clothes .
Vanity Fair under her arm .
So I told them , ' Tomorrow is Labor Day : the holiday to ' honour the unions . '
The guy gives me the kind of look Noël Coward might have given a bug on his sleeve .
' We despise unions . '
I fix him with my glittering eye , like the Ancient Mariner , and I ask , ' How many hours do you work a day ? '
He tells me eight .
' How come you do n't work 18 hours a day , like your great - grandparents ? '

How come you do n't work six and a half ?'
He is n't sure .

I tell him about that massacre of workers , in Chicago , in 1937 .
He 's never heard of these things before .

I feel great .
Things are looking great for the first time in a long time .
The polls have never looked better ( up in Florida ? ! ) .
The voter registration numbers are off the hook .
Sarah Palin looks destined for disaster in tomorrow 's debate .
With every upward tick in a tracking poll , with every superb performance by Barack in a Presidential debate , my confidence in the inevitability of 2008 grows .
But what really is inevitable ?
This is inevitable .
Yep .
Sure , the polls may look good right now , it might seem like we are winning the message war , but that only adds to my apprehension .
Can any Democrat feel confident .
Remember the first debate in 2004 , the most one - sided debate in American history ?
Nukeular anyone ?
The stumbles by McCain and Palin might seem almost comedic , day by day piling on top of each other .
But there are still five weeks until election day , and that 's a damn long time .
Too long for anything to really be inevitable .
Well , except maybe for this .

McCain , Deregulation and the Economy : The Bottom Line

by psericks
I just watched all the Sunday morning talk shows and one overriding theme emerged .
Nearly everyone , Democrat or Republican , that got up and talked about our current economic crisis largely blamed the lack of oversight and regulation .
Let me repeat that .
The emerging consensus is that a lack of meaningful oversight and regulation over the financial services and mortgage industries is now causing us to socialize both industries and put at risk at least $ 1 trillion of taxpayer money to bail it out .
In light of this , the choice for President in this coming election has now become absolutely and unarguably clear .
McCain has spent his nearly three decades in Washington being aided and abetted by Phil Gramm and his cronies in push through every possible measure to keep the financial and mortgage industries from being subject to meaningful oversight and regulation .
This is how the New York Times describes John McCain 's economic regulation pedigree :
[ McCain 's ] record … suggest [s ] that he has never departed in any major way from his party ’s embrace of deregulation ...
[ H ]e has consistently characterized himself as fundamentally a deregulator [ yet ] he has no history prior to the presidential campaign of advocating steps to tighten standards on investment firms .
McCain has always been in his party ’s mainstream on the [ economic ] issue .
In early 1995 … McCain promoted a moratorium on federal regulations of all kinds .
' I ’m always for less regulation , ' he told The Wall Street Journal last March … .
' I am fundamentally a deregulator . '
The bottom line : John McCain 's loving embrace of the fundamental Republican dogma of " deregulation , deregulation , deregulation " has caused the worst financial crisis in American history since the Great Depression .
John McCain , Phil Gramm and their Republican cohorts got us into this mess .
It would be , at this point in history , absolutely and profoundly wrong for the American people to reward John McCain 's failure by electing him to lead the world 's biggest economy .
Period .
There is no more room for debate .
None .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Four people have been indicted on arson charges in a fire that damaged a Michigan State University building , a 1999 blaze for which environmental activists claimed responsibility , officials said on Tuesday .
“ This was a significant act of domestic terrorism which caused more than a million dollars in damage to facilities and loss of research records , ” the university ’s police chief , James Dunlap , said in a report issued by the school .
The 1999 fire at Agriculture Hall damaged the office of the Agriculture Biotechnology Support Project , which the school said works to promote agricultural biotechnology in developing countries .
“ Shortly after the fire a loosely organized environmental movement called the Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility , ” the announcement said .
The shadowy band of radical environmental activists has been blamed for several arsons in the U.S. Pacific Northwest in recent years and designated by the FBI as “ eco-terrorists . ”
Indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of arson , aggravated arson , and conspiracy to commit arson were Marie Mason , 46 , of Cincinnati ; Frank Ambrose , 33 , Aren Burthwick , 27 , and Stephanie Fultz , 27 , all of Detroit , the FBI said .
Earlier this month , a hand - painted sign with the group ’s initials was posted near a fire that destroyed three luxury homes in a Seattle suburb , which the sign denounced as “ McMansions , ” a derisive term for large homes often in rural developments .
Audio Clip from The Alex Jones Show
Paul Joseph Watson , Prison Planet — American icon Willie Nelson says he supports efforts to impeach President Bush and “ throw the bastards out , ” adding that the administration will do anything to stay in power , including staging an event to cancel the election .
In his second appearance this month , Nelson told The Alex Jones Show today that he supported Dennis Kucinich ’s attempt to impeach Bush , adding , “ If you break the law you have to pay for it one way or another and if these guys have n’t broke the law nobody has . ”
“ The deck ’s been stacked and we need to figure out a way to get a new fresh deck in there in the deal and I do n’t know how else to do it except throw the bastards out , ” said Nelson .
But the award winning star of stage and screen was quick to clarify that he did n’t see the Democrats as any kind of viable alternative .
“ We went through a couple of elections now and we did n’t do anything , we thought we did but come to find out that the voting machines are crooked , everything ’s stacked against us , the politicians that we vote for wo n’t stay and fight and they wo n’t count the votes . ”

If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , ( i.e. , the " business cycle " ) the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake - up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
Thomas Jefferson , President of the United States 1801 - 1809
If Thomas Jefferson were running for the US presidency and spoke the words he uttered two centuries ago , he would be marginalized by today�s press just as Ron Paul has been marginalized in his campaign for the US presidency .
Today , private bankers control not only the issuance of money in America , but the corporations [ that will grow up around the bankers ] control what Americans see , read , and hear because of their influence in the media .
The clear and present dangers Jefferson warned about two centuries ago are now clearly present .
America threw off the yoke of British dominion in 1776 only to institute the very form of that dominion in 1913 when US banking and corporate interests �the same forces Jefferson warned about �recreated the British credit - based banking system in the US in the form of the Federal Reserve Bank�a system whereby private bankers control the issuance of the public currency ; and , just as Jefferson had warned , America�s freedoms are now at risk .
I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
Thomas Jefferson , 1816 In 1913 , Woodrow Wilson was President of the US when the Federal Reserve Act was signed into law .
Too late , Wilson recognized the damage he had done ; and his own words haunt us today as it is now clear what his approval of the Federal Reserve Act set in motion :
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit .
Our system of credit is privately concentrated .
The growth of the nation , therefore , and all our activities are in the hands of a few men ... We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated , governments in the civilized world �no longer a government by free opinion , no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority , but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men ..
Today , Americans are looking to the Fed to protect them against the financial chaos threatening our economy .
This is tantamount to the Jews in 1930s Germany looking to the Nazis to stave off a possible holocaust .
The Fed cannot help America with its economic problems because the Fed is itself the cause of those problems .
While it is understandable that slaves would look to their masters to save them , it is futile to believe they will do so when their masters � only concern is to save themselves .
A PRIMER ON JEFFERSON �S WARNING
In capital credit - based systems , credit is fed into the economy in a process whereby producers and savers are indebted and bankers are enriched .
Because credit is an integral part of capital systems , as the economy expands the debt and the interest it produces benefits bankers .
The debt and the compounding interest on that debt in turn enslaves producers and savers .
Like parasites , bankers cannot exist without producers and savers .
In capital credit - based systems , producers and savers cannot exist without bankers .
In savings - based systems where gold and silver are money as was the US prior to 1913 , producers and savers can and do prosper without central bank credit and debt .
Over time , in capital credit - based systems , producers and savers become so indebted that the economy is no longer able to service and retire previously created debt .
This is where the US economy is today .
Homeowners cannot pay their mortgages , consumers cannot pay their credit cards , and governments cannot pay their obligations without issuing even more obligations .
The banker�s credit money system is now everywhere as are their resultant unsustainable debts ; and those who profit by that system , the bankers [ and the corporations that grew up around them ] now control the media , the political process , and the agencies charged with overseeing and regulating the economy �the US Federal Reserve Bank , the SEC , the US Treasury , and indeed the US government itself : the Presidency , the Congress , and the Supreme Court .
THE US GOVERNMENT , SUSAN WONES , & JP MORGAN CHASE Susan Wones is one of many millions of Americans with credit cards .
James Dimon is the chairman and CEO of Wall Street bank JP Morgan Chase which issued a credit card to Susan Wones at 0 % interest .
Then , one month later Mr. Dimon�s bank JP Morgan Chase suddenly and without explanation raised the interest rates on Ms. Wones credit card to 23 % .
Last week , Ms. Wones traveled from Denver to Washington DC where she and other upset credit card users were to testify before Congress about how they had been treated by the banks that issued their credit cards .
But when they reached Washington DC , Ms. Wones and the others were told the Republicans would not let them testify unless they first agreed to allow the banks to discuss their personal financial history in any forum at any time .
Not willing to have their privacy rights invaded , Susan Wones and the majority of the witnesses chose to not testify .
As a consequence , Americans never heard about how Susan Wones� bank , JP Morgan Chase , had without notice or explanation raised her interest rate on her credit card to usurious levels .
Instead they heard the media recount how JP Morgan Chase had bought Bear Stearns investment bank at the urging of the US Fed , a purchase underwritten and guaranteed up to $ 30 billion by American taxpayers such as Susan Wones .
What happened to Susan Wones and the others who had traveled to Washington DC was a victory for the credit card companies , the banks ( JP Morgan Chase in particular ) , their lobbyists and the Washington DC power structure .
It was , however , a loss for the American people .
But it was a loss in a war Americans have been losing since 1913 , the year when private bankers took control of a once free nation and its once free markets .
The prediction of Thomas Jefferson has come true .
The bankers sold us credit By catering to our dreams
Then they sold us debts
With promised income streams
But then they raised our interest rates
And our debts could not be paid
We found too late �twas sex they�d sold And us the bankers had laid YESTERDAY TODAY & TOMORROW
Last year , I wrote an article predicting an economic crisis would happen in the summer of 2007 .
The following is excerpted from Subprime America Infects Asia And Europe posted May 5 , 2007 .
http://www.drschoon.com/articles%5CSubprimeAmericaInfectsAsiaandEurope.pdf
�
Thailand �s economy went into apoplectic shock and its currency and stock market fell by 50 % in 1997 when international currency flows suddenly changed direction .
America may soon be in for the same .
And if America falters and falls , the consequences of such will be felt around the world .
Today , afternoon tea and scotch flow freely in The City as does dim sum in Hong Kong and Shanghai and sushi in Tokyo around their respective bourses .
Soon , however , the risks that have lain dormant beneath globalization�s foundation are about to erupt and a reordering of the world�s financial geography is about to ensue .
It �s spring 2007 and the sun is shining in the US , backyard BBQs are being cleaned in anticipation of summer�s use .
A severe financial crisis , however , is in the offing ; a crisis as unexpected as the Golden State Warriors � last minute streak to the NBA playoffs .
An unexpected financial crisis , however , will be much more consequential than Don Nelson�s magical resurrection of the Warriors � NBA hopes .
There , at least , the Warriors will have a fighting chance .
But because most people don�t know a financial crisis is in progress , they will have little chance of survival .
This summer , America �s subprime CDOs are coming home to roost , and not just to the US .
The financial crisis I predicted happened in August 2007 and is now gaining momentum .
Central bankers in Europe , Asia , and America have made available billions of dollars in credit in a failed attempt to restart a stalled and faltering global economy .
The central bankers have only succeeding in delaying the coming day of reckoning they themselves set in motion .
Credit leads to debt as well as to expansion and today the expansion has slowed but the debts have compounded .
Central banks are the very institution that Thomas Jefferson warned about .
Their role in today�s problems is misunderstood , an error as fatal as in misdiagnosing a growing cancer .
Americans and indeed the world are looking to central banks to stabilize world markets .
But central banks won�t and can�t because central banks are themselves the destabilizing force that first issued the credit that has now becoming the defaulting debt that can�t be traded .
Central banks are the mechanism by which private bankers create the credit that turns into debt , debt that US homeowners , US consumers , and the US government can�t afford to repay ; and the global banks , pension funds , and insurance companies that bought those debts for their expected income streams are now becoming stuck with IOUs / sic investments as worthless as today�s subprime CDOs .
The international currency flows I referred to in my article Subprime America Infects Asia And Europe will be affected by the inability of US consumers to pay back debts now bundled as investments that are now in the portfolios of banks , pension funds , and insurance companies .
And when international currency flows turn away from America , the spigot of credit which allowed and encouraged Americans to live beyond their means will be turned off .
The consequences of such will be felt first in America and then in the world , a world which has come to depend on the credit - driven consumption of the US for its profits .
THE COLLAPSING US ECONOMY AND THE RISING PRICE OF GOLD
One year ago on March 21 , 2007 , gold was at $ 660 .
Today , the price of gold is $ 919 .
Gold has not seen its top nor has the US economy yet seen its bottom .
Both gold and the US economy are currently in a correction .
The difference is gold�s correction will last days and the economy�s correction will continue for years .
When the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 , in 2001 /2002 the Fed cut interest rates in a similar attempt to restart a slowing economy .
They succeeded but in so doing created an even greater bubble , the largest residential and commercial property bubble in history .
Now that the property bubble is deflating and the economy again slowing , once again the Fed is lowering interest rates as it attempts to restart the economy .
But this time as it pours liquidity and even more credit into world markets , the consequences will be far greater and far more dangerous than even the property bubble it inadvertently set in motion in 2002 - 2006 .
The trick bag of central bankers is almost empty as they relentlessly pursue the only avenue kreditmeisters have at their disposal , issuing more credit .
But this time , instead of a property bubble , the kreditmeisters are running the very real risk of igniting the greatest danger of all �hyperinflation , a hyperinflation which will result in the complete destruction of the US dollar �and if gold went to $ 850 an ounce in 1980 when inflation reached 13.91 % , the price of gold will go through the roof if and when inflation turns into its most feared offspring , hyperinflation � the United States has experienced high rates of inflation in the past and appears to be running the same type of fiscal policies that engendered hyperinflations in 20 countries over the past century .
Laurance Kotlikoff , Federal Reserve Bank Review St Louis July / Aug 2006 RISK ANALYSIS REDUX
The dangers Thomas Jefferson warned about are upon us .
Bankers and corporations control America�s finances ; the US Treasury is their bank , their credit money is now our debts and , as a consequence , the fate of the US is sealed .
We are but a shadow of the magnificent nation we once were .
Our patrimony spent , our liberties reduced to sound bites and echoes of once tangible rights , America stands today on the bankers � gallows of debt , waiting for the bottom to give way as it someday will .
We can do no better than to repeat and reread the words of US President Woodrow Wilson who signed the despicable Federal Reserve Act into law .
Those words were uttered and written almost one century ago .
His words were true then ; they are even truer today .
We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated , governments in the civilized world �no longer a government by free opinion , no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority , but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men ..
Woodrow Wilson , President of the United States 1913 - 1921 Today , we are no more able to stop the bankers and corporations in their continuing shake - down of America than the Nazis could be stopped in 1930s Germany .
History is being played out in America as it was then in Germany .
But times change and America will change in the future as Germany changed in the past .
Tomorrow will bring a better day .
But until then , we can only persist and pray [ and buy gold ] until the bankers and corporations finish destroying and consuming what remains of the once great nation known as America .

Track your mileage :
You can't tell if your efficiency efforts are working unless you 're keeping track .
Try resetting the odometer every time you refill your tank , rather than trying to note and guess mileages individually .

Ah , is n't love grand ?
In this world of unending ladies room bathroom lines and overpriced shoes , the Rage immensely appreciates that men spend twice as much as ladies on Valentine 's Day .
Sure , it 's not fair and we women want our equality .
But in this instance , we 'll take off our sensible , feminist shoes and do a barefoot jig .
According to the National Retail Federation , the average male drops about $ 135 on V - Day , while women spend about $ 68 .
Where does the money go ?
Here 's the breakdown :
62 % purchase one greeting card .
And that will buy you exactly one kiss on the cheek .
47.1 % purchase candy .
Expect tongue if truffles are involved .
42.1 % blow the bank on an evening out .
If the Champagne flows , you may get lucky .
But wait .
There 's even more evidence that the onus of Valentine 's Day falls entirely on dudes .
The Society of American Florists reports that of the 180 million roses sold , 74 % are bought by men .
Jewelry is bought by 22.5 % of men and just 7.3 % of women .
Twice as many women than men plan to buy clothes as pesents .
And that means men can expect button down shirts and ties .
But here are the best results ever .
What do men want ?
According to a survey by BizRate Research , dudes are begging for :
54 % : Romantic dinner -- 14 % : Tools -- 14 % : Massage / Spa treatment -- 4 % : Day with buddies -- 3 % : Hunting trip .
( Who would n't want to slay deer on Valentine 's Day ?
That 's brilliant . )
Women want :
60 % : Card -- 58 % : Romantic dinner -- 51 % : Flowers -- 40 % : Jewelry -- 25 % : Massage / Spa treatment .
How much are you spending today ?
Should women spend as much as men ?
Does Valentine 's
Day just suck all around ?

Israel to brief Bush on options for Iran strike during visit John Byrne
Published : Monday January 7 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email
This Israel still does n't have ' smoking gun '
In the midst of a highly competitive US presidential race , events occurring in the Middle East are threatening to take center stage .
As CNN reported Monday , a US Navy vessel was given orders to fire on an Iranian ship which purportedly threatened to " explode " it and was dropping white boxes in the water .
Meanwhile , a little noticed report in the UK press gives new fears to those who believe the US is still considering mounting an attack on Iran .
Israel security officials are set to brief President Bush on their " Iran file " regarding the country 's alleged nuclear weapons program " and how it could be destroyed - when he begins a tour of the Middle East in Jerusalem this week , " the UK Times Uzi Mahnaimi reported Sunday .
" Ehud Barak , the defence minister , is said to want to convince him that an Israeli military strike against uranium enrichment facilities in Iran would be feasible if diplomatic efforts failed to halt nuclear operations , " the paper added .
" A range of military options has been prepared . "
Despite a US National Intelligence Estimate last month which asserted that Iran abandoned a secret nuclear weapons program in 2003 , Israel believes the program has been restarted .
Still , the evidence largely matches the US estimate .
Today , an Israeli news service reported that Israel " does not have any evidence which could turn the tables on a recent US intelligence report which concluded that Iran has stopped developing nuclear weapons . "
A secret cabinet discussion at the " Prime Minister 's Office [ yesterday ] was aimed at examining whether Israel had different evidence than the Americans , " YNetNews reported .
During the discussion it was made clear that more than 90 % of the intelligence information possessed by Israel was identical to the information presented to the American president .
" Nonetheless , the additional information does not confirm that Tehran resumed its secret activity to create military nuclear capabilities after 2003 , " the publication added .
" Although the Israeli information points to suspicions that this is in fact Iran 's intention , its does not contain enough evidence which will allow Bush to return to Washington with information which will lead to firm action by the international community . "
" While security officials are reluctant to reveal all their intelligence , fearing that leaks could jeopardise [ sic ] the element of surprise in any future attack , they are expected to present the president with fresh details of Irans enrichment of uranium - which could be used for civil or military purposes - and the development of missiles that could carry nuclear warheads , " Mahnaimi wrote .
He added , " In an interview with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot this weekend , Bush argued that in spite of the US intelligence assessment , Iran still posed a threat . "
Israeli president says war unlikely
Two weeks ago , however , Israeli President Shimon Peres said he did not believe a war with Iran would be necessary but called for the end of the current government in Tehran .
Peres told the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was dangerous for Israel and the region but that other means could be used to contain the threat .
" I do not think that a war with Iran is necessary , " he said when asked if he supported a military strike against the country .
" Ahmadinejad can be deposed by other means .
Sanctions have revealed themselves to be a very effective instrument .
Sanctions , not war , did away with North Korea 's nuclear weapons . "
He said he did not believe the Iranian people wanted to destroy Israel or develop nuclear arms .
" The majority is not ready to trade Allah and Mohammed for enriched uranium .
Those that , like Iran , threaten the future of humanity have no future themselves .
We will survive Ahmadinejad . "

Mr Chertoff said the system has already helped catch smugglers
The $ 20 m ' virtual fence ' already covers 28 miles ( 48 km ) of the border between Arizona state and Mexico .
The system has already helped catch smugglers , and would be deployed elsewhere , said US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff .
But he said plans to complete 770 miles ( 1,130 km ) of physical fence remain .
" I have personally witnessed the value of this system , " said Mr Chertoff .
" I have spoken directly to the border patrol agents ... who have seen it produce actual results in terms of identifying and allowing the apprehension of people who are illegally smuggling across the border . "
Unmanned towers
Built by Boeing , the virtual fence is part of a strategy to stop illegal immigrants as well as drug - smugglers attempt to pass into the US on foot or in vehicles .
Its technology - including 100 - ft ( 30 - metre ) unmanned surveillance towers equipped with sophisticated sensor devices - is capable of distinguishing people from cattle at a distance of about 10 miles ( 16 km ) .
The virtual fence targets illegal immigrants and drug smugglers
The system 's cameras and radars are powerful enough to determine whether people are carrying backpacks that may contain weapons or drugs .
The US government plans to extend the technology to other areas of the Arizona border , as well as sections of Texas , possibly within months .
In a televised debate in Texas on Thursday , both Democratic party presidential candidates , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , said high - technology surveillance could lessen the need for a physical barrier .
A highly charged political issue , immigration has been at the forefront of this year 's presidential campaign .
Plans for the physical barrier covering about a third of the US - Mexico border have drawn fierce criticism .
Trolltech recently released many smartphone developers ' dream combination — the Linux - based Greenphone and its open - source Qtopia Phone SDK .
The Trolltech Greenphone is a full - featured tri-band GSM ( 900/1800/1900 M
Hz ) mobile phone with a built - in 1.3 megapixel camera .
Like many other modern smartphones , it features a QVGA touchscreen , Bluetooth , client USB , mini-SD Flash and stereo audio connectors .
Under the hood , it is built around a Marvell 312MHz PXA270 ( ARM ) processor , runs with 64 M of RAM , and has 128 M of built - in Flash storage .
It also uses the same field - proven Broadcom BCM2121 GSM / GPRS baseband processor module as the Palm Treo .
The Greenphone almost could be described as a sporty , Linux version of the Palm Treo .
It is much lighter , more compact and comes in any color you want — as long as it's green !
Introducing the Qtopia Greenphone SDK
The Greenphone SDK is a distribution of Qtopia Phone Edition , specially configured for use on the Greenphone .
Qtopia ( formerly Qt Embedded ) inherits its API from Trolltech 's flagship product Qt , a mature C++ application framework available for Linux / X11 , Windows and Mac OS X. Qtopia is specifically enhanced for embedded Linux devices , such as phones , PDAs and appliances .
Qtopia is remarkably self - sufficient — sitting immediately on top of the base operating system , it provides its own font and image rendering , window management and input processing .
Along with this sort of behind - the - scenes stuff , Qtopia avails itself of all the rich features of Qt 's standardized access to files , networking , multithreading , internationalization , graphics processing and , of course , GUI widgets .
Like its big brother , Qtopia is readily available either as a free download to those wanting to do GPL - style open - source development or by commercial license purchased from Trolltech .
Qtopia also bundles a suite of personal information management tools as would be expected on any PDA or smartphone .
Inside the Box When you open the Greenphone 's box , you find everything needed to start developing : mobile handset , power supply , USB cable , stereo headset and a Greenphone SDK CD - ROM .
This last item contains a copy of the VMware player and a virtual machine preloaded with Debian Linux , Qt , Qtopia , KDevelop , native development tools and a complete ARM cross-compiling toolchain .
Figure 1 . Greenphone Package Contents
The only other item needed actually to go on air with your newly created applications is a GSM subscriber identity module ( SIM ) card with a currently active account .
What Is GSM ?
The two most widely used standards for cellular communications are GSM and CDMA , with GSM outnumbering CDMA worldwide by a ratio of about 1 billion to 270 million users .
Although they are as completely incompatible on each other 's networks as AM and FM radio , a normal user typically would notice only that phone accounts on GSM phones are usually tied to the SIM card , so changing handsets is really easy .
GSM currently stands for Global System for Mobile communications .
It is an open standard governed by the nonprofit European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( ETSI ) .
GSM allows great interoperability permitting easier international roaming .
GSM 's other claims to fame are higher digital voice quality ; a cheap short messaging service ( SMS ) ; multimedia messaging service ( MMS ) for exchanging images , audio , video and rich - text data ; and finally , a general packet radio service ( GPRS ) , often used as an Internet gateway , with billing based on megabytes of data transferred , as opposed to time spent on - line .
The Greenphone actually is based on two ARM RISC processors : a beefy Marvell 312MHz PXA270 acts as the PDA part and communicates to the ARM7 - based GSM / GPRS communications controller .
This controller is effectively the heart and brain of the phone component .
It also acts like a modem and accepts GSM AT - style commands to dial , answer calls , send or receive messages , and other activities typical of a GSM / GPRS communications device .
Standard GSM modem AT commands can be sent to the phone , which execute and then return a response code .
These AT commands are analogous to the decades - old Hayes modem commands , but instead of user using or programming a string like “ +++ ATDT16505511676 ” to dial Trolltech 's number 1-( 650 ) 551-1676 , we do the same sort of thing with the GSM version of the command set , and the string looks more like “ ATD16505511676 ” .
There are myriad other AT commands for handling everything that the GSM / GPRS phone unit can do .
These include setting up the phone and establishing various types of communication , such as voice calls , SMS and MMS , and they can be used for getting information on signal strength , network status and so forth .
For a comprehensive description of these standardized commands , you can download the following documents from the ETSI site : ETSI TS 127 007 V3.13.0 ( 2003-03 ) , AT Command Set for 3G User Equipment ( UE ) : webapp.etsi.org/exchangefolder/ts_127007v031300p.pdf
ETSI TS 127 005 V7.0.0 ( 2007-03 ) , Data Circuit Terminating Equipment ( DTE - DCE )
Interface for Short Message Service ( SMS ) and Cell Broadcast Service ( CBS ) : webapp.etsi.org/exchangefolder/ts_127005v070000p.pdf
Qtopia embeds the most commonly used of these commands into C++ class wrappers .
The on - line documentation in Qt Assistant describes how to use and enhance these classes in the sections titled “ GSM Modem Integration ” and “ Modem Emulator ” .
For testing applications off - line , the Greenphone SDK provides a modem emulator that allows testing software without having actually to join a network and go on air .
Gnokii
For an excellent example of a Linux program using GSM AT command codes , check out Gnokii — it 's a great tool for learning about GSM modems , as you actually can watch each transaction with the data sent and received to execute commands to dial the phone , send SMS messages and so on .
It works well with most modern phones that have a serial or USB data connector .
By the time this article is printed , it might already be running natively on the Greenphone .
For complete details , visit www.gnokii.org.
Getting Ready Loading the development environment is simple — run the installation program on Windows or Linux , respond affirmatively to the prompts , and within a minute you will have VMware and the SDK tools , application sources , documentation and binaries installed with an icon on your desktop to start things up .
This makes life really easy for reluctant developers using MS Windows to get into both embedded and desktop Linux and Qt application development .
At the time of this writing , developers using the x86 version of Macintosh OS X can use the Greenphone SDK under VMware Fusion , but they need to copy over the virtual machine 's files from another installation ; however , this may change by the time this article is published .
Tip :
One technique for VM - based cross- platform development is to export your display from the Linux VM to your host machine running an X11 server .
This might be the built - in X11 server running locally on your Linux host , Apple 's optional add - on to OS X or even Cygwin on a Windows machine .
I use screens rotated 90° to allow reading many more lines of code without scrolling , so this trick helps to leave the VM configurations as generic as possible .
GUI performance typically is enhanced when the X server is run on the host machine due to the lowest level rendering being shoved off as far down the pipeline as possible — often at the display adapter 's GPU .
Using this method , it can almost make Windows and OS X feel like a Linux box .
Getting Started Building Applications
Trolltech always ships its products with copious documentation and example code demonstrating all common features , and the Greenphone SDK is no exception .
For starters , the “ Developer Quickstart Guide ” shows what needs to be done to build an application with a few one - liners .
First , we start the Qtopia emulator using the Qt Virtual Frame Buffer and a Greenphone skin by clicking on the runqvfb icon on our desktop .
This is analogous to an X server for Qtopia , and it provides an exact pixel - for - pixel representation of the program running on the phone .
Then , we start the Qtopia phone environment by clicking the runqpe icon , which then connects to the qvfb process and displays its contents in its virtual screen .
Figure 2 . qvfb Running with qpe Running in It We need to run a script to set our QPEVER and PATH environment variables and to define some functions for communicating to the phone .
If building for the x86 version of Qtopia , we would use : .
/opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/devel-x86.sh
Otherwise , if building for the actual Greenphone itself , we would choose the cross - compile environment with : .
/opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/devel-greenphone.sh
Then , we change to our directories and build : cd ~/ projects / application qtopiamake - project && qtopiamake && make && gph -p - i
The qtopiamake program is Qtopia 's version of the Qt qmake utility .
It can generate a .
PRO project file based on the contents of the current directory if given the - project parameter , but its most important job is to use the project file as the starting point to generate a Makefile based on the installed configuration of Qtopia and the type of build we want .
Note :
It might be worthwhile to point out that the commands depicted here are separated by a double ampersand ( && ) to cause execution of the command string to stop at the first point where it meets an error .
In this case , it would stop the shell from trying to execute or install a program that had failed to build .
Typically , we generate a new .
PRO and Makefile only when we have new files to add to our project , but qtopiamake takes so little time to execute that it is common to see it run from a standard shell script every time .
gph Utility
The gph utility is a useful awk script that provides convenience functions for doing things like building , packaging , installing and running applications in the Qtopia environment , either emulated or actually on the phone .
It can be invoked instead of make , and it is powerful enough that we can use it to convert from raw source code to running applications installed from a package onto a real or emulated device .
For example , to rebuild the code , package it and install and run on qvfb , we would try the following command : gph -C x86 - debug -c - all If that were to go well , and we were happy with enough to want to run it on an actual phone , we could build ourselves a package to install with the following : gph - C greenphone -p
This would give us a file in our pkg directory with a name like qpe-application_1.0.0-1_arm.qpk .
To have a more complete idea of the gph capabilities , we can look at its help message : $ gph -- help FORMAT : /opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/gph < options >
Options : -h display command help -q quiet mode -c clean - C < opt > reconfig < x86 > or < greenphone > , default greenphone - b make -p make package - i install package to greenphone -r run application on greenphone - all reconfig , make , make package , install , run - debug force configure for debug build , override default - release force configure for release build , override default - options " < opts > " pass extra options to build system eg .
/opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/gph -C x86 - all - options " CONFIG +=debug " - net bring up network to greenphone - console console on greenphone - qpk < file > install qpk to SDK http server for installation - rescan Tell Qtopia to rescan for new documents and applications
When applications are packaged for distribution to Qtopia devices , they reside in .qpk files that are specially made gzip 'd tar files .
In addition to the executable file itself , there also are the help files , multilingual translation files and the desktop entry .
This desktop entry file contains elements to describe the name of the executable , the icon , what type of application it is and , finally , the MIME type to indicate what sort of data it can process .
Debugging on Target Debugging our application on the Greenphone itself is fairly easy to set up .
First , we need to configure our build environment to cross-compile for the ARM architecture on the Greenphone : .
/opt/Qtopia/SDK/scripts/devel-greenphone.sh
Next , we need to rebuild our Makefile and executables , package them up and install them onto the phone : qtopiamake - debug && make clean && make && gph -p - i -r - debug
At this point , we can click the arm - linux debugger icon on the desktop , open the example program on the phone and click run to execute it in the remote debugger .
Building for Development and Deployment A number of application deployment methodologies are available when developing with the Greenphone SDK .
First , we can build and run our applications so that they execute within the virtual machine 's ersatz phone - like environment complete with a JPEG skin that looks like a phone sitting on your desktop .
It is great for working out the GUI parts of an application , and it saves us the step of having to compile , flash on to the unit and debug remotely .
Second , applications can be compiled and packaged for the Greenphone , then run and tested on the device itself .
As mentioned previously , the VM installs with a gdb debugger that can run inside the virtual machine and debug applications remotely on the phone .
Finally , we have “ Phone bounce ” mode , using the phone as a standard GSM / GPRS modem connected to the development machine via a USB cable .
Our applications would run inside the emulator on the local machine , but would be joined logically to the real phone by whatever network link you have to it , such as a USB connection .
We do not have to customize the Greenphone in a piecemeal fashion .
The Flash image representing the whole Greenphone Linux distribution on the phone can be updated using either the mini-SD Flash reader or the USB cable to re-install a complete new Linux distribution along with all the applications and configuration files .
This makes it easier for enterprise use where items such as standard configuration options are set to enable things like corporate branding with visual themes , VPN settings , default address - book entries and localization settings , among others .
Anatomy of a Qtopia Application Qtopia development will make any Qt or KDE developer feel right at home , as it is quite compatible with the desktop version of Qt .
There are a few minor differences , as we will see in the example application in the Greenphone SDK found at ~/ projects / application .
The style lately , with C++ in general and Qt v4.x in particular , is to include a header named after the class we want declared .
This saves ever having to guess which header contains a class ' declaration .
In the following example , we have the old way commented out and the easier - to - remember method following it : // main.cpp #include " example.h " // #include < qtopia/ qtopiaapplication .h> # include < QtopiaApplication > QTOPIA_ADD_APPLICATION ( " example " , Example ) QTOPIA_MAIN // end of main.cpp
The function formerly known as main ( ) has been deprecated in Qtopia in favor of two macros .
In the above example , the QTOPIA_ADD_APPLICATION macro is used to create an instance of the main application window .
The first parameter is the executable name , and the second parameter is the base class of the application window class .
The QTOPIA_MAIN macro expands out either to the traditional main ( ) function if building a traditional application or to the entry point needed if building a quick launcher plugin .
Inside our example.h , we find the class declaration for our main window , which we have sub-classed from a generic QWidget : #ifndef EXAMPLE_H # define EXAMPLE_H #include " ui_examplebase.h " class ExampleBase : public QWidget , public Ui_ExampleBase { public : ExampleBase ( QWidget * parent = 0 , Qt:: WFlags f = 0 ) ; virtual ~ ExampleBase ( ) ; } ; class Example : public ExampleBase { Q_OBJECT public : Example ( QWidget * parent = 0 , Qt:: WFlags f = 0 ) ; virtual ~ Example ( ) ; private slots : void good Bye( ) ; } ; #endif // EXAMPLE_H
This class uses a form created using the Qt Designer GUI building tool , so we see an include file called ui_examplebase.h that brings in its declaration .
In Qt , headers with names starting with ui_ typically are Designer - generated .
This is followed by our class ' immediate ancestor called ExampleBase .
This base class inherits from both QWidget and the class defined by the GUI builder called Ui_ExampleBase .
Note :
As a brief reminder to newer users of Qt , classes generated by Designer do not have a base widget that contains all the other widgets inside it .
The code in the generated class instantiates child widgets of only whatever parent widget instance is passed into its constructor .
This is a reason why we see multiple inheritance used with classes derived from Qt Designer - generated code — it provides a single widget from which to hang other widgets .
Figure 3 . Designer Running in VM
Our main window is an instance of the Example class derived from ExampleBase .
It makes use of a technique called signals and slots — a method used by Trolltech that allows great flexibility for defining how a function is invoked .
The invoking side of the connection is called a SIGNAL ( ) , and the invokee side is called a SLOT ( ) .
They are joined together using a method called connect ( ) that allows a many - to - many connection relationship .
Qt uses a preprocessor to add metadata processing to add to C++ dynamic invocation and object introspection effectively and elegantly — elements available in other OOP languages .
Our final code example shows the implementation of our classes : #include " example.h " # include < QPushButton >
ExampleBase :: ExampleBase ( QWidget * parent , Qt:: WFlags f ) : QWidget ( parent , f ) { setupUi ( this ) ; } ExampleBase ::~ExampleBase ( ) { } Example :: Example ( QWidget * parent , Qt:: WFlags f ) : ExampleBase ( parent , f ) { connect ( quit , SIGNAL ( clicked ( ) ) , this , SLOT ( goodBye ( ) ) ) ; } Example ::~Example ( ) { } void Example : : goodBye( ) { close ( ) ; } Our ExampleBase class ' constructor calls the Designer - generated setupUi ( ) method to have the form - defined child widgets created and their layout and other properties set .
Without that step , it would be a generic QWidget .
The next interesting thing we see is the constructor for the Example class .
It calls the connect ( ) method to join the clicked ( ) signal on the Qt Designer - generated QPushButton called quit with our good Bye ( ) slot .
This allows us to exit the example program by clicking the QPushButton labeled Quit .
Where to Go from Here
It would be great to explore many other Qtopia - specific features in more detail , such as the QCop IPC mechanism for communication across processes , the XML - based theming engine , the secure execution environment ( SXE ) , plus all the phone - specific features , for starters .
Qtopia provides a lot of advantages for the embedded developer designing applications for mobile phones .
Besides the emulation environment , the code compatibility with desktop applications and the natural intuitive application framework , I find that Qtopia does something better than other embedded environments do — it helps put the fun back into programming .

Ray Kurzweil is a celebrated inventor and futurologist
Exponential growth in processing power and the shrinking of technology would see the development of microscopic computers , he said .
" We will see a billion - fold increase in the price - performance of computers in the next 25 years , " he said .
" Virtual will compete with reality , " he told the Game Developers Conference .
Pea -sized computer
Mr Kurzweil said it was possible to accurately predict the growth and change in computing power by looking at how it had developed over the last 50 years .
" There will be a 100,000 - fold shrinking of computer technology over the next 25 years , " he said .
" Today you can put a pea - sized computer inside your brain , if you have Parkinson 's disease and want to replace the biological neurons that were destroyed by the disease . "
He said a billion - fold increase in computing performance and capability over the next 25 years coupled with the 100,000 fold shrinking , would lead to " blood cell - size devices ... that can go inside our bodies and keep us healthy and inside our brain and expand our intelligence " .
He said the blood cell computers would be able to " produce full immersion virtual reality from inside the nervous system " .
People have more freedom in virtual worlds
He said the games industry had to be thinking about the future development of computing now .
" The games industry fits in well with the acceleration of progress ; in no other industry do you feel that more than games . "
Mr Kurzweil , who invented the flat bed scanner and text - to - speech synthesis , said the virtual world was a misnomer .
" In virtual worlds we do real romance , real learning , real business .
Virtual reality is real reality . "
He added : " Games are the cutting edge of what is happening - we are going to spend more of our time in virtual reality environments .
" Fully emergent games is really where we want to go .
We will do most of our learning through these massively parallel interactions . "
" Play is how we principally learn and principally create , " he said .
Monks began to protest on the streets of Lhasa earlier this week
One eyewitness told the BBC how large groups of people were setting fire to cars and shops and destroying anything of Chinese influence .
The US embassy in Beijing said US citizens had reported hearing gunfire .
Rallies have continued all week in what are thought to be the largest protests against Beijing 's rule in 20 years .
Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , released a statement expressing deep concern , saying the protests were a " manifestation of the deep - rooted resentment of the Tibetan people " .
The Dalai Lama , who heads Tibet 's government - in - exile in India , called on the Chinese leadership to stop using force and begin dialogue with the Tibetan people .
He also urged Tibetans not to resort to violence .
" As I have always said , unity and stability under brute force is at best a temporary solution .
It is unrealistic to expect unity and stability under such a rule , " the statement said .
Tear gas
The US - based International Campaign for Tibet ( ICT ) said at least one police car had been set on fire on Friday .
ICT spokeswoman Kate Saunders said her group had received reports that the Tromsikhang market in Barkhor Street - a busy commercial neighbourhood - was either on fire or had burnt down .
TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet always part of its territory But Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century
In 1950 , China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India
Quick guide : Tibet India detains Tibetans Eyewitness : Monks protest
" It seems that lay people have now become involved in the protests , " she said .
An eyewitness told the BBC there was a thick pall of smoke hanging over the city .
Another eyewitness said security forces and monks had clashed on Wednesday and several monks were beaten .
He said about 300 monks had tried to leave the Sera monastery to protest but security forces brandishing clubs stopped them and at least one monk was beaten to the ground .
The protests began earlier this week , when a number of monks were reportedly arrested after a march marking the 49th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
Hundreds of monks took to the streets to demand their release - and reports say tear gas was used to disperse them .
The police were reported to have sealed off the city 's three main monasteries on Thursday .
Correspondents say there is growing evidence that protests against Chinese rule are intensifying , despite assurances by Beijing on Thursday that the situation was under control .
China says
Tibet has always been part of its territory , though Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before the twentieth century , and many Tibetans remain loyal to the Dalai Lama , who fled in 1959 and currently lives in exile in India .

If you have ever designed a website for a company or organization with a pre-established logo , you ’ve probably found yourself between a crossroad .
The customer will come to you because he needs to revitalize or strengthen his company ’s image , and purchasing a website is one of the most cost - effective ways to do so .
The problem starts when you are given the logo to work with .
There are various types of logo designs : some are mono - colored , others are multi-colored ; some are based on text , some are based on a symbol and finally some are a combination of both .
In some cases , having a pre-established logo can be a God - sent gift because it can save you from the trouble of deciding things such as : what kind of font family to use , or what kind of colors should you use .
But as we all know , things usually do n’t always work out so well , and sometimes what the customer wants from the site design can be contradictory to what the logo looks like .
Sometimes you might come across a customer that wants a modern looking website while sticking to their “ old ” , 1970 ’s looking logo .
A good example of a contradictory design , in terms of logo / design comparison , is the New York Times website , which despite having a logo with a distinct “ color ” , which is black , does n’t correspond to the colors used in the website , where black is only used to distinguish some small categories .
I ’m not saying that their current design would look better if they were to use style , or colors , of the logo in the rest of the website design , but the contrast between tradition and technology is evident , and for this particular website , having their traditional logo might have been the proper approach to take .
When it comes to using text as a site ’s identification , you probably wo n’t have too many problems trying to create a design that fits it , or the other way around , as text is easier to manipulate and integrate in a design than a logo .
When it comes to using a logo as the foundation , or crucial part of a design , things might seem a bit more complicated in the first approach , but there are several “ nays ” one might presume which are n’t necessarily true .
“ the logo ’s color has to be the prominent color of the design ”
Wrong .
Unless the customer specifically wants this from you , you are not obligated to use color of the logo as main color of the website .
A great example of such a case is Bartelme Design ’s website .
What he did in it was to use a color with good contrast but with the same “ strength ” as his green logo .
If you are working with a mono - colored logo , you pretty much have the freedom to do “ whatever you ( or your customer ) wants ” without many risks .
A good example of what kind things you can achieve with different backgrounds and the same logo are the “ big ” sports brands websites like Nike and Adidas .
When all else fails , or when you ca n’t quite integrate the logo with the design that your customer loves so much , you may also try suggesting to redesign or revamp their logo to better suit the new website .
Although that might not be an option for most customers , because it involves a bit of investment afterwards in other things that use the logo , it would n’t be the first time a web designer created a logo for a company .
Just make sure you satisfy the customer with the design first .
News Anchor Darlene Rodriguez Cop Husband Charged In Teen Rape
Policehas been charged with raping a 17 year old girl .
The alleged act happened after he arrested her 35 - year old boyfriend for domestic abuse .
Rodriguez is married to anchorwomanfrom channel WNBC - TV Today in New York .
The cop has plead not guilty and was able to post $ 25,000 bail .
While outside the courthouse , the anchorwoman was visibly upset , crying and pleading her husbands case .
She believes that he is innocent and said :
" I am here to support my husband .
I believe in him .
I love him .
He 's innocent 100 percent . "
Police Commissioner , responding to claims by Rodriguez attorney that the investigation was slipshod , assured the public that the investigation had been thorough .
On February 8 , Rodriguez and fellow officers went to the girl 's home to break up a fight .
They arrested the boyfriend on assault charges .
Later that evening they were called back to the home and rearrested the boyfriend , who after making bail had made contact with the girl , in violation of a police protection order .
The girl alleges that Sgt. Rodriguez returned early the next morning , for the third time , and attacked and forcibly raped her .
The girl waited to report the attack until two days later because she was fearful of retaliation .
The collection of physical evidence was difficult because of the lapse between attack and disclosure .
Sgt. Rodriguez is currently suspended without pay until further notice .
The nine year police veteran could be sentenced to 25 years in prison if he is found guilty .

Shadrack Nuru does n't know it but he is a soldier on the front line of a global war against the most efficient terrorist the earth has known .
The terrorist 's name is Plasmodium falciparum , the malaria parasite that invades the organisms of 500 m people a year and kills as many every day as al - Qaeda did in New York on 11 September 2001 .
More than 90 per cent of the disease 's 1 m annual victims die in Africa , the vast majority of them under the age of five .
Shadrack , nine months old , is one African baby who , with his mother 's blessing , will join forces in the first anti-malaria offensive with a fighting chance of victory since the first mosquito spat the first parasite into the human blood system a very long time ago - long before the time even of Hippocrates , the Greek who invented medicine and first recorded malaria 's symptoms 2,500 years ago .
Among Hippocrates 's successors today , the consensus is that - never mind the bubonic plague or TB or Aids - no disease in the history of the human species has caused more sickness or death , and no disease has proved harder to defeat .
It decimated armies during the First and Second World Wars and counts among its more illustrious victims Alexander the Great , Dante , the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , Oliver Cromwell and Lord Byron .
Shadrack is one of 340 babies from the region of Bagamoyo in Tanzania who are part of a newly energised global campaign to defeat nature 's most enduringly tenacious killer .
They are participating in blind clinical trials under way in Africa to test the efficacy of the most promising malaria vaccine yet devised .
Half of the Bagamoyo babies were injected with the prototype vaccine , known as RTS , S and half with a control vaccine .
The doctors at the Bagamoyo heath and research centre , where the trials are being carried out , do not know which child has received which vaccine , but when they saw Shadrack one day recently , they hoped he had not had RTS,S .
The child lay on a blanket twitching convulsively ; his pupils had rolled back so far into his head all you could see were the whites of his eyes .
His mother looked on in horror , aware there was nothing she could do to help her only child .
The doctor said it looked like cerebral malaria , the deadliest kind .
The doctor , himself an inhabitant of Bagamoyo , a humid town on Tanzania 's Indian Ocean coast , where the malaria parasites and their mosquito carriers run riot , has an urgent personal interest in finding a vaccine for the disease .
He and other doctors I spoke to at the health centre , a rickety assembly of low buildings housing world - class malaria researchers , told me malaria attacks here were as routine as the common cold is in Europe .
One doctor , in his late thirties , whose wife had recently miscarried after contracting malaria , told me he 'd calculated he had succumbed to the disease 70 times .
Shadrack 's mother , watching her child 's convulsively comatose body on the table , was grateful her child had been among those babies selected for the vaccine trials and would have been grateful if he lived to endure similar recurrences .
Those leading the local fight against malaria keep rigorous watch over their infants .
The system worked especially effectively this time : a health worker in Shadrack 's village radioed the Bagamoyo clinic , who sent an ambulance for him .
For rural Tanzania , where the funding for malaria is still 10 times less than that for Aids , this was five - star service .
Very few children manage to get access to medical treatment within 24 hours of the symptoms appearing , as Shadrack had done .
His chances of surviving now that he was in hospital were much higher than average , in a country where local doctors estimate that more than 100,000 children died from malaria in 2007 .
If Shadrack does survive to adulthood , he may look back one day with pride on the small part he played in this battle .
He and the other 339 vaccine - testing babies of Bagamoyo are part of a wider effort that will ultimately involve 16,000 children in half a dozen African countries .
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the RTS , S vaccine .
It is a monumental project , one of whose central figures is Pedro Alonso , a Spanish doctor who has conducted remarkably successful initial trials in Mozambique over the past five years and who has spent his career working on malaria all over Africa .
The results so far for RTS ,S , produced by the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline , have shown an efficacy of 65 per cent in the most vulnerable group , children under 12 months old .
Alonso , whose team 's findings have been published in The Lancet , is one of the generals in the war .
The strategic leadership - and a big chunk of the cash - comes from Bill and Melinda Gates .
The $ 1bn provided by their health foundation has funded a worldwide push that has seen spending to fight malaria quadruple since 2000 .
On 17 October last year , the Gateses invited the world 's 300 leading malaria experts - scientists , senior UN and government officials , heads of NGOs and of the pharmaceutical industry - to Seattle , to see how best they could combine their efforts to tackle the disease .
The high point of the event was a Churchillian keynote speech delivered by Melinda Gates .
Recalling her own Shadrack moment , when she visited the clinic Dr Alonso runs in Manhica , Mozambique , Melinda Gates told the assembly that she was haunted by the memory of a little girl whom doctors had diagnosed with severe malaria .
' No child should die from malaria .
No child , ' she declared .
' And the only way to end death from malaria is to end malaria . '
What she meant , and it provoked gasps from her audience , was ' end ' as in ' eradicate ' - known as the 'e ' word in the malaria community because of its almost taboo status , so improbably , unscientifically dreamy does the task appear .
' Every life , ' Melinda Gates continued , 'has equal worth .
Sickness and death in Africa are just as awful as sickness and death in America ...
Any goal short of eradicating malaria is accepting malaria , it 's making peace with malaria ...
That 's just unacceptable .'
If it was not peace , then it was war .
' Conquering malaria is one of the most ambitious medical quests of all time , ' Melinda acknowledged , yet in the same breath she challenged ' the top scientific minds in the world ' to take it on .
As did her husband .
' We 're not done and we will not stop working , ' declared the founder of Microsoft , ' until malaria is eradicated . '
For most of the Seattle 300 , the speech was a milestone .
' They are dead right , ' reflected Dr Alonso .
' Anything less than the goal of eradication is unacceptable .
Before we only talked of " controlling " malaria .
That 's all past now .
The question is no longer whether we will defeat malaria , but how and when . '
This is not to say Bill Gates believes the RTS , S vaccine he is championing represents some sort of holy grail .
He agrees with Marcel Tanner , a fluent Swahili speaker who heads the partly Gates - funded Swiss Tropical Institute and divides his life between stately , affluent Basle and sub-Saharan Africa , that , likely as it appears that the first ever malaria vaccine will be registered by 2011 , this is not the solution to malaria , no more than the military offensives in Afghanistan and Iraq are the lasting answer to terrorism .
' It will work but it will be an imperfect vaccine , ' said Tanner .
' It will take decades before we win , because this is not like the measles or the polio vaccine : there is no one magic bullet .
We need lots of magic bullets .
You need a complex , multi- pronged approach to fight malaria . '
David Schellenberg , professor of malaria at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , makes it his business to untangle those multi-prongs , which means getting down to the nitty - gritty of addressing the disease among communities in deepest , poorest , roadless Africa .
Schellenberg , who has just returned to London after 10 years in Tanzania , is excited by the potential of RTS ,S , on which he has worked in Bagamoyo , but says that just as important is research on the logistics and economics of delivery : ' We need to find an effective gun to go with the magic bullets , which in and of themselves are of no use to anybody , ' he said .
The ' gun ' and ' magic bullets ' image and the phrase ' multi- pronged approach ' recurred like mantras among doctors and scientists I met in Tanzania - in Bagamoyo and its parent health and research centre at Ifakara , 300 km and seven hours by bumpy road inland .
To travel there from Switzerland , as I did , is to live an experience in time travel that is instructive in the attempt to understand why members of the malaria high command insist on emphasising the logistical aspects of their war .
In chilly , impeccably bourgeois Basle , I visited the vast hi-tech ' campus ' , as they call it , of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis , leading manufacturer of the best drug available at present to combat malaria .
It was ' Big Pharma ' central : a space - age town within an ancient European city .
Cut from there to the Kilombero valley , the last stretch on the slow road from Bagamoyo to Ifakara , and you are in a world that the technological revolution of the 20th century has barely touched .
Yes , one does see a motorised vehicle now and then , as well as a fair number of bicycles , and some men wear football shirts with the names ' Ronaldinho ' and ' Beckham ' on them .
But the women dress in much the same way that Dr Livingstone would have found them .
The villages along the road to Ifakara were like scenes from The Jungle Book : mud huts , big mango trees heaving with fruit , banana trees , coconut trees , lush fields and everywhere fat goats with shiny coats and , in the distance , an elephant or a giraffe .
Paradise , were it not for malaria and the sorrow it causes and the desperate burden it puts on the frail economics of subsistence farming .
Ifakara , Tanner had told me , means ' the place of death ' in Swahili .
Until a decade ago , it was the most lethal malarial area in the world , and it remains so in the town 's outlying districts .
Here , in the warm , stagnant swamps , mosquitos breed in greater numbers than anywhere else on earth .
Ifakara holds the world record for the highest number of mosquitos ever found in one house , in one room - 6,000 , in 1988 .
That the will and the technology existed to count them is down to the existence in town of a health and research centre founded half a century ago by the Swiss pharmaceutical millionaire , Rudolf Geigy .
Tanner , his scientific heir , transformed the centre from what he called a Swiss colonial field laboratory into what had become a sort of Oxford University of malaria , a focus of knowledge in the heart of the research zone run today by Tanzanians , and to which the world 's leading malaria experts make obligatory pilgrimages .
The questions that had to be asked here were why malaria represented such a vast scientific challenge , and why to defeat the disease it was necessary to fight on so many fronts .
The answer to the first question was provided at the Ifakara centre 's laboratory , whose equipment is partly funded by the Gates Foundation and whose exclusively Tanzanian staff are trained , often abroad , to the highest international standards .
' You hate the malaria parasite , but you have to admire it for its complexity , its endless capacity to mutate and develop resistance to the weapons humanity hurls at it , ' said Debora Sumari , a molecular biologist .
' Each new drug we come up with in time becomes confused , thrown off balance by the parasite , which radically alters its DNA composition , assumes disguises .
It is a very clever parasite , always one step ahead of the cleverest scientific minds . '
Sumari spends her days peering at the tiny organisms through high - powered microscopes .
In the war against the disease , she sees herself , she smiled , as a spy infiltrating behind enemy lines , gathering intelligence on the lifestyle and habits of nature 's terrorists and trying to anticipate their next move .
' It is like an endless game of chess against a brilliant and cunning adversary , ' she said .
The malaria delivery vehicle , the Anopheles mosquito , is brilliant and cunning , too - and almost as inscrutable as the parasite itself .
Gerry Killeen , an Irish entomologist who has been in Tanzania for four and a half years and is one of the leading world experts on the mosquito , was speaking only half in whimsy when he told me :
' We know more about the polar bear than we do about the mosquito - we do n't even know what the damn thing eats !'
Killeen is working on it , aided by a team of young Tanzanian scientists who are endeavouring to discover , among other things , whether a smell might be found that is more appealing to mosquitos than that of human flesh .
' When it comes to species protection , I have to say that the tiger is higher on my list , ' Killeen smiled .
' But you have to hand it to the mosquito : it is a smart and elegant killer . '
Or ' she' is .
The males do not need blood to survive ; only the females do , in order to lay their eggs .
So it is only the females that bite , or rather ' spear ' , humans , the unintended consequence being that all too often the uninvited parasite they carry then attacks in overwhelming numbers .
The way it works is this : the mosquito , belonging to the malaria - carrying genus Anopheles , stores the parasite in its saliva glands .
It alights on human skin , locates a blood vessel , and pierces it with its sharp , serrated proboscis needle .
It then spits out saliva in order to stop the blood coagulating and sucks it up into its body .
( Small children are particularly appetising prey because they sleep deeply , allowing for long , uninterrupted gorging . )
The parasites enter the human bloodstream and make for the liver , where they remain undetected for seven to 10 days .
The liver is a sort of orgiastic gymnasium where the parasites not only become big and strong , they reproduce in vast quantities , multiplying the original number that left the mosquito 's saliva by a factor of 20,000 .
They then invade the organism to devastating effect , slaughtering red blood cells , decimating the body 's iron content and clogging up the blood vessels that irrigate the vital organs .
When the bloodflow to the brain is closed down - cerebral malaria - the parasite 's human host dies .
Quinine , a natural product first discovered in the bark of trees in Peru hundreds of years ago , is the oldest weapon used against malaria , though its efficacy has been severely curtailed by the parasite 's genius for mutating .
It has , however , led to the development of a pharmaceutical byproduct called chloroquine that is still used today .
But the latest and best drug is Coartem .
This combines a natural product derived from the Artemisin plant , originally found in China , with a chemical compound .
Novartis produces 70 per cent of the world 's Coartem and , while it is by far the single biggest drug it produces in terms of volume , it sells it at cost .
If the pills are taken with the recommended regularity , and in time , they kill off the parasite within three days .
' Yet here we have a perfect example of why we must never drop our guard , ' said Jullu Boniphace , Debora Sumari 's boss at the Ifakara lab .
' We did the trials on Coartem here in Ifakara and it is working .
Yet we know that at any moment we will be surprised , that the parasite will have come up with a defence and that we will have to find a new weapon .
If we fall asleep , the enemy will be at our door . '
When Boniphace said ' we ' he meant the entire malaria garrison at Ifakara , each with their specialist field .
The lab ' spies ' must do their part , but propaganda - or ' education ' , as they more politely call it in Ifakara - is as essential an instrument to combating malaria as the ' top scientific minds '
Melinda Gates spoke of .
' One of our greatest enemies is ignorance , ' said Angel Dillip , a medical sociologist who helps run a travelling circus of musicians and comedians that arrives in big trucks at remote villages and tries to stress , among other things , the urgency of seeking immediate medical help the moment the first malaria symptoms of fever , exhaustion and muscular aches present .
' One big problem is people 's belief in traditional healers , who tell them the illness is a sort of curse created by a djinni , or ghost , that only they are able to address .
By the time the convulsions set in , and it is now clear to the parents of a sick child that the traditional cures have not worked , it is often too late , ' Dillip said .
Logistics is an even bigger area .
It includes , on the one hand , a statistics department at Ifakara that employs more than 60 field workers and keeps records on the health and basic economy of 19,000 households .
Without that data it would be impossible for the likes of David Schellenberg to do his research , which in turn leads to the all - important policy question of how much the malaria war costs , or how to judge the efficacy of new drugs .
Logistics also means getting the drugs and , critically in recent years , mosquito bednets to outlying areas where roads are practically non-existent .
The emergence of increasingly efficient , washable , insecticide - treated bednets - the fruit of extensive research done in part by Pedro Alonso in the Nineties - has had a big impact in reducing malaria deaths in Ifakara .
Ifakara offers ' a vision of success ' , as one local doctor put it , but the concentration of cutting - edge resources here will not be easily replicated in the rest of Africa .
And even so , they are not enough to eradicate the disease locally .
If a country like Italy , where malaria was endemic up to the Thirties , has been able to eliminate malaria it is in large measure because of the giant public works projects it was able to fund to clear out open drains where mosquito larvae breed , and because people have windows in their homes and quick access to medical help .
What African poverty means , as a doctor in Bagamoyo told me , is that parents are often confronted with a desperate choice .
' If you live far from a town and your child falls sick in a season when a subsistence farming family must sow the fields , you are faced with a desperate choice , ' Dr Kafuruki Shubis explained .
' Do you take the child on a trip to a health centre that costs you money you barely have , and takes up one or two days there and back , knowing that by so doing you leave the fields unsown and the family hungry ?
Or do you leave the child to die ? '
David Schellenberg has done specific research on this African Sophie 's Choice in Ifakara and confirmed Dr Shubis 's findings .
' You have a two - week window to plant the seeds , which you 've spent a lot of your money to buy , ' Dr Schellenberg said .
' That window coincides with the time of heaviest rains , when the mosquitos reproduce in greatest numbers and malaria is at its peak .
Yet the peak of malaria admissions to health centres is not highest during this time .
This tells us for sure that many people are making the decision to plant instead of taking the children to be treated . '
This brings us back to what Schellenberg calls the ' unsexy but critical ' question of the economics of the war on malaria ; and to how important money is if the Gateses ' dream of final victory is ever to be achieved .
Fortunately , Bill Gates has plenty of it , the main reason why , at the start of the 21st century , money is at last on its way .
An effort was made in the Fifties to combat malaria globally , but it was abandoned after Africa proved too intractable for the available science .
Thirty years followed during which , apart from a few medical diehards , the world practically gave up on malaria .
Until one day Bill Gates looked around and decided in the year 2000 that the most fruitful way to invest his Microsoft billions charitably would be in the attempt to restore the health imbalance between rich and poor countries .
The impetus provided by the Gates Foundation has led in turn to a new phenomenon , a global private - public partnership whereby governments - notably the American and British so far - pool resources with international bodies such as the World Health Organisation , private charities and the pharmaceutical companies to fight malaria together .
This new partnership has been decisive in terms of the development of the RTS , S vaccine .
If the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline were to propose developing something as complex , time - consuming and bottomlessly costly as a malaria vaccine at the company 's own expense , knowing the only market for such a vaccine is to be found in the world 's poorest countries , then , as Dr Alonso pointed out , he would be fired on the spot .
' That is the reality in the capitalist world and it's no use screaming about it , ' he said .
Some do .
' I have had Latin American colleagues who 've argued that it is unethical for us to work with Big Pharma , ' said Dr Schellenberg .
' Those are ideologues who get in the way of effective solutions , I 'm afraid .
Because the truth is that if we do n't have Big Pharma , we do n't have the products . '
Big Pharma and Big Government , plus Bill Gates .
Given that only the likes of GSK have the capacity to develop and manufacture such a drug , the solution has been for the public side of the new malaria partnership to provide funding for pre-clinical , laboratory trials and to offer a guarantee that they will purchase enough of the vaccines , once they are registered , to cover the company 's costs .
It is thanks to this co-ordinated effort that places like Bagamoyo and Ifakara have their own well - equipped research centres , increasingly staffed by local scientists .
It is thanks to this that free bednets have so far reached 20 per cent of Africa 's target population , with more on the way ; that Coartem production and delivery has increased 25 - fold in the past three years ; that research is under way into everything from the study of mosquito larvae - eating fish to electronic devices that fry mosquitos in mid-flight and a complex programme in the US to extract infected saliva from vast numbers of mosquitos and then use it as anti-parasite vaccine ; and that the RTS , S vaccine , which is just one more possible magic bullet , was developed .
Salim Abdulla , who now heads the Bagamoyo research centre , is a MsC graduate of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , a PhD from the Swiss Tropical institute / University of Basel , and a veteran of Ifakara , where he played a critical role in the development of Coartem .
One of the Seattle 300 , Abdulla , another man for whom catching malaria is like catching a cold , is more aware than anybody of the difficulties involved , yet he remains cheerful .
' I believe we are the first generation in human history with a serious chance of beating malaria , ' he said .
' But I would not have dreamt of saying such a thing 10 years ago , when we were alone , neglected and unfunded .
But then six or seven years ago people with big names , like Bill Gates , started making a noise .
They said , " You know what ?
Malaria kills more people - and far , far more kids - than Aids ! "
And now things have snowballed to the point that there is an energy heading in this direction , towards us in Africa , that we 've never felt before .
I saw it in Seattle and I was impressed . '
Was he impressed by the rhetoric of the billionaires , too ?
' We are painfully aware of the difficulties ahead , ' Abdulla said .
' We applaud the scientific work , but the big question is how best to deploy those resources ; how they will impact usefully on real people here in the real world .
The people who will do it will be people like us , here .
The Churchills make the calls for eradication , ' he said , 'we carry out and execute .
The challenge is tremendous , but that is why we welcome the Churchills - the Bill and Melinda Gates of this world .
They inspire us soldiers on the ground to believe that one day we will win . '
· This article was amended on Tuesday February 19 2008 to clarify the credentials of Salim Abdulla .
Most of us would prefer to base our voting decision on policy differences .
However , the candidates ’ goals are similar .
They have all laid out detailed plans on everything from strengthening our middle class to investing in early childhood education .
So qualities of leadership , character and judgment play a larger role than usual .
Senator Obama has demonstrated these qualities throughout his more than two decades of public service , not just in the United States Senate but in Illinois , where he helped turn around struggling communities , taught constitutional law and was an elected state official for eight years .
And Senator Obama is showing the same qualities today .
He has built a movement that is changing the face of politics in this country , and he has demonstrated a special gift for inspiring young people  known for a willingness to volunteer , but an aversion to politics  to become engaged in the political process .
I have spent the past five years working in the New York City public schools and have three teenage children of my own .
There is a generation coming of age that is hopeful , hard - working , innovative and imaginative .
But too many of them are also hopeless , defeated and disengaged .
As parents , we have a responsibility to help our children to believe in themselves and in their power to shape their future .
Senator Obama is inspiring my children , my parents ’ grandchildren , with that sense of possibility .
Senator Obama is running a dignified and honest campaign .
He has spoken eloquently about the role of faith in his life , and opened a window into his character in two compelling books .
And when it comes to judgment , Barack Obama made the right call on the most important issue of our time by opposing the war in Iraq from the beginning .
I want a president who understands that his responsibility is to articulate a vision and encourage others to achieve it ; who holds himself , and those around him , to the highest ethical standards ; who appeals to the hopes of those who still believe in the American Dream , and those around the world who still believe in the American ideal ; and who can lift our spirits , and make us believe again that our country needs every one of us to get involved .

A new bill proposed in the Tennessee state senate aims to reduce copyright infringement at universities by forcing the schools to become antipiracy enforcers .
If passed , the bill would require universities that receive funding from the state to analyze all traffic passing through their networks in order to track down and stop infringing activity .
Under the proposed bill , universities could lose state funding if they refuse to implement network analysis systems or if they receive ten or more infringement complaints from content owners during a single year .
The University of Tennessee is number four on the RIAA 's list of top music piracy schools and number 19 on the MPAA 's list of top movie piracy schools .
The content industry has increasingly attempted to pressure universities into taking a more active role in squashing piracy and wants the government to step in and force the issue if universities are n't willing to comply .
A controversial college funding bill that recently passed in the House also includes mandatory anti-piracy filtering requirements .
Many questions remain unanswered about the extent to which piracy occurs on college campuses .
The MPAA recently retracted the outrageously inflated college piracy statistics that it published after a 2005 study .
Despite the fact that the MPAA 's numbers were egregiously inaccurate , the study has been repeatedly cited by lawmakers .
As we have pointed out in the past , it is n't clear that every download necessarily constitutes a lost sale .
If the raman stereotype is to be believed , the average college student does n't exactly have a lot of extra money for buying movies .
Universities understandably complain about the high costs of acquiring and operating network analysis tools .
In an attempt to make it easier for schools to shoulder the burden of antipiracy enforcement efforts , the MPAA created a toolkit last year that aimed to automate much of the process .
The toolkit , however , was built using open source software and failed to comply with software 's license .
After the MPAA refused to take down the software and comply with copyright law , one of the developers sent a DMCA takedown notice to the organization 's Internet service provider .
The MPAA claimed that it would make the toolkit available again after resolving the copyright issues , but still has n't done so .
Efforts taken by universities thus far to deter and prevent piracy have had mixed results .
The University of Utah , for instance , claims that it has reduced MPAA and RIAA complaints by 90 percent and saved $ 1.2 million in bandwidth costs by instituting anti-piracy filtering mechanisms .
However , the school revealed that their filtering system has n't been able to stop encrypted P2P traffic and noted that students will find ways to circumvent any system .
The end result , some say , will be a costly arms race as students perpetually work to circumvent anti-piracy systems put in place by universities .
The content industry fully admits that its own anti-piracy enforcement efforts have been extremely costly .
These laws look like an attempt to shift some of those expenses away from the content industry and onto students and tax payers .
Surely , university resources are better spent on education than on futile efforts to prevent file sharing and prop up outdated business models .
Unfortunately , lawmakers do n't seem to agree .
Tennessee residents wishing to share their concerns with members of the Tennessee legislature can do so with contact information available on the legislative body 's web site .

BusyBox developers go after Verizon
From : Jim Garrison < garrison - AT - softwarefreedom.org >
To : pr-AT-lwn.net Subject : BusyBox Developers File GPL Infringement Lawsuit Against Verizon Communications Date : Fri , 07 Dec 2007 09:00:25 - 0500 Message -ID : <475951F9.2050400@softwarefreedom.org >
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE BusyBox Developers File GPL Infringement Lawsuit Against Verizon Communications Lawsuit Claims Verizon Illegally Distributes Open Source Software to FiOS Customers NEW YORK , December 7 , 2007 -- The Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) today announced that it has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Verizon Communications , Inc. on behalf of its clients , two principal developers of BusyBox , alleging violation of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
BusyBox is a lightweight set of standard Unix utilities commonly used in embedded systems and is open source software licensed under GPL version 2 . Verizon is the provider of a fiber - optic Internet and television service called FiOS .
Verizon distributes Actiontec MI424WR wireless routers to FiOS customers .
This router contains BusyBox , and under the terms of the GPL , Verizon is obligated to provide the source code of BusyBox to recipients of the device .
According to the lawsuit , Verizon continues to distribute BusyBox illegally without source code , despite having been contacted by SFLC .
The complaint requests that an injunction be issued against Verizon and that damages and litigation costs be awarded to the plaintiffs .
A copy of the complaint , as filed yesterday in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , is available at http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2007/dec/07/busybox/v...
" Our clients licensed BusyBox under the GPL to ensure that all users of the program can access and modify its source code , " said Dan Ravicher , Legal Director of SFLC .
" Because Verizon chose not to respond to our concerns , we had no choice but to file a lawsuit to ensure that they comply with the GPL . "
This is the fourth GPL enforcement lawsuit filed by SFLC on behalf of BusyBox developers Erik Andersen and Rob Landley .
Defendants in previous cases have included Monsoon Multimedia , High Gain Antennas , and Xterasys Corporation .
The case against Monsoon Multimedia was settled out of court in October , with Monsoon agreeing to remedy its prior violation , ensure future compliance , and financially compensate the plaintiffs .

OTTAWA–A top adviser to Hillary Clinton arrived by plane in Ottawa to deliver a speech only to be subjected to intensive interrogation about who he was , what he was going to say and what group he was addressing , the American economist said yesterday .
In a private lunch , Gene Sperling complained that he had been pulled aside by a Canadian border official and questioned in more detail than he had ever experienced in his numerous trips to Canada or dozens of other countries , according to those in attendance .
Many in the luncheon group , which included business people , a United States government official , journalists and organizers of the speaking event , said they were shocked by the extent of the grilling reported by Sperling .
But in public later , the former national economic adviser in the Bill Clinton administration refused to discuss the matter in detail .
Choosing his words carefully , he appeared to put it all down to an overzealous Canadian border official .
" There are a lot of people who are in a lot of jobs in the United States and Canada – civil servants , people trying to do their jobs , " he told the audience at the Canada 2020 event .
" People have good days and they have bad days . "
Sperling , whose speech was billed as a look how the economic problems in the U.S. will affect Canada , arrived in Ottawa at a time when cross - border relations have been rocked by allegations that Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government interfered in American politics .
Harper has asked the government 's top official , Privy Council Clerk Kevin Lynch , to investigate leaks from Canadian officials that rattled the Democratic presidential campaigns of Clinton and Illinois Senator Barack Obama last month .
The issue blew up after Ian Brodie , Harper 's chief of staff , told CTV journalists in Ottawa that Clinton 's criticism of the NAFTA agreement between Canada , the U.S. and Mexico need not be viewed too seriously .
Brodie reportedly told CTV that a Clinton campaign official had told Canadian officials to take her criticisms " with a grain of salt . "
In a question - and - answer session later , Sperling said Clinton , if elected president , is determined to reopen the 15 - year - old NAFTA agreement and that if talks were unsuccessful , she would be willing to scrap the deal .

In the end , it turns out it 's all about the emails .
The fight in Congress and the big push for expanded wiretapping powers has nothing to do with intercepting foreign - to - foreign phone calls inside the United States without a court order .
In fact , it turns out that the nation 's secret wiretapping court is fine with that .
That extraordinary admission came from Assistant Attorney General for National Security Kenneth Wainstein at a breakfast on Monday , according to the Washington Post .
At the breakfast yesterday , Wainstein highlighted a different problem with the current FISA law than other administration officials have emphasized .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , for example , has repeatedly said FISA should be changed so no warrant is needed to tap a communication that took place entirely outside the United States but happened to pass through the United States .
But in response to a question at the meeting by David Kris , a former federal prosecutor and a FISA expert , Wainstein said FISA 's current strictures did not cover strictly foreign wire and radio communications , even if acquired in the United States .
The real concern , he said , is primarily e-mail , because " essentially you do n't know where the recipient is going to be " and so you would not know in advance whether the communication is entirely outside the United States .
That would make sense since email does n't go directly to a device in most cases , it goes to a server that holds the email until the recipient ( s ) come to pick up the email – which could be and often is from different parts of the world – think of any business traveler .
But that also means all the hysterical screaming and the dire scenarios constructed by right - wing spying proponents based on very thin evidence of what the secret court actually ruled – all of it is just wrong .
And more to the point , the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence allowed them to be wrong for months .
They allowed and facilitated their supporters to scare freedom loving people with phantoms of lost wiretaps .
DNI Michael McConnell , the serial exaggerator who claims to be a non-political straight shooter , himself kept saying the NSA lost 70 percent of its capabilities after the ruling .
If that 's the case , that means that 70 percent of what the NSA does is collect emails inside United States telecom infrastructure and service providers .
Really ?
If that 's what tens of billions of dollars are going to the NSA for annually , we do n't need to give them more power to read emails , we need to get them to learn to do real intelligence collection .
It 's no wonder the nation 's intelligence services decided that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
The EFF's Kurt Opsahl has more .
And finally THREAT LEVEL is pretty sure this means it won the $ 1000 bet about what the court ruled – too bad no one took me up on the offer .
I 'd hate to say that means that every one who spouted the " all wiretapping has to go through the court now " rhetoric knew that was false , but one does wonder ...
Faster ...
Lighter ...
Cheaper ...
More Flammable !
Fed up with folding tiny paper cranes , a team from Japan 's Tokyo University has crafted the highest of flyers : a paper plane that will be launched from the International Space Station and then descend to earth ... eventually ... hopefully ...
On the face of it , launching a paper airplane from the space station is the least problematic part of the deal .
Getting down to Earth is a bit more complicated - bear in mind , the space shuttle is zipping along at a scorching speed of Mach 20 ( over 15,200 mph ) when it hits the atmosphere .
Notice I said " scorching " , but that 's OK because researchers from Tokyo University say that the neatly folded paper glider " has been treated to withstand intense heat " .
Now they do n't say exactly how the paper was treated ... perhaps they 'll sandwich it between a couple of extra shuttle tiles and toss it out the airlock .
" To heck with these troublesome tiles , next time let 's use paper ! "
Am I being too cynical ?
Fine , let 's skip the how and examine just what this crack team of aeronautical geniuses is planning .
We 'll skip the part about a paper airplane being launched into airless space ... still with me ?
Allrighty then , once the 3 - inch long prototype passes wind tunnel tests that will subject it to wind speeds of Mach 7 - that 's 5,300 miles per hour - a larger version will be built ( well , folded ... ) and sent up to the ISS to amuse the astronauts .
Like Elton John said , it 's lonely out in space .
" HAL , open the pod bay doors ! " ...
" I 'm sorry Dave , but flying paper airplanes in space is not part of the mission "
Shinji Suzuki , an aerospace engineering professor at TU ( what , you thought students trying to graduate dreamed this up ? ) hopes " the space station crew will write a message of peace on the plane before they launch it . "
Good luck with that , Shinji !
Since the odds of a paper airplane thrown from Earth orbit actually landing anywhere on dry land are rather long , as is the estimated time of descent ( weeks ? months ? ) , I 'm thinking the space - mad crew will take joy in writing less than peaceful messages on the airplane , such as " Dammit Suzuki , we asked for TOILET paper ! " ( via Pink Tentacle )

In most ways , 2007 has been a great year for Twitter .
The service has grown tremendously and has become one of the big social network successes .
The flip side of this popularity is that they have often been unable to handle all the traffic their large user base has been bringing in , which has affected the stability of their website .
In other words : Twitter has been suffering from growing pains .
We have monitored the availability of the Twitter.com website since mid February 2007 until today ( and counting ) .
So far , the accumulated downtime of the website totals 5 days and 23 hours .
This includes maintenance , but is still a very high number .
So far in December , the website has been unavailable for a total of almost 11 hours ( part of which was due to problems related to a data center move ) .
The worst month for Twitter by far was March , when the Twitter.com website totaled over 2 days and 10 hours of downtime .
This is also the month when Twitter ’s popularity really took off , winning the SXSW Interactive Festival , so it looks like the rapid growth that month took its toll .
Above : Note that the February data is not complete , and that the December data of course is n’t complete as of this writing .
This data can be found , always up to date , on the public uptime report page for Twitter.com .
( A day - by - day breakdown can be had by clicking on the link for a month . )
Another indication that the Twitter.com website has been suffering from more traffic than it can handle is that a lot of days the website has been unavailable for numerous short periods of time , often ranging from 1 to 10 minutes , spread over large parts of the day , which indicates that the website has been struggling to keep up with demand and deliver pages during much of that time .
This last weekend Twitter moved their service to a new data center , which will hopefully alleviate the problems they have been experiencing .
Will the Twitter website be more reliable from now on ?
As we mentioned , you can keep track of this on a public report page from Pingdom that shows the uptime of the Twitter.com website and is updated continuously .
Note : Twitter ’s recent downtime and data center move has received a lot of buzz and speculation , for example in Mashable , Ensight and Data Center Knowledge .

A study of Guatemalan babies provided the basis for the research
The findings , published in the British medical journal The Lancet , were based on a three - decade study of Guatemalan males from birth .
Those who had been well - fed soon after they were born earned almost 50 % more than those who had not .
Experts say the results could affect how aid is managed in countries in the developing world .
The findings could also have a bearing on social policy towards the poor in more developed nations .
' First clear link '
Although there is widespread evidence that the babies of better - off parents grow stronger and richer than those of the poor - indeed , it 's so obvious that it hardly needs saying - the reasons why this happens are complex .
Food , schooling , the economic environment and the social services provided by government , all play a role .
In this long - term study of villagers in Guatemala , however , nutrition was the only variable that changed .
During the 1970s , some of the babies in the study were given a very nutritious food supplement , some a less nutritious one .
When the researchers returned three decades later to see how the babies - now men - were faring , they found that men who had had the very nutritious supplement up to the age of three were earning nearly half as much more per hour than the other villagers .
The girl babies who had become women did not have similar wage differentials , possibly because they had less choice about where they worked .
But The Lancet said these results were the first direct evidence of a clear link between early - life nutrition and adult wages , and that feeding babies well could drive economic growth .
She pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court after filming the attack on Gavin Waterhouse last September .
Mr Waterhouse , 29 , from Keighley , later died from a ruptured spleen .
The Crown Prosecution Service said the decision to prosecute the girl was a legal landmark .
Mark Masters , 19 , and a male , 17 , have admitted manslaughter .
All three defendants will be sentenced at a later date .
The message is this :
If you stand by and watch your friends committing brutal crimes and video their acts ... prosecution may follow
Judith Naylor , CPS
According to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and was told to " video this " .
She then approached Mr Waterhouse and asked him for some money before recording the attack upon him .
Prosecution witnesses said they saw and heard the attackers boasting about what they had just done , saying it was not the first time that they had attacked the victim .
' Cowardly attack '
Judith Naylor , from the CPS , said : " As far as I am aware , this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter , for the filming of an inaptly called ' happy slapping ' incident .
" The message is this :
If you stand by and watch your friends committing brutal crimes and video their acts for yours or for others ' amusement your actions will not be ignored by the law enforcement agencies and prosecution may follow . "
Neil Atkinson , from the North of England Victims ' Association ( Neva ) , said : " It 's revolting to think of people celebrating the pain and suffering and eventual death of someone in the way that has obviously taken place in this case . "
He said Neva believed the three teenagers should receive long custodial sentences but was concerned about the current " atrocious weak sentencing " of criminals in the UK .
" If they served one to two years in prison , is this sort of person likely to be cured or deterred by that short prison sentence ?
" Common sense says that they would not . "
Det Supt Paul Kennedy , from West Yorkshire Police , said : " We are pleased with the outcome of this police investigation following what was an unprovoked and cowardly attack .
Our thoughts are with Gavin 's family . "

The former president of Tanzania Julius Nyerere once asked , " Why have n’t we all got a vote in the US election ?
Surely everyone with a TV set has earned that right just for enduring the merciless bombardment every four years . "
Having reported four presidential election campaigns , from the Kennedys to Nixon , Carter to Reagan , with their Zeppelins of platitudes , robotic followers and rictal wives , I can sympathize .
But what difference would the vote make ?
Of the presidential candidates I have interviewed , only George C. Wallace , governor of Alabama , spoke the truth .
" There ’s not a dime ’s worth of difference between the Democrats and Republicans , " he said .
And he was shot .
What struck me , living and working in the United States , was that presidential campaigns were a parody , entertaining and often grotesque .
They are a ritual danse macabre of flags , balloons and bullshit , designed to camouflage a venal system based on money power , human division and a culture of permanent war .
Traveling with Robert Kennedy in 1968 was eye - opening for me .
To audiences of the poor , Kennedy would present himself as a savior .
The words " change " and " hope " were used relentlessly and cynically .
For audiences of fearful whites , he would use racist codes , such as " law and order . "
With those opposed to the invasion of Vietnam , he would attack " putting American boys in the line of fire , " but never say when he would withdraw them .
That year ( after Kennedy was assassinated ) , Richard Nixon used a version of the same , malleable speech to win the presidency .
Thereafter , it was used successfully by Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , Bill Clinton and the two Bushes .
Carter promised a foreign policy based on " human rights " — and practiced the very opposite .
Reagan ’s " freedom agenda " was a bloodbath in central America .
Clinton " solemnly pledged " universal health care and tore down the last safety net of the Depression .
Nothing has changed .
Barack Obama is a glossy Uncle Tom who would bomb Pakistan .
Hillary Clinton , another bomber , is anti-feminist .
John McCain ’s one distinction is that he has personally bombed a country .
They all believe the US is not subject to the rules of human behavior , because it is " a city upon a hill , " regardless that most of humanity sees it as a monumental bully which , since 1945 , has overthrown 50 governments , many of them democracies , and bombed 30 nations , destroying millions of lives .
If you wonder why this holocaust is not an " issue " in the current campaign , you might ask the BBC , which is responsible for reporting the campaign to much of the world , or better still Justin Webb , the BBC ’s North America editor .
In a Radio 4 series last year , Webb displayed the kind of sycophancy that evokes the 1930s appeaser Geoffrey Dawson , then editor of the London Times .
Condoleezza Rice cannot be too mendacious for Webb .
According to Rice , the US is " supporting the democratic aspirations of all people . "
For Webb , who believes American patriotism " creates a feeling of happiness and solidity , " the crimes committed in the name of this patriotism , such as support for war and injustice in the Middle East for the past 25 years , and in Latin America , are irrelevant .
Indeed , those who resist such an epic assault on democracy are guilty of " anti-Americanism , " says Webb , apparently unaware of the totalitarian origins of this term of abuse .
Journalists in Nazi Berlin would damn critics of the Reich as " anti-German . "
Moreover , his treacle about the " ideals " and " core values " that make up America ’s sanctified " set of ideas about human conduct " denies us a true sense of the destruction of American democracy : the dismantling of the Bill of Rights , habeas corpus and separation of powers .
Here is Webb on the campaign trail : " [ This ] is not about mass politics .
It is a celebration of the one - to - one relationship between an individual American and his or her putative commander - in - chief . "
He calls this " dizzying . "
And Webb on Bush : " Let us not forget that while the candidates win , lose , win again . . . there is a world to be run and President Bush is still running it . "
The emphasis in the BBC text actually links to the White House website .
None of this drivel is journalism .
It is anti-journalism , worthy of a minor courtier of a great power .
Webb is not exceptional .
His boss Helen Boaden , director of BBC News , sent this reply to a viewer who had protested the prevalence of propaganda as the basis of news :
" It is simply a fact that Bush has tried to export democracy [ to Iraq ] and that this has been troublesome . "
And her source for this " fact " ?
Quotations from Bush and Blair saying it is a fact .

It ’s not easy to make a big software system that really fits together .
It ’s incredibly important , though .
Because it ’s what makes the whole system more than just the sum of its parts .
It ’s what gives the system limitless possibilities — rather than just a bunch of specific features .
But it ’s hard to achieve .
It requires maintaining consistency and coherence across every area , over the course of many years .
But I think it ’s something we ’ve been very successful at doing with Mathematica .
And I think it ’s actually one of the most crucial assets for the long - term future of Mathematica .
It ’s also a part of things that I personally am deeply involved in .
Ever since we started developing it more than 21 years ago , I ’ve been the chief architect and chief designer of Mathematica ’s core functionality .
And particularly for Mathematica 6 , there was a huge amount of design to do .
Actually , I think much more even than for Mathematica 1 .
In fact , I just realized that over the course of the decade during which we were developing Mathematica 6 — and accelerating greatly towards the end — I spent altogether about 10,000 hours doing what we call “ design reviews ” for Mathematica 6 , trying to make all those new functions and pieces of functionality in Mathematica 6 be as clean and simple as possible , and all fit together .
At least the way I do it , doing software design is a lot like doing fundamental science .
In fundamental science , one starts from a bunch of phenomena , and then one tries to drill down to find out what ’s underneath them — to try to find the root causes , the ultimate primitives , of what ’s going on .
Well , in software design , one starts from a bunch of functionality , and then one needs to drill down to find out just what ultimate primitives one needs to support them .
In science , if one does a good job at finding the primitives , then one can have a very broad theory that covers not just the phenomena one started from , but lots of others too .
And in software design , it ’s the same kind of thing .
If one does a good job at finding the primitives , then one can build a very broad system that gives one not just the functionality one was first thinking about , but lots more too .
Over the years , we ’ve developed a pretty good process for doing design reviews .
We start with some particular new area of functionality .
Then we get a rough description of the functions — or whatever — that we think we ’ll need to cover it .
Then we get down to the hard job of design analysis .
Of trying to work out just what the correct fundamental primitives to cover the area are .
The clean , simple functions that represent the essence of what ’s going on — and that fit together with each other , and with the rest of Mathematica , to cover what ’s needed .
Long ago I used to do design analysis pretty much solo .
But nowadays our company is full of talented people who help .
The focal point is our Design Analysis group , which works with our experts in particular areas to start the process of refining possible designs .
At some point , though , I always get involved .
So that anything that ’s a core function of Mathematica is always something that I ’ve personally design reviewed .
I sometimes wonder whether it ’s crazy for me to do this .
But I think having one person ultimately review everything is a good way to make sure that there really is coherence and consistency across the system .
Of course , when the system is as big as Mathematica 6 , doing all those design reviews to my level of perfection takes a long time — about 10,000 hours , in fact .
Design reviews are usually meetings with somewhere between two and twenty people .
( Almost always they ’re done with web conferencing , not in person . )
The majority of the time , there ’s a preliminary implementation of whatever it is that we ’re reviewing .
Sometimes the people who are in the design review meeting will say “ we think we have this mostly figured out ” .
Sometimes they ’ll say “ we ca n’t see how to set this up ; we need your help ” .
Either way , what usually happens is that I start off trying out what ’s been built , and asking lots and lots of questions about the whole area that ’s involved .
It ’s sometimes a little weird .
One hour I ’ll be intensely thinking about the higher mathematics of number theory functions .
And the next hour I ’ll be intensely focused on how we should handle data about cities around the world .
Or how we should set up the most general possible interfaces to external control devices .
But although the subject matter is very varied , the principles are at some level the same .
I want to understand things at the most fundamental level — to see what the essential primitives should be .
Then I want to make sure those primitives are built so that they fit in as well as possible to the whole existing structure of Mathematica — and so they are as easy as possible for people to understand , and work with .
It ’s often a very grueling process .
Progressively polishing things until they are as clean and simple as possible .
Sometimes we ’ll start a meeting with things looking pretty complicated .
A dozen functions that use some strange new construct , and have all sorts of weird arguments and options .
It ’s usually pretty obvious that we have to do better .
But figuring out how is often really hard .
There ’ll usually be a whole series of incremental ideas .
And then a few big shifts — which usually come from getting a clearer understanding of what the true core functionality has to be .
Often we ’ll be talking quite a bit about precedents elsewhere in Mathematica .
Because the more we can make what we ’re designing now be like something we ’ve done before in Mathematica , the better .
For several reasons .
First , because it means we ’re using approaches that we ’ve tested somewhere else before .
Second , because it means that what we ’re doing now will fit in better to what already exists .
And third , because it means that people who are already familiar with other things Mathematica does will have an easier time understanding the new things we ’re adding .
But some of the most difficult design decisions have to do with when to break away from precedent .
When is what we ’re doing now really different from anything else that we ’ve done before ?
When is it something sufficiently new — and big — that it makes sense to create some major new structure for it ?
At least when we ’re doing design reviews for Mathematica kernel functions , we always have a very definite final objective for our meetings : we want to actually write the reference documentation — the “ function pages ” — for what we ’ve been talking about .
Because that documentation is what ’s going to provide the specification for the final implementation — as well as the final definition of the function .
It always works pretty much the same way : I ’ll be typing at my computer , and everyone else will be watching my screen via screen - sharing .
And I ’ll actually be writing the reference documentation for what each function does .
And I ’ll be asking every sentence or so : “ Is that really correct ?
Is that actually what it should do ? ”
And people will be pointing out this or that problem with what we ’re saying .
It ’s a good process , that I think does well at concentrating and capturing what we do in design analysis .
One of the things that happens in design reviews is that we finalize the names for functions .
Naming is a quintessential design review process .
It involves drilling down to understand with as much as clarity as possible what a function really does , and is really about .
And then finding the perfect word or two that captures the essence of it .
The name has to be something that ’s familiar enough to people who should be using the function that they ’ll immediately have an idea of what the function does .
But that ’s general enough that it wo n’t restrict what people will think of doing with the function .
Somehow the very texture of the name also has to communicate something about how broad the function is supposed to be .
If it ’s fairly specialized , it should have a specialized - sounding name .
If it ’s very broad , then it can have a much simpler name — often a much more common English word .
I always have a test for candidate names .
If I imagine making up a sentence that explains what the function does , will the proposed name be something that fits into that sentence ?
Or will one end up always saying that the function with name X does something that is described as Y ?
Sometimes it takes us days to come up with the right name for a function .
But usually one knows when it ’s right .
It somehow just fits .
And one can immediately remember it .
In Mathematica 6 , a typical case of function naming was Manipulate .
It took quite a while to come up with that name .
We created this great function .
But what should it be called ?
Interface ?
Activate ?
Dynamic ?
Live ?
What ?
Interface might seem good , because , after all , it creates an interface .
But it ’s a particular kind of interface , not a generic one .
Activate might be good , because it makes things active .
But again it ’s too generic .
Dynamic : again it sounds too general , and also a bit too technical .
And anyway we wanted to use that name for something else .
Live … that ’s a very confusing word .
It ’s even hard to parse when one reads it .
Does it say “ make it alive ” , or “ here ’s something that is alive ” , or what ?
Well , after a while one realizes that one has to understand with more clarity just what it is that this great new function is doing .
Yes , it ’s creating an interface .
Yes , it ’s making things active , dynamic , alive .
But really , first and foremost , what it ’s doing is to provide a way to control something .
It ’s attaching knobs and switches and so on to let one control almost anything .
So what about a word like Control ?
Again , very hard to understand .
Is the thing itself a control ?
Or is it exerting control ?
Handle ?
Again , too hard to understand .
Harness ?
A little better .
But again , some ambiguity .
And definitely too much of a “ horse ” motif .
Yoke ?
That one survived for several days .
But finally the oxen jokes overwhelmed it .
And then came Manipulate .
At first , it was , “ Oh , that ’s too long a word for such a great and important function . ”
But in my experience it often “ feels right ” to have a fairly long word for a function that does so much .
Of course there were jokes about it sounding “ manipulative ” .
But as we went on talking about the function , we started just calling it Manipulate among ourselves .
And everyone who joined the conversation just knew what it meant .
And as we went on developing all its detailed capabilities , it still seemed to fit .
It gave the right sense of controlling something , and making something happen .
So that ’s how Manipulate got its name .
It ’s worked well .
Still , in developing Mathematica 6 , we had to name nearly 1000 functions .
And each name has to last — just as the names in Mathematica 1 have lasted .
Occasionally it was fairly obvious what a function should be called .
Perhaps it had some standard name , say in mathematics or computing , such as Norm or StringSplit .
Perhaps it fit into some existing family of names , like ContourPlot3D .
But most of the time , each name took lots and lots of work to invent .
Each one is sort of a minimal expression of a concept that a primitive in Mathematica implements .
Unlike human languages that grow and mutate over time , Mathematica has to be defined once and for all .
So that it can be implemented , and so that both the computers and the people who use it can know what everything in it means .
As the Mathematica system has grown , it ’s in some ways become more and more difficult to do the design .
Because every new thing that ’s added has to fit in with more and more that ’s already there .
But in some ways it ’s also become easier .
Because there are more precedents to draw on .
But most importantly , because we ’ve gotten ( and I think I personally have gotten ) better and better at doing the design .
It ’s not so much that the quality of the results has changed .
It ’s more that we ’ve gotten faster and faster at solving design problems .
There are problems that come up today that I can solve in a few minutes — yet I remember twenty years ago it taking hours to solve similar problems .
Over the years , there ’ve been quite a few “ old chestnuts ” : design problems that we just could n’t crack .
Places where we just could n’t see a clean way to add some particular kind of functionality to Mathematica .
But as we ’ve gotten better and better at design , we ’ve been solving more and more of these .
Dynamic interactivity was one big example .
And in fact Mathematica 6 has a remarkable number of them solved .
Doing design reviews and nailing down the functional design of Mathematica is a most satisfying intellectual activity .
It ’s incredibly diverse in subject matter .
And in a sense always very pure .
It ’s about a huge range of fundamental ideas — and working out how to fit them all together to create a coherent system that all makes sense .
It ’s certainly as hard as anything I know about in science .
But in many ways it ’s more creative .
One ’s not trying to decode what exists in the world .
One ’s trying to create something from scratch — to build a world that one can then work within .
I use Mathematica 6 every day .
And every day I use countless design ideas that make all the pieces fit smoothly together .
And I realize that , yes , those 10,000 hours of design reviews were worth spending .
Even just for me , what we did in them will save me countless hours in being able to do so much more with Mathematica , so much more easily .
And now I ’m looking forward to all the design reviews we ’re starting to do for Mathematica 7 , and Mathematica 8 … .
As of 2019 , we ’ve reached Mathematica Version 12 ( which is also Wolfram Language Version 12 ) — with more than 6000 built - in functions .
And ABC news says :
I flew the two actual aircraft which were involved in 9/11 . . .
Fight number 175 and Flight 93 , the 757 that allegedly went down in Shanksville and Flight 175 is the aircraft that 's alleged to have hit the South Tower .
I do n't believe it 's possible for . . . a so - called terrorist to train on a 172 , then jump in a cockpit of a 757 - 767 class cockpit , and vertical navigate the aircraft , lateral navigate the aircraft , and fly the airplane at speeds exceeding it 's design limit speed by well over 100 knots , make high - speed high - banked turns , .. . pulling probably 5 , 6 , 7 G's . . .
I could n't do it and I 'm absolutely positive they could n't do it .
“ At the Pentagon , the pilot of the Boeing 757 did quite a feat of flying .
I have 6,000 hours of flight time in Boeing 757’s and 767’s and I could not have flown it the way the flight path was described . ”
* * *
“ I was also a Navy fighter pilot and Air Combat Instructor and have experience flying low altitude , high speed aircraft .
I could not have done what these beginners did .
Something stinks to high heaven ! ”
How difficult would it have been to fly a Boeing 757 into the Pentagon in the manner observed on 9/11 ?
Well , the head of the flight school where the supposed pilot of the planes which crashed into the Pentagon said that neither the hijacker or he himself could have performed such flying feats in a Boeing 757 Military and aviation professionals tracking the plane on radar had a similar reaction :
Air Force captain and commercial pilot Russ Wittenberg , with over 30,000 hours flown , said And top gun navy pilot , Commander Ralph Kolstad , says
" The maneuver at the Pentagon was just a tight spiral coming down out of 7,000 feet .
And a commercial aircraft , while they can in fact structurally somewhat handle that maneuver , they are very , very , very difficult .
And it would take considerable training .
In other words , commercial aircraft are designed for a particular purpose and that is for comfort and for passengers and it's not for military maneuvers .
And while they are structurally capable of doing them , it takes some very , very talented pilots to do that .
...
When a commercial airplane gets that high , it get very , very close to getting into what you refer to as a speed high - speed stall .
And a high - speed stall can be very , very violent on a commercial - type aircraft and you never want to get into that situation .
I just can't imagine an amateur even being able to come close to performing a maneuver of that nature .
***
Commercial airplanes are very , very complex pieces of machines .
And they 're designed for two pilots up there , not just two amateur pilots , but two qualified commercial pilots up there .
And to think that you 're going to get an amateur up into the cockpit and fly , much less navigate , it to a designated target , the probability is so low , that it 's bordering on impossible . "
extremely difficult
thousands of hours of combat - level flying experience in large aircraft
So how could
It is not reasonable to believe that they could have pulled off the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon .
, have pulled it off ?
Or this guy , one of two totally inept wannabe pilots described by their flight instructor as " dumb and dumber " ?
These guys are flight school dropouts who could n't even fly a small airplane on the easiest possible flight plan .
It is not reasonable to believe that they could have pulled off the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon .
And retired Naval aviator and commercial airline pilot Ted Muga says : Everyone agrees : it would have beenfor even the world 's most experienced pilots -- with -- to have flown a Boeing 757 into the Pentagon in the manner observed on 9/11 .
彼は何のカーネルを学んだのだろうか。*1最近の実用OSのソースコードってLinuxにせよWindowsにせよ、SMP対応のチューニングとか電源管理のために核の部分まで非常に複雑になってしまい、読んだりコードを追って動きを理解するのは難儀ではないか。Minixなら教育を意識して平易に実装されているしドキュメントも充実しているから読みやすいし、" Lions’ Commentary on UNIX ( Ascii books ) " に至っては昔はこんなにシンプルだったかと衝撃を受けるのだが。PDP-11のアセンブラなんて勉強したことないよとか、げ、これGOTO文とか細かいことを気にしてはいけない。Alan Kayが2万行でネットワークからGUIまで含んだ見通しのよい教育用OSを手掛けているらしいので楽しみにしている。とはいえ実務で触るのは複雑なOSなのだから早いうちから複雑なコードに見慣れておくこと自体が教育なのだという考え方もある。コンピュータ・アーキテクチャの全体像を押さえておきたいだけならばMinixでいいけれども、デバイスドライバ等のカーネルプログラミングを手掛けたければLinuxやWindows Research Kernel等で腰を据えて学んだ方がいいだろう。
カーネルって意外と汎用性のある知識ではある。特に最近の手に入りやすいOSってLinuxもBSDもMacintoshもWindowsも平準化してきて、ひとつ覚えれば何割かの概念は使い回せるようになった。技術史家としては平準化の背後にある構造に関心を抱きつつ、歴史的にはもっと多様な可能性が試みられたことに言及した上で、次の10年が組込系まで含めてMachライクになっているのか、意外とまたカンブリア大爆発っぽい展開も考えられるのか興味がある。
僕はカーネル技術を学ぶ価値に関して強調せずにはいられない。(略)そう感じるのは、僕がカーネルを学んだからである。
一般的に人は、既に学んだ事の価値は高く、まだ学んでいない事の価値は低く認識する物だ。だから、世の中は常に” 既に学んだ者”によって必要性が強調される。しかし、それらが真に価値ある事かどうかは別の問題である。
Although their lifetimes span billions of years , galaxies age , just like people .
As rambunctious young ’uns , they undergo bursts of star formation that create hot blue orbs out of the simple elements hydrogen and helium .
As galaxies grow older , they settle down .
Not only do their stars cool and become redder , but they eventually burn out and die , releasing into the galaxy heavier elements that formed in the stellar furnaces .
So astronomers have been repeatedly baffled by a peculiar , developmentally challenged galaxy called I Zwicky 18 .
When they first sighted it about 40 years ago , they thought it was a not - quite - billion - year - old toddler brimming with hot young stars , full of hydrogen and helium and possessing very few heavy elements , called metals .
Finding such a young galaxy near others that are at least 7 billion years old thrilled — and perplexed — the scientists .
But new observations from NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope have revealed ancient stars mingled with the young ones , proving the galaxy as a whole is in fact as old as its neighbors .
Astronomers do n’t know why this galaxy is so low on metals , or why it ’s forming so many new stars so late in the game .
It ’s possible that this relatively light galaxy has too little mass — or gravitational pull — to retain the metals , and that a rush of gas called a galactic wind swept them away .
Or maybe the galaxy ’s relatively isolated position caused it to develop slowly :
There are few other galaxies around to help seed star formation .
They also do n’t know why it ’s not happening in all dwarf galaxies .
“ It ’s possible that there are more out there like this , ” says Francesca Annibali , an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , who worked on the project .
“ If they are more common , then that means that some process is inhibiting star formation in small , low - metal environments . ”
Whatever the cause of I Zwicky 18 ’s strange history , its close resemblance to primordial galaxies offers a unique opportunity to study how stars acted in the early universe , something that normally cannot be observed at such close range .
This month , 69 - year - old Japanese sailor Ken-ichi Horie will attempt to captain the world ’s most advanced wave - powered boat 4,350 miles from Hawaii to Japan .
If all goes as planned , he ’ll set the first Guinness world record for the longest distance traveled by a wave - powered boat and , along the way , show off the greenest nautical propulsion system since the sail .
At the heart of the record - setting bid is the Suntory Mermaid II , a three - ton catamaran made of recycled aluminum alloy that turns wave energy into thrust .
Two fins mounted side by side beneath the bow move up and down with the incoming waves and generate dolphin - like kicks that propel the boat forward .
“ Waves are a negative factor for a ship — they slow it down , ” says Yutaka Terao , an engineering professor at Tokai University in Japan who designed the boat ’s propulsion system .
“ But the Suntory can transform wave energy into propulsive power regardless of where the wave comes from . ”
Horie ’s latest adventure builds on a storied career of eco-sailing .
In 1993 he pedaled a boat 4,660 miles , from Hawaii to Okinawa , setting a world record for the longest distance traveled by a pedal - powered boat .
In 1996 he set the world record for the fastest crossing of the Pacific Ocean in a solar - powered boat .
And in 1999 , he made a solo trip across the Pacific in a catamaran made from recycled beer barrels .
With a maximum speed of five knots , the Suntory will take two to three months to complete a voyage that diesel - powered craft accomplish in just one .
But speed is not the point .
The voyage aims to prove that wave propulsion can work under real - world conditions , opening up the technology for commercial applications such as cargo shipping .
“ Oil is a limited power source , ” Horie says , “ but there is no limit to waves . ”
How to Ride Waves Across the Pacific
Electricity : A set of eight solar panels produces 560 watts to run the navigation lights , ham radio , satellite phone and PC .
Propulsion : Dual fins set in a side - by - side configuration beneath the bow convert wave energy into a dolphin - like kick that can propel the three - ton boat at five knots .
Stability :
The fins absorb energy from the rocking of the boat to help make the propulsion more efficient .
Hull :
The outer hull , only three millimeters thick , is made of a durable recycled - aluminum alloy .
Price Gouging
The gouging price of oil – today reaching over $ 105 a barrel – is spiking gasoline and heating oil prices .
The price is being manipulated as a speculative commodity on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
A necessity for billions of people is now in the grip of speculators while producers and refiners are laughing all the way to the bank .
Where is our government ?
It is doing nothing .
The oil - marinated Bush regime and the oil - saturated Congress are leaving Americans defenseless .
Four dollar a gallon oil is coming , analysts declare .
Millions of poor Americans are shivering without adequate home energy assistance funds .
While Exxon / Mobil makes over $ 1700 a second .
And the bosses make tens of thousands of dollars each per hour .
Despite appeals , the giant oil companies will not contribute to these energy assistance funds .
Over two years ago , they rebuffed Senator Charles Grassley ’s request that they show some sympathy for the poor .
The major party candidates – McCain , Clinton and Obama – are not speaking out forcefully and demanding that the federal government investigate the causes of the skyrocketing price of oil .
They are not speaking out forcefully and demanding the Justice Department and Congressional committees use their subpoena powers to delve into the workings of the these mercantile exchanges , the timing and excessively long shutdowns of refineries for repair , and the resulting refinery shortages – which curtail supply and push prices upward .
Nor do they aggressively advocate for an excess profits tax on the oil industry – a tax which has been supported by American leaders ranging from former President Harry Truman to entrepreneur and CEO Jeno Paulucci .
I was intrigued by this couple after they appeared on Oprah Wednesday , February 27 .
I know it ’s been over a week .
Did you really think I caught the episode on Oprah ?
I heard about this from a friend who never misses the show .
Honestly !
OK , I watch it sometimes .
Daniel Burt is an eye doctor and his wife Amanda is a civil engineer living in Nashville .
Their hobbies include living a lifestyle that makes a statement against rampant overconsumption and wastefulness in America .
In other words , they dive in dumpsters to redeem things that have been thrown away .
Daniel explains , “ We try to live very simply , and we do n’t spend a lot on ourselves .
We are very happy with having a little .
We like to make it a priority to share a lot of our money .
A lot of that comes from our Christian values of sharing and generosity . ”
Amanda tells why donating their surplus discoveries to people in need is also helpful to the planet .
“ We just put it back into the system rather than into a landfill , ” she says .
Their blog gives a more detailed account of the beliefs and values behind their “ freegan ” lifestyle .
Daniel says that Americans represent 5 % of the world ’s population , but they use 30 % of the world ’s resources .
In part 2 of his 3 - part series of blog posts explaining why two professionals would take part in such an unusual lifetyle , Daniel sums it up this way :
We recycle and dumpster dive because we care about God ’s earth and its inhabitants , and we believe that consuming and wasting too much of the planet ’s resources is destroying both .
It ’s time we started loving our neighbors by shredding our credit cards and treading lightly on the earth … somewhere other than a shopping mall .
The couple believes that freeganism goes beyond recovering usable “ waste ” from ending up in the landfill .
It is a lifestyle that begs the question , “ Why do we have so much waste in the first place ? ”
To try to take the edge off the ick factor , the Burts make it clear that they are n’t trying to tell everyone they should go do a swan dive into the nearest dumpster .
What they hope to do is help people begin to come up with creative ways of living less wasteful and less consumptive lifestyles .
So what do you think , Green Options Nation ?
Would you snatch perfectly good items out of a corporate dumpster that would otherwise be headed for the landfill , even if it meant getting a little dirty ?

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- The Great Unwind has begun , Citigroup Inc. strategists warned on Wednesday .
As markets and economies de-leverage across the globe , investors should avoid companies and countries that have grown to rely too much on borrowed money , they said .
That means favoring public - equity markets over hedge funds , private - equity and real estate , while leaning toward emerging market countries and away from developed nations like the U.S. , the bank 's global equity strategy team advised .
Within equity markets , the financial - services should be avoided because it 's still over - leveraged , while other companies have stronger balance sheets , the strategists said .
" Steady growth , low inflation and rock - bottom interest rates encouraged economic and financial participants across the world economy to gear up over the past few years , " Robert Buckland and his colleagues on Citi 's global strategy team wrote in a note to clients .
" Easy money encouraged many to buy a bigger house , a bigger car or a bigger speculative position . "
" But now , any behavior that relied upon continued access to easy money is being dramatically reassessed , " they added .
" Leveraged banks must lend less , leveraged consumers must consume less , leveraged companies must acquire or invest less , and leveraged speculators must speculate less . "
Financial - services companies are the most vulnerable to this reduction of borrowed money across the globe , they said .
During the last credit crisis in 1998 , European banks were leveraged 26 to 1 .
In the early part of this decade , leverage grew to 32 to 1 .
Now the sector is geared 40 to 1 on average , according to Citi's European bank research team .
" The banks have a long way to go , " the strategists said .
" We would continue to avoid the sector while they are de-leveraging . "
Other companies are in much better shape , having rebuilt cash from strong earnings since 2003 .
Emerging market companies have developed particularly strong balance sheets , having learnt hard lessons from the Asian financial crisis a decade ago .
However , even though some companies may not have much debt themselves , they may be exposed to over - leveraged customers or highly leveraged investors , Citigroup warned .
Automakers , home builders and electronics retailers benefited as customers borrowed money cheaply in recent years to buy cars , houses and flat - screen TVs .
That attractive financing is now being withdrawn .
" There will be plenty of companies that have strong balance sheets , so may not be most immediately vulnerable to the credit crunch , " Citi C , - 2.12 % said .
" But they may find that their leveraged customers are vulnerable . "
The difference , or spread , between interest rates on investment - grade corporate bonds and Treasury bonds has jumped in recent months , even though most companies are n't very leveraged .
This widening may be caused by leveraged investors such as hedge funds having to sell good quality assets to meet margin calls , or requests for more cash or collateral .
" It is the leverage of the investors who hold these bonds that is now being brutally exposed , " Matt King , a Citigroup credit strategist , said .
" We are now confronted by a broad bloodbath in the credit markets , " Citigroup said . "
The most leveraged paper is falling in value because it is leveraged , and now the least leveraged paper is also falling in value because it is owned by leveraged investors . "
Investors should also avoid hedge funds themselves , along with private equity , Citi added .
Both types of investment rely at least partly on borrowed money to generate returns .
" Private equity returns have been especially strong .
Without leverage it will be much harder to meet excessive investor expectations [ most surveys suggest 20 % annual returns are expected from the asset class ] , " Citi warned .
" Similarly , many hedge funds have generated healthy uncorrelated returns by adopting cautious underlying strategies , but applying significant leverage .
Again , that looks unsustainable in the current environment . "
Leveraged economies , like the U.S. , should also be avoided , in favor of emerging market countries , which have reduced borrowing , the bank advised .
With less capital sloshing around the world , and the dollar falling , the U.S. may have to compete more to finance its deficits .
" The U.S. shows up as the world 's greatest consumer of external capital , " Citi noted .
So it " has the most to lose as this capital becomes less freely available . "
The 158 - page bundle of internal Microsoft e-mails ( PDF ) that Judge Martha Pechman ordered unsealed as part of the ongoing " Vista Capable " lawsuit contains a great deal of interesting information .
We 've previously covered how the e-mails within the evidentiary document describe the changes Microsoft made to the definition of Vista Capable in order to improve Intel 's quarterly earnings , but that 's not the only gem within the document .
According to Microsoft's own included documentation , the widespread reports of NVIDIA Vista driver issues were by no means exaggerated during Vista 's first months .
NVIDIA had significant problems when it came time to transition its shiny , new G80 architecture from Windows XP to Windows Vista .
The company 's first G80 - compatible Vista driver ended up being delayed from December to the end of January , and even then was available only as a beta download .
In this case , full compatibility and stability did not come quickly , and the Internet is scattered with reports detailing graphics driver issues when using G80 processors for the entirely of 2007 .
There was always a question , however , of whether or not the problems were really that bad , or if reporting bias was painting a more negative picture of the current situation than what was actually occurring .
Microsoft 's data strongly indicates that the problems were real .
Damon Poeter at CRN dug through the documentation to find that on page 47 of the PDF , NVIDIA drivers were identified as the cause of over 479,000 crashes , or just under 29 percent of all the crashes Microsoft logged .
Microsoft 's own drivers follow , at 17.9 percent , and the " Unknown " category takes third place at 17 percent .
ATI is in fourth place ( 9.3 percent ) and Intel in fifth place ( 8.83 percent ) .
The data points in the table cover an unspecified period in 2007 , and Microsoft makes no attempt to break the aggregate data down into which device drivers , specifically , returned the highest number of crashes .
If the number of failures were split by month and then graphed , we 'd presumably see the number of NVIDIA driver failures per month decreasing as the company slowly brought its driver issues under control .
The data clearly indicates that NVIDIA had a driver problem , but it 's impossible to quantify the scope of that problem given the numbers above .
NVIDIA holds a greater percentage of the market than ATI , which means that there will inevitably be a higher percentage of NVIDIA driver crashes than ATI driver crashes ; however , the degree to which such market share considerations have affected the results above is hard to determine in the absence of more data .
There 's also the matter of data collection ; Microsoft 's charts do not clarify if multiple crashes from a single system each counted as separate events .
In theory , NVIDIA 's proportion of total driver crashes could be inflated by a relatively small handful of systems with severe driver issues .
Driver problems are nothing new , particularly during the launch of a new OS , but the high incidence of NVIDIA driver crashes may have fueled public perception of Vista as an unstable and buggy OS .
Microsoft has always billed DirectX 10 as a next - generation enthusiast feature , but in early 2007 the only DX10 - capable parts were limping under the combined burden of buggy drivers and the increased computational demands of DX10 games .
NVIDIA 's early - to - midyear Vista issues may not have counted for much , given that few consumers actually purchase enthusiast - level graphics cards , but the company 's problems were an additional drag on the perception of Vista at a time when Redmond could least afford it .
Are there more atheists and agnostics in this country than is commonly supposed ?
Two studies -- last week ’s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey from the Pew Forum and one published two years ago -- suggest so .
The 2006 study from the University of Minnesota does not examine the question of how many non- believers there are but rather makes clear the troubling depth of Americans ’ distrust of them .
Asked whether they would disapprove of a child ’s wish to marry an atheist , 47.6 % of the 2,000 randomly selected people interviewed said yes .
When asked the same question about Muslims and African Americans , the respondents ’ “ yes ” responses fell to 33.5 % and 27.2 % , respectively , and the responses dealing with Asian Americans , Latinos and other groups were lower .
When asked which groups did not share their vision of society , 39.5 % of those interviewed mentioned atheists -- again , a level of distrust far in excess of that shown to other groups .
Sociologist Penny Edgell , the study ’s lead researcher , called the results “ a glaring exception to the rule of increasing tolerance over the last 30 years . ”
The recent study by the Pew Forum reports on the religious affiliations of Americans .
It notes that the percentage of self - declared Protestants , although still a bit over 50 % , is shrinking ; that Catholics make up just shy of 25 % of the population , a figure that would be declining were it not for recent immigrants ; and that the number of denominations is rising .
The study also notes a significant increase in movement from one religious affiliation to another , with almost half of the 35,000 people who participated in this extensive survey saying that they had switched religions .
Advertisement
Of interest to me , however , is that almost one in six ( 16.1 % ) of the respondents said they are not affiliated with any particular religious faith , and this figure rises to one in four for 18 - to 29 - year - olds .
Of course , unaffiliated does not mean irreligious , but 4 % of Americans say exactly that , with 1.6 % and 2.4 % describing themselves as atheists and agnostics , respectively .
The remaining 12 % who are unaffiliated are split more or less in half between those who say they are secular and unaffiliated and those who say they are religious but unaffiliated .
Let me put the two studies together and speculate a bit .
Given the negative attitudes toward atheists documented in the Minnesota study , and considering that most people probably do n’t see much advantage in incurring the distrust of their religious neighbors and colleagues , the testimony of many people formally classified as religious is suspect .
Some nonbelievers , it seems to me , are likely either to lie and say they belong to some established creed , or to fudge their responses by saying they ’re spiritual and believe in a nebulously defined God , or are simply unsure .
Whenever surveys , especially surveys of sexual practices , religious beliefs or potentially unpopular opinions , ask people to self - report , the results are dubious .
Few American men acknowledged suffering from erectile dysfunction before the introduction of Viagra , yet as ads assure us , millions of motorcycle - riding , party - loving cowboys seem to suffer from it now .
There is also a definitional problem .
The question of religious belief is a nuanced one , and different people who hold similar beliefs and are willing to tell the truth will nevertheless give different answers depending on how they interpret necessarily ambiguous questions .

The conclusion I draw is that the number of nonbelievers in a conventionally described God is in the tens of millions and is not limited to angry “ neo-atheists ” and Madalyn Murray O’Hair clones .
Moreover , I think a more fruitful distinction than the one between atheists and theists is the one between those who acknowledge that there are no compelling logical arguments for believing in God ( even if they choose to believe anyway ) and those who are sure of their God and the literal truth of their particular holy book .
There is a bravery and a wisdom associated with disbelief and honest doubt .
As my father used to say , “ Uncertainty is the only certainty there is . ”
More biting is William Butler Yeats ’ line : “ The best lack all conviction , while the worst are full of passionate intensity . ”

COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
HIGHER BALANCE , LLC , an Oregon
Limited Liability Company , dba HIGHER
BALANCE INSTITUTE , Plaintiff
v .
QUANTUM FUTURE GROUP , INC , a
California corporation , and LAURA
KNIGHT- JADCZYK , Defendants .
Plaintiff Higher Balance LLC , dba Higher Balance Institute ( " HBI " ) files this Complaint against defendants Quantum Future Group , Inc. ( " QFG " ) and Laura Knight - Jadczyk and alleges the following :
... defendants committed intentional torts that were purposefully targeted at HBI within the State of Oregon ; defendants knew that HBI is a resident of the State of Oregon ; defendants ' tortious conduct cause HBI to suffer economic harm within the State of Oregon ; HBI 's claims arise out of defendants ' activities relating to the State of Oregon ; and the exercise of jurisdiction over defendants is reasonable in light of their intentional misconduct directed towards a resident of the State of Oregon .
As this Court has specific personal jurisdiction over the defendants , venue is proper in this district and division under 28 U.S.C 1391 ( a ) ( 3 )
General Allegations :
HBI is an Oregon - based company with over 40,000 customers from all over the world .
HBI is dedicated to helping its customers relieve stress , reduce anxiety , and achieve emotional balance and spiritual enlightenment through meditation techniques .
The majority of HBI 's revenues are derived from the online sale of its books and CDs , which are designed to help its customers learn these meditation techniques .
[ Etc . .. ]
Defendant QFG operates a website known as Signs of the Times ( " SOTT " ) .
QFG posts articles and sponsors forums regarding various conspiracy theories and allegedly corrupt organizations on the SOTT website .
Employees and agents of QFG , including defendant Knight - Jadczyk , serve as administrators and moderators of SOTT forums .
QFG employees and agents , including defendant Knight - Jadczyk , post comments and analyses in SOTT forums .
These employees and agents act within the course and scope of their agency for QFG when serving as administrators and moderators of the SOTT website and when posting comments and analyses on the SOTT website .
SOTT forums are available to the general public online .
... Many of HBI 's existing and potential customers read the SOTT website as a source of alternative media ....
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF - Defamation - Libel
.... Beginning in May 2006 , QFG sponsored a forum on the SOTT website concerning HBI under the heading " COINTELPRO . "

a. HBI is a " front for pedophilia " ;
b. HBI is a " cointelpro " organization ;
c. Meditation , as sold by HBI , is an act of " falling into confluence with a psychopathic reality " ;
d . Those associated with HBI must be careful to avoid sexual molestation by HBI members ;
e. HBI is conning the public ;
f. " Fishy sexual conduct is occurring at HBI ; and
g. HBI " leads people more deeply into sleep . "
By posting these statements in a public internet forum , defendants have published and communicated false and baseless accusations concerning HBI to third parties , including existing and potential HBI customers .
Defendants ' statements tend to subject HBI to hatred , contempt , and ridicule and tend to diminish the esteem , respect , goodwill and confidence in which HBI is held by the public and by its customers .

Attorneys for Higher Balance Institute
A 39 - year - old Aloha man who promises spiritual awakening through meditation books and CDs he sells on the Internet is facing sex - abuse charges .
Beaverton police Detective Mike Smith said Eric J. Pepin runs what appears to be a cult out of his Higher Balance Institute on Southwest Second Street in Beaverton .
Pepin was arraigned Tuesday in Washington County criminal court on one count of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct , two counts of second - degree sexual abuse , and four counts of third - degree sexual abuse .
He was released after posting $ 26,750 cash , or 10 percent of $ 267,500 bail .
A trial was set for Sept. 12 .
Using a child in a sexual display is a Measure 11 crime punishable by a mandatory minimum of 5 years and 10 months in prison .
Jamison Dwight Priebe , 21 , who works for Pepin and lives at the same address in the 19600 block of Southwest Cooperhawk Court in Aloha , also was arrested on one count each of using a child in a sexual display and third - degree sexual abuse .
Priebe and Pepin turned themselves in at the Washington County Jail last week after a grand jury handed down secret indictments .
Priebe was released after posting $ 25,375 cash bail and is awaiting arraignment Monday .
Smith said a man who is now 20 was 17 and working for Pepin when he allegedly was sexually abused at the Higher Balance office in the 11900 block of Southwest Second Street in Beaverton and at Pepin 's former home in the city .
A call to the Higher Balance Institute on Wednesday was answered by a " Personal Star Reach Coach , " who referred questions to Pepin 's private attorney , Sam Kauffman .
" The charges are false , and we are confident Mr. Pepin will be exonerated , " Kauffman said .
Pepin's
Web site claims he has located more than 100 missing persons and runaways , along with U.S. Navy submarines , through a psychic ability he calls " remote viewing . "
Pepin 's meditation systems , which sell for $ 79 to $ 149 , help customers develop their " sixth sense " and apply it " inward to awaken a dimensional universe within the mind , " the Web site says .
According to an affidavit Smith filed with a request for a search warrant , the alleged victim told police that Internet customers who rave about Pepin 's teachings are men and women usually older than 35 .
But , the man said Pepin told him he should recruit " good - looking men " between the ages of 18 and 24 to work for him .
The court record also says Pepin knew the man was 17 when he forced him to perform sex acts .
The boy , Smith wrote , " was taught by Pepin to believe that the sexual contact was only a spiritual necessity . "
But after a while , the affidavit says , the boy decided he was being used by Pepin , who bought him meals and paid him $ 200 after sex .
The man contacted Beaverton police in January .
Smith said anyone who may have had underage sexual contact with Pepin should call him at 503-526-2280 .
Smith said the man accusing Pepin told police he met one of Pepin 's followers at Beaverton Town Square in April 2004 .
He told Smith the recruiter invited him to meet Pepin and see him demonstrate levitation .
Pepin introduced himself dressed in a robe emblazoned with the words " Master Eric " and a triangular symbol and told the victim to take off his shirt , the detective said .
" It 's a cult , " Smith said , " anytime you have a guy who fancies himself as the master , the leader . "
Beaverton police Detective Mike Smith said Pepin operated the Higher Balance Institute in Beaverton .
Smith said the ornate robe emblazoned " Master Eric " turned up during a search .
Institute leader acquitted of sex charges
HOLLY DANKS - HILLSBORO -- A Washington County Circuit judge called the leader of a metaphysical Internet sales company manipulative and controlling and his testimony unbelievable , even as he acquitted him Wednesday of charges that he had sex with an underage boy .
Judge Steven L. Price , after a five - day trial without a jury , found Eric James Pepin , 40 , not guilty of two counts of second - degree sexual abuse , four counts of third - degree sexual abuse and one count of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct .
Also acquitted of third - degree sexual abuse and using a child in a pornographic display was Jamison Dwight Priebe , 21 , who has worked for Pepin 's Higher Balance Institute since he was 18 .
" Everybody has stood by me who knows me , " Pepin said Wednesday after hugging supporters .
" They had faith in me , prayed for me .
I told them I would n't let them down .
I did nothing of what was alleged .
I 've been nothing but honorable and impeccable . "
However , Price said it was " probable that the conduct alleged in all counts occurred , " but he was n't convinced beyond a reasonable doubt .
" There 's a lack of strong corroboration , " such as a date - stamp on a videotape of the sexual encounter , the judge said .
The accuser testified Pepin had him take off his shirt the first day they met at Pepin 's Beaverton home in April 2004 .
" He was going to try and fix my energy and he needed me to trust him , " the accuser said .
Pepin touched the teen's " chakra points " on his heart , head and lower abdomen .
" Eric asked me to tell him everything I had done in my life that I was ashamed about , " the teen added .
The accuser said Pepin asked him how old he was the first day they met and that he told him the truth .
" He said students had to be 18 because he did n't like parents fussing around , " the accuser said .
But within days the two were having sex , including a three - way encounter with Priebe , the youth testified .
Pepin called it " crossing the abyss , " the accuser said , " surrendering yourself to your teacher , your master . "
Pepin testified he is gay and has had sexual relationships with most of his 11 employees , but not before they were 18 .
Pepin said he gave his accuser a job , even though the teen was a poor worker , and continued to be intimate with him and give him money after he was fired , to help him out .
Stephen A. Houze , Pepin 's private defense attorney , called the accuser a liar more than 100 times in his closing argument and noted that Pepin was " the perfect patsy " because society wants to believe the worst of a gay man .
Houze said the accuser brought the charges because he wanted to shake down Pepin .
Pepin's Higher Balance Institute , now on Northwest Saltzman Road in Cedar Mill , reached an annual high of $ 2 million in Internet sales of meditation CDs , tapes and books before his arrest in July .
Pepin touts himself as a psychic and " remote viewer " who has found lost submarines and missing people , and says he created the " psychic pill " Magneurol6 - S that enhances brain function , heals nerve damage , heightens paranormal experiences and relieves stress for $ 79 a bottle .
Andrew Erwin , deputy district attorney , called Higher Balance nothing more than a sex cult run by a " snake oil " salesman who preys on the troubled .
The accuser had nothing to gain by going to police and turned down $ 250,000 from Pepin to drop the sex charges , Erwin said .
" I 'm disappointed , " Erwin said of the verdicts .
" The judge wants proof beyond all doubt and that 's too high a standard . "
Yesterday , as I was working on finishing up the next installment of the Comet Series of Articles , FedEx delivered a packet of mail from our corporate registered agent in the U.S.
It was " Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial " filed in the State of Oregon by Eric Pepin 's Higher Balance Institute , LLC .
The reason ?
A discussion on the SOTT Forum that begins HERE Well , that was entertaining enough when you think about the fact that the discussion that he objects to was centered on several newspaper articles that describe his close calls with the legal system in Oregon over charges of sex abuse .
The legal document I received is 10 pages long so I 'm just going to summarize it here .
If you want to read the whole thing ( it 's hilarious beyond belief ! ) go HERE for the pdf .
Whoah !
That 's some heavy duty stuff , eh ?
Sounds like we just ripped up on that poor guy for no reason at all !
But that 's not quite the situation .
The original article about Eric Pepin that was brought to our attention on page 5 of the above - mentioned forum thread read as follows :
In another story from Associated Press found HERE , we read :
Well , I 've been falsely accused of trying to start a cult myself , so I might ordinarily have had sympathy for Pepin , but when I read the bit about the robe , I blew my tea through my nose .
I guess that 's why I 'm such a failure as a cult - leader ( aside from the fact that I 'm not interested in the job ) - I hardly ever wear anything other than sweats and bedroom slippers and spend all my time working !
In any event , even though a grand jury felt that there was enough evidence to indict Pepin , he was eventually acquitted in trial before a judge as the following report informs us :
And now , Pepin wants to sue QFG and yours truly for talking about these articles , published in a newspaper and scattered across the web ( though all of them are no longer on the newspaper 's website , wonder what 's up with that ? ) !!
Notice that Pepin , himself , revealed his " sex cult " practices in his own testimony .
We 'll be trying to get transcripts of the trial to publish so our readers can hear it from the horse 's mouth ; stay tuned for that .
Notice also that Pepin 's attorney , Houze , accused the victim of bringing charges because he wanted to shake down Pepin even though the kid turned down 250 K hush money offered by Pepin .
Well , maybe that 's what gave Pepin the idea of suing me .
Only thing is , he 's gonna have a hard time collecting his 4.47 million because I do n't own a thing , live in a rented house , drive a used car and QFG rarely has more than a grand in the bank at any given time .
When we have fund - raisers , the funds are used almost instantly , repaying loans and covering basic expenses for the site and equipment .
It 's also humorous that Pepin is suingwhich only sponsors a world - wide group of independent researchers who , together , make up sott .
net .
QFG does n't own sott , nor does QFG have any employees nor any official oversight of anything that the sott .
net researchers say or do .
But the bottom line is this : Eric Pepin is convicted out of his own mouth .
I mean , what kind of teacher of meditation says that he has sex with all his employees ?
And all of them young men ?
Nope , we are n't backing down .
We firmly believe , based on available official documents and court records , that Eric Pepin is a danger to innocent people looking for spiritual guidance .
Obviously , young guys just looking for sex and money and a good time will be delighted to take his pills , listen to his tapes and attend his retreats .
But the wider public who are not aware of these things in Pepin 's background , who are not aware that even the judge who acquitted him regretted having to do so , and that the Prosecutor of the case was also convinced that justice had NOT been done , need to be warned about such individuals in our society .
Maybe Eric Pepin will take Sott. net down , we do n't know .
We do n't have money for an expensive defense attorney , we barely stay afloat .
But even if that happens ( and we hope our readers will help us out now as never before ) , there are others who know and I do n't think that Eric Pepin and all his minions can track down and silence all of them .
Even if you can't give to our legal defense fund , I will appreciate letters of support during this trying time .
Write to sott ( at ) sott.net and I will try to answer each and every one .
And thanks to all our readers for your constant support and encouragement .

( text in Dutch )
Looking through the current swathe of publishers ' catalogues , I was fascinated to note the long - delayed unveiling of a biography that literary London has had raptly in its sights since at least the middle of the last decade .
It would be horribly unfair of me to name the biographee ( a distinguished British novelist , dead these last 10 years ) or the equally distinguished author , for most of this fascination stems not from the book 's prospective merits , but from the existence of a kind of guerrilla warfare conducted by X the biographer and his subject Y almost from page to page .
Basically , X , having cheerfully accepted the publisher 's commission all those years ago , discovered at an early stage in the proceedings that he did n't much like the man he was writing about .
When he found , slightly further down the road , that the dislike had turned to loathing , it was all he could do , apparently , to finish the work .
Curiously enough , this phenomenon is a great deal commoner than it sounds .
Obviously , there are professional anti-biographers grimly at work - Kitty Kelley , for instance , or the late Albert Goldman , sedulous stitcher - up of Elvis Presley and others - who simply begin by assuming the worst and go on from there .
Most biographers , though , start by adducing some mild affinity with their subject , or at the very least extending some faint respect to the career , the achievement or the personality .
But postwar biography is littered with the bones of supposedly absorbing subjects whose personalities turned out to be so rebarbative or uninspiring that teams of potential anatomists tried , laboured , and gave up .
Never mind the long years of work you have to put in , the interviews with the deceased 's surviving acquaintances , the search - if the subject has been done before - for that striking new angle , that unknown love - child , that choir - boy fetish : biography requires a long - term emotional commitment .
Five years in a study with someone you do n't actually like ?
There are easier ways of making a living .
My own particular biographer 's dilemma started with the discovery , in the files of the publisher Victor Gollancz Ltd , of a letter sent to Gollancz himself in the spring of 1933 .
The writer , Mr GM Lipsey , had read a copy of George Orwell 's newly published Down and Out in Paris and London .
He was furious , not only with Orwell but also with his publisher .
" On its merits or otherwise I have no desire to comment , " he commented .
" But I am appalled that a book containing insulting and odious remarks about Jews should be published by a firm bearing the name ' Gollancz ' . "
A spirited correspondence followed .
There were threats of legal action , and finally the row fizzled out .
Its shadow , though , hangs over much of Orwell 's early writings , and indeed his whole attitude towards Jews , Jewishness and , later on , the foundation of a Zionist state .
Having read and annotated Down and Out in Paris and London half a dozen times , I was aware of the book 's " Jew " references , just as one is aware of them in , to select a random handful of Orwell 's 30s contemporaries , the work of Anthony Powell , JB Priestley , TS Eliot and Graham Greene .
Reading it again , in the light of the Lipsey remonstrance , I was struck by how oddly gratuitous they are .
Barely has the third chapter been reached , for example , before a hard - up Orwell is unloading clothes in a Parisian secondhand shop to " a red- haired Jew , an extraordinarily disagreeable man " .
Now , one can be disagreeable and a Jew , but the faint hint that the connection has a racial basis is somehow reinforced by the coda .
" It would have been a pleasure to have flattened the Jew 's nose , if only one could have afforded it .
" Back in London , Orwell wanders into a coffee shop near Tower Hill where " in a corner by himself a Jew , muzzle down in the plate , was guiltily wolfing bacon . "
How does Orwell know the bacon - wolfer is a Jew ?
And how does he know that the emotion he detects in his face is guilt ?
There is something loaded , too , about the reference to a " muzzle " , as if the man is not quite human , and the explanation for this sub-humanity has something to do with being Jewish .
One could ignore this , just possibly , if it existed in a single book .
And yet for 10 years the abstract figure of " the Jew " makes regular appearances in Orwell 's diaries .
Out tramping in the early 30s , he falls in with " a little Liverpool Jew , a thorough guttersnipe " with a face that recalls " some low - down carrion bird " .
Watching the crowds thronging the London underground in October 1940 , he decides that what is " bad " about the Jews is that they are not only conspicuous but go out of their way to make themselves so .
He is particularly annoyed by " a regular comic - paper cartoon of a Jewess " who literally fights her way on to the train at Oxford Circus .
Again , it is perfectly possible that the woman in question resembled an extra from Fiddler On The Roof and that the incident took place exactly as Orwell describes it .
Even so , it is a safe bet that no early 21st - century liberal will be able to read Orwell 's account without clenching their teeth .
It would be idle to classify Orwell as " anti-semitic " .
He had dozens of Jewish friends and kept a vigilant eye out for evidence of anti-semitism , both on theatre stages and in print .
In fact , the complexities of what he thought and wrote about Jews defy easy summary ( although it is worth pointing out that in an argument with Aneurin Bevan , he once referred to Zionists as " a gang of Wardour Street Jews " with a controlling interest over the British press . )
But having come across these attitudes , what do you do with them ?
Context , inevitably , is all .
The only sensible answer to anyone who suggests that , say , Thackeray was a racist or that Trollope hated Italians is : so what ?
There is a particular school of modern literary criticism which believes in what used to be called the Shakespeare and the Second - best Bed syndrome ( the reference is to the inferior piece of furniture bequeathed to the bard 's wife in his will ) - that if a writer holds to political and social views that are morally disgusting or behaves badly as a person , therefore his work will show similar flaws and should be similarly disregarded .
Thus Tom Paulin , for example , seems to believe that because Philip Larkin was a racist and a misogynist his work either should n't be studied or , if so , taught only to be disparaged .
On the other hand , there are people who will tell you that it is possible - in fact , desirable - to separate a writer 's life from his or her art , and to study the one in isolation from the other .
Obviously it is theoretically possible to make this separation .
But sooner or later anyone who studies the works of a particular poet or novelist is going to want to know about the life running on beneath , however subliminally or obliquely that knowledge will eventually influence what the reader thinks about the work .
Where does this leave Larkin ?
And to a slightly lesser extent , Orwell ?
From the biographer 's point of view - not , admittedly , the only point worth staring from - it ought to make them more , rather than less , interesting .
Pace Paulin , we should not be writing Larkin off as a racist but pondering the contrast between his venomous remarks about " niggers " and the extraordinary delicacy of his lament over the dead hedgehog scythed apart by his lawnmower .
Similarly , Orwell 's fixation with doling out the word " Jew " like a kind of party badge raises fundamental questions about the social milieu he inhabited and the upbringing that put stereotypes of this sort into his head .
Above all , perhaps - and this is a man regularly marked down by posterity as a secular saint - it makes him seem human in a way that much of the posthumous embalming of his reputation does not .
Meanwhile , I look forward to this autumn 's outpourings from Biographer X , the humanity of whose subject will , you feel , turn out to be rather more problematic .

Sadly , thinking of yourself as the Tupac of your NCAA office pool will not make his success sting any less .
Your boss 's daughter burst onto the scene in 2006 , when she correctly picked Florida and UCLA to go to the finals because " that 's where Mickey Mouse lives , " and Georgetown because her imaginary friend is named George .

Three powerful Democrats have circulated a " dear colleague " letter among their House colleages , arguing for a delay in acting on telco amnesty in light of new revelations
In a letter to lawmakers Thursday , panel Chairman John D. Dingell of Michigan , and two subcommittee chairmen , Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Bart Stupak of Michigan , said claims by the chief of security at an unnamed wireless carrier that the company may have given a government entity access to all of its customers ’ communications , justified further delay in considering the legislation .
" Because legislators should not vote before they have sufficient facts , we continue to insist that all House members be given access to the necessary information , including the relevant documents underlying this matter , to make an informed decision on their vote , " the trio wrote .
Babak Pasdar , chief executive of a security firm who was hired to upgrade security at the unnamed telecommunications company , said he discovered a third - party security breach traced to a governmental office in Quantico , Va. , home to a U.S Marine Corps base and the FBI Academy , the letter said .
Pasdar ’s allegations are similar to those of Mark Klein , a former AT&T technician whose claims support a lawsuit against the company being advanced by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , an internet privacy advocacy group .
The full text of the letter is available here [ pdf ] .
Mr. Pasdar 's allegations are not new to the Committee on Energy and Commerce , but our attempts to verify and investigate them further have been blocked at every turn by this Administration .
Moreover , this whistleblower 's allegations echo those in an affidavit filed by Mark Klein , a retired AT&T technician , in the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's lawsuit against AT&T .
The merits of these claims have yet to be assessed by the Federal judge assigned to that case .
Indeed , the court may not be able to assess them for quite some time , until the appellate courts finish sorting through threshold questions relating to the so - called " state secrets " doctrine .
Should these defenses prevail , the court will dismiss the lawsuits out of hand before reaching any question of whether or how much money damages to impose .
Even if the court permits the suits to go forward -- long before any monetary award is evaluated -- the court will have to determine whether the carriers did what the plaintiffs say they did .
In the meantime , the carriers who did -- and did not -- participate in wiretapping without court orders or warrants , are prohibited from talking the Congress .
The President will not let them .
However , he continues to ask that Members of this body , other than the limited number to whom he has given drudging and belated access , to vote in the dark .
Because legislators should not vote before they have sufficient facts , we continue to insist that all House Members be given access to the necessary information , including the relevant documents underlying this matter , to make an informed decision on their vote .
After reviewing the documentation and these latest allegations , Members should be given adequate time to properly evaluate the separate question of retroactive immunity .
The Democrats lining up against telco amnesty continues to grow , from these three long - time , respected members to the newest Democratic Congressman , Bill Foster , to the group of Freshman Democrats who have been specifically targeted by the Republicans with robocalls and fearmongering .
This is not going to be an election year issue .
The Republicans have done their worst against Democrats on the issue and it has n't worked .
There is no need to cave on telco amnesty .
A traditional windmill which drives a pump : that is the simple concept behind the combination of windmill / reverse osmosis developed by the Delft University of Technology ( TU Delft ) in The Netherlands .
In this case , it involves a high - pressure pump which pushes water through a membrane using approximately 60 bar .
This reverse osmosis membrane produces fresh water from seawater directly .
The windmill is suited for use by , for instance , small villages in isolated , dry coastal areas .
The combination of windmills and desalination installations is already commercially available .
These windmills produce electricity from wind power , the electricity is stored and subsequently used to drive the high - pressure pump for the reverse osmosis installation .
The storage of electricity in particular is very expensive .
Energy is also lost during conversion .
In the TU Delft installation , the high - pressure pump is driven directly by wind power .
Water storage can be used to overcome calm periods .
The storage of water is after all a great deal cheaper than that of electricity .
Robust
The chosen windmill is normally used for irrigation purposes .
These windmills turn relatively slowly and are also very robust .
On the basis of the windmill ’s capacity at varying wind speeds , it is estimated that it will produce 5 to 10 m3 of fresh water per day : enough drinking water for a small village of 500 inhabitants .
A water reservoir will have to ensure that enough water is available for a calm period lasting up to five days .
Three safeguards ( in the event of the installation running dry , a low number of revolutions or a high number of revolutions ) are also performed mechanically so that no electricity is needed .
Very slippery interview Romney did with a bunch of reporters in South Carolina in which he told them that he does n’t have lobbyists running his campaign .
An AP reporter then named a lobbyist who was even in meetings helping prepare Romney for the debates .
Romney then gets huffy and says that the lobbyist is n’t his campaign manager , so that means he does n’t “ run ” his campaign .
Uh ok .
So Romney has lobbyists running his campaign , they just do n’t “ run ” his campaign .
This is slippery as hell of Romney .
But perhaps the best part is at the end where Romney ’s staff scolds the AP reporter for being “ argumentative with the candidate . ”
First off , “ the candidate ” ?
What is he , God now ?
We ca n’t call him Mitt or Romney – no , it ’s “ the candidate . ”
Secondly , do n’t get argumentative ?
Uh , reporters are now not allowed to challenge presidential candidates on their lies ?
Maybe it ’s a Mormon thing .

Updated , 5:55 p.m. | A Buildings Department inspector , Edward J. Marquette , has been arrested and charged with lying to New York City authorities about inspecting the crane that collapsed on Saturday afternoon , killing seven people , injuring dozens of others and causing widespread property damage .
Officials issued a stern warning that corrupt workers will be punished , but said the failure to inspect the crane on March 4 was almost certainly not a factor in the deadly collapse , which officials think may have been caused by the failure of a nylon strap , which led to a large steel collar coming loose .
Rose Gill Hearn , the commissioner of the Department of Investigation , announced the arrest at a news conference shortly after 3 p.m. near the site of the collapse , at Second Avenue and East 51st Street in the Turtle Bay section of East Midtown , as officials gave an update on the effort to repair the damage and allow people back in to 18 buildings that had to be evacuated .
According to Ms. Hearn , a call to 311 was made on March 3 reporting concerns about the stability of the crane .
In response , Mr. Marquette claimed to have inspected the crane the following day .
“ Marquette made false statements on his route sheet indicating that he had inspected the crane , when in fact he had admitted to D.O.I. that he did not inspect the crane on March 4 , ” she said .
Officials emphasized that Mr. Marquette ’s failure to inspect the crane was likely not a factor in the collapse of the crane last Saturday , which occurred as operators were preparing to “ jump , ” or extend , the crane .
“ With regard to the crane accident itself , it is highly unlikely that a March 4 inspection would have prevented the horrific accident that happened on March 15 , which we are still looking at the probable cause being mechanical failure or human failure during the ‘ jumping ’ operations when the crane was raised , ” said Patricia J. Lancaster , the commissioner of the Department of Buildings .
The lack of an inspection , indeed , was probably not even “ remotely associated ” with the collapse , she said .
Indeed , the crane had been inspected several times before the March 15 collapse — most recently last Friday , on the eve of the collapse , when no violations were found .
Some equipment that was needed for extending the crane on Saturday had not even arrived at the work site by March 4 , Ms. Lancaster said .
Ms. Hearn , whose department investigates allegations of misconduct by city workers , noted , “ The investigation is ongoing and will take time , ” She added , “ We thought it was important to file charges on this discrete issue , to assure that this accident is being thoroughly investigated for any criminal charges but also , from the city ’s perspective , to determine if D.O.B. followed all proper procedures . ”
Mr. Marquette was arraigned in Criminal Court in Manhattan on one count of falsifying business records in the first degree and one count of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree , both felonies that can be punished by up to four years in prison .
Mr. Marquette did not speak or enter a plea and he was released until his next court date , April 10 , at the request of his lawyer , Kate A. Mogulescu of the Legal Aid Society .
Mr. Marquette , dressed in saggy blue workpants and black work boots and with several days ’ growth of beard , declined to speak to reporters after the hearing , dashing several blocks surrounded by friends with photographers and reporters in pursuit .
Prosecutors said that Mr. Marquette made entries on a Buildings Department inspector ’s route sheet indicating that on March 4 he had inspected a crane at a construction site at 301 East 51st Street .
But when Mr. Marquette was interviewed by investigators on Wednesday , he admitted that in fact he had failed to make the inspection , according to the criminal complained filed by the office of Robert M. Morgenthau , the Manhattan district attorney .
A law enforcement official said that investigators believed Mr. Marquette had in fact been on the job conducting inspections that day , but that he was not where he said he was .
The investigation into where he was and why he falsified the record is continuing , the official said .
Ms. Lancaster , whose department has been widely criticized since the accident for not having enough inspectors to handle the city ’s construction boom , spoke in blunt terms about her determination to root out corruption .
“ Today I suspended Marquette , ” she said .
“ We will not tolerate this kind of behavior at the Department of Buildings .
Since September 2002 we have been working closely with D.O.I. in an anticorruption program by issuing the first - ever code of conduct for the agency . ”
Ms. Lancaster said her department has a “ zero - tolerance policy on corruption , ” and added , “ I do not and will not tolerate any misconduct in my department . ”
She said :
In light of this episode , I ’ve done the following : I ’ve ordered reinspections of 100 percent of Marquette ’s inspections over the last six months , I ’ve requested the Department of Investigation to do a full audit of Marquette ’s inspection reports .
I ’ve requested the Department of Investigation to do a full audit of the entire cranes and derricks unit .
I ’ve redistributed the code of conduct to our entire agency and I ’ve also launched a full operational review of the cranes and derricks unit and ordered that associated applications and paperwork be made available on the Web so that they are apparent to the public .
City personnel records indicate that as of last year , Mr. Marquette , 46 , was paid a base wage of $ 47,326 a year , not including overtime .
Joseph F. Bruno , the commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management , joined Ms. Hearn and Ms. Lancaster at the news conference to give an update on the efforts to repair property damage and assist displaced residents .
Mr. Bruno said that nine of the 18 evacuated buildings have been reopened , including a large apartment building at 311 East 50th Street .
Among the properties that remain closed pending repair of structural damage are : 306 and 308 East 50th Street ; 301 East 50th Street , which was near the brick house that was demolished ; 954 Second Avenue ; 300-304 East 51st Street , the building upon which the body of the crane rested after the top sheared off ; and 301 and 311 East 51st Street .
Some city officials said they were shocked by the news of the arrest .
“ I am beyond outraged , ” Councilwoman Jessica S. Lappin , a Manhattan Democrat who lives on East 55th Street and whose district includes the area of the accident , said in a phone interview .
“ Somebody called 311 because they thought something was wrong .
If the charges were true and the inspector did n’t even inspect the site , how are we supposed to have faith in our public servants and in the D.O.B. inspectors ?
We do n’t know what this inspector would have seen , and seven lives were lost in this tragedy . ”
Scott M. Stringer , the Manhattan borough president , said in a statement : “ What more evidence do we need ?
It is clear we cannot trust the Buildings Department to keep construction sites safe .
We need now a complete top - to - bottom independent review of this department , its procedures and its personnel . ”

Like any other three - year - old child , Molly has brought joy to her parents .
Bright - eyed and cheerful , Molly is also deaf - and that is an issue which vexes her parents , though not for the obvious reasons .
Paula Garfield , a theatre director , and her partner , Tomato Lichy , an artist and designer , are also deaf and had hoped to have a child who could not hear .
' We celebrated when we found out about Molly 's deafness , ' says Lichy .
' Being deaf is not about being disabled , or medically incomplete - it 's about being part of a linguistic minority .
We 're proud , not of the medical aspect of deafness , but of the language we use and the community we live in . '
Now the couple are hoping to have a second child , one they also wish to be deaf - and that desire has brought them into a sharp confrontation with Parliament .
The government 's Human Fertilisation and Embryology ( HFE ) bill , scheduled to go through the Commons this spring , will block any attempt by couples like Garfield and Lichy to use modern medical techniques to ensure their children are deaf .
The bill is a jumbo - sized piece of legislation intended to pull together all aspects of reproductive science in Britain and pave the way for UK scientists to lead the field in embryology .
But in trying to do so , the civil servants drafting the bill have provoked a great deal of unrest .
' Paula is now in her early 40s , ' says Lichy .
' Our first daughter was born naturally , but due to Paula 's age , we may need IVF for the second . '
The trouble is that , according to clause 14/4/9 of the bill , the selection of a hearing child through IVF is permitted , but embryos found to have deafness genes will be automatically discarded .
' This sends out a clear and direct message that the government thinks deaf people are better off not being born , ' says Steve Emery , a sign - language expert at Heriot - Watt University .
This point is backed by Lichy .
' It is a cornerstone of modern society and law that deaf and hearing people have equal rights .
If hearing people were to have the right to throw away a deaf embryo , then we as deaf people should also have the right to throw away a hearing embryo . '
Garfield and Lichy say they will continue to try for a second baby naturally and will be happy if it is able to hear .
Yet their affront over the blocking of their use of IVF is intense .
' I find this shocking , detestable and utterly inhuman , ' says Lichy .
' I 'm a governor at a school for deaf children .
When I visit , I see a class of 30 deaf children , all happily signing to each other , running about and creating chaos .
Some will be artists , some will be accountants , some may go to Oxbridge , following the path that several of my deaf friends have already beaten .
If they had been conceived via IVF , and detected as deaf at that stage , then all would have been aborted before birth . '
The government is unlikely to change its mind over this issue , it appears .
Nevertheless , it illustrates the intense feelings that surround the embryology bill .
Its passage through the Commons is set to be one of the most passionately debated in recent years .
Designed to update the HFE
Act of 1990 , which in turn updated the Abortion Act of 1976 , the new bill has been drafted to ensure the law is compatible with modern medical practice .
Given the issues - from abortion to hybrid embryos - it covers , the bill was always going to stir controversy .
This point is demonstrated , somewhat unexpectedly , at Dr Warren Hern 's clinic in Boulder , Colorado .
Hern is one of a handful of specialists worldwide willing to perform abortions beyond 24 weeks ' gestation , the legal cut - off point in most of Europe for terminating a pregnancy .
And he is increasingly seeing British women for terminations that would be against the law in their home country , despite the fact that British providers - nervous of entering a legal grey area - refuse to refer them to him .
' They find me on the internet .
The consequences of the refusal to refer is that they are further along , higher risk and higher cost ( when I do see them ) , ' Hern told The Observer .
' This is cruel and unusual punishment for women who need this service in issues of foetal abnormality . '
Depending on the bill 's passage , his clinic could soon become a lot busier , however .
Tory backbencher and former nurse Nadine Dorries is to table an amendment to the bill which would reduce the upper limit for abortions in Britain from 24 to 20 weeks : David Cameron has pledged to support it .
Dorries argues there is evidence that babies above this age are sentient - capable of feeling pain - although the scientific evidence is hotly contested .
Dorries first thought there was no chance of changing the law but is now more confident : ' I only have to walk through the House of Commons and MPs say : " I am with you on 20 weeks , I do n't want to go any lower , do n't want to ban abortion , but I 'm with you . " '
Pro-choice campaigners , however , argue that the 2 per cent of abortions carried out every year after 20 weeks often involve severe abnormalities discovered only at the 20 - week scan , or drastic changes in personal circumstances such as a woman being abandoned by the father .
There are also frightened teenagers unable to accept they were pregnant or seek help early enough .
Changing the law , they argue , would simply drive these women - if they could afford it - to fly somewhere like Colorado .
' People find ways , ' says Louise Hutchins of the pro-choice pressure group Abortion Rights .
The Commons debate will concentrate on viability , the age at which a baby is considered to have a good chance of survival outside the womb .
Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo , who will steer the bill in the Commons , will tell MPs the medical consensus remains that babies cannot be considered viable below 24 weeks , which should remain the legal limit .
' The care of premature babies is clearly improving but it has n't improved to the point where you can move the point of viability , ' she told The Observer .
' There just is a certain time limit when things like lungs are formed .
Clearly if the science changes we would have to make that clear to Parliament , but it has n't . '
MPs will have a free vote on abortion , a traditional issue of conscience but Labour 's chief whip has rebuffed pleas from anti-abortion MPs to be given the same freedom over other controversial parts of the bill , from provisions on stem - cell therapy to animal - human hybrids .
A further issue provoking controversy has been the decision to include clauses that would require the use of all tissue used to create lines of stem cells to have the explicit consent of its donor , while another clause would block the use of any tissue from children , even if their parents give consent .
This has caused considerable concern because scientists take DNA from tissue of individuals with genetic conditions , insert this into a human or animal egg cell and then create stem cells , which can be grown in laboratories .
These cell lines have the same genetic defects as the patient .
New therapies can then be tested on them .
The new bill , as it stands , would have a devastating impact on this kind of medical research , as leading UK scientists - including three Nobel prize winners , Sir Martin Evans , Sir Paul Nurse , and Sir John Sulston - recently warned .
The law would be retrospective , so cell lines on which scientists are now working would have to be thrown out .
In addition , in the case of tissue taken from children , there is the problem that many of them have conditions that mean they will not reach adulthood and , therefore , could never give consent for taking their tissue at a later date .
The issues vex scientists .
To date , however , the government has refused to back down , further inflaming debate .
How the bill will finally emerge from the ensuing negotiations is difficult to determine .
One option being discussed is for chief whip Geoff Hoon to impose a ' soft whip ' , meaning Catholic cabinet ministers such as Ruth Kelly and Paul Murphy can be conveniently absent from the vote over issues conecrning abortion , rather than having to choose between their government and their consciences .
But Gordon Brown is said to be heavily personally committed to the bill , and to the cause of medical research .
His second son Fraser has cystic fibrosis - one of the conditions that could ultimately be cured by stem cell therapy .
Jérôme Kerviel , the man at the centre of the row over Société Générale 's multibillion euro losses , said today that he will not be scapegoated by his employer over the affair .
Speaking to French news agency Agence France Presse , Kerviel reportedly said he accepted " his share of responsibility " for the € 4.9bn ( £ 3.7 bn ) losses , but insisted that he was not solely to blame .
" I never had any personal ambition in this affair .
The aim was to earn money for the bank , " said Kerviel , who said he had " got carried away " and had not acted for personal gain .
" You lose your sense of the sums involved when you are in this kind of work .
It 's disembodied .
You get a bit carried away . "
In the interview , his first since news of the losses broke on January 24 , Kerviel also denied being suicidal or depressed .
French prosecutors have accused Kerviel of breach of trust , falsifying documents and breaching computer security .
SocGen claims that he evaded a range of internal controls to set up an unauthorised position worth about € 50bn on the future direction of European financial markets .
But yesterday , a report handed to French finance minister Christine Lagarde said that SocGen 's risk management and internal controls were inadequate .
This cast new light on the claim that the losses were the work of a single rogue trader .
While investigations continue , Kerviel 's new - found fame has sparked a small industry in spin - offs , including T - shirts and mugs , and thousands of bets on who might play him in a future film .
Turkey launched air strikes Tuesday night on rebel targets in northern Iraq , an Iraqi security source said on Wednesday .
Turkish warplane targeted the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) militants in the Sidekan area of Arbil province , but no casualties had been reported , the source said on conditional of anonymity .
The latest strikes came about a week after Turkey wrapped up across - border ground military operation going after the PKK members .
Earlier in the day , Turkish private NTV said helicopters bombed the Sidekan region , some 40 km inside the border .
Meanwhile , PKK spokesman Ahmed Danis confirmed that Wednesday 's attacks began at 3 a.m. local time ( 0100 GMT ) and continued during the day , with the focus on the Bazger valley area of Arbil province .
" The area is uninhabited and there were no reports of casualties or damage , " said Danis .
Turkey 's military has not yet confirmed the reports .
The Turkish military ended last Friday an eight - day groundincursion into northern Iraq .
Turkish army chief Yasar Buyukaniton Monday rejected suggestions that the incursion was cut short by U.S. pressure , saying that the military would launch further strikes on Kurdish rebels if needed .
On Feb. 21 , some 10,000 Turkish troops crossed the Iraqi border and rolled 10 km inside to crack down on PKK rebels , who have long taken refuge in the region and used it as a launch pad for attacks across the border .
The PKK , listed by the United States and Turkey as a terrorist group , took up arms against Turkey in 1984 with the aim of creating an ethnic homeland in southeastern Turkey .
More than 30,000 people have been killed in the over - two - decade conflict .

It ’s been widely reported that playing Rock Band drums is eerily similar to playing real world drums , far more so than any other fake plastic rock instrument .
Take it from Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopulous :
You can take a person that ’s playing on the expert levels in Rock Band on the drums and put them on a real drum set , and they can play the drums .
And I watched this happen with a Q&A staff of 25 - 30 people .
Maybe 2 or 3 of those had experience of being drummers , but they ’ve been playing the game for months now , and what we ’ve got is 30 drummers in the Q&A department who are pounding away in the Hard and Expert settings .
These people have learned the fundamentals of drums , and this is n’t abstracting fundamentals — you can put these people on a drum set and they have some basic skills now .
As a payoff for playing a video game , that ’s incredible !
Rock Band is going to be out there training this wave of new young drummers , and that ’s a really exciting aspect of the project for us .
Kevin , who regularly gets 98 to 99 percent on expert drums in Coheed and Cambria ’s “ Welcome Home ” , put that theory to the test in a recent epsiode of G4 ’s Attack of the Show .
He met with Coheed and Cambria and substituted for the real drummer !
How did he do ?
I do n’t want to spoil the surprise .
What did we learn here today , kids ?
Rock Band rocks — and so does Coheed and Cambria .

With today ’s announcement that Fidel Castro is stepping down as President of Cuba , the curtain is drawn on one of the longest international rivalries of the 20th Century .
Yes , Fidel ’s brother Raul is taking his place , and , yes , Cuba remains a one - party dictatorship , but this announcement leaves me with the feeling that we are seeing the beginning of the end of Cuba ’s totalitarian history .
Which leads to a question — is it time for the United States to lift it ’s near total embargo against Cuba ?
For the past 50 years , Americans have not been able to travel to Cuba ( although people do go there through Canada and Mexico ) , they have n’t been able to sell anything to the Cuban people , and they have n’t been able to buy anything from them .
The United States does n’t even have diplomatic relations with Cuba .
From the beginning , the rationale for the embargo was that the United States did n’t want to strengthen the Cuban regime , but that rationale never made sense .
Even during the height of the Cold War , we were trading with , and had diplomatic relations with , the USSR , China , and all of Eastern Europe behing the Iron Curtain .
We ’ve been trading with Vietnam for nearly two decades now and we have an ambassador there .
But not Cuba .
Politically , it ’s simply been impossible to even address this issue before now .
No President — Republican or Democrat — wanted to raise the opposition of the powerful anti-Castro Cuban lobby in South Florida .
But now that Fidel is basically gone , is n’t it time to start treating Cuba like every other nation in the world ?
I think the answer is yes .

NH State Rep. Betty Hall announces Public Hearing to Petition Congress for Impeachment
New Hampshire Representative Betty Hall announces Expert Witnesses to testify at Legislative Hearing for House Resolution 24 to Commence Impeachment Procedures in the US Congress .
Representative Betty Hall ’s focus on House Resolution 24 begins the process of Impeachment for the President and the Vice President at the State level .
In the State of New Hampshire , the procedure then goes to committee for a public hearing .
It is that hearing that welcomes expert witness and public comment and is scheduled at the State Legislative Office Building , Rooms 305 and 307 , Tuesday February 19 at 1:00 pm .
Key to New Hampshire ’s legislative process is the strong committee ’s recommendation for passive [ sic ] in the full House vote .
Because the committee level is crucial , Representative Hall has invited a number of expert witnesses to testify on five distinctive articles for Impeachment .
Witness testimony will include Selectman Dan De Walt VT , Herb Hoffman ME NEImpeach.org , John Kaminski Maine Lawyers for Democracy and Paul Lehto , Lawyer representing Election Integrity .
What is unique for NH citizens , is that every bill introduced and sent to committee receives a vote in the full House .
In NH there are 400 House legislators from a relatively small population state .
In order for HR24 to be brought to Washington DC , only House passage is needed , neither a vote in the Senate nor a signature from the Governor is needed to commence impeachment in the US Congress .
In addition , The New Hampshire Bill of Rights retains since 1784 , the right to revolution .
No wonder the state ’s motto “ Live Free or Die ” applies to the people ’s trials .
The House Resolution procedure to commence impeachment procedure in the US Congress is part of a history making effort from a State level .
The Founding Fathers of the Constitution , created this remedy for the people , to set impeachment in motion under Section 603 of Jefferson ’s Manual , by charges transmitted by a State legislature .
The State ’s ability to bring forth the people ’s voice to the Federal level , without the strong arm of Washington DC spin , may be small defined , but for imperative measures , the effort of Betty Hall ’s HR24 may out live this generation , yet become the ultimate duty of the people ’s effort as only a sampling of the Founders past .
Representative Hall has worked tirelessly to make sure the people ’s voice is heard in New Hampshire .
The committee hearing serves as an opportunity for the public to become involved , expressing the voice of a true democracy .
Hall has declared that she will join the Code Pink hunger strike and is “ willing to die for impeachment . ”
Members of the PDA community in New Hampshire and surrounding areas are encouraged to attend the public hearing to show support for Rep.
Hall and this House Resolution .

Nick Haley took just 30 minutes to pluck the Brazilian band CSS from obscurity and hurl it into the national spotlight .
In September , Haley paired the band 's dance - pop song " Music is My Hot , Hot Sex " with his 30 - second amateur video , displaying the capabilities of Apple 's new iPod Touch .
The video ends with the lyrics , " My music is where I 'd like you to touch . "
" I was like , ' This song is too perfect , ' " said Haley , 18 , by phone from the University of Leeds in England , where he studies politics .
" It 's punchy , loud , fast and naughty . "
Marketers at Apple headquarters in Cupertino were so impressed with the song selection and YouTube video , they arranged for Haley to travel from England to Los Angeles , where he helped advertising executives at TBWA / Chiat / Day produce Apple 's newest iPod television commercial .
" This has been a remarkable experience , " Haley said .
" As a fan of CSS , it 's great to think that in some small way I have helped to launch them . "
Since 2001 , small , independent bands appearing in iPod commercials have sold thousands of records , been placed on numerous Billboard charts , and drawn the respect and admiration of music fans around the world .
Apple 's promotional influence has grown so great that music industry insiders now compare it with Oprah Winfrey 's ability to create best - sellers through her book club .
CSS ( Cansei de Ser Sexy , a Portuguese translation of " tired of being sexy , " taken from a Beyoncé Knowles quote ) released its debut album in July 2006 .
American fans and critics touted the group for its high - energy act and playful innocence .
But CSS soon learned that buzz , rave reviews and a small indie following do not necessarily translate into lofty record sales .
The album sold just 340 copies per week through October , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
Then the iPod Touch commercial premiered on Oct. 28 .
In the next two weeks , CSS sold 2,000 records and climbed to No. 15 in song downloads and No. 5 in ring tone sales at Apple 's iTunes Store .
" This is one of the rare instances where we can point to a single event and say , ' This is for sure what 's driving all of our record sales , ' " said Tony Kiewel , CSS 's agent at Sub Pop records .
" The band is completely absent from this country and has been for ages .
And the record is over a year old . "
CSS 's year - old record now stands at No. 19 on Billboard 's Top Electronic Album chart , and " Music is My Hot , Hot Sex " has since broke onto the all - important Pop 100 chart .
" America 's response to our music has been crazy , " said guitarist and drummer Luiza Sá by phone from the band 's hometown recording studio in Sao Paulo , Brazil .
" The whole story , the way that this ad happened for us , is amazing .
We plan to do everything we can to keep the buzz going and also to remain pure and true to our fans . "
Apple commercials have featured music giants Bob Dylan , Paul McCartney , U2 and Wynton Marsalis .
But for a small band like CSS , iPod commercials are legitimate springboards into the mainstream music scene .
" If you can take an indie band and can get this kind of exposure , you do it , " said Al Masocco , a music industry veteran who put together the 100 - hour promotional stunt " The Backstreet Boys Around The World . "
" Let 's face it , the majors are in a tailspin . "
Major record labels have yet to recover from an industrywide shift to digital downloads .
With Tower Records gone , and music floor space shrinking annually , physical sales are down 15 percent in the past six months , according to SoundScan .
Further complicating the matter is a decline in overall band exposure .
For the most part , radio has been unwilling to break the Top 40 model and television stations like MTV and VH1 have all but dropped music by unbranded bands .
In response , labels have turned to companies such as Apple and Volkswagen , and television dramas like ABC's " Grey 's Anatomy , " to promote unknown bands that both attract young audiences and translate to high product sales and ratings .
The Canadian band Feist was quick to realize the benefits of its Apple partnership .
Headed by singer - songwriter Leslie Feist , it released " The Reminder " on May 1 , a well - reviewed collection of alternative and folk songs .
The record sold decently - 31,000 its first week and 21,000 the next , according to SoundScan .
On Sept. 9 , when its song " 1234 " was paired with Apple 's new iPod video Nano , the band was averaging 6,000 record sales weekly for a grand total of 216,000 .
During the next four weeks , as the catchy ad beamed into millions of American living rooms , weekly sales for Feist improved to 14,000 the first week , 19,000 the second , 28,000 the third and 20,000 four weeks into the ad campaign .
" I would contend that anything above 6,000 in those weeks was driven 100 percent by the iPod ad , " said Phil Gallo , a music industry expert and Variety associate editor .
" That 's eight grand the first week , then 13,000 , 22,000 and 14,000 .
( In all ) nearly 60,000 bonus sales in one month . "
Feist 's single placed seven times on Billboard charts , climbing as high as No. 4 on Hot Digital Songs and No. 10 on the Pop 100 chart .
At the iTunes Store , the record is No. 25 in album sales and No. 44 in song downloads .
On Nov. 3 , Feist secured the highly coveted musical guest spot on Saturday Night Live .
And as of last Saturday , " The Reminder " had sold 346,000 total records , 130,000 additional sales since the iPod commercial premiered .
Haley handpicked CSS to appear in the iPod Touch campaign , but it is unclear how Apple selected Feist .
Historically , Apple has chosen half of the artists used in iPod campaigns , while the other half were discovered based on artist - submitted demos , an Apple spokesman said .
Apple , along with the bands interviewed , declined to say how much artists are paid for their participation .
Steriogram , a pop-punk band from Auckland , New Zealand , permitted Apple to use the single " Walkie Talkie Man " in its recent iPod and iTunes spot .
The band 's guitarist , Brad Carter , said he had long been a fan of Apple 's sleek , best - selling music device .
" What band would n't welcome this type of attention ? "
Carter said .
" The advertisement gave us a new lease on life .
We were able to expand our tours , gain recognition in America , and have our music heard around the world . "
Capitol Records released Steriogram 's " Schmack ! " on May 18 , 2004 .
But it was only after the iPod ad premiered on Aug. 29 , 2004 , that the album made No. 18 on Billboard 's Hot Digital Tracks , placed on numerous European and Japanese sales charts and sold 48,000 records , according to SoundScan .
" There really is an amazing element of luck to this , " said Carter , who was reached in Los Angeles .
" If bands stick to writing good songs , they will get noticed . "
Jean - Philippe Freu , who leads the electro - rock band Rinôçérôse , feels the same way .
He said Apple contacted him to use the single " Cubicle " before its third album was released in April 2006 .
The commercial premiered on March 3 , 2006 , and by May the album by the little - known band from Montpellier , France , premiered at No. 25 on Billboard 's Top Electronic Albums chart and " Cubicle " reached No. 48 on the Hot Dance Club Playlist .
" Quickly , everybody in the music industry knew of it , " Freu said .
" To be in an iPod ad gives you credibility .
Thousands of bands would do it for free . "
Not everyone is enthusiastic about Apple 's growing power as music industry scout .
Bob Lefsetz , publisher of the Lefsetz Letter , an acerbic and often profanity - laced daily rundown of the music industry , says young artists should not leap to gain exposure through commercials .
" If you sell out up - front , your career is shortened , " Lefsetz said .
" What kind of screwed - up world do we live in where the iPod is cooler than the music it plays ? "
But most bands - and their advisers - are not heeding this argument , especially as more listening is being done on iPods .
In a recent survey of 474 Americans between the ages of 14 and 24 , 73 percent favored iPods and home - burned compact discs to radio , according to Paragon Media Strategies in Denver .
Back in Brazil , Sá said CSS is busy recording tracks for a new album and preparing for an upcoming European tour .
On Dec. 2 , the band will take the stage at the University of Leeds , a venue made famous by the Who .
Haley said he plans to attend .
" It will finally be great to meet him , " Sá said .
" He gave hope to all bands out there .
You can say this gives hope to the industry . "
Howard had promised that Australia would be relaxed and comfortable under his rule , yet this year Australians had become more fearful and suspicious of each other than ever , a state of affairs that Howard 's government seemed happy to exploit .
Howard 's divisiveness and his skilful manipulation of public opinion obscured the strange paradoxes of his era .
If he flirted with racism , it was nevertheless under him that Australia ended up with the largest immigration programme in its history .
His foreign policy was notoriously sycophantic to the Bush administration .
Yet while he often seemed little interested in Asia , over the past decade Australia became far more closely tied in terms of trade to China , India , Japan and Indonesia , and its destiny ever more deeply enmeshed with the coming Asian century .
If he was the most ideologically driven prime minister Australia has had , on occasions he acted entirely out of character : his courageous introduction of comprehensive gun laws in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 , and again , under enormous public pressure , his sending of a peacekeeping force to East Timor to halt a campaign of repression covertly sponsored by the Indonesian military after the East Timorese voted for independence - flying in the face of Australia 's long - standing policy of support for Indonesia .
Howard 's seeming blandness disguised his ruthless determination radically to reshape Australia .
His politicisation of the public service severely weakened that institution ; his government 's ceaseless and ferocious attacking of alternative points of opinion brought a disturbing conformity to Australian public life ; and he stacked body after body with sycophants and far - right ideologues to prosecute his causes through society .
Then there are the lies : the most extraordinary was his declaration that he would not introduce a consumption tax , though he later did ; and the most shameful was the infamous children overboard case .
At the height of the 2001 election , Howard 's ministers claimed that refugees on a boat approaching Australia had thrown their children overboard , leading Howard to declare : " I do n't want people like that in Australia . "
Only after the election was it proven that the government had known the claim was false .
His condoning of the imprisonment of David Hicks at Guantánamo Bay without trial for five years , and the subsequent gagging of Hicks until after the election , suggested a growing contempt for human rights and the rule of law that was most frighteningly on display with his anti-terrorism legislation , much criticised for its provisions of secret trials and imprisonment .
The mandatory detention of refugees was vigorously defended and extended by Howard , though revelations of Australian citizens being locked up by accident for several months , and in one case deported to the Philippines , spoke not just of incompetent administration but of a darker heartlessness , echoing the infamous Tampa episode of 2001 .
When 400 refugees were rescued from a sinking boat and left stranded in the tropical heat on the deck of the Tampa , a container ship , Howard very publicly refused permission to land the refugees in Australia , an act that for many epitomised the brutal meanness at the heart of his government .
Though the country became far more chauvinistic under Howard , and though he often invoked the idea of Australia as justification for his government 's actions , he had no compunction in frequently going against the will of the people - whether in refusing to say sorry to black Australia in the face of the reconciliation movement ; slowly and expertly destroying the widespread desire for a republic ; or committing Australian troops to the Iraq conflict following anti-war demonstrations that were the largest in the nation 's history .
Then something strange happened : history changed and the times no longer were his .
His ever lonelier support for the Bush administration 's adventurism looked increasingly foolish and possibly dangerous .
The very climate of Australia was transformed .
Every mainland capital city now has a water supply crisis so severe that people have been murdered by neighbours for watering gardens .
Yet in the midst of a once - in - a - thousand - years drought , Howard remained until late last year a climate sceptic .
His supporters dismissed global warming as they had so much else - more hysteria from the left .
But it was n't : it was the world and the world had changed .
How odd then that , by voting in Kevin Rudd's Labor party , it seemed in many ways that Australia was simply replacing one older short man with glasses with a slightly younger short man with glasses .
Where Howard was a reactionary radical , Rudd is a religious conservative once described by a fellow Labor MP as " about as interesting as carpet " .
Rudd 's conservative agenda was often difficult to distinguish from Howard's .
He was declared a " heartless snake " by the Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson after swinging to the right of Howard on Aboriginal reconciliation in the final days of the election .
His claim to be strong on climate change rings hollow when he has promised a subsidy of A$ 110 m to Gunns Ltd , a company intending to build one of the world 's biggest pulp mills in Tasmania , which will burn half - a- million tonnes of native forest a year in the monstrosity of its electricity generator alone .
Was this Howard 's greatest victory : the creation of a Labor party in his own image ?
In the wake of his defeat the attacks on Howard 's legacy will turn ferocious , but at their heart will be an unease , a ritual exorcism of something deeper that Australians would perhaps rather not admit .
For a decade Howard 's power had resided in his ability to speak directly and powerfully to the great negativity at the core of the Australian soul - its timidity , its conformity , its fear of other people and new ideas , its colonial desire to ape rather than lead , its shame that sometimes seems close to a terror of the uniqueness of its land and people .
At the end of his concession speech , Howard claimed to have left Australia prouder , stronger and more prosperous .
But it did n't feel that way .
It felt like it had been a lost decade .
It felt like the country was frightened , unsure of what it now is , unready for the great changes it must make , and ill - fitted for the robust debates it must have .
There was a strange sense that Australia , which had seemed so often to sleepwalk , mesmerised , through the past 11 years , had suddenly woken up .
But where it might go and what it might do and be , no one any longer knew .

PIN Entry Device ( PED ) vulnerabilities
by Saar Drimer , Steven J. Murdoch and Ross Anderson
Executive summary
In Chip & PIN card transactions , customers insert their card and enter their PIN into a PIN Entry Device ( PED ) .
We have demonstrated that two popular PEDs , the Ingenico i3300 and Dione Xtreme , fail to adequately protect card details and PINs .
Fraudsters , with basic technical skills , can record this information and create fake cards which may be used to withdraw cash from ATMs abroad , and even some in the UK .
These failures are despite the terminals being certified secure under the Visa approval scheme , and in the case of the Ingenico , the Common Criteria system .
Our results expose significant failings in the entire evaluation and certification process .
Background
The UK banking industry chose to deploy Chip & PIN cards that do not encrypt the data exchanged between the card and the PED during a transaction .
By tapping these communications , fraudsters can obtain the PIN and create a magnetic strip version of the card to make ATM withdrawals in the UK and abroad .
We examined two of the most popular PEDs used in the UK and found that cardholders are exposed to simple and cheap attacks .
Our investigations of why this failure took place also discovered flaws in the certification system which is supposed to protect customers .
Overall responsibility for certification lies with the banking industry itself and the process of evaluation is hidden from the public .
Despite our findings , none of the PEDs we examined are to be removed from service .
The full results of our study are to be published at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy .
An extended version of our paper is available online as technical report UCAM - CL - TR - 711 : " Thinking inside the box : system - level failures of tamper proofing " .
The key findings are summarised in our press release .
Our work was featured on Newsnight , BBC2 , 26 February 2008 .
A video of the segment is also available ( alternate version : part 1 and part 2 ) .
Following our November 2007 notification , in February 2008 , we asked APACS , GCHQ , Visa , Ingenico , and Verifone a number of questions .
Ingenico did not reply .
The responses we did receive are :
Questions and answers
Why does the " tapping attack " work ?
Data is not encrypted between the card and the PED .
To initiate a transaction , the card sends its details to the PED .
The PED also sends the customer 's PIN to the card for verification .
Both of these exchanges are unencrypted , and together contain enough information to create a fake card .
This card , which has a correct magnetic strip but no chip , can be used in shops in countries which do n't yet use Chip & PIN .
It can also be used to withdraw cash from ATMs abroad , because the fraudster also has the correct PIN recorded .
Fake cards may also work in some UK ATMs which still accept magnetic - strip only cards .
How can the attack be prevented ?
The banks can do more to prevent such attacks .
The more expensive DDA ( Dynamic Data Authentication ) cards allow the PIN to be encrypted and so preventing it from being intercepted .
Banks could also block magnetic strip transactions , but this would prevent use of cards abroad .
They could also alter the copy of the magnetic strip stored on the chip , replacing it with an " iCVV " .
APACS states that all UK cards issued since January 2008 have an iCVV , but our own testing in February 2008 shows this not to be the case .
When did you contact the banking industry ?
In November 2007 , we informed APACS , GCHQ , Visa , Ingenico and , Verifone ( Dione ) of our findings and sent them a draft copy of our paper stating that it would be released in January / February 2008 .
All except Visa acknowledged receipt , but we did confirm that Visa downloaded the paper from the address we sent them .
APACS were notified that Newsnight would be featuring our work on 21 February 2008 .
On Friday 22 February 2008 , they asked us for some clarifications to our paper .
This was over three months after our original notification in which we offered to answer any queries our work raised .
Prior to this we received no requests for assistance .
On 27 February 2008 we answered the questions APACS raised .
Is there anything that customers can do ?
Perhaps , but not much .
Since January 2008 , some banks have issued iCVV compliant cards , which are less vulnerable to fraud .
Customers could ask their bank to re-issue their card , to help defend against the attack we describe here , and other variants criminals are using .
Otherwise , there is not much customers can do .
The Dione tap is hard to spot , and the Ingenico one is completely enclosed by the terminal .
Are n't PEDs and terminals supposed to be tamper - resistant ?
Yes , but they are n't .
The designers of the PEDs we examined failed to stop the simple attacks , and in fact the devices have curiously placed holes and contacts that make these attacks even easier .
The PEDs do have some anti-tampering mechanisms ( such as lid switches , sensor meshes and epoxy encapsulated hardware ) , yet they are mostly used to protect the banks ' security rather than the cardholders ' .
Who approved these PEDs ?
Visa and APACS .
Both PEDs we examined were approved by Visa , and the Ingenico was additionally approved by APACS .
APACS and Verifone ( the manufacturer of the Dione PED ) have refused to tell us who evaluated the PEDs or let us see the reports .
Ingenico has not responded to our questions .
The Ingenico PED is Common Criteria approved .
What does this mean ?
Not very much .
Common Criteria is a system for certifying product security .
It is operated by a network of government - appointed bodies , such as GCHQ in the UK or the NSA in the US .
The Ingenico PED was not certified under this scheme and GCHQ has no knowledge of the device .
It was actually certified by APACS on the basis of a secret report from an undisclosed laboratory .
Now that vulnerabilities are exposed , will the certification be withdrawn ?
No .
APACS are responsible for certifying the Ingenico terminal , and will not revoke the certification .
Visa did not respond to our questions .
What may be the cause of these vulnerabilities ?
There can be many causes .
The primary cause , in our opinion , is the banks ' lack of emphasis on the security of cardholder data , or the lack of the right incentive structure to improve security .
If protecting customers were a higher priority then they would have spent the extra money on technologies such as PIN encryption and iCVV that make card cloning more difficult .
Would n't merchants detect tampered - with PEDs ?
They might if they were trained to do so , but they are n't .
There are also corrupt merchants , and staff may be coerced into installing tampered PEDs .
The banks seem to assume that merchants are honest and base their security outlook on this incorrect assumption .
Why are you doing this work ?
Previous documents have warned about the possibility of this type of attack , though we have not seen any action to stop it .
There are cases currently in court in which criminals are accused of stealing eight - figure sums using tampered terminals , but these will remain sub judice until details become public .
Meanwhile customers who complain about phantom withdrawals are just told that the banks ' systems are secure .
We therefore bought the two most popular PEDs on eBay and analyzed them to see if they are as secure as claimed .
Our intent is twofold : reducing fraud and empowering defrauded cardholders during disputes with banks .
It seems that public pressure is the only effective way in pressuring the banking industry to adopt sound security practices .
How much does it cost to implement this attack ?
Very little .
As described in some detail in our paper , the basic attack tool is a paper clip .
In order to record and analyze transactions a couple hundred pounds ' worth of equipment is required , in addition to some digital design experience .
Are n't you helping criminals ?
No .
Criminals are already using tampered terminals to forge bank cards .
We are not teaching them anything new .
Detailed information on criminal activity has been kept out the public domain by the sub judice rules .
This leaves customers at a disadvantage when they complain , and lessens the pressure on vendors to design better terminals .
Security systems improve as vulnerabilities are disclosed to the people that can fix them .
We have privately informed affected organisation of our findings over three months prior to public disclosure .
The replies we received indicated that no immidiate improvement to security will be made .
The banking industry even argued that the attacks we describe will not adversely affect cardholders ; we strongly disagree with that assessment .
Fraud is actually happening .
Furthermore , prior work by other researchers and organisations already warned about the possibility of such vulnerabilities over the past three years , yet nothing has been done about it .
The lobby of the Sony building in New York is 70 - feet high and heavy with music business ambience - gold records , photographs and the ' Sony Shop of New Technology ' .
Upstairs , the main reception is like the lounge of an exclusive club .
Young people , dreaming of stardom , stand in wonder breathing in the atmosphere , looking at memorabilia - platinum CDs , photos of stars , framed press reports , Billboard charts .
For an aspiring artist or manager , just to step into the building is a thrill .
The impression is of a corporation dedicated to the success of its artists , almost altruistic in its understanding of their needs .
Yet it 's nothing but a flytrap .
Artists go there dreaming of being signed .
But out of every 10 signed nine will fail .
A contract with a major record company was always a 90 per cent guarantee of failure .
In the boardroom the talk was never of music , only of units sold .
Artists were never the product ; the product was discs - 10 cents ' worth of vinyl selling for $ 10 - 10,000 per cent profit - the highest mark - up in all of retail marketing .
Artists were simply an ingredient , without even the basic rights of employees .
Imagine the outcry if people working in a factory were told that the cost of the products they were making would be deducted from their wages , which anyway would only be paid if the company managed to sell the products .
Or that they would have to work for the company for a minimum of 10 years and , at the company 's discretion , could be transferred to any other company at any time .
Recently , the Wall Street Journal investigated the industry and concluded that ' for all the 21st - century glitz that surrounds it , the popular music business is distinctly medieval in character : the last form of indentured servitude . '
As long as the major record companies controlled the industry , artists had to accept these conditions .
But the majors ' grip on things has almost gone .
For years they saw it coming but did little to change things .
Now each week brings them more gloom .
CD sales are down on last year , which were down on the year before , and the year before that .
Sony and BMG amalgamated , but brought themselves little benefit in doing so .
EMI and Warners tried to go the same route , but failed .
So EMI was taken over by someone with no knowledge of the record industry .
Guy Hands of Terra Firma fame promised to reinvent the whole business plan ; he started by parting company with Radiohead .
But outside of the industry , who cares ?
Pop music has never sounded better or more vibrant , never been more easily available to the listener .
The only people who are suffering are the people who brought it on themselves .
The major record companies .
In 1966 I came into a business that was alive with excitement and optimism .
I was one of a select group - the young managers , like Brian Epstein , Andrew Loog Oldham and Kit Lambert - who had taken over the UK's new pop groups - the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , the Who , the Kinks , the Yardbirds , the Animals .
We young managers were on fire .
We hustled , and we were free .
We were n't even friends , yet we knew each other from hanging out at the Ad Lib club or the Scotch of St James .
Despite enormous differences between us , we found one thing in common .
We all saw our principal job as going to war with the record company .
The first record company I ever went to was Decca in London in 1964 .
It was a six - storey building on the south bank of the river at Lambeth .
The inside was painted in the same colour , olive green , as government buildings - like the labour exchange or the tax office .
With a gruff commissioner on the door , it was pure bureaucracy , the civil service of the music industry .
During the Second World War , Decca developed radar for the army .
From the profits , its stuffy owner , Sir Edward Lewis , indulged his enthusiasm for recording classical music .
For him , pop music was a necessary sideline , nothing to be too proud of .
At Decca they did n't like young people .
I was 25 , but I talked my way into seeing someone in A&R , a small mean - minded man who sat picking his nose while I played my record .
It was a group I wanted to manage and I 'd paid for them to make the record .
The man was a pedant ; a killjoy .
' It 's dreadful ! ' he exclaimed .
' The song 's not memorable and the musicians do n't catch the beat . '
Then , surprisingly , he agreed a deal .
It was a very small one , but I was delighted - my first step into the business .
But if the record was as bad as he'd said it was , why did he give me a deal ?
And if it was n't that bad , why had he said it was ?
I left the building thinking , ' What a wanker ! ' and it's been difficult to think of A&R people in any other way since .
At that time Britain had four major record companies - Decca , EMI , Pye and Philips .
These last two were offshoots of corporations that produced electronic hardware for home and industry .
EMI , like Decca , manufactured hi-tech equipment for the government , mainly for hospitals - brain scanners and the like .
None of these companies had been set up first and foremost for music ; they made records for extra profit .
It was a wonderful trick they 'd learnt .
They bought vinyl cheaply ; added a label , a song and a sleeve and sold it expensively .
When I took over the management of the Yardbirds I had to deal with EMI .
In 1961 , it had become the biggest record company in the world , and that was before it signed the Beatles .
There was an air of pomposity about the place .
Artists were from the wrong class - they tended to cause problems .
EMI preferred to deal with managers , especially if they were middle class and public school .
The people in the business affairs department were extraordinarily pissed off when I told them I considered their contract with the Yardbirds to be invalid .
They doubted I was right , but were too scared to challenge me in case they lost the group altogether , so they agreed to negotiate a new deal .
In order to bypass the company 's A&R department , I insisted the Yardbirds should produce their own records .
I demanded the biggest advance they 'd ever paid and the highest royalty - £ 25,000 and 12 per cent of retail - and they gave it to me .
If this was my entrance exam into management , I thought I 'd passed with flying colours .
I soon learned I 'd failed .
EMI had simply advanced the Yardbirds their own royalties and included a host of tricky accounting clauses - for instance the artist was only paid on 90 per cent of records sold , and was not paid on ' over - pressings ' , although these were usually sold anyway .
I asked the group 's lawyer why he'd let these things pass .
' If I told my clients not to sign unfair contracts they 'd never get a deal . '
I had learned the first golden rule of management - record companies are not to be trusted .
Management is a wildly up and down occupation .
Sometimes - if you 're standing at the top of a stadium looking down on 100,000 people stomping and cheering at your artist , or popping another bundle of cheques into your bank account , or being hailed as the Svengali behind the new icon of youth culture - it feels good .
Like standing at the back of the hall in Guangdong during Wham !'s trip to China with the group being cheered or encore after encore .
But at other times - when your nitwit star , out of his head on drugs or drink or self - admiration , tells you to cancel the gig with a stadium full of people waiting for the first chord , or wakes you in the middle of the night with a call from Sydney to say he can't go on stage because he has no clean socks ( as the lead singer of the Yardbirds once did ) - it feels less so .
In the end , though , you have to see it from the artist 's point of view .
He 's the one who will be booed off if he performs badly , or slated by the critics if he makes a bad album , or shot at by some maniac just for being famous .
The artist takes all the emotional hits and needs you as his friend .
Your common enemy is the record company .
Having got the contract with EMI sorted out , I visited our American record company .
In 1966 the US market was dominated by CBS and RCA , both of whom had the same civil service atmosphere as EMI and Decca .
Their principal business was broadcasting and they held government licenses that required them to keep high moral standards .
The other majors were Capitol , which had been bought by EMI , and MCA , which had bought the American office of Decca .
( Warners was still considered a minor offshoot of a movie studio . )
The Yardbirds were with CBS whose New York HQ was known as Black Rock - a gaunt , black - bricked , black - glassed skyscraper .
Its lobby was as austere as a high security prison and I was accompanied to the elevator by a guard .
I was meant to be seeing Len Levy , the head of the Epic label , but the company did n't want me there .
They had the rights to the record , they were going to release it , they 'd decided on the budget and they did n't want the manager turning up demanding things .
' The Yardbirds ' manager is here . '
' Aw Jesus , is he ?
Well , Len 's out at the moment .
Ask Ernie if he 'll have a talk with him .
That should do the trick . '
So I saw Ernie Altschuler , one of their old - time staff producers .
He knew nothing about rock 'n 'roll or British pop or Swinging London ; he produced Tony Bennett and Ray Conniff .
But he was a charmer and we became immediate friends .
Ernie was 20 years older than me and wildly disillusioned with things .
' I 've made CBS more hits than any other producer but I 've never been paid a royalty or a bonus .
They see me the same way they see the artists - just part of the process . '
I was n't ready to believe such doleful news .
I was excited , I was in the USA , I was managing a top band .
America felt good .
This was the real record industry - the corrupt , tough , no holds barred , American industry - not the whingeing , always - changing - their - mind industry we suffered in the UK .
Nevertheless , I was totally in their hands .
Here there were 6,000 radio stations .
Four thousand were said to have playlists under Mafia control .
To promote my record would require cocaine and sex and suitcases full of cash .
I had n't chosen to be with this company : that had been done by EMI .
In America I had just one job - to persuade CBS the Yardbirds were worth promoting .
But since that was already decided there was n't much left to do .
So I went and had tea with Ahmet Ertegun .
Ever since the mid-Fifties , a lot of small record companies had been growing up .
The people who owned them also ran them .
They gave a more personal service than the majors , made the artist feel cared for .
The royalties were no more and the profit margins no less but there was a feeling of compromise between commerce and art .
Four of them dealt only with black artists - Motown , King , Chess and Atlantic .
Atlantic was owned by Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun - sophisticated , jazz - loving , multilingual Turks .
With a view to discovering more about the explosion of music coming out of London , Ahmet invited me for afternoon tea and muffins .
I 'd only been there five minutes when the door opened and Joe Tex , one of the biggest black recording artists in America , stuck his head in .
' Ahmet , man , I was just wondering if you could loan me 10 bucks . '
' You want 10 bucks , ' Ahmet told him .
' Go downstairs to the studio , find a backing track you like and put your voice on it . '
An hour later Joe came back .
Ahmet buzzed the studio and asked the engineer if Joe had done a good vocal .
Then he doled him out $ 10 and offered him a cup of tea .
When Ahmet left the room for a minute I asked Joe how much royalties he got .
He was n't sure he got royalties at all .
' I do n't know exactly how it works , ' he confessed , ' but Ahmet and Nesuhi are like brothers .
Whenever I 'm in New York I gotta place I can hang out .
And I always come away with a few bucks . '
Ahmet and Nesuhi , by the way , were making themselves very rich .
Owners of other small companies were getting rich less pleasantly .
For a while I was producing records with Ray Singer and we went together to see the Roulette label , rumoured to be connected with the Mafia .
People told us not to , but what the hell , we wanted all the work we could get and dealing with the Mafia sounded fun .
We arrived early and were shown to a waiting room .
Only when Ray wanted a pee did we notice there were no handles on the inside of the doors .
He held it .
We were taken to meet the boss - Morris Levy , a Jewish record company executive with lots of Italian friends .
His office was long , with his desk at one end on a dais .
We arrived and Morris was standing mid-office .
His hands were round the collar of a slightly built black guy , lifting him off the floor , shaking him furiously .
' You fucking black cocksucker .
You promised to make me a hit record and you screwed up . '
The little black guy was shuddering from top to toe of his shaken body .
Then we recognised him .
It was Mickey Stevenson , for God 's sake !
One of the top black producers in the world .
He 'd written ' Dancing in the Street ' for Martha and the Vandellas and produced ' What Becomes of the Brokenhearted ' for Jimmy Ruffin .
Now he was being shaken to death .
When Morris realised we'd come into the room he let go of Mickey , who fell to the floor like an empty sack .
While Morris motioned us to chairs , Mickey crawled to the door and fled .
' So you want to make some records for me ? '
Morris boomed .
Ray and I eyed each other awkwardly .
What we 'd seen seemed accurately to portray how the American music business dealt with people who failed .
Extraordinarily , Morris Levy was hugely loved in the music industry .
In 1973 , when he was voted Man of the Year by the United Jewish Appeal , the entire hierarchy of the music industry turned out to his celebration party .
Morris loved to play the Mafia chief - he behaved the way all the other executives wished they were able to behave .
Whenever artists asked Morris about royalties , he yelled : ' Royalties ?
Try Buckingham Palace . '
Other small companies popped up all over the place .
In the UK , there was Island , owned by Chris Blackwell , a white West Indian who spoke Oxford English and Jamaican patois with equal panache .
Charisma was owned by Tony Stratton - Smith , who was much loved by his artists despite a lifestyle that revolved around fine wine , racehorses and rent boys .
In California , trumpet player Herb Alpert started A&M , which zoomed to success with the Carpenters and Carole King .
Jac Holzman started Elektra specifically to sign non-mainstream artists such as the Doors and Judy Collins .
Like all the other owners of small labels , he liked rock stars for what they were - self - obsessed and irrational .
When he signed Love , he gave them a $ 5,000 advance ( $ 100,000 in today 's money ) .
There were five of them , all living in a single hotel room and they needed transport to get to gigs with their equipment .
They took his money and went to buy something suitable .
An hour later they came back with a gull - winged Mercedes capable of taking two .
Jac shrugged and shelled out for a van .
At a major no one would have done that .
Whenever a rock singer experienced success , the ambition lobe in his brain seemed to develop a permanent , painful erection .
Small companies understood how to deal with this , the majors had n't a clue .
Seeking to solve this problem , CBS appointed a charismatic figure to head the company , Clive Davis , a charming young lawyer .
Clive camped it up , put on love beads and a hippy Nehru jacket and signed Scott McKenzie , Donovan , Laura Nyro and Blood Sweat & Tears .
CBS 's market share suddenly shot up .
Warners was now close on its heels .
Steve Ross , who'd made money from car parking and hobnobbing with the Mob , headed an investment group which bought the company out for $ 50 m .
Free of all controls , the new company could go hell for leather for profit and forget about the niceties .
To run it , Steve Ross found a guy called Mo Ostin who had a talent for picking off - the - wall artists and standing by them - the Kinks , Jimi Hendrix , Frank Zappa .
Ross also took Warners on a buying spree and snapped up the best two small companies together with their owners ; Elektra , with Jac Holzman , and Atlantic , with Ahmet Ertegun .
Suddenly stuffy old Warners had become WEA .
At that time I was producing records for RCA .
It too was trying the ' friendly president ' approach but could n't get it right .
Each time I visited there was a new face at the top .
Each new person signed new artists and stopped promoting the artists his predecessor had signed .
Eventually RCA had more than 100 artists who were not achieving chart success so it had to hire yet another new president especially to fire them all .
By the mid-Seventies , in both the UK and the US , there were now only six majors .
In the UK , there were three new small labels - Chrysalis , Zomba , and Virgin , which had signed my group Japan .
After four years Japan had finally broken in the UK so I decided to head for the States .
Virgin had licensed America to CBS , which had fired Clive Davis in the wake of a payola scandal .
The company was now run by two lawyers - Walter Yetnikoff and Dick Asher .
I liked Walter but fell into the half of the company run by Dick - a very dull man indeed .
I finally got a meeting with him but had no sooner arrived in his office than the buzzer sounded and his secretary 's voice said : ' Bob Dylan on line one . '
' Can I call him back ? '
Dick asked .
' No .
He says he wants to talk to you now . '
Dick was about to have a conversation he did n't want .
Eighteen months previously there had been publicity about Jewish - born Dylan becoming a born - again Christian .
He 'd made a couple of albums full of evangelical zeal but they 'd bombed .
Now his contract had come up for renewal .
Dick especially did n't want to have this conversation in front of me .
He took the call anyway .
To begin with , it was n't too interesting but then Dick yelled , ' I 've told you , Bob - no fucking religion !
If you can't agree to that , the deal 's off ...'
Bob was arguing the point but Dick was having none of it .
' Look , I 'm telling you .
There 'll be no fucking religion - not Christian , not Jewish , not Muslim .
Nothing .
For God 's sake , man - you were born Jewish , which makes your religion money , does n't it ?
So stick with it , for Christ 's sake .
I 'm giving you 20 million bucks - it 's like baptising you , like sending you to heaven .
So what are you fucking moaning about ?
You want 20 million bucks from us ?
Well , you gotta do what we tell you .
And what we 're telling you is ... No Torah !
No Bible !
No Koran !
No Jesus !
No God !
No Allah !
No fucking religion .
It 's going in the contract . '
As a devout atheist , I could hardly object , though it seemed tough that a contract should include such specific restrictions .
When we finally got back to the subject of my group Dick had rather lost interest .
He agreed to release one album .
There were three to choose from , each a cohesive musical whole , but he wanted bits from each .
It was like introducing a new film director with a composite of three of his movies - the album would n't have a chance .
And to make sure it did n't , CBS gave it no promotion .
That way , Dick was able to tell me , ' You see , I was right .
There 's no market for a group like yours in the States . '
A year later I was back with Wham !.
By now Walter Yetnikoff had taken the whole thing over for himself .
He took artist friendliness to new levels .
In his book Howling at the Moon , he describes his 15 years at the top of the company .
He was there , he explained , for the artists .
Yet from beginning to end of the book , he only talks about seven artists with whom he spent time - Paul McCartney , Michael Jackson , Mick Jagger , Barbra Streisand , Paul Simon , Bob Dylan , and Patti Labelle ( and the latter only because he was screwing one of her singers ) .
During that 15 - year period , perhaps 700 artists would sign to CBS , only 10 per cent of whom would have hits .
More than 600 others would see CBS as the dead end that killed their career .
Yet Walter saw himself as the man who nurtured artists - seven of them .
In a greater or lesser way , that had been the ratio of care meted out to the artists by the majors since the beginning of time .
' People are so anxious to record , they 'll sign anything ...' said singer Tom Waits , ' ... like going across the river on the back of an alligator . '
They flocked to the majors asking for a chance .
The failure rate was still the same .
Count the names of every artist who appeared in the Top 100 from 1980 to 1990 - 1,000 perhaps ?
Multiply by nine and that 's the number who signed to majors and were never heard of again .
As record companies got bigger in the Eighties , everything grew more corporate and less personal .
Ron Weisner , who managed both Madonna and Michael Jackson , told me : ' The biggest frustration is always dealing with the record company - cajoling them , bullying them , charming them , threatening them .
They 're totally insensitive to the artist or his wellbeing .'
Polygram bought up every small company left to buy .
At the annual conference in the US , the new German MD started his speech by saying : ' The first time I saw America was through the periscope of a U - boat . '
In the UK , Chrysalis , Zomba and Virgin had grown fast and were opening offices in the States .
At Virgin they were trying to boost income , waiting for someone to buy them , using age - old accounting tricks .
On one occasion I noticed the royalty statements for Japan had arrived with the artist 's royalty less than it should be .
It was because the company had first deducted the producer 's royalty of 4 per cent .
Lower down on the statement it stated the producer 's royalty as 4 per cent and deducted it a second time .
A call to the accounts office set things right but when the next statement came it was calculated in exactly the same way .
A quick call round other managers established it was the same on their statements , too .
Ed Bicknell , manager of Dire Straits , said that dealing with Polygram altered his whole personality .
' You sometimes do things you would n't do to a mate .
I had no compunction in screwing a corporation .
I got through 16 or 17 managing directors ... they 're incredibly inefficient and absolutely hopeless to deal with ... '
Ahmet Ertegun was still at WEA , but hating every minute of it .
' They kept putting up people to run it who were non-music people ... they would never take somebody from the cable division and let them run the movie division ... but they would take anybody and let them run the music ... there was no leadership from the top ... it was everybody fighting everybody else ...'.
In the Nineties , WEA 's biggest artist , Prince , found it so frustrating he refused to record for them again even though he was still under contract .
George Michael attempted to terminate his contract with Sony , which had now purchased CBS .
It was rumoured what had triggered George was hearing the company 's new president , Tommy Mottola , referring to him as a ' limey fag ' .
If a Sony employee were referred to in the same way the company would probably end up in court and be fined .
But an artist was not an employee , he was just an ingredient .
Under advice from his lawyers George did n't sue over this but instead claimed his contract was invalid .
It did n't win him his case but it told people a great many things they had n't previously known about the record business .
Artists had to pay their own recording costs yet companies ended up owning the records .
' The bank still owns the house after the mortgage is paid , ' is how Senator Orrin Hatch described it .
Could we imagine film stars having to pay the costs of the movies they starred in and then giving the rights to the company that distributed it ?
Artists also had to pay a packaging deduction of around 15 per cent .
This , despite the fact that packaging rarely cost more than 5 per cent .
The remaining 10 per cent was enough to pay the record company 's entire cost of manufacturing the record .
All in all , it meant an artist who sold 200,000 copies of a first album would still owe the record company although the record company had made a profit of a million .
But the worst thing about being signed to a major was that you lost the freedom to run your life .
And though top artists could sometimes re-negotiate an unfair contract , it soon became clear that in the music business you did n't get out of an unfair record contract to get into a fair one ; you get out of an unfair contract to get into another unfair one , but with slightly better terms .
Irving Azoff ran MCA for six years .
Talking about ' time - honoured accounting traditions in the record business ' , he tells an industry audience of 3,000 audits on record companies .
' In 2,998 of them the artist was underpaid . '
Everyone had the same story .
' Systematic thievery , ' said the Dixie Chicks in their writ against Sony .
' Intentionally fraudulent , ' claimed US music lawyer Don Engel .
' Makes Enron look like amateur hour , ' wrote music journalist Dave Marsh .
Azoff changed sides .
He decided to head the American Artists ' Association and sue all the major record companies on behalf of its artists .
But he was pessimistic about their winning much ; the majors were going under too fast .
' The big boys swooped in and bought all the historic , artist - friendly , independents ...
A&M , Geffen , Interscope , Island , Chrysalis .
The multinationals rationalised these purchases based on growing cash flows that do n't exist any more .
Now they are trying to defend failed business plans . '
So what have the major record companies done to try to solve the mess they bought into ?
First , they chose to attack their own customers by suing people who downloaded files from Napster .
Then Sony amalgamated with BMG and everyone enjoyed the show as top executives fought over who should be made redundant .
The joint company had a disastrous setback when it attempted to stop the copying of records by secretly putting a code into CDs which made people 's computers more vulnerable to viruses .
Meanwhile , two of Britain 's recent big successes , Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand , signed to an independent , Domino , famous for giving its artists fairer deals .
Forced to finally accept downloads into the singles charts , the majors watched as Arctic Monkeys got 18 of their songs into the Top 200 .
Once , that would have given a major half a million opportunities to sell a penny 's worth of vinyl for a pound .
At Domino the deals with artists are more like partnerships and other independent companies are following suit .
But the problem with signing to any record company is what might happen if it sells out to a major .
It 's clear .
The majors should become ' music companies ' .
They should find new artists , develop them , promote them and participate in all aspects of their earnings .
The artist , rather than the record , should be the product .
Artists should be developed for longevity , not for quick profit .
Universal , Sony and EMI all claim to be heading in that direction , but nobody believes them .
As always , the biggest problem with signing to a record company is the bottomless pit of commitment .
When your record flops , how do you extricate yourself ?
For 50 years the major labels have thought of themselves as guardians of the music industry ; in fact they 've been its bouncers .
Getting into the club used to be highly desirable .
Now it does n't matter any more .
For artists and managers , this is the moment to take things into their own hands .
Artists no longer need to be held for 10 years and they no longer need to sign away ownership of their recorded copyrights .
These days , an artist working closely with his manager can ensure that everything is done in the artist 's best interest .
Majors have never done that .
And never will .
Four tops : the major players
Although independents account for 28 per cent of the market , the music industry today is still dominated by ' the Big Four ' record companies .
Universal Music Group
Chairman and CEO Doug Morris presides over the largest record company in the world .
Taken together , its labels such as Island , Polydor and Mercury account for a 25.5 per cent share in the global market .
UMG itself is a subsidiary of Vivendi , the French media conglomerate .
Sony BMG
The result of a 50/50 joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment ( part of Sony ) and BMG Entertainment ( part of Bertelsmann ) .
Subsidiary labels include Arista , Columbia , Epic , J Records and RCA .
Warner Music Group

Today 's lesson comes to you courtesy of your local Department of Transportation :
The Utah DOT is spending $ 6 million on a feasibility study for a bridge across a lake .
Meanwhile , the DOT does n't have enough money to put up traveler information video cameras at dangerous mountain passes and canyons to help motorists make safe driving choices .
That $ 6 million could have easily paid for the cameras , while still leaving money for a reasonable analysis of a bridge feasibility .
In Washington State , budgeted money for a drainage project has been tied up in studies .
Meanwhile , recent flooding has wiped out several small cities with damages in the tens of millions , destroying many people 's lives .
And $ 16 million is being spent on a rail trail conversion study .
That money would be enough to build a new freeway interchange and relieve millions in congestion delay and improved safety today .
John Taber , the author of the article , is professionally involved in exactly these kinds of studies .
His opinion ?
Heck , I make a living off transportation studies and even I 'm saying there 's too much study and not enough construction .
It 's an easy conceptual trip from building bridges to building software .
In software , some developers take up residence on planet architecture , an otherworldly place where software is eternally planned and discussed but never actually constructed .
Having endless discussions about software in a conference room or mailing list feels like useful work -- but is it ?
Until you 've produced a working artifact for the rest of the world to experience , have you really done anything ?
One of my favorite quotes on this subject comes from Christopher Baus .
Software is n't about methodologies , languages , or even operating systems .
It is about working applications .
At Adobe I would have learned the art of building massive applications that generate millions of dollars in revenue .
Sure , PostScript was n't the sexiest application , and it was written in old school C , but it performed a significant and useful task that thousands ( if not millions ) of people relied on to do their job .
There could hardly be a better place to learn the skills of building commercial applications , no matter the tools that were employed at the time .
I did learn an important lesson at ObjectSpace .
A UML diagram can't push 500 pages per minute through a RIP .
There are two types of people in this industry .
Talkers and Doers .
ObjectSpace was a company of talkers .
Adobe is a company of doers .
Adobe took in $ 430 million in revenue last quarter .
ObjectSpace is long bankrupt .
So that 's what you have to ask yourself : are you a doer , or a talker ?
Ideally , you'd be a little of both , as I 've said many times here .
There 's certainly value in some discussion and planning on your team .
But if you must pick one or the other , try to err on the side that produces useful , working code :
The best way to start an open source project is with code .
Working code .
Hack away at home on weekends , maybe get a couple of friends to help you out , and do n't go public until you have something to show people that does something interesting , and that other people can use to build more interesting stuff on top of .
You need this for a bunch of different reasons : it establishes the original contributor 's bona fides in the open - source meritocracy , it shortcuts all sorts of damaging debates about coding styles and architecture that can stop a project before it starts , and so on .
Working code attracts people who want to code .
Design documents attract people who want to talk about coding .
There 's a definite upper bound on the value of pure , theoretical discussion and planning in software .
The trick is knowing when you 've reached that limit , and how to funnel that effort into producing real code assets instead of letting it dissipate in a harmless puff of hot air .
Even the most incurious observer will have noticed the growing calls for a move away from fossil fuel dependence for our energy needs .
A host of interrelated issues make this one of the most pressing technological challenges of our time .
Whether it be the impact of fuel use ( climate change , pollution ) or the geopolitical consequences of where that fuel comes from , alternatives that did n't involve fossil fuels would plainly be beneficial .
In practice however , there is unlikely to be a single silver bullet that cures what ails us .
Oil has a high energy density and is readily transported .
Most of the hard work has already been done by the conversion of sunlight to chemical energy and then the slow geological conversion of those sugars and other complex molecules into crude oil .
Fossil fuels will likely require application - specific replacements .
For transportation needs , biofuels are currently enjoying widespread support , although they have many critics .
The need to develop cleaner transportation fuels is highlighted by an article in PNAS this week1 , which shows that transport accounts for around 15 percent of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions worldwide .
Brazil has a thriving biofuel industry , using its climate to grow sugar cane , which can then be refined to ethanol .
However , this strategy is unsuited to most other regions due to shorter growing seasons .
In the US , the current political vogue is for ethanol to be made from corn , despite corn - based ethanol 's many problems , Already , increased demand for corn for energy uses has seen a huge increase in the crop 's pricing , with serious knock - on consequences for poorer countries and their food supplies .
Image credit : USDA - ARS .
This week 's PNAS has a second article2 that highlights a the potential of a rival of corn - based ethanol , a perennial plant known as switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum ) .
Switchgrass can be grown on marginal land not suited to corn , and requires much less in the way of agricultural inputs .
Although energy yields are not quite as high as corn , the lower impact farming necessary results in 540 percent more renewable energy output than energy used to grow and process .
Even right now , that looks like a viable alternative to corn- based biofuel production that wo n't cause food riots in Mexico , but use of modern agronomics and genetics ought to be able to raise those energy yields relatively easily .
Whether switchgrass has what it takes to compete with the powerful political and commercial interests behind corn remains to be seen .

In Manchester , in case you have missed it , controversy has raged for days over whether to clap , or be silent .
They are going for silence .
Manchester United had planned a minute 's silence at tomorrow's home game , to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air crash , the most traumatic event in the history of the club .
But , by an unfortunate coincidence , today 's visiting side are Manchester City .
As is normal in football , the fact that the teams ' supporters live in close proximity to each other generates fierce rivalry , spilling over , in a few sad cases , into actual hatred .
At the City of Manchester Stadium , they recalled trying to hold a minute 's silence after the death of George Best , in November 2005 ; a few Liverpool fans made trouble , and the tribute did not last the full 60 seconds .
They are now worried that one or two City fans with strong lungs and weak brains might turn this weekend 's act of respect into a scandal .

Kevin Parker , spokesman for the City supporters ' club , told BBC Radio 5 Live : " It will only take one of those idiots to decide to shout something stupid and then the whole situation has been spoilt for ever .
We are calling for applause just in case . "
But United are the host team , and their decision stands .
Tomorrow 's silence will be one of many held this year – some lasting a minute , and some longer – to mark events , single deaths , multiple deaths , violent deaths and natural deaths .
We live in a time of silence inflation .
Commemorative silence first became a fixed event in British national life nearly 90 years ago , on 11 November 1919 .
A South African politician named Sir Percy Fitzpatrick was wrongly credited as inventing the idea , because of his part in deciding how Britain and the Commonwealth would mark the first anniversary of Armistice Day .
Actually , the practice of silently remembering the dead was already established .
The death of King Edward VII , in 1910 , was marked by a minute 's silence .
So was the news of the sinking of the Titanic , in 1912 .
Sir Percy will have remembered how his fellow South Africans stood in silence on receiving bad news from the front line during the war .
But Sir Percy 's proposal was different .
He suggested to King George V that victory in the bloodiest war in history should be commemorated by a ritual associated with mourning .
It suited the mood of the moment .
Too many people were grieving for loved ones and living with economic dislocation .
The public was more inclined to mourn than gloat over Germany 's humiliation .
The idea of a silence appealed to the King , who invited Sir Percy and others to a rehearsal by the Grenadier Guards in Buckingham Palace .
They decided that five minutes was too long , and settled for two .
On 7 November 1919 the King issued a proclamation asking " that at the hour when the Armistice came into force , the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month , there may be , forthe brief space of two minutes , a complete suspension of all our normal activities .
All locomotion should cease so that in perfect stillness , the thoughts of everyone may be concentrated on reverent remembrance of the glorious dead " .

Years later , a group of citizens of Melbourne , Australia , ran a vigorous campaign to establish that , actually , the silence that marked Armistice Day was not Sir Percy 's idea , but was first thought up by an Australian journalist and war veteran named Edward George Honey , who came from Melbourne but was based in London at the time .
He had seen people dancing in the streets on Armistice Day , and thought it an inappropriate way to mark the end of the slaughter .
No doubt , he remembered that when he was young , Australians stood in silence out of respect for victims of a mining accident .
He wrote to the Evening News in May 1919 urging that the first anniversary be marked by " five silent minutes of national remembrance .
A very sacred intercession .
Communion with the Glorious Dead who won us peace , and from the communion new strength , hope and faith in the morrow " .
The two - minute silence has featured in the November calendar ever since .
It was moved to the second Sunday in November during the Second World War , to avoid disrupting production , and after 1945 , its name was changed to Remembrance Day , in honour of the dead of both wars .
That it was two minutes long was recognition of the enormous human cost of the two wars .
Other crimes and tragedies merited only a minute .
Even the deaths in terror attacks of 11 September 2001 were commemorated in 2002 by a one - minute silence in the US and across the Western world .
Then in March 2004 , terrorists struck again , killing 191 people in the Madrid train bombs .
That weekend , there were one - minute silences at football matches across Spain ; at the Sydney Opera House , where the Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias was appearing ; and at the political rally when the incoming Prime Minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , was celebrating his election victory .
Bertie Ahern , the Prime Minister of Ireland , which held the EU presidency , thought more was needed to bring a sense of unity to the EU , which was bitterly divided over the war in Iraq .
He called on all member - nations to observe a silence for Madrid 's dead – not for one minute , or even two .
It was to be Europe 's first three - minute silence .
If Madrid was worth three minutes , New York had to be worth four .
In 2004 , the 9/11 commemoration was altered so that there were four minutes of silence , one for each of the four aeroplanes destroyed by the hijackers .
Two years later , George Bush led the fifth anniversary ceremony by standing in silence at Ground Zero for four minutes .
On 5 January 2005 , silence descended over all of western Europe for another three minutes , in memory of 150,000 victims of the Asian tsunami .
By now , the grumblings about silence inflation were becoming audible .
In the Daily Mail , Max Hastings furiously announced that he would keep talking through what he called " a political stunt that betrays our war dead and demeans the awesome generosity of the British public " .
Six months later , at noon on 14 July , London came to another three - minute halt , as railway stations and airports fell silent , buses pulled into the kerb , office workers piled out on to the streets , and crowds in busy shopping streets stood still , in memory of the 52 people killed a week earlier by suicide bombers .
Silence that commemorates a war or a terrorist attack at least has a ritual significance , because it implies a collective determination not to allow the event to be repeated .
There is no such purpose to silences marking events which , though sad , are of no obvious collective significance .
Two weeks ago , 1,000 American and Australian guests at a function at New York 's Waldorf Astoria hotel held a minute 's silence for Heath Ledger , a 28 - year - old actor who died of a drug overdose .
The death of Diana , Princess of Wales was also allocated a minute 's silence .
The list goes on : football tragedies such as Hillsborough and Heysel ; the deaths of Bob Woolmer , the cricket coach , and Sir Edmund Hillary , the climber ; the murder of Kenneth Bigley and the death of the Pope John Paul II .
On 31 March 2005 , there was a minute 's silence at the Parsonage , in Haworth , West Yorkshire , to mark the death of the former vicar 's daughter .
Her name was Charlotte Bronte , and she died in 1855 .
You would think they were over the shock by now .
Nearly 12 years ago , the whole of Britain recoiled in horror at the massacre of 16 primary schoolchildren and a teacher by a gunman in Dunblane .
The killer was dead , and there was nothing for the nation to do – except , of course , hold a minute 's silence .
On this occasion , there was a rare act of dissent , when the heads of the Roman Catholic church , Cardinal Basil Hume and Cardinal Basil Winning , put out a statement saying : " The Christian response to such tragedy is not silence , but rather fervent prayer to God for the victims , their families , the community and our society . "
They were of course ignored .
In our secular society , prayer is not a public activity .
We honour the dead with the sound of silence .
We started the year with high hopes thanks to the Democrats having gained control of both Houses of Congress in the 2006 elections .
It was widely expected that the new Congress would follow the voters ’ mandate to prevent George W. Bush ’s surge in Iraq and set a timeline for troop withdrawal from that beleaguered country .
In addition , it was widely expected that legislation would be passed that would once and for all reject and prevent official U.S. policy that utilized torture and would make sure that the President did not even think about taking military action against Iran without Congressional approval .
So what happened ?
Did we get a timetable for withdrawing the troops from Iraq ?
Hardly .
The reason given is that there were not enough votes in the Senate to cut off debate on the critical issues .
Did Congress pass legislation that would prohibit President Bush from using military force against Iran without first getting Congressional approval ?
No .
In this case such language had actually been inserted into a military spending bill , but as reported by ABC news on March 13 , 2007 “ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , and other leaders agreed to remove the requirement concerning Iran after conservative Democrats as well as other lawmakers worried about its possible impact on Israel , officials said Monday . ”
Did Congress take steps to once again demand that torture not be used by the U.S. ?
No .
The issue was front and center during the Judiciary Committee ’s confirmation hearings for Michael Mukasey as Attorney General .
Chairman Leahy and others tried to get Mukasey to merely admit that yes , indeed , waterboarding is a form of torture and should be banned , but he would not .
The impasse was broken when Democrats Feinstein and Schumer announced that they would vote for his confirmation in spite of his refusal on this point .
Ultimately , perhaps , the most serious offenses committed by the current Bush administration can only be resolved by impeachment of Bush or Cheney .
But the same Judiciary committee which gave a pass on Mukasey ’s nomination has been sitting on a resolution to impeach Cheney for over a month , with no action yet taken .
There are many other examples of failure on the part of the Democrats in both Houses .
They are called weak - kneed , overly sensitive on the security issue , unable for a variety of reasons to take on the President now that they control Congress .
However , there is one factor , a key indicator , that runs throughout these failures and that is the amounts of money that key Democratic Congressmen and Senators receive from the Israel Lobby .
The Center for Responsive Politics , on their website www.opensecrets.org , tallies the contributions that candidates receive from what they have identified as pro-Israel PACs .
Taking the Center ’s list of pro-Israel PACs and adding up contributions given by those PACs to various Congressional candidates from 1979 through 2006 , a remarkable fact comes through — the current Democratic leadership team in Congress has received twice as much pro- Israel PAC money as the Republicans !
According to my figures , individuals serving on the current Democratic Senate leadership team have received $ 1,955,995 from pro-Israel PACs , whereas their Republican counterparts have received $ 907,585 directly from the same PACs .
In the House , $ 469,082 has been received by the Democratic leadership team , with just $ 243,450 going to the Republicans .
Included in these numbers are $ 341,037 to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , $ 279,206 to Majority Whip Richard Durbin , and $ 216,100 to Democratic Outreach Chair Jeff Bingaman .
In the House Speaker Pelosi has received $ 84,900 , Steny Hoyer $ 140,626 , and Rahm Emanuel a smaller but significant $ 17,000 .
These figures for the Democratic leadership team do not include the amounts from pro-Israel PACs received by Independent Senator Joseph Lieberman .
The same data sources indicate that Sen. Lieberman has received $ 344,750 from these PACs since 1979 .
In 2005 - 2006 the same individuals who gave money to the pro-Israel PACs also contributed directly to Sen.
Lieberman an additional $ 900,000 , minimum , in helping him get reelected as an Independent after losing the Democratic primary .
And it hardly needs pointing out that Lieberman , by agreeing to caucus with the Senate Democrats , has enormous leverage over issues of his choosing in that body .
At the top of his agenda , of course , is U.S. Middle East policy .
Pro-Israel PAC contributions help explain other failures of the Democratically - controlled House and Senate .
For example , the nine Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which approved Mukasey ’s nomination and have so far failed to act on the proposal to impeach Cheney , received a total of $ 483,915 during just the period 1999 through 2006 .
Similarly , the eleven Democratic members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , whose responsibilities include aid to Israel , have received $ 610,579 from the pro-Israel PACs during the same period , 1999 - 2006 , even though Senators Webb and Kerry received none of these funds .
Here ’s my advice .
In any Congressional race in which you are interested , seek answers to the following questions :
1 . How much money has the incumbent received from pro-Israel PACs ?
The answer to this question may in most cases be found at www.opensecrets.org , at least for recent elections .
2 . Has the incumbent received a free trip to Israel from the American Israel Education Foundation , a sister organization of AIPAC ?
3 . Does the incumbent have any staff members who are supported by or were recommended by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) or any of its affiliates ?
4 . Has the incumbent ever addressed the annual AIPAC conference , where recipients of pro-Israel PAC funds are expected to show obeisance ?
There are those who argue that AIPAC and its affiliates are just another special interest group , so why pick on them ?
My answer is that if you want to understand U.S. foreign policy , especially that concerned with the Middle East , you must be aware of the influence of what John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt call the Israel Lobby .
You must also be aware of how that lobby works , and the quickest way to become knowledgeable about it is to read Mearsheimer ’s and Walt ’s The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , if you have not already done so .
In addition , I highly recommend the latest edition of Paul Findley ’s book , They Dare To Speak Out : People and Institutions Confront Israel ’s Lobby .
Findley , a Republican Congressman from Illinois for 22 years who was successfully targeted by AIPAC in 1982 , gives a vivid , first - hand account of how the Israel Lobby goes after any Congressman who attempts to take an even - handed approach to the Israeli - Palestinian issue .
Findley was beaten by Democrat Richard Durbin , who is now a Senator .
But as the Findley case exemplifies , the Israel Lobby ’s first allegiance is certainly not to the Democratic Party .
If that were the case , Connecticut would now be represented in the Senate by Democrat Ned Lamont , rather than Independent Joseph Lieberman .
This has made a huge difference .
The absolutely most efficient way to gain insight into why the hopes and promises of the 2006 elections have not materialized is merely to follow the money going from the pro-Israel PACs to Democrats in Congress .
In addition , one must realize that the reason the Israel Lobby has been so effective is because Congressmen who go along with them will receive their money and praise , but no criticism from other quarters .
Mearsheimer and Walt reported one instance , for example , where Senator John Culver ( D - IA ) was faced with the decision of whether to sign a letter being circulated by AIPAC .
They quote Culver as saying , “ It ’s easier to sign one letter than to answer 5000 . ”

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The Organization of the Islamic Conference on Friday added its voice to the growing criticism of a film released by a Dutch lawmaker , which features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran .
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , secretary general of the Jeddah , Saudi Arabia - based OIC , released a statement condemning " in the strongest terms the release of the film ' Fitna ' by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders . "
The organization added that the film defamed and denigrated " the Holy Quran , causing insult to the sentiments of more than 1.3 billion Muslims in the world .
" The film was a deliberate act of discrimination against Muslims " that aimed to " provoke unrest and intolerance , " the organization said .
The OIC has 57 member states over four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations .
In its statement , it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law .
The 15 - minute film , posted Thursday on a London - based Web site , has also drawn condemnation from the European Union and others .
The European Union said the film inflames hatred , and Iran 's Foreign Ministry called the movie " anti-Islamic and insulting . "
The foreign ministry called on the EU , the Netherlands , and Britain to take action to put an end to its showing , the official IRNA news agency reported .
The Danish Union of Journalists said it was suing Wilders for using a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed drawn by one of its members , newspaper political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard .
It said Wilders used the picture -- which shows Mohammed with a turban shaped like a bomb -- without permission .
The film , titled " Fitna , " opens with Westergaard 's controversial caricature , followed by translated portions of Islam 's holy book , the Quran .
The passages are interspersed with graphic images of the September 11 terrorist attacks juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York and other video clips .
The video includes disturbing images of other terror attacks ; bloodied victims ; beheadings of hostages ; executions of women in hijab , the traditional full - body attire ; and footage , with subtitles , of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians .
The film concludes with scrolling messages reading in part : " The government insists that you respect Islam , but Islam has no respect for you " and " In 1945 , Nazism was defeated in Europe .
In 1989 , communism was defeated in Europe .
Now the Islamic ideology has to be defeated . "
Wilders , the filmmaker , is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom .
He has been outspoken in his criticism of Islam and called the religion a threat to the world .
" It 's not a provocation , but the harsh reality and a political conclusion , " Wilders said of the film Thursday .
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad - Ali Hosseini on Friday condemned Wilders and the UK - based Web site hosting the film , LiveLeak.com , for showing the " provocative and anti-Islamic movie . "
" He said such a ' dirty act ' of the Dutch lawmaker and of a British institute at the end of the Islamic Unity Week reveals continued enmity and deep hostility of such western nationals against Islam and Muslims , " IRNA reported .
" Warning against consequences of such ' provocative ' acts , Hosseini asked the Dutch and British governments as well as ( the ) European Union to step in the case as soon as possible and prevent and put an end to showing of such ( an ) ' insulting , anti-Islamic and anti-cultural ' film , " IRNA wrote .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon condemned the film , calling it " offensively anti-Islamic " while urging calm .
" There is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence , " he said in a statement .
" The right of free expression is not at stake here . "
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Thursday that the film equates Islam with violence .
" We reject this interpretation , " Balkenende said in a statement .
" The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence .
In fact , the victims are often also Muslims . "
Slovenia , which holds the rotating EU presidency , said Friday that it supports the Dutch government 's position and believes the film does nothing to promote dialogue among religions .
" Mutual tolerance and respect are universal values we should uphold .
We believe that acts , such as the above - mentioned film , serve no other purpose than inflaming hatred . "
The U.S. government warned the film could spark protests and riots .
The title of the film , " Fitna , " translates in Arabic to " strife " or " conflict " of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group .
LiveLeak issued a statement Thursday saying there was no legal reason not to allow Wilders to post the film .
It said the site 's policy is to remain unbiased and allow freedom of speech .
Some in the Muslim community rejected the film as nothing more than dangerous anti-Islamic propaganda .
" This film is a direct attempt to incite violence from Muslims and help fan the flames of Islamophobia , " Arsalan Iftikhar , a contributor to Washington - based Islamica Magazine , told CNN on Thursday .
" Any reasonable person can see this is meant to spit in the face of Muslims and insult our religion . "
Iftikhar said he doubted the film would spark the same type of violence that followed the publication of the caricature of Mohammed , but he called on Muslim leaders to react peacefully .
Westergaard 's caricature was one of a dozen printed in a Danish newspaper in late 2005 .
Violent protests erupted early the next year after other European newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech .
Some Muslims believe the Quran forbids showing an image of the prophet .

EBay users are mad as hell and they 're not going to stop complaining about it .
After a fairly challenging year , John Donahoe , who takes over as eBay CEO at the end of March , unveiled plans yesterday to lower the upfront listing fee and increase the back - end fee for sellers .
The so - called " success - based " model , which takes effect Feb. 20 , is meant to increase listings , but from what we can gather , it will do little more than enrage its merchant base .
" Sellers prefer this structure , as it lowers their risk if an item does n't sell , " Donahoe said in a keynote speech at a conference yesterday .
" Put simply , we will make more of our money when sellers are successful . "
We 're not sure who Donahoe consulted , but sellers far and wide are loudly complaining that the new fee structure will increase the costs of using the auction site – the web is aflutter with calls for a " mass exodus " of " feebay . "
Ina Steiner , author of the Auction Bytes blog , calculates that the new fee structure could hike rates by 33 percent for many sellers .
eBay , by contrast , projects that new structure will lower fees for 60 percent of its sellers , assuming they 're eligible for discounts offered to power sellers who meet eBay 's recently revised criteria .
" Every seller 's going to have to go back and review their business practices and see what this means for them individually , " said eBay spokesman Usher Lieberman .
It is n't just the fee structure that has sellers out of sorts : eBay also changed its feedback system so that sellers cannot give a negative or neutral rating to buyers .
" Sellers will no longer have a way to protect themselves against bad buyers , deadbeat bidders , scam artists , buyers who make unreasonable demands , buyers who do n't read the ad then demand a refund , the list goes on and on , " one merchant wrote in a forum .
The company argues that the feedback system was being abused , and that it has provided sellers with several new tools to protect themselves from deadbeat bidders .
" We 've seen a four - fold increase in unwarranted negative feedback left for buyers in a retaliatory way .
Buyers have told us consistently that one of the strongest reasons for not using the site is retaliatory feedback , " says Lieberman .
" If buyers have a bad transaction , that wo n't drive them away .
What does drive them away is retaliatory feedback . "

Tribune chief Sam Zell had a meeting with the staff of The Los Angeles Times today that was so wildly entertaining it puts to shame the one he held at Newsday two weeks ago .
Among other things discussed — his willingness to take a 50 - cent salary !
—he blasted outgoing editor Jim O’Shea , according to a newsroom source present .
Mr. Zell said this morning that Mr. O’Shea " pissed all over the company where he worked for over 30 years , " and that he embarrassed the company .
" He really trashed him , " our source said .
" He said it was just unacceptable for him to humiliate me and humiliate this company and asked why he shit all over the place .
He said that we have enough trouble as it is and it was a really , really bad way to go . "
According to two L.A. Times sources , a lot of people at the paper felt the same way .
" Someone , that being S.Z. , finally called bullshit on Jim O’Shea , " said a newsroom source .
At the meeting there was a " lot of laugther and a lot of clapping .
A lot of good energy . "
In response to a question , Mr. Zell also talked about the importance of adding more local stories to the front page .
When discussing newsroom decorum , he told reporters that if they want to watch porn all day at their desk then go for it !
As long as they ’re productive .
He added , with a smile , " Let me know if you find any good sites . "

Let me preface this piece by saying two things :
1 ) As a white , non- Jewish , heterosexual male , I 'm in the one group that 's not allowed to give opinions on racism , and 2 ) I do n't care , and I 'm going to anyway .
While there are some who hallucinate racism everywhere they look , usually as an excuse to get some sort of special benefit from " government , " there are some real racists around .
The question is , how much do they matter ?
In most cases , the accurate , though politically - incorrect answer is , " not much . "
If someone thinks that I 'm evil because of my race , or my religion , why should I care ?
During my year - long prison stay ( for saying things the IRS did n't like ) , I met a person who openly preached that " whitey " ( which presumably includes me ) is the Devil .
But since he never did anything about it , or showed any signs that he intended to , I did n't care .
If someone says that everyone of your race or religion is stupid , or nasty , or in some way inferior or bad , why would you even care ?
Ever heard of " stick and stones " ?
Of course , if they actually resort to sticks and stones , or -- as is more common these days -- the violence of government , then there is a real problem .
But if all they do is whine and criticize , who cares ?
Are we such sissies that we can't tolerate a little name - calling ?
When did Americans become such thin - skinned wimps ?
If people would stop obsessing on what others SAY about them , and pay a little more attention to what others are DOING to them via government , we might not be in this situation .
For example , which of the following should worry Jews more : 1 ) some loud - mouthed skinhead who is constantly saying that all Jews are evil , but never resorts to using violence , or 2 ) a Jewish politician advocating that everyone ( including Jews ) be forcibly disarmed and rendered defenseless ?
If someone is advocating that government force be used to deprive you of your freedom , should n't that be a bigger concern to you than someone who merely says nasty things about you ?
On the other hand , racism COMBINED with " government " has historically been a horrendous tool for oppression , whether you 're talking about Hitler 's disarming of the various " undesirables , " or the American politicians disarming blacks just a few decades back .
But even real racism , without the help of government , is hardly a threat at all .
Even the cliche of the angry , racist lynch mobs of yesterday relies heavily on government helping , or at least turning a blind eye to such things , and on " law " being used to DISARM the intended victim beforehand .
How many cowardly , racist bullies do you think would show up to burn a cross on the front yard of someone who owned a semi-auto 12 - gauge Kalashnikov ?
Once an intended victim is disarmed , however , oppressing , harassing , or even murdering him is rather easy .
And historically , so - called " gun control " has been used for that very purpose .
http://www.jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/gpj4.htm
So why is it that those who claim to be " black leaders , " while constantly harping on the supposed threat of the ubiquitous white racist , are at the same time conspiring to deprive black Americans ( and everyone else ) of the ability to defend themselves , under the euphemism of " gun control " ?
If someone is trying to render you helpless , THAT is the person to distrust , even if he 's the same color as you , and even if he pretends to be your friend and ally .
For example , if Jesse Jackson is an advocate of the rights of blacks , and an opponent of racism , why did he have nothing to say about agents from U.S. Department of Victim Disarmament ( aka the BATF ) handing out " nigger hunting licenses " ?
If you think I 'm kidding , check this out :

Though there are plenty of things that Malcolm X said that are dead wrong ( mainly his pro-socialist ideas ) , he was right on when he explained that , though it is wrong to be an aggressor , using force -- even deadly force -- in self - defense is both justified and noble .
( Not surprisingly , the leftward - leaning New York Times demonized him for it .
How dare those uppity blacks think they have a right to defend themselves ? )
When 's the last time you heard any self - proclaimed " black leaders " like Al Sharpton defending the Second Amendment rights of blacks ?
Instead , the modern " leaders " are always proponents of GOVERNMENT " solutions , " which have kept millions of blacks defenseless , helpless , and dependent for decades .
Meanwhile , the political left is always eager to portray any opponents of their " progressive " ( socialist ) plans as a racist .
A few years back , the " Anti-Defamation League " ( perhaps the most inaccurately named organization ever ) even threw a veiled accusation of racism at me personally , because I do n't like the IRS .
( How 's that for a strange leap of logic ? )
Personally , I believe everyone , including every Jew , has the right to be able to defend himself .
Meanwhile , the ADL knowingly advocates " gun control " laws copied from the Nazis .
Once again , if you think I 'm kidding , behold :
http://www.jpfo.org/images02/handbill-adl.jpg
So the self - proclaimed " black leaders " and the self - proclaimed Jewish " leaders " are advocating that the force of law be used to DISARM those for whom they pretend to be advocates .
Meanwhile , extremist honkeys like myself believe that people of all races and religions have an unalienable right to defend themselves , and therefore have a right to possess the means to do so .
But with the constant propaganda spewed out by the government and the mainstream media , so many people are scared of all the wrong things .
The truth is , whatever the tyrants tell you to be afraid of , the supposed threat is NEVER as big a danger to you as the government which offers to protect you from it .
Anyone who says he is concerned for your safety , but who advocates your disarmament , is a liar .
He wants you disarmed for one reason : so he can do as he pleased to you , without fear of reprisal .
Whether he looks like you , or says he shares your religion , does n't matter a bit .
If he intends to oppress you , even if it 's purportedly " for your own good , " he is your ENEMY .
And if he intends to leave you in freedom , no matter what he looks like or what he says , he 's no threat to you .
If a black Islamic racist womanizing pothead LIBERTARIAN was running for President , he would be my second choice ( my first choice being " no one " ) .
What he says about me , and what I think about him personally , do n't matter .
Whether he will use government to initiate FORCE against me , whether to disarm me , rob me , silence me , harass me , control me , etc. , is all that matters .
If he 'll simply LEAVE ME ALONE , then I could n't care less what his personal beliefs and opinions are , about me or anything else .
To put it another way , government may break my bones , but words will never hurt me .

The economic recovery that 's been officially underway since late 2001 is probably over — too bad many Americans never got to experience it .
John Miller
This article is from the January / February 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This article is from the January / February 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
It 's not only radical economists and cyberspace Cassandras uttering the " r " - word nowadays .
Just what are we to make of it when Harvard economists , The Economist magazine , and Morgan Stanley followed by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch say the economy is headed toward , or already in , a recession ?
You can bet the house , whatever its current value , that hard times are on the way — more layoffs , fewer new jobs , lower wages , tighter family budgets , more debt , and higher poverty levels .
This year will see rising economic hardship even if the U.S. economy scrapes by without sinking into an official recession , usually defined as two straight quarters of declining output .
How do I know this ?
Hard times have been the hallmark of the U.S. economy during this decade , even as the economy expanded .
We will be in for more of the same , but worse , as the economy slows and the inevitable downturn in the business cycle exacerbates the economic injuries many people have already sustained thanks to long - term shifts in the U.S. economic system .
And Those Were the Good Times
For a while now , there have been plenty of signs that the overall U.S. economy is headed south .
Economic growth stalled in the last three months of 2007 , adding only 0.6 % to output after correcting for inflation .
In December , job growth ground to a near halt , and the economy lost 17,000 jobs in January , as construction suffered large job losses .
The unemployment rate jumped to 5.0 % for the first time in three years , and would be much higher if the labor force participation rate — the fraction of the population either working or actively looking for work — were at the same level as when George Bush took office .
On top of that , retail sales tanked in December as worried consumers cut back on holiday spending .
Finally , the terminally volatile stock market registered one of its worst Januaries on record , enough to induce a panicked Fed to make an emergency interest - rate cut .
But even leaving these and other recent numbers aside , U.S. economic performance this decade has been nothing to write home about .
The economy has now expanded for 74 straight months , from November 2001 to December 2007 , far longer than the usual 51 - month post - WWII expansion .
But economic growth has been the slowest of any post - WWII expansion , averaging just 2.8 % a year , far below the 4.3 % average posted by earlier post - WWII business cycles of similar length .
Worse yet , the economic growth that has occurred has done so little for so many — and so much for so few .
Employment expanded by just 0.9 % a year since the recovery began , compared with an average of 2.5 % for all recoveries that have lasted at least this long .
After correcting for inflation , weekly wages were just 1.9 % higher in October 2007 than at the onset of the last recession in March 2001 .
The average post - WWII expansion drove wages up by twice that amount , 3.8 % .
Seven million more people were without health insurance in 2006 than when the expansion began in 2001 .
Median household income actually fell during this recovery .
After correcting for inflation , median household income in 2006 ( the latest year for which data are available ) was down 2.0 % from its 2000 level , and down 8.0 % for black families .
during this recovery .
After correcting for inflation , median household income in 2006 ( the latest year for which data are available ) was down 2.0 % from its 2000 level , and down 8.0 % for black families .
The poverty rate was 12.3 % in 2006 ( again the latest year available ) , down from 12.6 % in 2005 , but still a full percentage point above the 11.3 % rate at the onset of the last recession .
U.S. inequality reached levels not seen since the 1920s as the average real ( inflation - adjusted ) income of the richest 1 % of households rose 34.8 % from 2001 to 2005 , while rising just 0.8 % for the middle fifth of the population and falling by 3.0 % for the poorest fifth .
by 3.0 % for the poorest fifth .
And corporate profits skyrocketed .
Inflation - adjusted corporate profits rose 12.8 % a year during the first five years of this recovery , compared to an 8.3 % average growth rate in the other post - WWII recoveries lasting at least as long .
No wonder 7 out of 10 people think the U.S. economy is heading into a recession , according to a recent poll conducted by the Economic Cycle Research Institute , a New York - based independent think tank .
For many , the recession that began in March 2001 and ended , officially , that October has in reality continued straight through the decade .
Pop Goes the Housing Bubble
Besides punishing people who work for a living and those who can't even find a job , the 2008 economy will face a financial crisis brought on by the bursting of the housing bubble .
How bad will it get ?
Pretty bad .
A decade long stagnation , as Harvard economist Larry Summers suggests , or " the worst housing bust ever , " as NYU professor Noureil Roubini suggests , are not out of the question .
Here is why .
To begin with , subprime borrowers are not the only ones in trouble .
The same types of loans that imposed inordinate risks on subprime borrowers have left many other homeowners vulnerable to foreclosure as well .
Defaults are now engulfing even better - off borrowers saddled with adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , subprime or not , whose low introductory monthly payments are reset upward as interest rates rise in the economy .
About one - quarter ( 24 % ) of all home loans are ARMs .
Merrill Lynch economists have called ARM mortgages " ticking time bombs " that they suspect will add another $ 100 billion in losses , on top of an estimated $ 400 billion in losses on subprime and other mortgages .
Lehman Brothers estimates that nearly $ 156 billion worth of one particular type of ARM ( so - called option ARMs ) will face payment resets between 2008 and the second quarter of 2012 .
If home prices fall by 6 % or more in both 2008 and 2009 , the borrowers in over $ 90 billion of these loans would owe as much as or more than the market value of their homes .
With a growing number of borrowers already owing more than their houses are worth and , so , unable to refinance , foreclosure and delinquency rates have soared .
By the third quarter of 2007 , the percentage of home owners behind in their mortgage payments on all one - to four - unit residential loans already stood at a 19 - year high , according to a Mortgage Bankers Association survey , and the percent of loans in the process of foreclosure was the highest ever .
As of October , home prices in the ten major metropolitan areas that make up the S&P / Case - Shiller home - price index were down a record 6.7 % from a year earlier .
In Las Vegas , Miami , San Diego , and Phoenix , cities whose housing markets were sizzling just a few years ago , housing prices have fallen even faster , dropping by 10 % or more over the same period .
Existing home sales were at their lowest rate on record , and down about one - third from their mid-2005 peak .
Not surprisingly , then , the supply of detached single - family homes listed for sale in October 2007 was at its highest ( relative to the pace of sales ) since 1985 , according to the National Association of Realtors .
A glut of unsold houses has in turn squashed housing starts , which hit a 16 - year low in December .
How much more will housing prices drop and when will they hit bottom ?
While one real estate economist suggests that " parts of the housing market are scratching bottom right now , " others think housing prices wo n't bottom out until 2009 or even 2010 and forecast prices at that point may be 12 % lower than their peak levels .
Summers points to one property derivatives market indicating that over the next several years , house prices could fall by as much as 25 % from their previous peaks nationwide .
For anyone who does n't believe that housing prices can fall for a long time , the recent history of the Japanese housing market suggests otherwise .
So does the size of the U.S. housing bubble , which drove home prices up further and for longer than any period since 1890 , according to Yale economist Robert Shiller 's long - term U.S. house price index .
Economic journalist Doug Henwood , publisher of the Left Business Observer , calculates that housing prices at their peak were 40 % above Schiller 's long - term trend line , and notes that a 20 % to 25 % drop in housing prices would be " in line with past experience . "
During the bubble , housing prices rose far more quickly than income ; the resulting imbalance is another reason to expect home prices to keep falling .
From 2000 to 2006 nationwide housing prices jumped 74 % , while median household income rose just 15 % ( before correcting for inflation ) .
To restore a historically normal ratio of housing prices to incomes , average home prices would have to fall by more than 30 % percent from their peak levels , according to Princeton economist Paul Krugman .
Consumers to the Rescue ?
The bursting of the housing bubble will likely put more of a dent in consumer spending than the stock market collapse of 2001 .
The two bubbles are of comparable size .
But historically , a $ 100 rise in housing wealth leads to about a $ 6 increase in long - run consumption , one and a half times the $ 4 gain from the same increase in stock wealth .
Likewise , the current fall in housing wealth will likely translate into a sharper dropoff in consumer spending than would an equal - size fall in stock wealth .
And household consumption has been especially important in this decade 's expansion .
It now represents a record 72 % of GDP , up from about 67 % in the late 1990s .
So you can expect a collapse of consumer spending to trigger a deeper recession than the 2001 downturn set off by the dot - com bust and a collapse in business capital spending , which at the time accounted for only 13 % of GDP .
In November , a report by the forecasting firm Global Insight for the U.S. Conference of Mayors predicted that " the deepening housing crisis will cut economic growth by more than 25 percent in 143 U.S. metropolitan areas by next year . "
Meanwhile , as house prices fall and unemployment rises , defaults on consumer loans and credit cards , which put a sizeable dent in even American Express 's earnings last year , will spike in 2008 .
And since consumer debt is chopped up , bundled , and resold much like mortgages are , bad consumer debt will add to the fragility of the financial system as far - flung creditors take further losses .
While more and more business economists now foresee recession in 2008 , many remain convinced the U.S. economy will get through the year without lapsing into a recession .
Most of the optimists are betting that foreign economies will provide enough stimulus to keep the U.S. economy out of recession .
Recent Fed interest - rate cuts have reduced the value of the dollar , which in turn lowers the price of U.S. products to foreign consumers .
This should spur U.S. export growth and buoy the economy .
Indeed , in a recent note Morgan Stanley economists told their clients that their " meager " growth forecast for 2008 would be negative if not for export growth .
Perhaps the fast - growing emerging economies in the developing world offer some hope .
In 2007 emerging economies contributed half of the globe 's GDP growth measured at market exchange rates , over three times as much as the United States ' did .
In addition , emerging markets , which buy more than half of U.S. exports , continue to grow , some at an accelerating pace , even as industrialized economies cool .
" This time , " The Economist proposed in November , " they could be the rescuers . "
" Do n't count on it , " says economist Stephen Roach , chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia .
" American consumers spent close to $ 9.5 trillion over the last year .
Chinese consumers spent around $ 1 trillion and Indians spent $ 650 billion .
It is almost mathematically impossible for China and India to offset a pullback in American consumption . "
False Savior
All eyes are now on the Fed as it tries to prevent the housing slump from dragging down the broader economy by cutting interest rates and pumping liquidity into the system — as it has following other financial crises .
The Fed has cut interest rates repeatedly since the middle of last year and two times in January alone , including an extraordinary three - quarters of a percentage point cut to prop up the teetering stock market .
But because the current problem is not liquidity but solvency , the Fed 's actions will likely be ineffective this time around .
Injecting money into the economy wo n't solve today 's credit problem because banks are reluctant to lend , even to other banks , when they do n't know how much of the economy 's bad mortgage debt any borrower may be holding .
So when the Fed adds liquidity to the system , banks either hoard the money or , like everyone else , buy safe Treasury bills .
With few willing buy to other bonds , long - term interest rates , or the yields on those bonds , have not dropped , despite repeated liquidity injections by the Fed .
For instance , the interbank lending rate is still well above the rates on much safer government bond yields of similar maturity .
Economist and American Prospect editor Robert Kuttner likens the situation to " [t ] he financial system holding a $ 400,000 mortgage on a $ 300,000 house .
Lower interest rates can't fix that problem nor give people the confidence to lend . "
The ability of the Fed to pull the U.S. economy 's fat out of this fire is constrained in other ways as well .
At the end of last year , higher energy costs and imports made more expensive by the declining value of the dollar pushed up consumer prices .
The pick - up in inflation will make the Fed reluctant to cut interest rates further .
So too will the massive U.S. current account deficit .
Each year the United States finances the huge gap between its imports and exports by enticing Asian and other foreign investors to buy dollar - denominated assets such as government bonds and corporate stocks and bonds .
When the Fed cuts interest rates , that lowers the rate of return on U.S. assets and makes them less attractive to foreign investors — especially as the U.S. economy falters .
Should purchases of U.S. securities by foreign investors slow dramatically , then the dollar would crash , stock values would plummet , and a far more severe economic downturn would surely follow .
The " D " Word
With the sharp tightening of credit brought on by the bursting of the housing bubble , and with the Fed 's ability to affect the picture highly limited , chilling comparisons between today 's rocky economy and the 1920s economy prior to the onset of the Great Depression are now commonplace .
No one has beaten that drum louder than Kuttner .
" Future historians are likely to look back on the final year of the Bush administration as a moment not unlike 1930 , when government dithered while a financial crisis deepened , " he warns .
The comparison is an apt one .
Reckless private borrowing and gaping inequality defined both periods .
What 's more , in both periods a borrowing binge pushed up asset prices , first stock prices and then housing prices in the current period , to historically unprecedented levels compared to economic growth and incomes , saddling the economy with unsustainable levels of debt .
At some point that mounting debt will cut the economy down to size , perhaps in a sudden debt deflation similar to the Great Depression , in which the value of most assets , not just housing , sinks below the value of the debt on those assets .
More likely the post - stock market crash , post - housing bubble U.S. economy will sink into a lengthy period of economic malaise that looks as dismal as the economic prospects that most working people have already faced over the last decade .
It does n't have to be that way .
But much will have to be done to rescue today 's economy from its free - market excesses and to improve the life chances of those who have suffered as a few have enriched themselves .
Spending and tax relief targeted at the most hard - pressed , who can be counted on to spend any extra money they get and immediately boost consumption , is not a bad place to start .
Other good , quick stimulus measures include expanding unemployment insurance , cutting payroll taxes for families of modest incomes , getting funds to cash - strapped state governments so they can continue to deliver services , and providing mortgage relief for low - income homeowners .
But the economic stimulus package the Bush administration and the Democratic leadership of the House recently agreed on does not cover even this modest agenda : it fails to extend unemployment insurance or funnel monies to state governments , and it wastes one - third of its $ 150 billion price tag on accelerated - depreciation tax breaks for business that have no track record of inducing new investment , especially in a timely way .
And whatever the specifics , a $ 150 billion package is far too small to change to the direction of the $ 14 trillion U.S. economy .
Massive social investment and fundamental financial reform are needed to put the bubble economy out of business and to create a housing market that serves the needs of most people , not speculators .
Back in December , former democratic presidential candidate John Edwards proposed a progressive stimulus package that would also address some of the country 's long - term environmental and energy needs .
The Edwards plan would build a clean energy infrastructure , provide relief to states , expand unemployment insurance , and help families facing foreclosures .
Nobel Prize - winning economist and mainstream rebel Joseph Stiglitz proposes some additional worthy projects : more federal support for state education budgets , tax breaks and spending to lower emissions .
While it would take a while to get those programs in place , Stiglitz warns that this downturn is likely to last longer than other recent downturns .
Until those measures and many more are undertaken , the macroeconomy will lurch from bubble to bubble , while most people endure unrelenting economic hardship that intensifies when in an economic downturn but persists even when the economy grows .

Step - By - Step , Inch - By - Inch , Obama Tip - Toes Up To Clinton 's Back Door in Ohio :
In a Democratic Primary in Ohio today , 02/26/08 , the day the candidates debate in Cleveland , and 7 days before the votes are counted , Hillary Clinton is 6 points in front of Barack Obama , 50 % to 44 % , according to a SurveyUSA poll conducted for WCMH - TV Columbus , WKYC - TV Cleveland , WCPO - TV Cincinnati , and WHIO - TV Dayton .
Two weeks ago , Clinton led by 17 .
One week ago , Clinton led by 9 .
Today : 6 . Clinton holds her ground in greater Cleveland , greater Columbus , and greater Cincinnati .
Clinton is steady among seniors , among voters focused on Health Care , among Moderates , among Pro-Choicers , and among women .
Though Clinton trails among men , Obama has stopped making further inroads there .
However : Among registered Democrats , Clinton had led by 21 , then led by 17 , now leads by 8 .
Among voters under age 50 , Clinton had led by 9 , then trailed by 2 , now trails by 7 .
Among Pro-Life voters , Clinton had led by 11 , then led by 8 , now trails by 5 .
Among voters focused on the Economy , Clinton had led by 25 , then by 21 , now by 14 .
In greater Toledo , Clinton had led by 29 , now leads by 1 .
Early voting favors Clinton : Among the 12 % of respondents who tell SurveyUSA they have already voted , Clinton leads by 22 points .
For Obama to win Ohio , he must receive at least 52 % of the remaining likely voters .
If Clinton gets more than 48 % of the remaining Democratic Primary votes , Clinton wins the state .
Because the convention delegates are allocated proportionally , a win for either candidate is not as profound as the symbolism that goes with it .
While the US Department of Energy has spent $ 57.5 billion over the past 30 years for research & development on advanced energy technologies such as Ethanol , solar and wind power the nation ’s energy usage has not dramatically changed — fossil fuels today provide 85 % of the nation ’s energy compared to 93 % in 1973 .
Many technical , cost and environmental challenges must be overcome in developing and demonstrating advanced technologies before they can be deployed in the US with greater impact .
Those were just some of the not - too - encouraging conclusions the Government Accountability Office told the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment , Committee on Science and Technology today .
The DOE ’s fiscal year 2009 budget , as compared with 2008 , flies in the face of advanced energy development by seeking slightly less budget money for renewable energy R&D , while seeking increases of 34 % for fossil energy R&D and 44 % for nuclear energy R&D. added Mark Gaffigan , the GAO ’s acting Director of Natural Resources and Environment .
For better or worse the GAO said the DOE ’s recent R&D focus in renewable energy has been in biomass - derived ethanol ; hydrogen - powered fuel cells ; wind technologies ; and solar technologies .
The primary focus of ethanol and hydrogen R&D is to displace oil in the transportation sector .
The primary focus of wind and solar technologies is to generate electricity .
According to the GAO report , here ’s where that research stands :
· Ethanol : DOE ’s short - term R&D goal is to help meet the administration ’s goal of substituting 20 % of gasoline consumption in 10 years with alternative fuels , primarily biomass - derived ethanol .
DOE ’s longer - term R&D goal is to develop new technologies to allow the ethanol industry to expand enough to displace 30 % of gasoline requirements — about 60 billion gallons — by 2030 .
In 2007 , industry produced over 7 billion gallons of ethanol , displacing about 3 % of the nation ’s oil consumption .
Ethanol , however , faces high production and infrastructure costs , creating challenges in competing with gasoline nationally .
Ethanol refiners in the United States rely mostly on corn as a feedstock , the use of which has contributed to price increases for some food products , and ethanol ’s corrosive properties create challenges in developing an infrastructure for delivering and dispensing it , the GAO said .
DOE ’s R&D focuses on developing a more sustainable and competitive feedstock than corn , primarily by exploring technologies to use cellulosic biomass from , for example , agricultural residues or fast - growing grasses and trees ; reducing the cost of producing cellulosic ethanol to $ 1.33 per gallon by 2012 and $ 1.20 per gallon by 2017 .
Although DOE has made progress in reducing ethanol production costs , cellulosic ethanol in 2007 — based on current corn prices — still cost about 50 % more to produce than corn ethanol , the GAO said .
· Hydrogen - powered fuel cells :
The long - term R&D goal of DOE ’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative is to provide hydrogen fuel cell technologies to industry by 2015 to enable industry to commercialize them by 2020 .
To be commercialized , hydrogen fuel cells must be competitive with gasoline vehicles in terms of price , convenience , safety , and durability .
Hydrogen is the preferred fuel for vehicle fuel cells because of the ease with which it can be converted to electricity and its ability to combine with oxygen to emit only water and heat as byproducts , the GAO said .
The DOE has made important progress in developing hydrogen fuel cells , but the program has set very ambitious targets and some of the most difficult technical challenges– –those that require significant scientific advances––lie ahead .
Specifically , R&D for vehicles includes reducing the cost of commercial - scale manufacturing of fuel cells by nearly fourfold , storing enough hydrogen on board a fuel - cell vehicle to enable a 300 - mile driving range , and increasing the durability of fuel cells by more than threefold to match the 150,000 mile life - span of gasoline vehicles .
DOE ’s fiscal year 2009 budget request would reduce funding for the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative by 17 % from $ 283.5 million in fiscal year 2008 to $ 236 million in fiscal year 2009 .
The budget also proposes to increase the proportion of longer - term R&D by increasing the funding for basic research .
Although the Hydrogen Program Manager told us that funding is sufficient to meet target dates for critical technologies , other target dates for supporting technologies — such as hydrogen production from renewable sources — would be pushed back , according to the GAO .
· Wind technologies : DOE is assessing its long - term vision of generating 20 % of the nation ’s electricity using wind energy by 2030 .
Its current R&D efforts , however , are focused on more immediate expansion of the wind industry , particularly on utility - scale wind turbines .
One of DOE ’s targets is to increase the number of distributed wind turbines deployed in the United States from 2,400 in 2007 to 12,000 in 2015 .
Although wind energy has grown in recent years , from about 1,800 megawatts in 1996 to over 16,800 megawatts in 2007 , the wind industry still faces investors ’ concerns about high up - front capital costs , including connecting the wind farms to the power transmission grid , the GAO said .
· Solar technologies : DOE ’s R&D goal is for solar power to be unsubsidized and cost competitive with conventional technologies by 2015 by , for example , developing new thin - film photovoltaic technologies using less expensive semiconductor material than crystalline - silicon to reduce solar cell manufacturing cost .
Specifically , DOE is working to reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems from about 18 - 23 cents per kilowatt hour in 2005 to about 5 - 10 cents per kilowatt hour in 2015 .
DOE is also conducting R&D to reduce the cost and improve the reliability of concentrating solar power technologies , which use various mirror configurations to convert the sun ’s energy to heat to generate electricity .
Investors ’ concerns about high up - front capital costs are among the most significant challenges in deploying photovoltaic or concentrating solar energy technologies .
This requires both technologies to have lower costs for installation and operations and maintenance , better efficiency of converting solar power to electricity , and longer - term ( 20 to 30 years ) durability .
· Clean coal technologies : DOE ’s R&D goal is to reduce harmful power plant emissions to “ near - zero ” levels by 2020 .
For new power plant applications , DOE is developing and demonstrating advanced integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) technologies .
In 2003 , DOE announced plans to construct a near - zero emissions commercial scale R&D facility called FutureGen with an alliance of coal mining and coal - based electric generating companies .
DOE had originally pledged about three - quarters of the estimated $ 1 billion cost of the FutureGen project .
With escalation costs and rising price of materials and labor , the estimated project costs rose to nearly $ 1.8 billion .
As a result , DOE announced in January 2008 that it is restructuring FutureGen to focus on multiple , competitively selected projects that demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration at commercially viable power plant project sites .
The impact of DOE ’s restructuring on FutureGen at this time is not known , but an industry official from the FutureGen Alliance noted that the project cannot go forward without federal government assistance .
Because it is unlikely that DOE ’s energy R&D funding alone will be sufficient to significantly diversify the nation ’s energy portfolio , coordinating energy R&D with other federal programs , policies , incentives , standards , and mandates that can impact the nation ’s energy portfolio will be important for targeting any desired goals to change the nation ’s energy portfolio , Gaffigan stated .
A key factor to any sustainable deployment of advanced energy technologies will be to make them cost competitive , while addressing technical and environmental challenges , so that the market can support a more diversified portfolio .
Otherwise , without sustained higher energy prices for our current portfolio , or concerted , high - profile federal government leadership , US consumers are unlikely to change their energy - use patterns , and the U.S. energy use will not significantly change .
Recently a diverse committee of engineers and scientists - including Larry Page , co-founder and president of products , Google , Robert Langer , Institute Professor , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Robert Socolow , professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , Princeton University Environmental Institute - came up with a list of the greatest engineering challenges for the 21st centrury .
Many of the challenged had to do with develoing advanced energy resources .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Both Republicans and Democrats appear convinced at this point that Barack Obama is going to win the Democratic presidential nomination .
Not only does Obama enjoy this perceptual aura of inevitability , but he also is widely seen as the candidate who would provide the stiffer challenge for John McCain in November .
Republicans say he would be tougher for McCain to beat , and Democrats say he would have the best chance of beating McCain come November .
The latest USA Today / Gallup poll asked Americans which candidate " will win the Democratic nomination this year , " Hillary Clinton or Obama .
There 's little question about Americans ' feelings on this issue .
Almost three - quarters say Obama will win his party 's nomination , compared with only 20 % who say Clinton will win .
That perception of inevitability is present among both Republicans and Democrats : 82 % of Republicans and 70 % of Democrats say Obama will win .
Only 23 % of Democrats believe Clinton will win their party 's nomination -- despite the fact that in this sample , about 4 out of 10 Democrats say they personally support Clinton .
In fact , only half of Democrats who support the former first lady believe she will win the nomination ; 43 % believe she will not .
Only 5 % of Democrats who support Obama think Clinton will be the nominee ; 91 % think " their " candidate , Obama , will win .
Gallup first asked Americans in early January who they thought would win the Democratic nomination .
At that point , just after the Iowa caucuses that Obama had swept , the American public was much less certain that Obama would win his party 's nomination .
Democrats in particular were almost as likely to say Clinton ( 36 % ) would win as to say Obama ( 41 % ) would win .
Not only do the significant majority of Americans see Obama 's capture of the Democratic Party 's nomination as inevitable , both Republicans and Democrats perceive him as the candidate who would present the more formidable challenge to presumptive Republican nominee McCain .
Democrats by more than a 2 - to - 1 margin ( 63 % to 30 % ) say Obama -- rather than Clinton -- " has the best chance of beating the Republican in November . "
Democrats no doubt would be pleased to find out that Republicans are much more fearful of Obama than Clinton .
A separate question asked of Republicans found them saying by an overwhelming 66 % to 18 % margin that McCain would have an easier time of beating Clinton than Obama .
Bottom Line
It appears the substantial majority of Americans have concluded that Obama is going to be the Democratic Party 's nominee this year -- even before he has won the required number of delegates and before voting takes place in the crucial March 4 primary states of Texas and Ohio .
Importantly , close to half of Democrats who say they support Clinton concede that Obama is going to win their party 's nomination .
Another sign of Obama 's strength is the perception of Democrats and Republicans alike that Obama would be the more difficult opponent for McCain to beat in November .
These perceptions can change , but the data show that Obama currently has the strong edge in both perceptions and momentum .
This puts even more pressure on Clinton not only to do well in the March 4 primaries , but to win impressively .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 2,021 adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 21 - 24 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
The margin of sampling error is larger for specific subsamples .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
People who have smuggled in satellite dishes provide illegal connections to the Internet for a fee or download movies to sell on discs .
Others exploit the connections to the Web of foreign businesses and state - run enterprises .
Employees with the ability to connect to the Internet often sell their passwords and identification numbers for use in the middle of the night .
Hotels catering to tourists provide Internet services , and Cubans also exploit those conduits to the Web .

Even the country ’s top computer science school , the University of Information Sciences , set in a campus once used by Cuba ’s spy services , has become a hotbed of cyber -rebels .
Students download everything from the latest American television shows to articles and videos criticizing the government , and pass them quickly around the island .
“ There is a whole underground market of this stuff , ” Ariel said .
The video of Mr. Alarcón ’s clash with students was leaked to the BBC and CNN , giving the world a rare glimpse of the discontent among the young with the system .
His answers to the questions seemed evasive .
Asked about the ban on travel , Mr. Alarcón suggested that if everyone who wished to were allowed to travel , there would not be enough airspace for the planes .
Another event many people witnessed through the digital underground was the arrival in the United States of Carlos Otero , a popular television personality and humorist in Cuba who defected in December while on a trip to Toronto .
Illegal antennas caught signals from Miami television stations , which youths turned into digital videos and shared .
Though the event smacked more of celebrity news than politics , it would never have been shown on the official media .
Congressman calls hearing after White House report shows 473 days of email ' missing ' RAW STORY
Published : Friday January 18 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Sixteen days of email missing from Cheney 's office A White House chart shown to Congress indicates no e-mail was archived on 473 days for various units of the Executive Office of the President , a House committee chairman says .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , says a White House spokesman 's comments suggesting no e-mail had disappeared conflicted with what congressional staffers were told in September .
He also said the White House has refused to make the chart public .
On Thursday night , Waxman said he was scheduling a hearing for Feb. 15 and challenged the White House to explain spokesman Tony Fratto's remark that " we have absolutely no reason to believe that any e-mails are missing . "
Fratto based his comment on the contents of a White House declaration filed in federal court casting doubt on the accuracy of a chart created by a former White House employee that points to a large volume of e-mail gone from White House servers .
The brief description of the chart in the sworn declaration appears to match Waxman 's description of what White House officials showed his staff at a Sept. 19 briefing .
There are 16 days of no archived e-mails from Sept. 12 , 2003 , to May 23 , 2005 , for the office of Vice President Dick Cheney , according to Waxman 's letter announcing the hearing .
There are a dozen days of no archived e-mails for the White House Office inside the EOP , starting Dec. 17 , 2003 , and ending on Feb.
8 , 2004 , Waxman 's letter added .
" Archived e-mails were missing from even more days in other parts of the White House , the analysis found , " according to the Washington Post .
" The Council on Environmental Quality and the Council of Economic Advisers , for example , showed no stored e-mails for 2 1/2 months beginning in November 2003 .
The Office of Management and Budget showed no messages for 59 days -- including the period from Nov. 1 , 2003 , to Dec. 9 , 2003 -- and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative showed no e-mail for 73 days . "
" The administration has so far refused to release the study and a number of documents related to it , including a large summary chart used in a closed - door briefing conducted for Waxman and other lawmakers last September by Emmet T. Flood , special counsel to the president , " the Post added .
The briefers took the chart with them when they left , Waxman said , but committee staffers had copied many of the details .
Waxman said the White House officials took the chart on which the information is based with them , while indicating the White House was doing an additional analysis to determine whether the information in the chart was accurate .
Asked to testify are White House Counsel Fred Fielding ; Alan Swendiman , director of the White House Office of Administration , and Allen Weinstein , archivist of the United States .
Waxman called the hearing after Fratto tried to tamp down the growing e-mail controversy .
Fratto's comments shifted away from White House statements last spring that expressed uncertainty over whether the allegations were true or not .
" We tried to reconstruct some of the work " in the chart and " could not authenticate the correctness of the data , " said Fratto .
" We have no evidence and we have no way of showing that any e-mail at all are missing . "
The existence of the chart surfaced Tuesday night in the White House declaration filed in lawsuits brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the private National Security Archive .
The declaration , which the White House was forced to file pursuant to court order , disclosed that before October 2003 , the White House recycled computer backup tapes containing e-mail .
Such a process would overwrite large numbers of e-mails .
The White House said it began preserving backup tapes in October 2003 , but recycled them before then .
If the chart of e-mail missing from archives turns out to be accurate , the backup tapes should contain substantially all e-mails sent or received in the 2003 - 2005 time period , the White House court declaration said .
" We have no reason to believe that there is any data missing at all " from White House computer servers , said Fratto .
" And we 've certainly found no evidence of any data missing . "
The court declaration said the White House was undertaking an independent assessment of a chart to determine whether any e-mail is missing .
The White House 's latest statements represent a shift from what it was saying last spring when it seemed uncertain whether e-mail was missing from the archives or not .
The latest statements also represent a shift from what the White House apparently told prosecutors over two years ago in the probe into the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame 's name .
In January 2006 , Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald reported that " we have learned that not all e-mail of the Office of Vice President and the Executive Office of the President for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the White House computer system . "
The White House says the e-mail matter arose in October 2005 in connection with the Justice Department 's CIA leak probe .
Fitzgerald revealed it to the public three months later in preparations for the trial of Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who was later convicted of four felonies in the Plame affair .
President Bush commuted Libby 's 30 - month prison term .

Representations of uncomputable and uncountable sets
Andrej Bauer
,
Occasionally I hear claims that uncountable and uncomputable sets cannot be represented on computers .
More generally , there are all sorts of misguided opinions about representations of data on computers , especially infinite data of mathematical nature .
Here is a quick tutorial on the matter whose main point is :
It is meaningless to discuss representations of a set by a datatype without also considering operations that we want to perform on the set .
Unless you tell me what it is that you would like to compute about the set , I can represent it whichever way I want .
You will never look at my representation because you will never do anything with the elements of your set .
By this line of reasoning you can represent any set $ X$ simply by the unit type , which has a single element $ ( ) $ .
Naturally , you will object that this makes little sense because all elements of $ X$ would have the same representation .
But that means you do care about the structure of $ X$ : you are interested in the inequality relation on $ X $ .
For a less trivial but still silly example , consider the set of all Turing machines .
The famous halting problem asks for an algorithm that decides , given a description of a Turing machine $ T$ , whether $ T$ halts when we run it on the empty tape .
Such an algorithm is easy to obtain if all we care about is the halting problem .
Simply represent each Turing machine $ T$ with a bit which is $ 1 $ if $ T$ halts and $ 0 $ if it does not .
This way it is really easy to decide whether $ T$ halts .
Silly ?
Yes , but it makes a point : it is not the set we really want to represent but a set together with relevant operations on it .
What are the relevant operations on Turing machines ?
Essentially , we want a representation which makes the u-t-m and s-m-n theorems true .
The former says that the representation should be such that we can compute what happens when we apply a Turing machine to an input , and the latter that the currying operation should be computable .
One can prove that any such representation has an undecidable Halting problem .
That is much better .
In general , we can make any function $f : X \to Y$ whatsoever computable if we are allowed to change the representation of $ X $ : represent elements $ x in X $ as pairs $ ( a , b ) $ where $ a$ represents $ x $ ( in the original representation of $ X $ ) and $ b$ represents $ f ( x ) $ in the representation of $ Y$ .
The function $ f $ then becomes easily computable as the first projection : given a pair $ ( a , b ) $ representing $ x $ , the value $ f ( x ) $ is represented by $ b$ .
Sometimes it is quite hard to discover which operations on a set are “ relevant ” .
What would you say is the relevant structure of real numbers $ \mathbb {R} $ ?
Specialists in computable mathematics disagree about the answer .
Everyone wants computable arithmetic operations $ +$ , $ -$ , $ \times $ , $ / $ and computable constants $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ , but what else ?
If you say that the relation $ <$ should be computable as a function from $ \mathbb {
R} $ to boolean truth values , you are in good company , although you have opted for a rather unrealistic model of real number computation .
It is much more reasonable to require that $ <$ be computable as a function from $ \mathbb {
R} $ to semidecidable truth values .
In essence , the relevant structure of the reals is that of a Dedekind complete Archimedean ordered field which is also overt , Hausdorff , and locally compact .
No , wait !
The relevant structure is that of a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field !
Oh no , I disagree with myself !
At least the good news is that once we have settled the relevant mathematical structure of a set , we can automatically compute a description of its computer representation .
Remember then , when you see someone claiming that such - and - such set is not representable by a computer , you should always ask “ but what operations on the set do you want to compute with ? ”
Representing uncountable sets
There are two popular arguments which allegedly show that we cannot represent uncountable sets by computers :
Computers represent everything by finite sequences of 0’s and 1’s .
There are only countably many such sequences , therefore , we cannot represent an uncountable set .
Even if we allow infinite binary streams , we will be able to actually use only the computable ones , and there are only countably many of those .
It is true that there are only countably many finite sequences of 0’s and 1’s .
To be more precise , there are computably countably many such sequences because there is a program that enumerates them .
But did you know that a computably countable set may contain subsets which fail to be computably countable ?
For example , the set of all Turing machines is computably countable , but the subset of those Turing machines which do not halt is not .
The first argument relies on the fact that we are talking about arbitrary enumerations , including non-computable ones .
In fact , if we take computability seriously , the second argument immediately fails because the set of computable infinite streams of 0’s and 1’s is computably uncountable by a famous diagonal argument .
( Note that “ computably uncountable ” is more than “ not computably countable ” : the former means that given any enumeration we can compute an element outside the enumeration , while the latter just says that there is no enumeration of all elements . )
The second argument stands only if we mix “ computable ” and “ non-computable ” ingredients in just the right way .
Even if we disregard the theoretical issues about computable vs. non-computable enumerations , we are still left with the question whether real computers “ contain ” non-computable sequences .
Do they ?
Does the universe ?
Or do you claim that all streams of 0’s and 1 ’s that physicists are able to feed into computers are definitely computable ?
Perhaps physicists should devise an experiment that would tell us something about existence of non-computable streams .
I think we would quickly discover that such an experiment is in principle impossible because we may only ever observe finite prefixes of a binary stream .
According to the Verification principle this makes the question meaningless and any position about its truth an article of faith .
To conclude , let us then say that computers can represent all infinite binary streams of our universe , because computers are equipped with I/O devices that let them interact with the universe .
Whether there are uncountably many binary streams in the universe is a matter of faith if you are a human physicist trained in classical logic .
If you are a computer the matter is clear : there are computably uncountably many binary streams .
A much more interesting question is whether the space of binary streams is compact , but that is another story .
Living in Tokyo , the world 's largest metropolitan area , is n't easy - even more so if you have a pet .
Landlords are increasingly restricting pet ownership by tenants in the city 's high - demand rental apartments .
Even if you can find one that does allow pets , the shockingly small size of Japanese apartments makes pet ownership prohibitive .
The solution ?
Rent a cat at one of the city 's popular new cat cafés !
For just 800 yen an hour ( about $ 8 ) , you can get your fix of feline fellowship from - in the case of Calico - one of 19 " staff " kitties .
Located in the Kichijoji district of western Tokyo , Calico has been a roaring , er , meowing success to the point where reservations are recommended on weekends and holidays .
Once inside , Calico 's customers can enjoy drinks , sip on tea and lounge about , catlike , on comfy chairs and cushions .
The latter , embroidered with cute cats , are also available for sale so that café clients can take a little of the Calico experience home with them .
Calico is a business first and foremost so a variety of other goodies are also on sale including sweets , cat stickers , even jewelry .
Calico's owner , Takafumi Fukui , says that because " In Tokyo , many people are not allowed to have cats [ at home ] even if they want to do so , " having a place like Calico gives pet - lovers a place to unwind in the company of cats .
Calico 's customers agree : " This is just like having my own cat as a pet at home .
They have a soothing effect on me , " according to one 22 - year - old female college student at her first visit to Calico .
Seems it wo n't be her last !

Not too long ago , I added my company , Inedo , to the federal government 's Central Contractor Registration system .
I do n't know , I just did n't want to miss out on all the fun every one seems to have with government work .
Whenever one signs up for virtually any government thing , a deluge of companies somehow manage to find to out .
The CCR is certainly no exception .
One of the many companies that contacted me after signing up was the Federal Suppliers Guide .
The initial cold call went something like this :
FSG Rep : Hi Alex , I 've got some great news for you !
( Let me guess ... you can save me a lot of money on something ... )
Me : Okay ...
FSG Rep :
We 've reviewed your CCR registration , and it looks like your company could be eligible for placement in our guide !
( Wow , that * is* great news ! )
Me : Your guide ?
FSG Rep : The Suppliers Guide !
It 's used * exclusively * by state and federal agencies to purchase services and products .
Anyway , to confirm your eligibility , I 'll need to ask a few questions .
First , where are you located ?
--- snipped a total of three questions asked --- FSG Rep : Okay ... well , let me punch this in here -- clickity clickity clicky -- wow !
This is really good !
You are , in fact , eligible for the guide !
Would you like to be in our guide ?
( There 's no possible way there could be any sort of catch here ... )
Me : Sure !
Why not ?
FSG Rep : Fantastic !
There 's just a nominal fee to get started , so if you 'll just get me your credit card number we can -- Me : How much is the nominal fee ?
FSG Rep : Heh , it 's really very little actually .
It 's a fantastic investment that ranges anywhere from six hundred to several thousand .
Me : I can't make that decision right now ; can you send me over some information ?
FSG Rep : Oh .
You can't ?
Well , I mean , I guess I could send you more information ... but you know , I can just answer any questions you have now .
I mean , I 'd hate for you to lose your eligibility , that 's all !
( What a nice guy !
And this whole time , I thought he was a fast - talking salesman ... )
Me : I guess we 'll just have to take that risk ; can you also send me a copy the guide , too ?
FSG Rep : Err , gee ... well , you know ... that 's the one thing I can't do .
You see , these guides are to be used * exclusively * by government agents .
We can't just give them to anyone , you know .
( And to think , I was questioning whether they were even legitimate ! )
Me : Okaaaay ... just send me what you can then .
After a bit more back - and - forth about how he could " just answer any questions I had right now " , the sales rep pointed me to their sample ads , a 7 mb PDF with sixteen pages of seemingly real companies , all with the same phone number ( 555-555-5555 ) and the same website ( 00000000000.com ) .
Somehow , that did n't convince me to " invest " several hundred dollars , so the salesman faxed over some more inforation with a single , real ad .
As I eagerly waited for the follow - up call later that day , I thought I 'd take a minute or two to check out their website .
Almost immediately , I came across their Federal Procurement Officers
Only page .
Out of curiousity , I entered a username and password , and then clicked the Login button .
Instantly , a JavaScript dialog popped - up ...
Since there 's really only one thing that could cause such a dialog to pop -up so fast , I checked the source code ...
< script language= " javascript " >
<!--// /*This Script allows people to enter by using a form that asks for a UserID and Password */ function pasuser ( form ) { if ( form.id.value= = " buyers " ) { if ( form.pass.value==" gov1996 " ) { location = " http://officers.federalsuppliers.com/agents.html " } else { alert ( " Invalid Password " ) } } else { alert ( " Invalid UserID " ) } } //--> </script >
And sure enough , following that URL ( UPDATE : now taken offline ) led me to the " SECURE Federal Suppliers Guide Listings for Agents " [ sic ] page .
Having obviously way too much free time on my hands , I clicked through the secure guide and called a few of the companies listed to inquire about the ad .
The response was overwhelmingly the same : we spent several [ hundred|thousand ] bucks on this ad , and have n't had a single call -- aside from yours just now -- in [ one|two|three ] year [s ] regarding it .
When the sales rep called later , I decided to politely explain why I would n't be " investing " at this time ...
Me : I called a few of your clients for references , and none of them received a single lead from the -- FSG Rep : Wait - wait - wait ... clients ?
You called our clients ?
How did you -- Me : Err , well , I just clicked the " Agents " link -- FSG Rep :
You can't access that page !
That 's for Federal Procurement Officers Only !
It 's password protected !
Me : Well , umm , the password was right there on the -- FSG Rep : So you hacked our site !?
You can't do that !
It 's SECURE !
You can get in a lot of trouble for hacking !
The conversation quickly went downhill from there .
Needless to say , I decided against investing in the guide .
But the good news is , despite hacking their site , I 'm still eligible for inclusion in the guide !
The Economist begins a series of articles on the global saving glut , global investment deficit , excess liquidity , and slow expected world growth hypotheses for the persistence of low long - term interest rates , with an emphasis on world saving patterns .
This introductory piece asks whether Ben Bernanke , who can be assigned responsibility for both monetary and fiscal policy , was correct to deflect criticism over the current account deficit away from U.S. policymakers .
It concludes that the U.S. must shoulder more responsibility for global imbalances than Bernanke 's global saving glut hypothesis allows .
The paper also concludes that rebalancing will take time and invlolve risks to the world economy .
The second figure showing the shift in saving from the household to the business sector in recent years is noteworthy , though the chart shows this is not the first time household saving has dropped and corporate saving has risen since 1980 :
The great thrift shift , by Zanny Minton Beddoes , The Economist : On March 10th 2005 , Ben Bernanke ... argued ... the world might be suffering from a “ global saving glut ” .
The phrase immediately caught on .
...
The idea 's appeal lies in the way it ties together two of the most vexing questions about today 's economic landscape : why are interest rates so low ?
And why can America borrow eye - popping amounts from foreigners with seeming impunity ?
... A “ global saving glut ” could explain both oddities .
...
His suggestion that the causes of global imbalances lie elsewhere conveniently deflects attention from monetary and fiscal decisions ...
It suggests that Mr Greenspan 's loose monetary policy and George Bush 's tax cuts are not responsible for the imbalances in the world economy .
That may seem a little self - serving , coming from a man who has subsequently moved from the Federal Reserve to become chairman of Mr Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers .
Taken at face value , the notion of a global saving glut is not borne out by the facts .
“ Glut ” suggests an unusually large amount , as in a summer glut of strawberries .
In fact , figures published in the IMF 's latest World Economic Outlook show that the rate of global saving as a proportion of global output , measured at market exchange rates , has mostly been heading downhill over the past 30 years , with a particularly steep plunge between 2000 and 2002 ( see chart 1 ) ...
But Mr Bernanke 's argument is more subtle .
He is saying that low interest rates imply too much saving relative to the amount people want to invest , and that the ... discrepancy is concentrated outside America .
... [ E ]ven with the saving rate falling , there could be a glut of thrift if ... the demand for investment ... was falling even faster .
The important factors in the equation , therefore , are shifts in the appetite for investment as well as in the geography of thrift .
On both counts the world has seen big changes .
Traditionally , most of the saving ... is done by households , whereas most of the investing tends to be done by firms .
But in the past few years firms have become net savers as their profits have exceeded their investments .
That change has been most pronounced and long - lasting in Japan , where corporate saving soared after the bubble economy collapsed in the early 1990s .
Burdened with bad debts ... , Japanese firms have been net savers for a decade .
The late 1990s saw a similar shift in many emerging Asian economies , where corporate investment plunged after the Asian financial crisis .
After the stockmarket bubble burst in 2000 , American and European firms ' investment also fell .
Although American firms began investing again a couple of years ago , the level of corporate investment is still relatively low , given how strongly the economy — and profits — have been growing .
Firms in industrial countries as a whole are still saving more than they invest , despite record profits ( see chart 2 ) .
The only significant country bucking the trend is China , where investment has been rising sharply .
But saving has been growing faster still .

What does “ GPL ” stand for ?
# WhatDoesGPLStandFor )
“ GPL ” stands for “ General Public License ” .
The most widespread such license is the GNU General Public License , or GNU GPL for short .
This can be further shortened to “ GPL ” , when it is understood that the GNU GPL is the one intended .
Does free software mean using the GPL ? # DoesFreeSoftwareMeanUsingTheGPL )
Not at all — there are many other free software licenses .
We have an incomplete list .
Any license that provides the user certain specific freedoms is a free software license .
Why should I use the GNU GPL rather than other free software licenses ?
# WhyUseGPL )
Using the GNU GPL will require that all the released improved versions be free software .
This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete with a proprietary modified version of your own work .
However , in some special situations it can be better to use a more permissive license .
Does all GNU software use the GNU GPL as its license ?
# DoesAllGNUSoftwareUseTheGNUGPLAsItsLicense )
Most GNU software packages use the GNU GPL , but there are a few GNU programs ( and parts of programs ) that use looser licenses , such as the Lesser GPL .
When we do this , it is a matter of strategy .
Does using the GPL for a program make it GNU software ?
# DoesUsingTheGPLForAProgramMakeItGNUSoftware )
Anyone can release a program under the GNU GPL , but that does not make it a GNU package .
Making the program a GNU software package means explicitly contributing to the GNU Project .
This happens when the program 's developers and the GNU Project agree to do it .
If you are interested in contributing a program to the GNU Project , please write to < maintainers@gnu.org >.
What should I do if I discover a possible violation of the GPL ? # ReportingViolation )
You should report it .
First , check the facts as best you can .
Then tell the publisher or copyright holder of the specific GPL - covered program .
If that is the Free Software Foundation , write to < license-violation@gnu.org > .
Otherwise , the program 's maintainer may be the copyright holder , or else could tell you how to contact the copyright holder , so report it to the maintainer .
Why does the GPL permit users to publish their modified versions ?
# WhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions )
A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate .
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users .
Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified versions to go through the original author .
As long as the original author keeps up with the need for maintenance , this may work well in practice , but if the author stops ( more or less ) to do something else or does not attend to all the users ' needs , this scheme falls down .
Aside from the practical problems , this scheme does not allow users to help each other .
Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of preventing confusion between various versions made by users .
In our experience , this confusion is not a major problem .
Many versions of Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project , but users can tell them apart .
The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her name on it , to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the reputations of other maintainers .
Does the GPL require that source code of modified versions be posted to the public ?
# GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic )
The GPL does not require you to release your modified version , or any part of it .
You are free to make modifications and use them privately , without ever releasing them .
This applies to organizations ( including companies ) , too ; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally without ever releasing it outside the organization .
But if you release the modified version to the public in some way , the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program 's users , under the GPL .
Thus , the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in certain ways , and not in other ways ; but the decision of whether to release it is up to you .
Can I have a GPL - covered program and an unrelated nonfree program on the same computer ?
# GPLAndNonfreeOnSameMachine )
Yes .
If I know someone has a copy of a GPL - covered program , can I demand they give me a copy ?
# CanIDemandACopy )
No .
The GPL gives a person permission to make and redistribute copies of the program if and when that person chooses to do so .
That person also has the right not to choose to redistribute the program .
What does “ written offer valid for any third party ” mean in GPLv2 ?
Does that mean everyone in the world can get the source to any GPLed program no matter what ?
# WhatDoesWrittenOfferValid )
If you choose to provide source through a written offer , then anybody who requests the source from you is entitled to receive it .
If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source code , the GPL says you must provide a written offer to distribute the source code later .
When users non-commercially redistribute the binaries they received from you , they must pass along a copy of this written offer .
This means that people who did not get the binaries directly from you can still receive copies of the source code , along with the written offer .
The reason we require the offer to be valid for any third party is so that people who receive the binaries indirectly in that way can order the source code from you .
GPL v2 says that modified versions , if released , must be “ licensed … to all third parties . ”
Who are these third parties ?
# TheGPLSaysModifiedVersions )
Section 2 says that modified versions you distribute must be licensed to all third parties under the GPL .
“ All third parties ” means absolutely everyone — but this does not require you to do anything physically for them .
It only means they have a license from you , under the GPL , for your version .
Am I required to claim a copyright on my modifications to a GPL - covered program ?
# RequiredToClaimCopyright )
You are not required to claim a copyright on your changes .
In most countries , however , that happens automatically by default , so you need to place your changes explicitly in the public domain if you do not want them to be copyrighted .
Whether you claim a copyright on your changes or not , either way you must release the modified version , as a whole , under the GPL ( if you release your modified version at all ) .
What does the GPL say about translating some code to a different programming language ?
# TranslateCode )
Under copyright law , translation of a work is considered a kind of modification .
Therefore , what the GPL says about modified versions applies also to translated versions .
The translation is covered by the copyright on the original program .
If the original program carries a free license , that license gives permission to translate it .
How you can use and license the translated program is determined by that license .
If the original program is licensed under certain versions of the GNU GPL , the translated program must be covered by the same versions of the GNU GPL .
If a program combines public - domain code with GPL - covered code , can I take the public - domain part and use it as public domain code ?
# CombinePublicDomainWithGPL )
You can do that , if you can figure out which part is the public domain part and separate it from the rest .
If code was put in the public domain by its developer , it is in the public domain no matter where it has been .
Does the GPL allow me to sell copies of the program for money ?
# DoesTheGPLAllowMoney )
Yes , the GPL allows everyone to do this .
The right to sell copies is part of the definition of free software .
Except in one special situation , there is no limit on what price you can charge .
( The one exception is the required written offer to provide source code that must accompany binary - only release . )
Does the GPL allow me to charge a fee for downloading the program from my distribution site ?
# DoesTheGPLAllowDownloadFee )
Yes .
You can charge any fee you wish for distributing a copy of the program .
Under GPL v2 , if you distribute binaries by download , you must provide “ equivalent access ” to download the source — therefore , the fee to download source may not be greater than the fee to download the binary .
If the binaries being distributed are licensed under the GPLv3 , then you must offer equivalent access to the source code in the same way through the same place at no further charge .
Does the GPL allow me to require that anyone who receives the software must pay me a fee and / or notify me ?
# DoesTheGPLAllowRequireFee )
No .
In fact , a requirement like that would make the program nonfree .
If people have to pay when they get a copy of a program , or if they have to notify anyone in particular , then the program is not free .
See the definition of free software .
The GPL is a free software license , and therefore it permits people to use and even redistribute the software without being required to pay anyone a fee for doing so .
You can charge people a fee to get a copy from you .
You can't require people to pay you when they get a copy from someone else .
If I distribute GPLed software for a fee , am I required to also make it available to the public without a charge ?
# DoesTheGPLRequireAvailabilityToPublic )
No .
However , if someone pays your fee and gets a copy , the GPL gives them the freedom to release it to the public , with or without a fee .
For example , someone could pay your fee , and then put her copy on a web site for the general public .
Does the GPL allow me to distribute copies under a nondisclosure agreement ?
# DoesTheGPLAllowNDA )
No .
The GPL says that anyone who receives a copy from you has the right to redistribute copies , modified or not .
You are not allowed to distribute the work on any more restrictive basis .
If someone asks you to sign an NDA for receiving GPL - covered software copyrighted by the FSF , please inform us immediately by writing to license-violation@fsf.org .
If the violation involves GPL - covered code that has some other copyright holder , please inform that copyright holder , just as you would for any other kind of violation of the GPL .
Does the GPL allow me to distribute a modified or beta version under a nondisclosure agreement ?
# DoesTheGPLAllowModNDA )
No .
The GPL says that your modified versions must carry all the freedoms stated in the GPL .
Thus , anyone who receives a copy of your version from you has the right to redistribute copies ( modified or not ) of that version .
You may not distribute any version of the work on a more restrictive basis .
Does the GPL allow me to develop a modified version under a nondisclosure agreement ?
# DevelopChangesUnderNDA )
Yes .
For instance , you can accept a contract to develop changes and agree not to release your changes until the client says ok .
This is permitted because in this case no GPL - covered code is being distributed under an NDA .
You can also release your changes to the client under the GPL , but agree not to release them to anyone else unless the client says ok .
In this case , too , no GPL - covered code is being distributed under an NDA , or under any additional restrictions .
The GPL would give the client the right to redistribute your version .
In this scenario , the client will probably choose not to exercise that right , but does have the right .
I want to get credit for my work .
I want people to know what I wrote .
Can I still get credit if I use the GPL ?
# IWantCredit )
You can certainly get credit for the work .
Part of releasing a program under the GPL is writing a copyright notice in your own name ( assuming you are the copyright holder ) .
The GPL requires all copies to carry an appropriate copyright notice .
Does the GPL allow me to add terms that would require citation or acknowledgment in research papers which use the GPL - covered software or its output ?
# RequireCitation )
No , this is not permitted under the terms of the GPL .
While we recognize that proper citation is an important part of academic publications , citation cannot be added as an additional requirement to the GPL .
Requiring citation in research papers which made use of GPLed software goes beyond what would be an acceptable additional requirement under section 7 ( b ) of GPLv3 , and therefore would be considered an additional restriction under Section 7 of the GPL .
And copyright law does not allow you to place such a requirement on the output of software , regardless of whether it is licensed under the terms of the GPL or some other license .
Why does the GPL require including a copy of the GPL with every copy of the program ?
# WhyMustIInclude )
Including a copy of the license with the work is vital so that everyone who gets a copy of the program can know what their rights are .
It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license , instead of the license itself .
But you can not be sure that the URL will still be valid , five years or ten years from now .
Twenty years from now , URLs as we know them today may no longer exist .
The only way to make sure that people who have copies of the program will continue to be able to see the license , despite all the changes that will happen in the network , is to include a copy of the license in the program .
Is it enough just to put a copy of the GNU GPL in my repository ?
# LicenseCopyOnly )
Just putting a copy of the GNU GPL in a file in your repository does not explicitly state that the code in the same repository may be used under the GNU GPL .
Without such a statement , it 's not entirely clear that the permissions in the license really apply to any particular source file .
An explicit statement saying that eliminates all doubt .
A file containing just a license , without a statement that certain other files are covered by that license , resembles a file containing just a subroutine which is never called from anywhere else .
The resemblance is not perfect : lawyers and courts might apply common sense and conclude that you must have put the copy of the GNU GPL there because you wanted to license the code that way .
Or they might not .
Why leave an uncertainty ?
This statement should be in each source file .
A clear statement in the program 's README file is legally sufficient as long as that accompanies the code , but it is easy for them to get separated .
Why take a risk of uncertainty about your code 's license ?
This has nothing to do with the specifics of the GNU GPL .
It is true for any free license .
Why should I put a license notice in each source file ?
# NoticeInSourceFile )
You should put a notice at the start of each source file , stating what license it carries , in order to avoid risk of the code 's getting disconnected from its license .
If your repository 's README says that source file is under the GNU GPL , what happens if someone copies that file to another program ?
That other context may not show what the file 's license is .
It may appear to have some other license , or no license at all ( which would make the code nonfree ) .
Adding a copyright notice and a license notice at the start of each source file is easy and makes such confusion unlikely .
This has nothing to do with the specifics of the GNU GPL .
It is true for any free license .
What if the work is not very long ?
# WhatIfWorkIsShort )
If a whole software package contains very little code —less than 300 lines is the benchmark we use — you may as well use a lax permissive license for it , rather than a copyleft license like the GNU GPL .
( Unless , that is , the code is specially important . )
We recommend the Apache License 2.0 for such cases .
Can I omit the preamble of the GPL , or the instructions for how to use it on your own programs , to save space ?
# GPLOmitPreamble )
The preamble and instructions are integral parts of the GNU GPL and may not be omitted .
In fact , the GPL is copyrighted , and its license permits only verbatim copying of the entire GPL .
( You can use the legal terms to make another license but it wo n't be the GNU GPL . )
The preamble and instructions add up to some 1000 words , less than 1/5 of the GPL 's total size .
They will not make a substantial fractional change in the size of a software package unless the package itself is quite small .
In that case , you may as well use a simple all - permissive license rather than the GNU GPL .
What does it mean to say that two licenses are “ compatible ” ?
# WhatIsCompatible )
In order to combine two programs ( or substantial parts of them ) into a larger work , you need to have permission to use both programs in this way .
If the two programs ' licenses permit this , they are compatible .
If there is no way to satisfy both licenses at once , they are incompatible .
For some licenses , the way in which the combination is made may affect whether they are compatible — for instance , they may allow linking two modules together , but not allow merging their code into one module .
If you just want to install two separate programs in the same system , it is not necessary that their licenses be compatible , because this does not combine them into a larger work .
What does it mean to say a license is “ compatible with the GPL ? ” # WhatDoesCompatMean )
It means that the other license and the GNU GPL are compatible ; you can combine code released under the other license with code released under the GNU GPL in one larger program .
All GNU GPL versions permit such combinations privately ; they also permit distribution of such combinations provided the combination is released under the same GNU GPL version .
The other license is compatible with the GPL if it permits this too .
GPLv3 is compatible with more licenses than GPL v2 : it allows you to make combinations with code that has specific kinds of additional requirements that are not in GPL v3 itself .
Section 7 has more information about this , including the list of additional requirements that are permitted .
Can I write free software that uses nonfree libraries ?
# FSWithNFLibs )
If you do this , your program wo n't be fully usable in a free environment .
If your program depends on a nonfree library to do a certain job , it cannot do that job in the Free World .
If it depends on a nonfree library to run at all , it can not be part of a free operating system such as GNU ; it is entirely off limits to the Free World .
So please consider : can you find a way to get the job done without using this library ?
Can you write a free replacement for that library ?
If the program is already written using the nonfree library , perhaps it is too late to change the decision .
You may as well release the program as it stands , rather than not release it .
But please mention in the README that the need for the nonfree library is a drawback , and suggest the task of changing the program so that it does the same job without the nonfree library .
Please suggest that anyone who thinks of doing substantial further work on the program first free it from dependence on the nonfree library .
Note that there may also be legal issues with combining certain nonfree libraries with GPL - covered free software .
Please see the question on GPL software with GPL - incompatible libraries for more information .
Can I link a GPL program with a proprietary system library ?
# SystemLibraryException )
Both versions of the GPL have an exception to their copyleft , commonly called the system library exception .
If the GPL - incompatible libraries you want to use meet the criteria for a system library , then you do n't have to do anything special to use them ; the requirement to distribute source code for the whole program does not include those libraries , even if you distribute a linked executable containing them .
The criteria for what counts as a " system library " vary between different versions of the GPL .
GPLv3 explicitly defines " System Libraries " in section 1 , to exclude it from the definition of " Corresponding Source . "
GPL v2 deals with this issue slightly differently , near the end of section 3 .
What legal issues come up if I use GPL - incompatible libraries with GPL software ?
# GPLIncompatibleLibs )
If you want your program to link against a library not covered by the system library exception , you need to provide permission to do that .
Below are two example license notices that you can use to do that ; one for GPLv3 , and the other for GPLv2 .
In either case , you should put this text in each file to which you are granting this permission .
Only the copyright holders for the program can legally release their software under these terms .
If you wrote the whole program yourself , then assuming your employer or school does not claim the copyright , you are the copyright holder — so you can authorize the exception .
But if you want to use parts of other GPL - covered programs by other authors in your code , you cannot authorize the exception for them .
You have to get the approval of the copyright holders of those programs .
When other people modify the program , they do not have to make the same exception for their code — it is their choice whether to do so .
If the libraries you intend to link with are nonfree , please also see the section on writing Free Software which uses nonfree libraries .
If you 're using GPLv3 , you can accomplish this goal by granting an additional permission under section 7 .
The following license notice will do that .
You must replace all the text in brackets with text that is appropriate for your program .
If not everybody can distribute source for the libraries you intend to link with , you should remove the text in braces ; otherwise , just remove the braces themselves .

{ Corresponding Source for a non-source form of such a combination shall include the source code for the parts of [ name of library ] used as well as that of the covered work .}
If you 're using GPL v2 , you can provide your own exception to the license 's terms .
The following license notice will do that .
Again , you must replace all the text in brackets with text that is appropriate for your program .

How do I get a copyright on my program in order to release it under the GPL ?
# HowIGetCopyright )
Under the Berne Convention , everything written is automatically copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form .
So you do n't have to do anything to “ get ” the copyright on what you write — as long as nobody else can claim to own your work .
However , registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea .
It will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US .
The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if you are an employee or student ; then the employer or the school might claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them .
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances such as the laws of the place where you live , and on your employment contract and what sort of work you do .
It is best to consult a lawyer if there is any possible doubt .
If you think that the employer or school might have a claim , you can resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school .
( Your immediate boss or a professor is usually NOT authorized to sign such a disclaimer . )
What if my school might want to make my program into its own proprietary software product ?
# WhatIfSchool )
Many universities nowadays try to raise funds by restricting the use of the knowledge and information they develop , in effect behaving little different from commercial businesses .
( See “ The Kept University ” , Atlantic Monthly , March 2000 , for a general discussion of this problem and its effects . )
If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your program to be released as free software , it is best to raise the issue at the earliest possible stage .
The closer the program is to working usefully , the more temptation the administration might feel to take it from you and finish it without you .
At an earlier stage , you have more leverage .
So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only half - done , saying , “ If you will agree to releasing this as free software , I will finish it . ”
Do n't think of this as a bluff .
To prevail , you must have the courage to say , “ My program will have liberty , or never be born . ”
Could you give me step by step instructions on how to apply the GPL to my program ?
# CouldYouHelpApplyGPL )
See the page of GPL instructions .
I heard that someone got a copy of a GPLed program under another license .
Is this possible ?
# HeardOtherLicense )
The GNU GPL does not give users permission to attach other licenses to the program .
But the copyright holder for a program can release it under several different licenses in parallel .
One of them may be the GNU GPL .
The license that comes in your copy , assuming it was put in by the copyright holder and that you got the copy legitimately , is the license that applies to your copy .
I would like to release a program I wrote under the GNU GPL , but I would like to use the same code in nonfree programs .
# ReleaseUnderGPLAndNF )
To release a nonfree program is always ethically tainted , but legally there is no obstacle to your doing this .
If you are the copyright holder for the code , you can release it under various different non-exclusive licenses at various times .
Is the developer of a GPL - covered program bound by the GPL ?
Could the developer 's actions ever be a violation of the GPL ? # DeveloperViolate )
Strictly speaking , the GPL is a license from the developer for others to use , distribute and change the program .
The developer itself is not bound by it , so no matter what the developer does , this is not a “ violation ” of the GPL .
However , if the developer does something that would violate the GPL if done by someone else , the developer will surely lose moral standing in the community .
Can the developer of a program who distributed it under the GPL later license it to another party for exclusive use ?
# CanDeveloperThirdParty )
No , because the public already has the right to use the program under the GPL , and this right cannot be withdrawn .
Yes , because the copyright on the editors and tools does not cover the code you write .
Using them does not place any restrictions , legally , on the license you use for your code .
Some programs copy parts of themselves into the output for technical reasons — for example , Bison copies a standard parser program into its output file .
In such cases , the copied text in the output is covered by the same license that covers it in the source code .
Meanwhile , the part of the output which is derived from the program 's input inherits the copyright status of the input .
As it happens , Bison can also be used to develop nonfree programs .
This is because we decided to explicitly permit the use of the Bison standard parser program in Bison output files without restriction .
We made the decision because there were other tools comparable to Bison which already permitted use for nonfree programs .
Do I have “ fair use ” rights in using the source code of a GPL - covered program ?
# GPLFairUse )
Yes , you do .
“ Fair use ” is use that is allowed without any special permission .
Since you do n't need the developers ' permission for such use , you can do it regardless of what the developers said about it — in the license or elsewhere , whether that license be the GNU GPL or any other free software license .
Note , however , that there is no world - wide principle of fair use ; what kinds of use are considered “ fair ” varies from country to country .
Can the US Government release a program under the GNU GPL ? # GPLUSGov )
If the program is written by US federal government employees in the course of their employment , it is in the public domain , which means it is not copyrighted .
Since the GNU GPL is based on copyright , such a program cannot be released under the GNU GPL .
( It can still be free software , however ; a public domain program is free . )
However , when a US federal government agency uses contractors to develop software , that is a different situation .
The contract can require the contractor to release it under the GNU GPL .
( GNU Ada was developed in this way . )
Or the contract can assign the copyright to the government agency , which can then release the software under the GNU GPL .
Can the US Government release improvements to a GPL - covered program ?
# GPLUSGovAdd )
Yes .
If the improvements are written by US government employees in the course of their employment , then the improvements are in the public domain .
However , the improved version , as a whole , is still covered by the GNU GPL .
There is no problem in this situation .
If the US government uses contractors to do the job , then the improvements themselves can be GPL - covered .
Does the GPL have different requirements for statically vs dynamically linked modules with a covered work ?
# GPLStaticVsDynamic )
No .
Linking a GPL covered work statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on the GPL covered work .
Thus , the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination .

What legal issues come up if I use GPL - incompatible libraries with GPL software ?
Does the LGPL have different requirements for statically vs dynamically linked modules with a covered work ?
# LGPLStaticVsDynamic )
For the purpose of complying with the LGPL ( any extant version : v2 , v2.1 or v3 ) : ( 1 ) If you statically link against an LGPLed library , you must also provide your application in an object ( not necessarily source ) format , so that a user has the opportunity to modify the library and relink the application .
( 2 ) If you dynamically link against an LGPLed library already present on the user 's computer , you need not convey the library 's source .
On the other hand , if you yourself convey the executable LGPLed library along with your application , whether linked with statically or dynamically , you must also convey the library 's sources , in one of the ways for which the LGPL provides .
Is there some way that I can GPL the output people get from use of my program ?
For example , if my program is used to develop hardware designs , can I require that these designs must be free ?
# GPLOutput )
In general this is legally impossible ; copyright law does not give you any say in the use of the output people make from their data using your program .
If the user uses your program to enter or convert her own data , the copyright on the output belongs to her , not you .
More generally , when a program translates its input into some other form , the copyright status of the output inherits that of the input it was generated from .
So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if substantial parts of the output are copied ( more or less ) from text in your program .
For instance , part of the output of Bison ( see above ) would be covered by the GNU GPL , if we had not made an exception in this specific case .
You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its output even if there is no technical reason to do so .
But if that copied text serves no practical purpose , the user could simply delete that text from the output and use only the rest .
Then he would not have to obey the conditions on redistribution of the copied text .
In what cases is the output of a GPL program covered by the GPL too ?
# WhatCaseIsOutputGPL )
The output of a program is not , in general , covered by the copyright on the code of the program .
So the license of the code of the program does not apply to the output , whether you pipe it into a file , make a screenshot , screencast , or video .
The exception would be when the program displays a full screen of text and / or art that comes from the program .
Then the copyright on that text and / or art covers the output .
Programs that output audio , such as video games , would also fit into this exception .
If the art / music is under the GPL , then the GPL applies when you copy it no matter how you copy it .
However , fair use may still apply .
Keep in mind that some programs , particularly video games , can have artwork / audio that is licensed separately from the underlying GPLed game .
In such cases , the license on the artwork / audio would dictate the terms under which video / streaming may occur .

Can I use the GPL for something other than software ?
If I add a module to a GPL - covered program , do I have to use the GPL as the license for my module ?
# GPLModuleLicense )
The GPL says that the whole combined program has to be released under the GPL .
So your module has to be available for use under the GPL .
But you can give additional permission for the use of your code .
You can , if you wish , release your module under a license which is more lax than the GPL but compatible with the GPL .
The license list page gives a partial list of GPL - compatible licenses .
If a library is released under the GPL ( not the LGPL ) , does that mean that any software which uses it has to be under the GPL or a GPL - compatible license ?
# IfLibraryIsGPL )
Yes , because the program actually links to the library .
As such , the terms of the GPL apply to the entire combination .
The software modules that link with the library may be under various GPL compatible licenses , but the work as a whole must be licensed under the GPL .

What does it mean to say a license is “ compatible with the GPL ” ?
If a programming language interpreter is released under the GPL , does that mean programs written to be interpreted by it must be under GPL - compatible licenses ?
# IfInterpreterIsGPL )
When the interpreter just interprets a language , the answer is no .
The interpreted program , to the interpreter , is just data ; a free software license like the GPL , based on copyright law , cannot limit what data you use the interpreter on .
You can run it on any data ( interpreted program ) , any way you like , and there are no requirements about licensing that data to anyone .
However , when the interpreter is extended to provide “ bindings ” to other facilities ( often , but not necessarily , libraries ) , the interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses through these bindings .
So if these facilities are released under the GPL , the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a GPL - compatible way .
The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of such a binding mechanism ; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them .
These libraries are also linked with the interpreter .
If the interpreter is linked statically with these libraries , or if it is designed to link dynamically with these specific libraries , then it too needs to be released in a GPL - compatible way .
Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the interpreter which are themselves interpreted .
For instance , Perl comes with many Perl modules , and a Java implementation comes with many Java classes .
These libraries and the programs that call them are always dynamically linked together .
A consequence is that if you choose to use GPLed Perl modules or Java classes in your program , you must release the program in a GPL - compatible way , regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on .
I 'm writing a Windows application with Microsoft Visual C++ ( or Visual Basic ) and I will be releasing it under the GPL .
Is dynamically linking my program with the Visual C++ ( or Visual Basic ) runtime library permitted under the GPL ?
# WindowsRuntimeAndGPL )
You may link your program to these libraries , and distribute the compiled program to others .
When you do this , the runtime libraries are “ System Libraries ” as GPL v3 defines them .
That means that you do n't need to worry about including their source code with the program 's Corresponding Source .
GPL v2 provides a similar exception in section 3 .
You may not distribute these libraries in compiled DLL form with the program .
To prevent unscrupulous distributors from trying to use the System Library exception as a loophole , the GPL says that libraries can only qualify as System Libraries as long as they 're not distributed with the program itself .
If you distribute the DLLs with the program , they wo n't be eligible for this exception anymore ; then the only way to comply with the GPL would be to provide their source code , which you are unable to do .
It is possible to write free programs that only run on Windows , but it is not a good idea .
These programs would be “ trapped ” by Windows , and therefore contribute zero to the Free World .
Why is the original BSD license incompatible with the GPL ? # OrigBSD )
Because it imposes a specific requirement that is not in the GPL ; namely , the requirement on advertisements of the program .
Section 6 of GPL v2 states :
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients ' exercise of the rights granted herein .
GPLv3 says something similar in section 10 .
The advertising clause provides just such a further restriction , and thus is GPL - incompatible .
The revised BSD license does not have the advertising clause , which eliminates the problem .
When is a program and its plug-ins considered a single combined program ?
# GPLPlugins )
It depends on how the main program invokes its plug-ins .
If the main program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins , and they establish intimate communication by sharing complex data structures , or shipping complex data structures back and forth , that can make them one single combined program .
A main program that uses simple fork and exec to invoke plug-ins and does not establish intimate communication between them results in the plug-ins being a separate program .
If the main program dynamically links plug-ins , and they make function calls to each other and share data structures , we believe they form a single combined program , which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins .
If the main program dynamically links plug-ins , but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘ main ’ function of the plug - in with some options and waiting for it to return , that is a borderline case .
Using shared memory to communicate with complex data structures is pretty much equivalent to dynamic linking .
If I write a plug - in to use with a GPL - covered program , what requirements does that impose on the licenses I can use for distributing my plug - in ?
# GPLAndPlugins )
Please see this question for determining when plug-ins and a main program are considered a single combined program and when they are considered separate works .
If the main program and the plugins are a single combined program then this means you must license the plug - in under the GPL or a GPL - compatible free software license and distribute it with source code in a GPL - compliant way .
A main program that is separate from its plug-ins makes no requirements for the plug-ins .

If they form a single combined program this means that combination of the GPL - covered plug - in with the nonfree main program would violate the GPL .
However , you can resolve that legal problem by adding an exception to your plug - in 's license , giving permission to link it with the nonfree main program .
See also the question I am writing free software that uses a nonfree library .
Can I release a nonfree program that 's designed to load a GPL - covered plug - in ?
# NFUseGPLPlugins )
Please see this question for determining when plug-ins and a main program are considered a single combined program and when they are considered separate programs .
If they form a single combined program then the main program must be released under the GPL or a GPL - compatible free software license , and the terms of the GPL must be followed when the main program is distributed for use with these plug-ins .
However , if they are separate works then the license of the plug - in makes no requirements about the main program .

You have a GPLed program that I 'd like to link with my code to build a proprietary program .
Does the fact that I link with your program mean I have to GPL my program ?
# LinkingWithGPL )
Not exactly .
It means you must release your program under a license compatible with the GPL ( more precisely , compatible with one or more GPL versions accepted by all the rest of the code in the combination that you link ) .
The combination itself is then available under those GPL versions .
If so , is there any chance I could get a license of your program under the Lesser GPL ?
# SwitchToLGPL )
You can ask , but most authors will stand firm and say no .
The idea of the GPL is that if you want to include our code in your program , your program must also be free software .
It is supposed to put pressure on you to release your program in a way that makes it part of our community .
You always have the legal alternative of not using our code .
Does distributing a nonfree driver meant to link with the kernel Linux violate the GPL ? # NonfreeDriverKernelLinux )
Linux ( the kernel in the GNU / Linux operating system ) is distributed under GNU GPL version 2 .
Does distributing a nonfree driver meant to link with Linux violate the GPL ?
Yes , this is a violation , because effectively this makes a larger combined work .
The fact that the user is expected to put the pieces together does not really change anything .
Each contributor to Linux who holds copyright on a substantial part of the code can enforce the GPL and we encourage each of them to take action against those distributing nonfree Linux - drivers .
How can I allow linking of proprietary modules with my GPL - covered library under a controlled interface only ?
# LinkingOverControlledInterface )
Add this text to the license notice of each file in the package , at the end of the text that says the file is distributed under the GNU GPL : Linking ABC statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on ABC .
Thus , the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination .
As a special exception , the copyright holders of ABC give you permission to combine ABC program with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with independent modules that communicate with ABC solely through the ABCDEF interface .
You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for ABC and the licenses of the other code concerned , provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code and provided that you do not modify the ABCDEF interface .
Note that people who make modified versions of ABC are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions ; it is their choice whether to do so .
The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a modified version without this exception ; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception .
If you modify the ABCDEF interface , this exception does not apply to your modified version of ABC , and you must remove this exception when you distribute your modified version .
This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License , version 3 ( “ GPLv3 ” )
This exception enables linking with differently licensed modules over the specified interface ( “ ABCDEF ” ) , while ensuring that users would still receive source code as they normally would under the GPL .
Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize this exception .
If you wrote the whole program yourself , then assuming your employer or school does not claim the copyright , you are the copyright holder — so you can authorize the exception .
But if you want to use parts of other GPL - covered programs by other authors in your code , you cannot authorize the exception for them .
You have to get the approval of the copyright holders of those programs .
I have written an application that links with many different components , that have different licenses .
I am very confused as to what licensing requirements are placed on my program .
Can you please tell me what licenses I may use ?
# ManyDifferentLicenses )
To answer this question , we would need to see a list of each component that your program uses , the license of that component , and a brief ( a few sentences for each should suffice ) describing how your library uses that component .
Two examples would be :
To make my software work , it must be linked to the FOO library , which is available under the Lesser GPL .
My software makes a system call ( with a command line that I built ) to run the BAR program , which is licensed under “ the GPL , with a special exception allowing for linking with QUUX ” .
What is the difference between an “ aggregate ” and other kinds of “ modified versions ” ?
# MereAggregation )
An “ aggregate ” consists of a number of separate programs , distributed together on the same CD - ROM or other media .
The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate , even when the licenses of the other software are nonfree or GPL - incompatible .
The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program 's individual license would grant them .
Where 's the line between two separate programs , and one program with two parts ?
This is a legal question , which ultimately judges will decide .
We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication ( exec , pipes , rpc , function calls within a shared address space , etc. ) and the semantics of the communication ( what kinds of information are interchanged ) .
If the modules are included in the same executable file , they are definitely combined in one program .
If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space , that almost surely means combining them into one program .
By contrast , pipes , sockets and command - line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs .
So when they are used for communication , the modules normally are separate programs .
But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough , exchanging complex internal data structures , that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program .
When it comes to determining whether two pieces of software form a single work , does the fact that the code is in one or more containers have any effect ?
# AggregateContainers )
No , the analysis of whether they are a single work or an aggregate is unchanged by the involvement of containers .
Why does the FSF require that contributors to FSF - copyrighted programs assign copyright to the FSF ?
If I hold copyright on a GPLed program , should I do this , too ?
If so , how ?
# AssignCopyright )
Our lawyers have told us that to be in the best position to enforce the GPL in court against violators , we should keep the copyright status of the program as simple as possible .
We do this by asking each contributor to either assign the copyright on contributions to the FSF , or disclaim copyright on contributions .
We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from their employers ( if any ) so that we can be sure those employers wo n't claim to own the contributions .
Of course , if all the contributors put their code in the public domain , there is no copyright with which to enforce the GPL .
So we encourage people to assign copyright on large code contributions , and only put small changes in the public domain .
If you want to make an effort to enforce the GPL on your program , it is probably a good idea for you to follow a similar policy .
Please contact < licensing@gnu.org > if you want more information .
Can I modify the GPL and make a modified license ?
# ModifyGPL )
It is possible to make modified versions of the GPL , but it tends to have practical consequences .
You can legally use the GPL terms ( possibly modified ) in another license provided that you call your license by another name and do not include the GPL preamble , and provided you modify the instructions - for - use at the end enough to make it clearly different in wording and not mention GNU ( though the actual procedure you describe may be similar ) .
If you want to use our preamble in a modified license , please write to < licensing@gnu.org > for permission .
For this purpose we would want to check the actual license requirements to see if we approve of them .
Although we will not raise legal objections to your making a modified license in this way , we hope you will think twice and not do it .
Such a modified license is almost certainly incompatible with the GNU GPL , and that incompatibility blocks useful combinations of modules .
The mere proliferation of different free software licenses is a burden in and of itself .
Rather than modifying the GPL , please use the exception mechanism offered by GPL version 3 .
If I use a piece of software that has been obtained under the GNU GPL , am I allowed to modify the original code into a new program , then distribute and sell that new program commercially ?
# GPLCommercially )
You are allowed to sell copies of the modified program commercially , but only under the terms of the GNU GPL .
Thus , for instance , you must make the source code available to the users of the program as described in the GPL , and they must be allowed to redistribute and modify it as described in the GPL .
These requirements are the condition for including the GPL - covered code you received in a program of your own .
Can I use the GPL for something other than software ?
# GPLOtherThanSoftware )
You can apply the GPL to any kind of work , as long as it is clear what constitutes the “ source code ” for the work .
The GPL defines this as the preferred form of the work for making changes in it .
However , for manuals and textbooks , or more generally any sort of work that is meant to teach a subject , we recommend using the GFDL rather than the GPL .
How does the LGPL work with Java ? # LGPLJava )
See this article for details .
It works as designed , intended , and expected .
Consider this situation : 1 ) X releases V1 of a project under the GPL .
2 ) Y contributes to the development of V2 with changes and new code based on V1 .
3 ) X wants to convert V2 to a non-GPL license .
Does X need Y's permission ?
# Consider )
Yes .
Y was required to release its version under the GNU GPL , as a consequence of basing it on X's version V1 .
Nothing required Y to agree to any other license for its code .
Therefore , X must get Y's permission before releasing that code under another license .
I 'd like to incorporate GPL - covered software in my proprietary system .
I have no permission to use that software except what the GPL gives me .
Can I do this ?
# GPLInProprietarySystem )
You cannot incorporate GPL - covered software in a proprietary system .
The goal of the GPL is to grant everyone the freedom to copy , redistribute , understand , and modify a program .
If you could incorporate GPL - covered software into a nonfree system , it would have the effect of making the GPL - covered software nonfree too .
A system incorporating a GPL - covered program is an extended version of that program .
The GPL says that any extended version of the program must be released under the GPL if it is released at all .
This is for two reasons : to make sure that users who get the software get the freedom they should have , and to encourage people to give back improvements that they make .
However , in many cases you can distribute the GPL - covered software alongside your proprietary system .
To do this validly , you must make sure that the free and nonfree programs communicate at arms length , that they are not combined in a way that would make them effectively a single program .
The difference between this and “ incorporating ” the GPL - covered software is partly a matter of substance and partly form .
The substantive part is this : if the two programs are combined so that they become effectively two parts of one program , then you can't treat them as two separate programs .
So the GPL has to cover the whole thing .
If the two programs remain well separated , like the compiler and the kernel , or like an editor and a shell , then you can treat them as two separate programs — but you have to do it properly .
The issue is simply one of form : how you describe what you are doing .
Why do we care about this ?
Because we want to make sure the users clearly understand the free status of the GPL - covered software in the collection .
If people were to distribute GPL - covered software calling it “ part of ” a system that users know is partly proprietary , users might be uncertain of their rights regarding the GPL - covered software .
But if they know that what they have received is a free program plus another program , side by side , their rights will be clear .
I 'd like to incorporate GPL - covered software in my proprietary system .
Can I do this by putting a “ wrapper ” module , under a GPL - compatible lax permissive license ( such as the X11 license ) in between the GPL - covered part and the proprietary part ?
# GPLWrapper )
No .
The X11 license is compatible with the GPL , so you can add a module to the GPL - covered program and put it under the X11 license .
But if you were to incorporate them both in a larger program , that whole would include the GPL - covered part , so it would have to be licensed as a whole under the GNU GPL .
The fact that proprietary module A communicates with GPL - covered module C only through X11 - licensed module B is legally irrelevant ; what matters is the fact that module C is included in the whole .
Where can I learn more about the GCC Runtime Library Exception ?
# LibGCCException )
The GCC Runtime Library Exception covers libgcc , libstdc++ , libfortran , libgomp , libdecnumber , and other libraries distributed with GCC .
The exception is meant to allow people to distribute programs compiled with GCC under terms of their choice , even when parts of these libraries are included in the executable as part of the compilation process .
To learn more , please read our FAQ about the GCC Runtime Library Exception .
I 'd like to modify GPL - covered programs and link them with the portability libraries from Money Guzzler Inc .
I cannot distribute the source code for these libraries , so any user who wanted to change these versions would have to obtain those libraries separately .
Why does n't the GPL permit this ?
# MoneyGuzzlerInc )
There are two reasons for this .
First , a general one .
If we permitted company A to make a proprietary file , and company B to distribute GPL - covered software linked with that file , the effect would be to make a hole in the GPL big enough to drive a truck through .
This would be carte blanche for withholding the source code for all sorts of modifications and extensions to GPL - covered software .
Giving all users access to the source code is one of our main goals , so this consequence is definitely something we want to avoid .
More concretely , the versions of the programs linked with the Money Guzzler libraries would not really be free software as we understand the term — they would not come with full source code that enables users to change and recompile the program .
If the license for a module Q has a requirement that 's incompatible with the GPL , but the requirement applies only when Q is distributed by itself , not when Q is included in a larger program , does that make the license GPL - compatible ?
Can I combine or link Q with a GPL - covered program ?
# GPLIncompatibleAlone )
If a program P is released under the GPL that means * any and every part of it * can be used under the GPL .
If you integrate module Q , and release the combined program P+Q under the GPL , that means any part of P+Q can be used under the GPL .
One part of P+Q is Q .
So releasing P+Q under the GPL says that Q any part of it can be used under the GPL .
Putting it in other words , a user who obtains P+Q under the GPL can delete P , so that just Q remains , still under the GPL .
If the license of module Q permits you to give permission for that , then it is GPL - compatible .
Otherwise , it is not GPL - compatible .
If the license for Q says in no uncertain terms that you must do certain things ( not compatible with the GPL ) when you redistribute Q on its own , then it does not permit you to distribute Q under the GPL .
It follows that you can't release P+Q under the GPL either .
So you cannot link or combine P with Q .
Can I release a modified version of a GPL - covered program in binary form only ?
# ModifiedJustBinary )
No .
The whole point of the GPL is that all modified versions must be free software — which means , in particular , that the source code of the modified version is available to the users .
I downloaded just the binary from the net .
If I distribute copies , do I have to get the source and distribute that too ?
# UnchangedJustBinary )
Yes .
The general rule is , if you distribute binaries , you must distribute the complete corresponding source code too .
The exception for the case where you received a written offer for source code is quite limited .
I want to distribute binaries via physical media without accompanying sources .
Can I provide source code by FTP ? # DistributeWithSourceOnInternet )
Version 3 of the GPL allows this ; see option 6 ( b ) for the full details .
Under version 2 , you 're certainly free to offer source via FTP , and most users will get it from there .
However , if any of them would rather get the source on physical media by mail , you are required to provide that .
If you distribute binaries via FTP , you should distribute source via FTP .
My friend got a GPL - covered binary with an offer to supply source , and made a copy for me .
Can I use the offer myself to obtain the source ?
# RedistributedBinariesGetSource )
Yes , you can .
The offer must be open to everyone who has a copy of the binary that it accompanies .
This is why the GPL says your friend must give you a copy of the offer along with a copy of the binary — so you can take advantage of it .
Can I put the binaries on my Internet server and put the source on a different Internet site ?
# SourceAndBinaryOnDifferentSites )
Yes . Section 6 (d ) allows this .
However , you must provide clear instructions people can follow to obtain the source , and you must take care to make sure that the source remains available for as long as you distribute the object code .
I want to distribute an extended version of a GPL - covered program in binary form .
Is it enough to distribute the source for the original version ?
# DistributeExtendedBinary )
No , you must supply the source code that corresponds to the binary .
Corresponding source means the source from which users can rebuild the same binary .
Part of the idea of free software is that users should have access to the source code for the programs they use .
Those using your version should have access to the source code for your version .
A major goal of the GPL is to build up the Free World by making sure that improvement to a free program are themselves free .
If you release an improved version of a GPL - covered program , you must release the improved source code under the GPL .
I want to distribute binaries , but distributing complete source is inconvenient .
Is it ok if I give users the diffs from the “ standard ” version along with the binaries ?
# DistributingSourceIsInconvenient )
This is a well - meaning request , but this method of providing the source does n't really do the job .
A user that wants the source a year from now may be unable to get the proper version from another site at that time .
The standard distribution site may have a newer version , but the same diffs probably wo n't work with that version .
So you need to provide complete sources , not just diffs , with the binaries .
Can I make binaries available on a network server , but send sources only to people who order them ?
# AnonFTPAndSendSources )
If you make object code available on a network server , you have to provide the Corresponding Source on a network server as well .
The easiest way to do this would be to publish them on the same server , but if you 'd like , you can alternatively provide instructions for getting the source from another server , or even a version control system .
No matter what you do , the source should be just as easy to access as the object code , though .
This is all specified in section 6 ( d ) of GPLv3 .
The sources you provide must correspond exactly to the binaries .
In particular , you must make sure they are for the same version of the program — not an older version and not a newer version .
How can I make sure each user who downloads the binaries also gets the source ?
# HowCanIMakeSureEachDownloadGetsSource )
You do n't have to make sure of this .
As long as you make the source and binaries available so that the users can see what 's available and take what they want , you have done what is required of you .
It is up to the user whether to download the source .
Our requirements for redistributors are intended to make sure the users can get the source code , not to force users to download the source code even if they do n't want it .
Does the GPL require me to provide source code that can be built to match the exact hash of the binary I am distributing ?
# MustSourceBuildToMatchExactHashOfBinary )
Complete corresponding source means the source that the binaries were made from , but that does not imply your tools must be able to make a binary that is an exact hash of the binary you are distributing .
In some cases it could be ( nearly ) impossible to build a binary from source with an exact hash of the binary being distributed — consider the following examples : a system might put timestamps in binaries ; or the program might have been built against a different ( even unreleased ) compiler version .
A company is running a modified version of a GPLed program on a web site .
Does the GPL say they must release their modified sources ?
# UnreleasedMods )
The GPL permits anyone to make a modified version and use it without ever distributing it to others .
What this company is doing is a special case of that .
Therefore , the company does not have to release the modified sources .
The situation is different when the modified program is licensed under the terms of the GNU Affero GPL .
Compare this to a situation where the web site contains or links to separate GPLed programs that are distributed to the user when they visit the web site ( often written in JavaScript , but other languages are used as well ) .
In this situation the source code for the programs being distributed must be released to the user under the terms of the GPL .
A company is running a modified version of a program licensed under the GNU Affero GPL ( AGPL ) on a web site .
Does the AGPL say they must release their modified sources ?
# UnreleasedModsAGPL )
The GNU Affero GPL requires that modified versions of the software offer all users interacting with it over a computer network an opportunity to receive the source .
What the company is doing falls under that meaning , so the company must release the modified source code .
Is making and using multiple copies within one organization or company “ distribution ” ?
# InternalDistribution )
No , in that case the organization is just making the copies for itself .
As a consequence , a company or other organization can develop a modified version and install that version through its own facilities , without giving the staff permission to release that modified version to outsiders .
However , when the organization transfers copies to other organizations or individuals , that is distribution .
In particular , providing copies to contractors for use off - site is distribution .
If someone steals a CD containing a version of a GPL - covered program , does the GPL give the thief the right to redistribute that version ?
# StolenCopy )
If the version has been released elsewhere , then the thief probably does have the right to make copies and redistribute them under the GPL , but if the thief is imprisoned for stealing the CD , they may have to wait until their release before doing so .
If the version in question is unpublished and considered by a company to be its trade secret , then publishing it may be a violation of trade secret law , depending on other circumstances .
The GPL does not change that .
If the company tried to release its version and still treat it as a trade secret , that would violate the GPL , but if the company has n't released this version , no such violation has occurred .
What if a company distributes a copy of some other developers '
GPL - covered work to me as a trade secret ?
# TradeSecretRelease )
The company has violated the GPL and will have to cease distribution of that program .
Note how this differs from the theft case above ; the company does not intentionally distribute a copy when a copy is stolen , so in that case the company has not violated the GPL .
What if a company distributes a copy of its own GPL - covered work to me as a trade secret ?
# TradeSecretRelease2 )
If the program distributed does not incorporate anyone else 's GPL - covered work , then the company is not violating the GPL ( see “ Is the developer of a GPL - covered program bound by the GPL ? ” for more information ) .
But it is making two contradictory statements about what you can do with that program : that you can redistribute it , and that you can't .
It would make sense to demand clarification of the terms for use of that program before you accept a copy .
Why are some GNU libraries released under the ordinary GPL rather than the Lesser GPL ?
# WhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL )
Using the Lesser GPL for any particular library constitutes a retreat for free software .
It means we partially abandon the attempt to defend the users ' freedom , and some of the requirements to share what is built on top of GPL - covered software .
In themselves , those are changes for the worse .
Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy .
Sometimes , using the LGPL for a library might lead to wider use of that library , and thus to more improvement for it , wider support for free software , and so on .
This could be good for free software if it happens to a large extent .
But how much will this happen ?
We can only speculate .
It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while , see whether it helps , and change back to the GPL if the LGPL did n't help .
But this is not feasible .
Once we use the LGPL for a particular library , changing back would be difficult .
So we decide which license to use for each library on a case - by - case basis .
There is a long explanation of how we judge the question .
Using a certain GNU program under the GPL does not fit our project to make proprietary software .
Will you make an exception for us ?
It would mean more users of that program .
# WillYouMakeAnException )
Sorry , we do n't make such exceptions .
It would not be right .
Maximizing the number of users is not our aim .
Rather , we are trying to give the crucial freedoms to as many users as possible .
In general , proprietary software projects hinder rather than help the cause of freedom .
We do occasionally make license exceptions to assist a project which is producing free software under a license other than the GPL .
However , we have to see a good reason why this will advance the cause of free software .
We also do sometimes change the distribution terms of a package , when that seems clearly the right way to serve the cause of free software ; but we are very cautious about this , so you will have to show us very convincing reasons .
Why should programs say “ Version 3 of the GPL or any later version ” ?
# VersionThreeOrLater )
From time to time , at intervals of years , we change the GPL — sometimes to clarify it , sometimes to permit certain kinds of use not previously permitted , and sometimes to tighten up a requirement .
( The last two changes were in 2007 and 1991 . )
Using this “ indirect pointer ” in each program makes it possible for us to change the distribution terms on the entire collection of GNU software , when we update the GPL .
If each program lacked the indirect pointer , we would be forced to discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders , which would be a virtual impossibility .
In practice , the chance of having uniform distribution terms for GNU software would be nil .
Suppose a program says “ Version 3 of the GPL or any later version ” and a new version of the GPL is released .
If the new GPL version gives additional permission , that permission will be available immediately to all the users of the program .
But if the new GPL version has a tighter requirement , it will not restrict use of the current version of the program , because it can still be used under GPL version 3 .
When a program says “ Version 3 of the GPL or any later version ” , users will always be permitted to use it , and even change it , according to the terms of GPL version 3 — even after later versions of the GPL are available .
If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be obeyed for existing software , how is it useful ?
Once GPL version 4 is available , the developers of most GPL - covered programs will release subsequent versions of their programs specifying “ Version 4 of the GPL or any later version ” .
Then users will have to follow the tighter requirements in GPL version 4 , for subsequent versions of the program .
However , developers are not obligated to do this ; developers can continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL , if that is their preference .
Is it a good idea to use a license saying that a certain program can be used only under the latest version of the GNU GPL ? # OnlyLatestVersion )
The reason you should n't do that is that it could result some day in withdrawing automatically some permissions that the users previously had .
Suppose a program was released in 2000 under “ the latest GPL version ” .
At that time , people could have used it under GPLv2 .
The day we published GPLv3 in 2007 , everyone would have been suddenly compelled to use it under GPL v3 instead .
Some users may not even have known about GPL version 3 — but they would have been required to use it .
They could have violated the program 's license unintentionally just because they did not get the news .
That 's a bad way to treat people .
We think it is wrong to take back permissions already granted , except due to a violation .
If your freedom could be revoked , then it is n't really freedom .
Thus , if you get a copy of a program version under one version of a license , you should always have the rights granted by that version of the license .
Releasing under “ GPL version N or any later version ” upholds that principle .
Why do n't you use the GPL for manuals ?
# WhyNotGPLForManuals )
It is possible to use the GPL for a manual , but the GNU Free Documentation License ( GFDL ) is much better for manuals .
The GPL was designed for programs ; it contains lots of complex clauses that are crucial for programs , but that would be cumbersome and unnecessary for a book or manual .
For instance , anyone publishing the book on paper would have to either include machine - readable “ source code ” of the book along with each printed copy , or provide a written offer to send the “ source code ” later .
Meanwhile , the GFDL has clauses that help publishers of free manuals make a profit from selling copies — cover texts , for instance .
The special rules for Endorsements sections make it possible to use the GFDL for an official standard .
This would permit modified versions , but they could not be labeled as “ the standard ” .
Using the GFDL , we permit changes in the text of a manual that covers its technical topic .
It is important to be able to change the technical parts , because people who change a program ought to change the documentation to correspond .
The freedom to do this is an ethical imperative .
Our manuals also include sections that state our political position about free software .
We mark these as “ invariant ” , so that they can not be changed or removed .
The GFDL makes provisions for these “ invariant sections ” .
How does the GPL apply to fonts ?
# FontException )
Font licensing is a complex issue which needs serious consideration .
The following license exception is experimental but approved for general use .
We welcome suggestions on this subject — please see this this explanatory essay and write to licensing@gnu.org .
To use this exception , add this text to the license notice of each file in the package ( to the extent possible ) , at the end of the text that says the file is distributed under the GNU GPL :
As a special exception , if you create a document which uses this font , and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the document , this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to be covered by the GNU General Public License .
This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered by the GNU General Public License .
If you modify this font , you may extend this exception to your version of the font , but you are not obligated to do so .
If you do not wish to do so , delete this exception statement from your version .
I am writing a website maintenance system ( called a “ content management system ” by some ) , or some other application which generates web pages from templates .
What license should I use for those templates ?
# WMS )
Templates are minor enough that it is not worth using copyleft to protect them .
It is normally harmless to use copyleft on minor works , but templates are a special case , because they are combined with data provided by users of the application and the combination is distributed .
So , we recommend that you license your templates under simple permissive terms .
Some templates make calls into JavaScript functions .
Since Javascript is often non-trivial , it is worth copylefting .
Because the templates will be combined with user data , it 's possible that template +user data +
JavaScript would be considered one work under copyright law .
A line needs to be drawn between the JavaScript ( copylefted ) , and the user code ( usually under incompatible terms ) .
Here 's an exception for JavaScript code that does this :
As a special exception to the GPL , any HTML file which merely makes function calls to this code , and for that purpose includes it by reference shall be deemed a separate work for copyright law purposes .
In addition , the copyright holders of this code give you permission to combine this code with free software libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL .
You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for this code and the LGPL for the libraries .
If you modify this code , you may extend this exception to your version of the code , but you are not obligated to do so .
If you do not wish to do so , delete this exception statement from your version .
Which programs you used to edit the source code , or to compile it , or study it , or record it , usually makes no difference for issues concerning the licensing of that source code .
However , if you link nonfree libraries with the source code , that would be an issue you need to deal with .
It does not preclude releasing the source code under the GPL , but if the libraries do n't fit under the “ system library ” exception , you should affix an explicit notice giving permission to link your program with them .
The FAQ entry about using GPL - incompatible libraries provides more information about how to do that .
Are there translations of the GPL into other languages ?
# GPLTranslations )
It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages other than English .
People have even written translations and sent them to us .
But we have not dared to approve them as officially valid .
That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it .
A legal document is in some ways like a program .
Translating it is like translating a program from one language and operating system to another .
Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it — and even then , there is a risk of introducing a bug .
If we were to approve , officially , a translation of the GPL , we would be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they can do .
If it is a completely accurate translation , that is fine .
But if there is an error in the translation , the results could be a disaster which we could not fix .
If a program has a bug , we can release a new version , and eventually the old version will more or less disappear .
But once we have given everyone permission to act according to a particular translation , we have no way of taking back that permission if we find , later on , that it had a bug .
Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us .
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work , this would solve it .
But the actual problem is the risk of error , and offering to do the work does not avoid the risk .
We could not possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer .
Therefore , for the time being , we are not approving translations of the GPL as globally valid and binding .
Instead , we are doing two things : Referring people to unofficial translations .
This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL , but we do n't approve them as legally valid and binding .
An unapproved translation has no legal force , and it should say so explicitly .
It should be marked as follows :
This translation of the GPL is informal , and not officially approved by the Free Software Foundation as valid .
To be completely sure of what is permitted , refer to the original GPL ( in English ) .
But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to understand the English GPL .
For many users , that is sufficient .
However , businesses using GNU software in commercial activity , and people doing public ftp distribution , should need to check the real English GPL to make sure of what it permits .
Publishing translations valid for a single country only .
We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are officially valid only for one country .
This way , if there is a mistake , it will be limited to that country , and the damage will not be too great .
It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic and capable lawyer to make a translation , so we cannot promise any such translations soon .
If a programming language interpreter has a license that is incompatible with the GPL , can I run GPL - covered programs on it ?
# InterpreterIncompat )
When the interpreter just interprets a language , the answer is yes .
The interpreted program , to the interpreter , is just data ; the GPL does n't restrict what tools you process the program with .
However , when the interpreter is extended to provide “ bindings ” to other facilities ( often , but not necessarily , libraries ) , the interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses through these bindings .
The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of such a facility ; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them .
So if these facilities are released under a GPL - incompatible license , the situation is like linking in any other way with a GPL - incompatible library .
Which implies that :
If you are writing code and releasing it under the GPL , you can state an explicit exception giving permission to link it with those GPL - incompatible facilities .
If you wrote and released the program under the GPL , and you designed it specifically to work with those facilities , people can take that as an implicit exception permitting them to link it with those facilities .
But if that is what you intend , it is better to say so explicitly .
You can't take someone else 's GPL - covered code and use it that way , or add such exceptions to it .
Only the copyright holders of that code can add the exception .
Who has the power to enforce the GPL ?
# WhoHasThePower )
Since the GPL is a copyright license , the copyright holders of the software are the ones who have the power to enforce the GPL .
If you see a violation of the GPL , you should inform the developers of the GPL - covered software involved .
They either are the copyright holders , or are connected with the copyright holders .
Learn more about reporting GPL violations .
In an object - oriented language such as Java , if I use a class that is GPLed without modifying , and subclass it , in what way does the GPL affect the larger program ?
# OOPLang )
Subclassing is creating a derivative work .
Therefore , the terms of the GPL affect the whole program where you create a subclass of a GPLed class .
If I port my program to GNU / Linux , does that mean I have to release it as free software under the GPL or some other Free Software license ?
# PortProgramToGPL )
In general , the answer is no — this is not a legal requirement .
In specific , the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what their licenses are .
Most system libraries either use the GNU Lesser GPL , or use the GNU GPL plus an exception permitting linking the library with anything .
These libraries can be used in nonfree programs ; but in the case of the Lesser GPL , it does have some requirements you must follow .
Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone ; you must use a GPL - compatible license to use those libraries .
But these are normally the more specialized libraries , and you would not have had anything much like them on another platform , so you probably wo n't find yourself wanting to use these libraries for simple porting .
Of course , your software is not a contribution to our community if it is not free , and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it .
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software , which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people to lose their freedom .
If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society , you need to make your software free .
I just found out that a company has a copy of a GPLed program , and it costs money to get it .
Are n't they violating the GPL by not making it available on the Internet ?
# CompanyGPLCostsMoney )
No .
The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for distribution .
It also does not require anyone in particular to redistribute the program .
And ( outside of one special case ) , even if someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes , the GPL does n't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular , or any other person in particular .
What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a copy to you if he wishes to .
Once the copyright holder does distribute a copy of the program to someone , that someone can then redistribute the program to you , or to anyone else , as he sees fit .
Can I release a program with a license which says that you can distribute modified versions of it under the GPL but you can't distribute the original itself under the GPL ? # ReleaseNotOriginal )
No .
Such a license would be self - contradictory .
Let 's look at its implications for me as a user .
Suppose I start with the original version ( call it version A ) , add some code ( let 's imagine it is 1000 lines ) , and release that modified version ( call it B ) under the GPL .
The GPL says anyone can change version B again and release the result under the GPL .
So I ( or someone else ) can delete those 1000 lines , producing version C which has the same code as version A but is under the GPL .
If you try to block that path , by saying explicitly in the license that I 'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under the GPL by deleting those lines from version B , in effect the license now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL permits .
In other words , the license does not in fact allow a user to release a modified version such as B under the GPL .
Does moving a copy to a majority - owned , and controlled , subsidiary constitute distribution ?
# DistributeSubsidiary )
Whether moving a copy to or from this subsidiary constitutes “ distribution ” is a matter to be decided in each case under the copyright law of the appropriate jurisdiction .
The GPL does not and cannot override local laws .
US copyright law is not entirely clear on the point , but appears not to consider this distribution .
If , in some country , this is considered distribution , and the subsidiary must receive the right to redistribute the program , that will not make a practical difference .
The subsidiary is controlled by the parent company ; rights or no rights , it wo n't redistribute the program unless the parent company decides to do so .
Can software installers ask people to click to agree to the GPL ?
If I get some software under the GPL , do I have to agree to anything ?
# ClickThrough )
Some software packaging systems have a place which requires you to click through or otherwise indicate assent to the terms of the GPL .
This is neither required nor forbidden .
With or without a click through , the GPL 's rules remain the same .
Merely agreeing to the GPL does n't place any obligations on you .
You are not required to agree to anything to merely use software which is licensed under the GPL .
You only have obligations if you modify or distribute the software .
If it really bothers you to click through the GPL , nothing stops you from hacking the GPLed software to bypass this .
I would like to bundle GPLed software with some sort of installation software .
Does that installer need to have a GPL - compatible license ?
# GPLCompatInstaller )
No .
The installer and the files it installs are separate works .
As a result , the terms of the GPL do not apply to the installation software .
Some distributors of GPLed software require me in their umbrella EULAs or as part of their downloading process to “ represent and warrant ” that I am located in the US or that I intend to distribute the software in compliance with relevant export control laws .
Why are they doing this and is it a violation of those distributors ' obligations under GPL ? # ExportWarranties )
This is not a violation of the GPL .
Those distributors ( almost all of whom are commercial businesses selling free software distributions and related services ) are trying to reduce their own legal risks , not to control your behavior .
Export control law in the United States might make them liable if they knowingly export software into certain countries , or if they give software to parties they know will make such exports .
By asking for these statements from their customers and others to whom they distribute software , they protect themselves in the event they are later asked by regulatory authorities what they knew about where software they distributed was going to wind up .
They are not restricting what you can do with the software , only preventing themselves from being blamed with respect to anything you do .
Because they are not placing additional restrictions on the software , they do not violate section 10 of GPL v3 or section 6 of GPLv2 .
The FSF opposes the application of US export control laws to free software .
Not only are such laws incompatible with the general objective of software freedom , they achieve no reasonable governmental purpose , because free software is currently and should always be available from parties in almost every country , including countries that have no export control laws and which do not participate in US - led trade embargoes .
Therefore , no country 's government is actually deprived of free software by US export control laws , while no country 's citizens should be deprived of free software , regardless of their governments ' policies , as far as we are concerned .
Copies of all GPL - licensed software published by the FSF can be obtained from us without making any representation about where you live or what you intend to do .
At the same time , the FSF understands the desire of commercial distributors located in the US to comply with US laws .
They have a right to choose to whom they distribute particular copies of free software ; exercise of that right does not violate the GPL unless they add contractual restrictions beyond those permitted by the GPL .
Can I use GPLed software on a device that will stop operating if customers do not continue paying a subscription fee ?
# SubscriptionFee )
No .
In this scenario , the requirement to keep paying a fee limits the user 's ability to run the program .
This is an additional requirement on top of the GPL , and the license prohibits it .
How do I upgrade from ( L ) GPLv2 to ( L ) GPLv3 ? # v3HowToUpgrade )
First , include the new version of the license in your package .
If you 're using LGPLv3 in your project , be sure to include copies of both GPLv3 and LGPLv3 , since LGPLv3 is now written as a set of additional permissions on top of GPLv3 .
Second , replace all your existing v2 license notices ( usually at the top of each file ) with the new recommended text available on the GNU licenses howto .
It 's more future - proof because it no longer includes the FSF 's postal mailing address .
Of course , any descriptive text ( such as in a README ) which talks about the package 's license should also be updated appropriately .
How does GPLv3 make BitTorrent distribution easier ?
# BitTorrent )
Because GPLv2 was written before peer - to - peer distribution of software was common , it is difficult to meet its requirements when you share code this way .
The best way to make sure you are in compliance when distributing GPL v2 object code on BitTorrent would be to include all the corresponding source in the same torrent , which is prohibitively expensive .
GPLv3 addresses this problem in two ways .
First , people who download this torrent and send the data to others as part of that process are not required to do anything .
That 's because section 9 says “ Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer - to - peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance [ of the license ] . ”
Second , section 6 ( e ) of GPLv3 is designed to give distributors — people who initially seed torrents — a clear and straightforward way to provide the source , by telling recipients where it is available on a public network server .
This ensures that everyone who wants to get the source can do so , and it 's almost no hassle for the distributor .
What is tivoization ?
How does GPL v3 prevent it ?
# Tivoization )
Some devices utilize free software that can be upgraded , but are designed so that users are not allowed to modify that software .
There are lots of different ways to do this ; for example , sometimes the hardware checksums the software that is installed , and shuts down if it does n't match an expected signature .
The manufacturers comply with GPL v2 by giving you the source code , but you still do n't have the freedom to modify the software you 're using .
We call this practice tivoization .
When people distribute User Products that include software under GPLv3 , section 6 requires that they provide you with information necessary to modify that software .
User Products is a term specially defined in the license ; examples of User Products include portable music players , digital video recorders , and home security systems .
Does GPLv3 prohibit DRM ? # DRMProhibited )
It does not ; you can use code released under GPLv3 to develop any kind of DRM technology you like .
However , if you do this , section 3 says that the system will not count as an effective technological “ protection ” measure , which means that if someone breaks the DRM , she will be free to distribute her software too , unhindered by the DMCA and similar laws .
As usual , the GNU GPL does not restrict what people do in software , it just stops them from restricting others .
Can I use the GPL to license hardware ?
# GPLHardware )
Any material that can be copyrighted can be licensed under the GPL .
GPLv3 can also be used to license materials covered by other copyright - like laws , such as semiconductor masks .
So , as an example , you can release a drawing of a physical object or circuit under the GPL .
In many situations , copyright does not cover making physical hardware from a drawing .
In these situations , your license for the drawing simply can't exert any control over making or selling physical hardware , regardless of the license you use .
When copyright does cover making hardware , for instance with IC masks , the GPL handles that case in a useful way .
I use public key cryptography to sign my code to assure its authenticity .
Is it true that GPL v3 forces me to release my private signing keys ?
# GiveUpKeys )
No .
The only time you would be required to release signing keys is if you conveyed GPLed software inside a User Product , and its hardware checked the software for a valid cryptographic signature before it would function .
In that specific case , you would be required to provide anyone who owned the device , on demand , with the key to sign and install modified software on the device so that it will run .
If each instance of the device uses a different key , then you need only give each purchaser a key for that instance .
Does GPLv3 require that voters be able to modify the software running in a voting machine ?
# v3VotingMachine )
No .
Companies distributing devices that include software under GPLv3 are at most required to provide the source and Installation Information for the software to people who possess a copy of the object code .
The voter who uses a voting machine ( like any other kiosk ) does n't get possession of it , not even temporarily , so the voter also does not get possession of the binary software in it .
Note , however , that voting is a very special case .
Just because the software in a computer is free does not mean you can trust the computer for voting .
We believe that computers cannot be trusted for voting .
Voting should be done on paper .
Does GPLv3 have a “ patent retaliation clause ” ?
# v3PatentRetaliation )
In effect , yes .
Section 10 prohibits people who convey the software from filing patent suits against other licensees .
If someone did so anyway , section 8 explains how they would lose their license and any patent licenses that accompanied it .
Can I use snippets of GPL - covered source code within documentation that is licensed under some license that is incompatible with the GPL ? # SourceCodeInDocumentation )
If the snippets are small enough that you can incorporate them under fair use or similar laws , then yes .
Otherwise , no .
The beginning of GPLv3 section 6 says that I can convey a covered work in object code form “ under the terms of sections 4 and 5 ” provided I also meet the conditions of section 6 .
What does that mean ?
# v3Under4and5 )
This means that all the permissions and conditions you have to convey source code also apply when you convey object code : you may charge a fee , you must keep copyright notices intact , and so on .
My company owns a lot of patents .
Over the years we 've contributed code to projects under “ GPL version 2 or any later version ” , and the project itself has been distributed under the same terms .
If a user decides to take the project 's code ( incorporating my contributions ) under GPLv3 , does that mean I 've automatically granted GPLv3 's explicit patent license to that user ?
# v2OrLaterPatentLicense )
No .
When you convey GPLed software , you must follow the terms and conditions of one particular version of the license .
When you do so , that version defines the obligations you have .
If users may also elect to use later versions of the GPL , that 's merely an additional permission they have — it does not require you to fulfill the terms of the later version of the GPL as well .
Do not take this to mean that you can threaten the community with your patents .
In many countries , distributing software under GPL v2 provides recipients with an implicit patent license to exercise their rights under the GPL .
Even if it did n't , anyone considering enforcing their patents aggressively is an enemy of the community , and we will defend ourselves against such an attack .
If I distribute a proprietary program that links against an LGPLv3 - covered library that I 've modified , what is the “ contributor version ” for purposes of determining the scope of the explicit patent license grant I 'm making — is it just the library , or is it the whole combination ?
# LGPLv3ContributorVersion )
The “ contributor version ” is only your version of the library .
Is GPLv3 compatible with GPLv2 ? # v2v3Compatibility )
No .
Many requirements have changed from GPL v2 to GPLv3 , which means that the precise requirement of GPL v2 is not present in GPLv3 , and vice versa .
For instance , the Termination conditions of GPLv3 are considerably more permissive than those of GPLv2 , and thus different from the Termination conditions of GPLv2 .
Due to these differences , the two licenses are not compatible : if you tried to combine code released u

Demonstrators threw rocks at police as they tried to reach the embassy ’s branch office — which was closed — and police responded with tear gas .
SARAJEVO , Bosnia - Herzegovina ( CNN ) — Hundreds of Bosnian - Serb demonstrators broke away from a peaceful rally in Banja Luka on Tuesday and headed for the U.S. Embassy ’s office there , clashing with police along the way , a police spokesman said .
The errant demonstrators threw rocks at police as they tried to reach the embassy ’s branch office — which was closed — and police responded with tear gas .
The protesters never reached the embassy ’s office ; adjacent streets had been closed in anticipation of the demonstration in Banja Luka , Bosnia ’s second largest city .
Police said the violent demonstrators numbered about 600 or 700 , and had broken away from a 100,000 - strong rally of Bosnian Serbs protesting Kosovo ’s recent declaration of independence .
Police arrested some demonstrators , although it was not clear how many .
Because the United States supports Kosovo ’s independence , U.S. diplomatic missions in the region have been a target of protests since the Serbian province declared independence on February 17 .

Can Transition
Towns save us from climate chaos and peak oil ?
A few weeks ago , the climate activist and inventor Dave Wilks told me he’d hit on a new way to describe the warming of our atmosphere : it ’s equivalent to nearly five Hiroshima bombs exploding per second , he told me , and the rate is rising exponentially .
As a journalist I ’ve been privileged , and often depressed , to meet scientists and activists such as Wilks who have dragged climate change up the political agenda .
And I ’ve seen for myself some of the effects of all that extra atmospheric energy – extreme weather events such as last month ’s floods in which I waded up to my knees .
I ’ve also spoken to experts who believe there ’s another threat facing us , no less significant than global warming : the end of oil .
Our lives depend on ever - increasing amounts of cheap energy , and synthetic petroleum by - products , and when oil production peaks we ’re in trouble .
Some believe that will happen by 2010 .
After that , economic collapse will lead to literally billions of people starving to death .
In the 1970s , families abandoned the UK because they feared being wiped out by Russian nukes .
That dreaded event did n’t happen ( yet ) but I ’m aware of two such families , in the Bahamas and Australia , who do n’t regret moving out .
I ’m not aware that anybody left London out of fears relating to the Y2 K computer bug , but I would not be surprised to learn that people upped sticks as a result of Sars , or bird flu .
And it seems to me that the combined threat of climate change and “ peak oil ” is more menacing .
In fact , I ’m starting to wonder about getting out of here – taking my wife and daughter from London before the trouble starts .
In this I take my lead from the Biblical patriarch Lot , whom Genesis records as having sensibly quit Sodom before it started to rain fire and brimstone ; but also from the environmentalist George Monbiot , who turned his back on Oxford last year , in favour of rural Wales .
In the three years since I first started to worry very much about climate change and “ peak oil ” , I ’ve done a fair bit to address the problem .
I changed electricity supplier , ordered local food to be delivered to my doorstep in a cardboard box , and replaced my light bulbs .
I bought an electric car , protested outside shops that kept their doors open in winter , and even devised an entirely new model for Britain ’s energy infrastructure – a community energy cooperative .
Having sent an outline of my idea to virtually every politician I could think of , I found myself delivering an hour - long briefing to John Gummer , leader of the Conservative energy task force ; and addressing a dinner of my local Liberal Democrats , who raised the idea of the energy co-op at a meeting of the local council and won unanimous backing for it .
More recently , I got hold of several Electrisave meter readers , and leafleted hundreds of neighbours offering to lend them a meter at no cost so that they could monitor and reduce their domestic energy use .
Only seven took up the offer , but – undaunted – I persuaded the local vicar to host a public meeting .
Apart from the vicar himself , and a loyal friend of mine who belongs to the Green Party , only one other person turned up – bless her .
I mention all this not because I want congratulations – nor commiserations – but because I daresay that many others are doing similar things , and probably feeling no less downbeat about the results .
Certainly , they ’ll have been discouraged , as I was , by a Defra survey published this week [ on 15 Aug ] , showing that a quarter of the population still think it takes too much effort to do things that are “ environmentally friendly ” .
But there is hope .
In the last few months , I ’ve become aware of a growing movement of people across the country devising creative solutions to the problems facing us .
Over the same period – and this is important – I ’ve started to notice quite how many fruit trees and shrubs are growing in the streets near my home in northwest London – but more of them later .
The Transition Town movement was started by an Englishman , Rob Hopkins , after a stint working as a teacher in Kinsale , in Ireland .
“ I had never heard about peak oil , ” Hopkins says .
“ But then I showed students a film , The End of Suburbia , which I ’d never seen , and at the same time Dr Campbell from the Association for the Study of Peak Oil came to talk .
I have to say it was as traumatic and shocking for me as it was for the students .
One of the other members of staff said to me , ‘ What has happened to your students , they ’ve been walking around looking grey all week ! ’
The film , and Campbell , made clear that no aspect of life will be the same after oil runs out .
“ When we got over the shock we set about looking at the town of Kinsale .
We examined how the town might look in 20 years if it adapted to peak oil instead of pretending it was n’t happening . ”
The project lasted for seven or eight months .
“ We came up with a plan , a vision of how the town would be , and then backcast it to see how to get there , year by year . ”
Returning to England , Hopkins launched helped to create a similar “ energy descent ” plan in Totnes , Devon , and the Transition Town movement was born .
It ’s grown incredibly fast .
A year after Totnes launched , individuals and groups from 176 places have registered to become Transition Towns , with more coming on board all the time .
The first , Totnes , Lewes , Glastonbury and Stroud , were full of middle - class hippy types ( or as Hopkins puts it , “ places that traditionally have been laboratories for alternative ideas ” ) .
But in Bristol it ’s the poorer districts that have been most dynamic .
And in Wales the impetus has come from the agricultural community .
“ If we do n’t do anything , ” says Hopkins , “ there are all kinds of grim scenarios .
But I like to think of those as like Dickens ’ Ghost of Christmas Future – just one possible scenario . ”
The environmental movement , he believes , has been guilty of putting people in a place of despondency and guilt .
Transition
Towns are positively trying to move towards something .
“ Realistically , only a very small percentage will think that that life beyond abundant oil could be preferable to where we are now . ”
Does he believe that ?
“ I do n’t think it will be a dark age but the most extraordinary renaissance . ”
As Hopkins sees it , we need to engineer a certain degree of wartime mobilisation .
“ But how do we bring that about , when it ’s not going to be initiated at government level ?
A lot of the drive will have to come from communities . ”
The idea that solutions to civic problems should be provided by communities is popular with all the main parties at the moment .
“ This is an issue that goes completely beyond party politics .
At Transition Town Totnes we talk to the WI and the Conservative Association as much as we talk to the usual suspects .
Our Conservative MP , Anthony Steen , has been incredibly supportive and enthusiastic . ”
The concept that is central to transition towns is building resilience .
“ We have been doing work with people who remember the 1930s and 1940s , people who say it would have been insane to eat apples from New Zealand .
Back then , all the food came from near the town .
We do n’t have that resilience any more .
In the lorry strike of 2001 we had only three days of food in Totnes .
“ This is about doing things that come in under the radar .
We ’re building a parallel public infrastructure .
We have the Totnes pound , which we launched recently .
We have circulated 4,500 in one month .
You do n’t have to subscribe to peak oil and climate change to think that is quite sweet and fun . ”
( Hopkins recently gave a Totnes pound to Prince Charles , who cheerfully approved . )
“ But what it does is put in place something that is absolutely essential , because it stops wealth leaking out of the community . ”
More than 70 shops have agreed to trade with this parallel currency .
“ When we launched the Totnes pound 160 people turned up , and they all got one for nothing .
So at the beginning of the evening they were all waving their money in the air and laughing and exhilarated .
I thought , here are people who are concerned about peak oil and climate change and they ’re having a great time .
The possibility embodied in those notes is exhilarating .
We have only really started to scratch the surface of presenting these issues in a way that makes people feel optimistic .
They also planted nut trees throughout town .
“ Nobody can object to that , but it raises awareness about food security and local food .
And we are not standing in town with placards talking about ‘ them and us ’ . ”
It sounds impressive .
I think I may settle in Totnes when I leave London .
Does Hopkins approve ?
Not really .
Until recently , he concedes , people like him believed the most responsible thing to do was to move out , build a house and grow your own food .
“ But when I found out about peak oil I came to question that .
We had built our own house , and were growing our own food , but I thought , this was only going to be sustainable if I am prepared to sit at the gate with a shotgun .
What do I do with my carrots if the village up the road is cold and hungry ? ”
A little lugubriously , I point out that if cities do n’t get their act together on climate change , and temperatures rise by six degrees , even people with remote smallholdings will be wiped out by great fireballs of methane shooting across the sky .
“ We have to move towards collective solutions , ” Hopkins agrees cautiously .
“ Peak oil is a call to those of us who have been out in the highlands to come back and help because the skills are very much in demand now . ”
He points out that individuals and groups in major cities such as Nottingham , Leeds and Liverpool have shown considerable interest in joining the transition network .
Bristol has already launched .
“ Bristol has 800,000 people .
Will it work on that scale ?
We have no idea , we ’ve never done it before .
It may be that in five years we will say it only works in market towns .
But everybody who tries to run with it is contributing to the research .
This is the biggest and most important research project in the UK at the moment . ”
Inspired and enthused , I travel across London to a health - food café to meet Duncan Law , an actor and director who parked the day job months ago to devote himself full time to launching Transition Town Brixton .
I tell Law he ’s the only model I have for somebody trying to set up a Transition Town in London .
He grins : “ Your worst nightmare ! ”
Has Law considered quitting the city ?
“ I do n’t seriously think about leaving .
I have lived in Brixton for 20 years , a lot of my friends are here , and have always thought that my challenge was to bring some sort of sustainability to the urban environment . ”
There are roughly 67,000 people in Brixton and Law ’s group has only 350 names on its email lists , not all of them local .
Is there really any hope ?
“ Brixton is huge , ” he concedes , “ but it ’s a place that has a certain pride and oomph and creativity .
People here like to be in the vanguard .
It ’s also very diverse , with a lot of people who could n’t care less and indeed refuse to care less .
But we carry on trying .
We do have excellent projects in Brixton .
There ’s a fairly passive solar building built by Bed Zed and Lambeth council .
We have Brockwell Park Community greenhouses .
And there ’s an initiative to do composting . ”
The café where we meet , Honest Foods , has a policy of sourcing food locally .
Law asks for a word with the chef , says he knows somebody with a vast crop of pears in their garden and would the chef be interested in buying them ?
Amazingly , the chef says yes at once .
On a roll , Law mentions the revival of the local alternative currency , the Brick , and a pioneering “ loyalty card ” for corner shops promoted by the man who previously set up The Big Issue .
This time the chef sounds interested but not quite ready to sign up .
We set off for a tour of Brixton : Law on his recumbent bike and me on my foldaway with tiny wheels .
If we look odd together , the effect is increased by Law stopping every so often to collect apples that have fallen from trees .
Over his shoulder , he tells me about an entrepreneur who made £ 4,000 in the early 1950s – more than Law ’s headmaster father earned in a year – by commissioning children to gather blackberries for him .
Transition Town Brixton , he reveals , is currently mapping fruit trees across south London .
Near Balham , we visit Sue Sheehan , a Transition Town supporter who holds meetings with neighbours “ like Tupperware parties ” to share eco ideas .
She recently started growing fruit and veg in boxes in the tiny space in front of her terraced house .
I ’m impressed by the quantity , and the sheer variety .
But I still have n’t got the hang of how to be upbeat about peak oil and climate change and ungraciously tell her that the crop , though plentiful , will not be enough to keep her alive when the trouble starts .
A week later , I return to south London for a screening at the independent Ritzy cinema of the latest consciousness - raising film promoted by Transition Town Brixton .
A few weeks ago , the cinema 's education officer tells me , more people turned up to see a film about peak oil than bought tickets for Ocean ’s 13 .
Tonight ’s film has attracted the largest crowd yet .
The Power of Community is a short documentary about what happened to Cuba after Soviet oil supplies dried up and the US embargo curtailed other imports .
It shows how Cubans gradually turned from heavy reliance on carbon - intensive agriculture : all kinds of urban spaces were cultivated , from window boxes to wasteland .
The transition took several years , and Cubans had to forgo the equivalent of a meal a day – but by the end even people in cities were producing half their annual fruit and vegetable needs .
It ’s an upbeat film , and the audience is clearly impressed .
Many will later give names and email addresses to Law , and hang around to speak to him in the bar .
I fear that the film may have glossed over any incidents of vandalism , or plundering , but in the question and answer session afterwards Law introduces a guest speaker , author Andre Viljoen , who indicates among other things that there seems to be little evidence of that type of crime .
Viljoen also points out that the idea of urban agriculture has started to move mainstream – an exhibition at Tate Modern includes an installation by an artist , Fritz Haeg , comprising an “ edible estate ” on previously contaminated land outside the gallery .
Conventional agriculture , Law announces , uses ten calories from fossil fuels – for transportation , pesticides , fertilisers – to produce just one calorie in food .
“ That ’s plainly unsustainable .
Every lettuce you grown yourself saves growing another one miles away and shipping it to you , and all the emissions associated with that . ”
Before we clear the auditorium , a man with a beard points out that there ’s a long way to go .
“ There are people out there with fruit trees who do n’t bother picking the fruit .
We have to teach them how to do that again . ”
The point is well made .
Next morning , I rise early and gather a stepladder and my three - year - old daughter for a spot of urban gardening .
Without crossing more than one road , we manage to pick ten figs , a plum , and innumerable blackberries .
By next year we may have planted some trees and shrubs of our own – but only if the methane fireballs have n’t torched us first .

Head to a park for cheap , fun and healthy human family entertainment .
Parks are FREE !!
Yes , we could not believe it either .
There is nothing like fresh air and exercise to tire the little ones out and make them smile .
There is so much to do there .
We were quite surprised the parks were not more full of humans .
There are swings and slides .
Our favorite is monkey bars .
Here ’s a great , cheap park entertainment schedule :
1 . Make sure the sun is brightly shining .
Cost = $ 0.0
2. Bring water bottles with you .
Cost = $ 0.0 ( See Tip 4 Drink Tap Water , Didiot )
3 . Make sure you have water in the water bottles .
Cost = $ 0.0
4 . Bring munchies , apples , banana , whatever with you .
Cost - $ 5.00
5 . Bring a blanket .
Cost = $ 0.0
6 . Bring your walking shoes .
Cost =$0.0
7. Bring a soccer ball .
Cost = $ 0.0 ( if you already have one . )
If you do n’t have a soccer ball , go to a park where Latinos go .
They will have a soccer ball and they might let you play too .

Diesel fumes from large trucks have spooked American drivers
Overpowering diesel fumes fill the cabin of the double - cab pick - up as it lines up behind hundreds of idling trucks , stuck queuing at North America 's busiest border crossing .
Ambassador Bridge , which links Canada and the US in a graceful stretch across the Detroit river , may be beautiful .
But it stinks .
For many Americans , slow - moving queues such as this one are seen as a necessary evil .
The 18 - wheeler trucks that cross the bridge transport more than a quarter of all trade between the two nations by volume , adding tens of thousands of jobs and some $ 10bn to $ 15 bn ( £ 5.1 bn to £ 7.7 bn ) to economic output , according to some estimates .
But they also belch out tonnes of diesel , which has been widely blamed for a range of ailments ranging from bronchitis to asthma to lung cancer .
Reluctant consumers
At a filling station a couple of miles down river from the Ambassador Bridge , a virtual line is drawn between the diesel pumps in the truckers ' area and the area where drivers of cars and light trucks fill their tanks .
Trucks in one area , cars in the other
These days , most urban filling station offer diesel in both areas - though there may be just one diesel pump - yet the filling station 's layout often remains as a potent symbol of a line that many Americans are loath to cross .
In a country where the " filthy fuel " is generally reviled , most would not even consider buying a diesel - powered family vehicle .
And yet , in spite of such extreme distrust in - or disgust with - diesel , European auto makers are preparing a massive onslaught of diesel - powered models that they say will help cut fuel bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25 % .
This year , for the first time , diesel - powered cars that meet the emissions regulations in all 50 states will arrive in the US , says Stefan Krause , BMW 's executive director in charge of sales and marketing , in an interview with BBC News .
" If you point out the environmental friendliness of these cars and if you point out that it 's more cost effective than petrol , then high performance diesels will be accepted , " he predicts .
Dieter Zetsche , chief executive of Daimler , which owns Mercedes - Benz , agrees .
" We are very bullish about the prospects for diesel in this country , " he tells BBC News .
Clean diesel
The Germans are leading the charge
Angus MacKenzie , editor - in- chief , Motortrend
Much of the science is on the side of modern diesel , which has a sulphur content limited to 15 parts per million ( ppm ) , compared with up to 500 ppm found in the diesel of yesteryear .
Consequently , a growing number of industry observers agree with the claims made by manufacturers of diesel - powered cars : " Diesels can produce enormous improvements in the short - term , " according to Paul Ingrassia , author of Comeback : The Fall and Rise of the American Automobile Industry .
The emergence of so - called " clean diesel " has taken Europe by storm and now outsells petrol pretty much across the board .
Diesel now accounts for more than half of all new cars sold in Europe , and only a quarter of luxury car buyers in Europe choose petrol engines , though this is largely because of tax rules that favour diesel .
In the US , meanwhile , diesel has yet to rise above a single - digit market share in any segment , though there are early signs that wealthy drivers , who are more likely to choose cars made by non-US manufacturers , are keen to embrace the fuel .
" Where we offer diesel it accounts for 20 % of sales , " observes Daimler 's Mr Zetsche .
" Mercedes is now going for more and more diesel in the US , " he adds , and so are its main European rivals , Audi and BMW .
" The Germans are leading the charge , " observes Angus MacKenzie , editor - in - chief of Motortrend .
Big and powerful
In Europe , carmakers are offering a broad range of diesel - powered vehicles that have been specially designed to meet the continent 's much stricter environmental regulations .
But do not expect the same model ranges to go on sale in the States .
All the German manufacturers aim to woo US drivers with diesel - powered muscle - cars in a carefully thought - out effort to convince Americans that a switch to diesel will not involve sacrificing performance .
Diesel is not slow , honest , the Germans say
" One of the perceptions is that they are slow and weak cars , " says Mr Krause .
" We do n't think the consumer is interested in downsizing , in giving up something , especially not the American customer . "
So to reinforce the performance aspects of diesel cars , at last month 's motor show in Detroit , Audi showed its R8 super - car concept with a 500 horse power V12 6.0 litre turbo diesel engine .
Audi will also introduce diesel to its large A8 executive car this year and Mercedes is rolling out its Bluetec range .
BMW , meanwhile , will bring diesel to the US market this year with its 335d model , which packs 265 horse power into a 3 - litre diesel engine that it says will deliver 23 miles per gallon ( mpg ) in the city and 33 mpg on the motorway .
Diesel discounts
BMW is confident many American drivers will switch to diesel
This focus on powerful diesels also makes them more expensive , not least since their modern emissions systems are also forcing up costs .
The total price premium for modern diesels can easily reach $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 per car , which will be a bridge too far for most Americans , according to the indigenous automotive giant General Motors .
Mercedes ' marketing people seem to agree , so when it launched its E320 Bluetec model in California last autumn it came with a lease agreement at a price comparable with its E350 petrol engine .
" The margins on diesel are somewhat lower " , acknowledges Mr Zetsche .
" We did not want to burden it with a big price . "
It is a strategy that BMW 's Mr Krause is loath to copy .
" We do n't believe we 'll have to give price concessions to be successful with diesels in this market , " he declares .
" These guys have good diesels for farm equipment .
We 're developing high performance diesels for roads . "
Finding a common line on Israel
As a rule , Israel blogging is n’t really on my beat , but Barack Obama spoke with about 100 members of Cleveland ’s Jewish Community yesterday morning , and offered an interesting perspective on U.S. - Israeli affairs .
“ I think there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt a unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you ’re anti-Israel and that ca n’t be the measure of our friendship with Israel .
If we cannot have a honest dialogue about how do we achieve these goals , then we ’re not going to make progress .
“ And frankly some of the commentary that I ’ve seen which suggests guilt by association or the notion that unless we are never ever going to ask any difficult questions about how we move peace forward or secure Israel that is non military or non belligerent or does n’t talk about just crushing the opposition that that somehow is being soft or anti-Israel , I think we ’re going to have problems moving forward .
And that I think is something we have to have an honest dialogue about . ”
In context , I think Obama was responding to concerns about Zbigniew Brzezinski supporting his campaign , but the senator explained , “ There ’s never been any of my advisors who questioned the need for us to provide Israel with security , with military aid , with economic aid .
That there has to be a two state solution , that Israel has to remain a Jewish state . ”
Now , what struck me as interesting about Obama ’s comments , most specifically his argument that one can be pro-Israel without being “ unwaveringly pro-Likud ” — a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with — is that his remarks sound like the kind that might be perceived as inherently divisive .
But that may not entirely be the case .
Matt Yglesias , for example , sounded quite pleased .
[ T ] his is considerably more forward - leaning than I ’d heard previously from Obama … .
This is music to my ears and , frankly , very much the attitude that ’s Israel ’s long - term future requires .
Still , in some quarters the man may as well have just festooned himself with swastikas .
And , of all people , TNR ’s Marty Peretz also sounded pleased .
I have written here and elsewhere that Barack Obama ’s views on Israel and the possibilties of peace between it and the Palestinians are both tough - minded and deeply comprehending .
I do n’t at all think that I ’d be disappointed with an Obama presidency , and certainly not with his attitude towards the Jewish State .
He is also not massaging Jewish audiences when he observes — correctly — that Israelis are , in general , far more various in their views on the security situation than American Jews or American Jewish organizations .
But one of the reasons for that is many of those who are prone to criticize Israel in the U.S. are also deluded in their conviction that Jewish sovereignty itself is the essence of what prevents peace with the Palestinians .
So , instead of asserting the justice of Jewish peoplehood , they really want to abandon it , and , with that , the state itself .
Well , in Israel , no Jew would countenace giving up sovereignty .
In America , there are a lot of self - righteous and cavalier Jews who would give up the sovereignty of other Jews , half the Jews in the world , so that they themselves might feel morally untouched by nationalism .
Just like many deluded Jews in pre-war France , England and Germany .
In any case , here are Obama ’s opinions and sharp insights , as expressed in Cleveland yesterday , on Israel and the Palestinians .
They are not mine exactly .
But they are enough like mine to let me sleep calmly .
As Jonathan Chait put it , “ Maybe [ Obama ] really can bring America together . ”

Obama corners Clinton on Iraq ; Clinton counters with Farrakhan Associated Press
Published : Tuesday February 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama clashed over NAFTA , health care and the war in Iraq Tuesday night in a crackling debate at close quarters one week before a pivotal group of primaries .
Charges of negative campaign tactics were high on the program , too .
The tone was polite yet pointed , increasingly so as the 90 - minute session wore on , a reflection of the stakes in a race in which Obama has won 11 straight primaries and caucuses and Clinton is in desperate need of a comeback .
Clinton also said as far as she knew her campaign had nothing to do with circulating a photograph of Obama wearing a white turban and a wraparound white robe presented to him by elders in Wajir , in northeastern Kenya .
The gossip and news Web site The Drudge Report posted the photograph Monday and said , without substantiation , that it was being circulated by " Clinton staffers . "
" We have no evidence where it came from , " Clinton said , making clear that 's not the kind of behavior she wants in her campaign .
" I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo , " Obama said .
The two rivals , the only survivors of a grueling primary season , sat about a foot apart at a table on stage at Cleveland State University .
It was the 20th debate of the campaign , 10 months to the day after the first .
Both Obama and Clinton were on the receiving end of pointed questions from Tim Russert of NBC News , one of two moderators for the event .
On the war , both candidates denounced President Bush 's record on Iraq , then restated long - held disagreements over which of them was more opposed .
Clinton said she and Obama had virtually identical voting records on the war since he came to the Senate in 2005 .
The former first lady voted in 2002 to authorize the war , at a time when Obama was not yet in Congress , and he tried to use the issue to rebut charges that he is ill - prepared to become commander in chief .
" The fact is that Senator Clinton often says that she is ready on day one , but , in fact , she was ready to give in to George Bush on day one on this critical issue , " Obama said .
Obama also sought to distance himself from an endorsement from the Rev. Louis Farrakhan , the controversial Chicago - based minister who has made numerous anti-Semitic comments in the past .
Obama said he had n't sought the endorsement , and that he had denounced the remarks .
Clinton interjected at one point , saying that in her initial Senate campaign in New York in 2000 , she was supported by a group with virulent anti-Semitic views .
" I rejected it , and said it would not be anything I would be comfortable with . "
She said rejecting support was different than denouncing it , an obvious jab at Obama .
He responded by saying he did n't see the difference , since Farrakhan had n't done anything except declare his support .
But given Clinton 's comments , he said , " I happily concede the point and I would reject and denounce . "
The audience applauded at that .

At local caucuses held Feb. 9 , participants vote by secret ballot for presidential candidates .
Based on the results , 36 of 39 delegates to the national convention are allocated to presidential candidates .
The candidate who receives the most votes in each of the state ’s four congressional districts receives all three of that district ’s delegates .
If there is tie , one delegate is allocated to each of the candidates who tied and one delegate is unpledged .
The candidate who receives the most votes statewide get 27 at - large and party - leader delegates , as long as that candidate also received the most votes in two congressional districts .
If no candidate receives the most votes in two or more congressional districts , 24 delegates will go to the national convention unpledged .

TMZ has learned the plan to get Britney into UCLA Medical Center had been hatched for days -- it was aborted last night , but executed just minutes ago .
Back at her house , Britney 's psychiatrist told her she was going to the hospital .
Her response was , " Is something wrong ? "
She was not resistant .
She made hot chocolate and waited before paramedics arrived and placed her on a gurney .
We 're told the psychiatrist felt her condition had deteriorated .
Britney had not slept since Saturday -- a day and half longer than she stayed up in recent memory .
The reason she 's at UCLA is her new treating psychiatrist practices out of that medical center .
We 're told during her initial 72 - hour stay she cannot be forced to take medication against her will .
If , however , she refuses to take meds , the plan is for the the psych to go to court and have Britney held for an additional 14 days , during which time she can administer proper medications .
And get this ironic twist -- Lynne Spears and Adnan drove to the Medical Center in the same car .
A source tells us when Lynne found out Britney was being committed , she blamed it on Sam and was extremely agitated .
When Brit heard that , she screamed to her mother , " Shut the hell up . "

Earlier this week , YouTube pulled the plug on funnyman and media artist Santeri Ojala , whose hilarious and popular " shredding " videos poke fun at the world ’s great guitar players .
YouTube said it received three complaints of copyright infringement and automatically suspended Ojala ’s account .
YouTube has a standing policy to suspend accounts after three complaints from copyright holders , whether the complaints are valid or not .
YouTube declined to say who filed the complaints , but it was likely the guitar gods themselves — or their representatives .
Ojala , who overdubs rock concert footage with his own bad guitar playing , says he has no plans to fight YouTube ’s decision , which would likely require him to hire a lawyer and file suit against the company .
So here , for your viewing pleasure , are the videos YouTube refuses to host .
In the clip above , Ojala shreds solo guitarist Steve Vai , one of the musicians Ojala suspects may have filed an infringement claim against his parody videos .
This is surprising , since in an earlier story about Ojala ’s videos , the rocker said he enjoyed being featured in the parodies .
The rest of Ojala ’s shredding videos are after the jump .
Or watch them all on Wired Video .

In addition to overlaying Clapton ’s string work , Ojala also dubs the instrumentation for the rest of the band — including a drummer , bass player , keyboardist and another guitarist .
Santeri re-recorded the audio in this clip of virtuoso guitarist Jake E. Lee performing with Ozzy Osbourne during the " Bark At

The best sex should last between seven and 13 minutes , and even three - minute sex is " adequate " , a major survey of US experts has concluded .

I understand that the purpose of this site is to provide a space where people can rant about what an asshole George Bush is and , believe me , I truly doubt there 's anybody out there who dislikes him more than I do .
But , I think we are missing an excellent opportunity here to partake in some true cultural change .
Yes , we should continue to expose this fraudulent government for what it really is and yes , we should do all we can to throw these bastards out of office so we can charge them with the war crimes they 've committed and , while we 're at it , hit them with the high crimes and misdemeanors they haveÂ perpetrated against the American people .
But , we also must do some things to educate and organize ourselves to contribute to social and cultural changes necessary to preserve our planet and well being .

I live in the Great American Southwest , where for too long , the environment and environmentalism have been desecrated by mining efforts that stripped the landÂ and , by nuclear scientists who poisoned the inhabitants ; by politicians who have paved over far too much paradise in favor of parking lots and subdivisions and strip malls and toxin - spewing manufacturing companies .
Because so many people are fleeing from urban America , these little pockets of once green , rural , open land are fast - becoming metropolitan centers .
And , the hunger for power and water is leading to ridiculous ideas like a water pipeline from Lake Mead , revisiting the Colorado River compact and building more coal - fired energy plants .
The lazy answer to all of this , of course , is " We gotta do somethin ' so we might as well go along with it . "
No , we do n't .
Not when coal - fired plants are being thrown out of Kansas , Missouri , New York and other places that are learning the deleterious effects of these facilities .
We have a problem here in that we are looking upon our cities as being disposable .
Build 'em , wreck 'em , use 'em up and move on to destroy new turf , leaving urban decay in our wake .
Cities that were once centers of our culture are now scarred with boarded up sections of town , left only to the poor or dangerous .
Meanwhile , little towns across this land where Mom and Pop shops were the center of commerce and everybody knew their neighbor are evolving at a frightening pace into metropolitan centers with Wal - Mart , McDonald 's and Starbucks , just like in the " big cities . "
And , we do nothing because , well , if we get 10,000 more people to move to town , we 'll be big enough to get Olive Garden to open a franchise here .
Never mind that we are trading our natural beauty for the beast of commercialism and greed .
Never mind that we are sacrificing our individuality for some Orwellian nightmare .
Never mind that we are sacrificing our lives by polluting our air with refuse from coal - fired plants , dirty industry and foods that are so jacked up with preservatives that they have shelf lives of years instead of days .
As much as I 'd like to lay this all in George Bush 's lap , I can't .
It 's our fault for becoming so greedy , so selfish , so shallow that we allow ourselves to make compromises that have put the survival of mankind in tremendous jeopardy .
So , instead of replying here with your " Save the Planet " messages , save your breath and invest it in the bigger picture .
Write letters to your representatives , attend city council meetings , demand that they not allow corporate pig farmers , environmentally unsound mining practices or polluting power plants into your neighborhood or mine .
Yes , you DO have the right to make such demands .
And , anybody who tells you any differently is a lying bastard .
See , I DID find a way to work George Bush into this thing after all !

LOS ANGELES 
In a twist for the music industry ’s digital revolution , “ In Rainbows , ” the new Radiohead album that attracted wide attention when it was made available three months ago as a digital download for whatever price fans chose to pay , ranked as the top - selling album in the country this week after the CD version hit record shops and other retailers .
The album , the first in four years from the closely watched British rock act , sold 122,000 copies in the United States , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
That represents a mixed result for the band .
It ’s a sharp drop compared with the debut of Radiohead ’s previous album , 2003 ’s “ Hail to the Thief , ” but it ’s far from a flop , considering the steep decline in music sales in the last four years and the typically weak sales in the post - Christmas period .
“ Thief ” sold about 300,000 in its first week in 2003 .
In any case the figures challenge the conventional wisdom that music fans no longer have an affinity for plastic .
The sales of the album , which also snagged the top spot on the British weekly music chart , came despite the fact that “ In Rainbows ”  in the form of digital files  had been acquired by many fans after the band offered it in an unconventional pay - what - you - want offering through a Web site , inrainbows.com .
The album was released on plastic CDs and vinyl LPs on Jan. 1 , with the CD priced at $ 13.98 , though it could be found for as little as $ 7.99 at outlets like Amazon.com .
Some retailers viewed the Radiohead figures as a sign of the continuing market for so - called physical products in the music business , where the popularity of iTunes , music blogs and other sites have made the digital file appear to be the coin of the realm .
In particular they said even fans who received the digital files distributed by Radiohead may have decided to pay for the better audio quality versions on CD or LP .
NOVEMBER 5-- We 're not sure what they 're inhaling down in Collier County , Florida , but here 's the bizarre ' information bulletin ' prepared by the local sheriff 's intelligence bureau about a purported ' new drug ' favored by the kids .
It 's an inhalant called ' Jenkem , ' and causes hallucinations and a ' euphoric high . '
Of course , as the bulletin notes , Jenkem users dislike its sewagey taste , which can last for days .
That 's because Jenkem 's active ingredients are urine and fecal matter , hence its street names like ' Butthash ' and ' Fruit from Crack Pipe . '
We 've tried to speak with the bulletin's author , Lieutenant Al Ganich , but he has not returned TSG calls .
Perhaps he 's realized that his ' CONFIDENTIAL ' September 26 report -- which is authentic , according to a sheriff 's official - - may be itself full of shit .
Ganich 's alert reminds us of a New York Fire Department memo from a chief who also apparently never heard of snopes.com .

A computer security consultant working for a wireless carrier — probably Verizon — stumbled upon a high - speed backdoor built into the carrier 's network for the Feds to pull anything from " the billing system , text messaging , fraud detection , web site , and pretty much all the systems in the data center without apparent restrictions . "

Threat Level pegs the wireless carrier as Verizon Wireless , because of a 2006 lawsuit whose allegations are extremely similar — a direct line built into their network for a " Quantico recipient " ( Quantico , Virginia being the FBI 's cyber - surveillance HQ ) which allowed :
" Direct access to all content and all information concerning the origin and termination of telephone calls placed on the Verizon Wireless network as well as the actual content of calls . "

Plus !
" Unfettered access to Verizon Wireless customer records , data and information .
Any customer databases , records and information could be downloaded from this center . "
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Naturally , Verizon 's mouthpiece Peter Thonis could n't confirm or deny anything about a Quantico setup or if Pasdar worked for Verizon .
Takeaway , if you 're dense : Everything is tapped , there 's nothing you can do about it .
Whatever thrust there was in righteous outrage is spent and pointless — but at least you know when you 're talking to yourself ( on a phone ? ) , there 's probably someone listening .

The Pentagon has admitted it mistakenly sent Taiwan four fuses used to trigger nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles in late 2006 and only discovered the mistake last week .
The fuses were recovered on Monday from Taiwan , where they were believed to have been held in storage after being mistakenly shipped as helicopter batteries from a Defence Department logistics facility in the United States , senior Pentagon officials said .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has ordered an investigation into the incident and a comprehensive review of the US inventory of all nuclear - related components as well as of policies and procedures , senior officials said .
" We 'll do a thorough investigation , and those who are responsible will be held accountable .
The secretary is quite forceful on this , " said Ryan Henry , principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy .
It was the second major nuclear security breach uncovered in just over six months , following the mistaken transfer of nuclear - armed cruise missiles from one US base to another aboard a B - 52 bomber in September .
Investigators will seek to determine whether the fuses and nose cone assemblies in which they were housed were tampered with , as well as how the error occurred and who was responsible .
China was notified of the shipment , Mr Henry said .
" Our policy on Taiwan arm sales have not changed .
This specific incident was an error in process only and is not indicative of our policies , which remain unchanged , " he said .

Global sea levels would be higher and rising faster , if not for reservoir water trapped behind dams around the world , a new study suggests .
But the conclusion does not fully account for other human - caused changes to the water cycle , another researcher cautions .
Sea level rise caused by global warming has the potential to severely impact coastal and island communities by encroaching on populations there and increasing storm damage .
Most of the sea level rise in recent decades has been attributed to the thermal expansion of the oceans ( water expands as it heats up ) and ice melt from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets .
Scientists have known for some time that changes in land water storage , including the amount of water locked behind dams , was an important element in the sea level rise equation , but just how important was uncertain , said study leader Ben Chao of the National Central University in Taiwan .
Chao and his colleagues investigated this question by doing a comprehensive tally of all the world 's dams constructed since 1900 ( about 29,484 ) and estimating the amount of water they hold .
The data was taken from the International Commission on Large Dams ' World Register of Dams .
Chao and his team found that altogether these dams hold about 2,600 cubic miles ( 10,800 cubic kilometers ) of water .
This corresponds to a drop in global sea levels of about 1.2 inches ( 30 millimeters ) .
Meaning ocean levels today would be that much higher if some river water was n't trapped behind dams and prevented from flowing back into the ocean .
" If you look in just the past half century , the observed sea level rise is about 10 centimeters , and the negative effect of the reservoirs in total has been as much 3 centimeters , so in other words , the sea level could have risen 13 centimeters , " Chao told LiveScience .
The study 's findings are detailed in the March 14 issue of the journal Science .
Accounting for the drop from dams means that the average sea level rise over the 20th century estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) ( about 1.7 millimeters per year over the last century ) would actually be higher than thought , Chao said .
But other scientists caution against making the leap from the amount of sea level rise to the rate at which it has risen .
" That may be one step too far , " said Vivien Gornitz of Columbia University 's Center for Climate Systems Research , who was not involved with Chao 's study .
All of the ways in which humans manipulate water on land must be considered , Gornitz says , from groundwater pumping to the increased runoff from cities covered in concrete , which is n't as permeable as soil .
" You have to consider all of these aspects together , " Gornitz said , and some scientists think these effects may cancel each other out in terms of their impact on sea level .
This view was noted in the last IPCC report .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - China is producing far more carbon dioxide than previous estimates and this will frustrate global aims to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gases , a group of U.S. economists said .

China is the world ’s second - largest emitter of CO2 and some studies suggest it might already have overtaken the United States last year .
The report could add to calls for China to sign up to binding cuts , something it has refused to do .
Writing in the May issue of the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , and UC San Diego said China ’s CO2 emissions will grow at least 11 percent annually between 2004 and 2010 .
Previous estimates , including those used by the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , say the region that includes China will see a 2.5 to 5 percent annual increase in CO2 emissions during the same period .
The release of the article comes as energy and environment ministers from the world ’s 20 major greenhouse gas emitting nations prepare to meet in Japan from Friday to discuss climate change , clean energy and sustainable development .
The G20 , ranging from top polluters the United States and China to Indonesia , Brazil and South Africa , emit about 80 percent of mankind ’s greenhouse gases .
Pressure is growing on these nations to hammer out a pact to halt and reverse growing emissions of CO2 , the main gas blamed for global warming .
In the journal report , the U.S. researchers said that by 2010 , there will be an increase of 600 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in China over levels in 2000 .
They said that figure from China alone would overshadow the 116 million metric tons of carbon emissions reductions pledged by all the developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol during the pact ’s 2008 - 2012 first commitment phase .
China is not obliged under Kyoto to cut greenhouse gas emissions during 2008 - 12 .
But it joined nearly 190 nations in Bali in December in agreeing to launch two years of U.N. - led talks to create a global emissions - fighting pact to replace Kyoto from 2013 .
The authors used pollution data from 30 provinces and China ’s official waste gas emissions data to get a more detailed picture of CO2 emissions up to 2004 .
“ It had been expected that the efficiency of China ’s power generation would continue to improve as per-capita income increased , slowing down the rate of CO2 emissions growth , ” said Maximillian Auffhammer , UC Berkeley assistant professor of agricultural and resource economics .
“ What we ’re finding instead is that the emissions growth rate is surpassing our worst expectations , and that means the goal of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 is going to be much , much harder to achieve . ”
Part of the problem was also a shift to give provinces more say in building power plants after 2000 , the report said .
“ Wealthier coastal provinces tended to build clean - burning power plants based upon the very best technology available , but many of the poorer interior provinces replicated inefficient 1950s Soviet technology , ” said Richard Carson , UC San Diego professor of economics .
“ The problem is that power plants , once built , are meant to last for 40 to 75 years , ” said Carson .
“ These provincial officials have locked themselves into a long - run emissions trajectory that is much higher than people had anticipated .
Our forecast incorporates the fact that much of China is now stuck with power plants that are dirty and inefficient . ”
" [ Popular British radio DJ Chris Moyles ] has 1 million Facebook friends .
Do you think he knows them all intimately ? "
Mr Hurst said .
Geoff Dick , senior lecturer in information systems at the University of NSW , said he agreed with the judge that Mr Hurst was n't actually asking to become friends with his ex-girlfriend and physically spend time with her .
He was merely suggesting that they give each other access to their profile pages , pictures and comments .
Dr Dick said a lot of the time " friends " listed on the pages of Facebook or similar site MySpace were more like " acquaintances " and the more there were , the less friendly the profile owner was with them .
" If you only have 10 ' friends ' then they are probably your best friends , whereas if you have 1000 ' friends ' then clearly a lot of them are inconsequential , " he said .
Dr Dick , who last year conducted a extensive study of MySpace use by teenagers , said most people now saw the networking sites as more of a communication medium than a circle of friends .
Although many " friends " listed on users ' profiles were really acquaintances , problems still arose if one was to conduct a " cull " of them .
" Removing someone from your friend list is almost a declaration of war , " Dr Dick said .
He said it was important to maintain true friendships in the traditional way - spending actual time together .
" If it 's certainly possible , I would very much encourage people to make use of their real - life friends and use these [ networking sites ] as a supplement , " he said .
Garry Dean , a 26 - year - old office worker , said he had more than 200 " Facebook friends " but he would not classify the vast majority as actual friends .
" They are people that I have come into contact with in my life , some going back to primary school .
Most of them I do n't even talk to , " he said .
" They are not friends , they are just a little icon on my screen . "
Mr Dean said he was considering " ditching " his profile altogether to get away from most of them because he thought it would be rude to remove them as " friends " .
" There are too many .
I 'm sick of getting constant email alerts telling me that some nobody I have n't spoken to in 10 years has updated something on their site , " he said .
Website editor Jessica van Coppenhagen , 24 , said she " only " had about 100 friends on her Facebook page and claimed she was in regular contact with " at least 80 per cent of them " .
She said she had no problem approving people from her distant past as " friends " , or removing them if she desired .
" Is n't that the whole point of this medium - getting in touch with people you would n't normally ? " she said .
" Why would you just have your friends on Facebook .
Would n't you just talk to them ?
Why would you need Facebook ? " - with AFP
LONDON ( IRNA ) --
Iran ’s defense expenditure per capita remains among the lowest in the Middle East region despite having the second highest population behind Egypt , according to the new publication of Military Balance .
The 2008 edition said that Iran ’s total defense spending for 2006 , the latest available , was nearly 55 percent less that Israel ’s , despite having ten times the population of the Zionist entity .
Per capita , Israeli regime ’s expenditure was calculated to be nearly 17 times higher at an average of $ 1,737 per person compared with only $ 110 for each Iranian .
Israel ’s military spending was shown to be the second highest in the world and only $ 59 per capita behind the U.S. , excluding Qatar , which only has a population of less than one million .
Even as a proportion of GDP , Iran ’s defense expenditure of 3.3 percent was found to be well less than half of Israel ’s 7.9 percent , which is among the highest in the world and even more than the U.S. Publishers of Military Balance , the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) , reported that Tel Aviv had increased its proposed defense budget for 2007 following its invasion of Lebanon in the previous summer .
Under a new agreement with the U.S. , it also said Washington was providing Israeli regime with a $ 30 billion package of Foreign Military Financing between 2009 and 2018 , an increase amounting to around 25 percent more than in the previous ten - year period .
Millihertz 5 Progress April 2020
Friday , 10th April 2020
Work is progressing slowly on the Millihertz 5 , my all - mechanical implementation of the Manchester Baby .
The UK is currently under lockdown , which prevents me accessing the laser cutter in my hackspace , but does give my some time to write documentation .
This is an informal discussion of the machine 's current state ; more formal plans can be found on GitHub .
From the top down , the metering unit at the top is mostly working , other than being a bit stiff and jamming occasionally .
This takes a stream of ball bearings in plastic pipe and meters out exactly eight ball bearings at a time , then distributes them out to the 23 mm spacing between columns which the rest of the machine uses .
The top end regenerator - which selectively injects ball bearings into the top of the machine , based on which bearings are present lower down in the machine - has been one of the most difficult things to get working , but the top part of this works fine at least .
Most of the datapath works on gravity , so there must be some mechanism to send data upwards at some point .
Ball bearings will be physically returned by a lift , yet to be designed , but the information needs to be sent separately using the ' regenerator ' mechanism , which uses eight lines of string which are pulled down to send a ' 1 ' upwards .
After the regenerator , ball bearings fall into the memory unit , which is also working well .
The decoder ( the black unit on the right of the machine ) decodes the 5 - bit address into one of 16 lines ; this is chainable so that a second decoder below it can decode the other 16 addresses when we move up to full operation .
The " address sender " unit which senses ball bearings and sets up the decoder 's address lines must come much lower down , below the instruction counter , and this is posing some problems .
The 3 mm threaded rods I planned to use become too flexible at the nearly 1 metre length I need , so these may need to be upgraded to a wider hollow tube material .
Below the memory is a combination distributor and regenerator ; this has to discard memory values ( for store instructions ) , divert the memory value to the instruction counter ( for jump instructions ) or divert it to the instruction decoder ( for instruction fetching ) .
You may be able to see from the picture that two red props have been added which tilt the distributor slightly .
This is to help the bearings fall out of the back of the machine , where they would go on to their destination .
The slope still is n't enough , and some bearings are failing to fall out and remaining stuck in the distributor .
The regenerator part of this , which senses ball bearings and pulls strings to send data up the machine , is also jamming ; the force the strings exert is enough to hold ball bearings in place when they should fall through to the rest of the machine .
The lowest part of the datapath , the staircase subtractor / accumulator unit , is one of the oldest designed parts of the machine , and is working very well .
Below this will be another regenerator to send the accumulator 's value up to memory .
This will be largely the same as the regenerator sender part of the distributor , so I 'm leaving it until I get the design of the first regenerator sender working correctly .
Next to the subtractor , there 's a temporary Lego contraption with three levers , which is hooked up to various parts near the top of the machine , to test that the parts really do operate by cable / string tension , rather than directly prodding parts .
The sequencer is the most current development .
This is a large camshaft with 18 cam profiles .
The cam profiles are designed to be modular , coming in quarter - circle sections which can be individually replaced .
However , they do n't snap into place properly and have a tendency to fall out when the bolts holding the whole camshaft together are loosened , so I 've had to add some weak glue to hold them in place .
The large gear and 14 mm diameter shaft have been the most heavyweight engineering I 've done on this project , and I 'm pleased to say that and the input shaft , reduced 3:1 with a 75:25T gear reduction , are aligned and turning smoothly .
A further set of ' combs ' on the bottom and the bar which holds the Bowden cables to connect to the followers was designed and ready to cut when I lost access to the laser cutter .
The instruction decoder ( the yellow box on top of the sequencer ) is waiting to be assembled , but is the same design as the memory address decoder , so I 'm not expecting any problems with that .
Above the sequencer , the instruction counter and separate metering unit for it still need to be cut , but these are mostly copies of parts already present on the datapath and which work well , so should be straightforward .
4 Secret Societies You ( Probably ) Do n't Know About
by Stefanie Becker
You 've probably heard about the Order of Skull and Bones at Yale " “ George W. Bush and John Kerry were both members , among many other famous and / or influential men .
But the Seven Society ?
Check out this secret fraternity and three others .
But if anyone asks , I did n't tell you ...
Flat Hat Club
Formed in 1750 at William and Mary College , F.H.C. was the nation 's first secret society .
The " Flat Hat Club "  was a name given to the group by outsiders , likely because of the mortarboard caps they wore ( caps that we now wear at graduations ) .
F.H.C.'s initials stood for Latin words , but it is uncertain what they were .
Some believe them to be " Fraternitas Humanitas Cognitioque "  meaning " Brotherhood , Humanity , and Knowledge . "
The society met regularly at Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg for drinking and discussion .
They were not known for scholarly pastimes ; the most famous known member , Thomas Jefferson , wrote in a letter that the society " served no useful object . "
F.H.C. seemed to die within two decades of its founding due to the Civil War but has seen recent revivals .
When membership and interest waned in F.H.C. in the 1770's , P.D.A. ( now referred to as Phi Delta Alpha but called " Please Don't Ask "  at the time ) imitated F.H.C. and established themselves as a secret society to take its place .
A student at the college , John Heath , was repeatedly refused entry , and so in retaliation he created the first Greek - letter fraternity , Phi Beta Kappa , which later spawned chapters in other colleges .
Ta -da !
Greek Life !
Seven Society
At the University of Virginia , Seven Society is the most secretive as well as ( ironically ) the most famous and visible on campus .
It 's unclear when or how they were founded ( one rumor is that seven men gathered for a card game created the society when the eighth man did n't show up ) , but they first became public in 1905 when a white seven was painted on school grounds .
Since then , the group has become a charitable powerhouse , buying a campus carillon , raising thousands of dollars for student loan funds , and awarding their own Seven Society Graduate Fellowship for Superb Teaching annually , which donates $ 7,000 to a teaching assistant nominated by students .
Membership in the fraternity is so secret that it is n't revealed until after a member has died .
When this happens , a wreath of black magnolias shaped like a " 7 "  is placed on the grave and the University Chapel 's bell tower chimes seven times in seven - second intervals on the seventh dissonant chord at seventh past the hour .
The only way to contact the Seven Society is by hiding a letter at the base of the Thomas Jefferson statue inside the University 's Rotunda .
Order of the Bull's Blood
Established by five friends in 1834 , this fraternity holds the high honor of being the oldest active secret society at Rutgers University .
Known for encouraging escalating pranks by new members to " ˜prove ' their allegiance , the Order caught the attention of nationwide newspapers in 1875 when they allegedly stole a canon from Princeton University .
Other secret societies on campus , such as The Cap and Skull Honor Society , have made their activities and memberships public , but the Order is still so secretive that some question it even exists , calling it a hoax .
In 2001 , Spencer Ackerman wrote an unconfirmed article called " Degenerate Society "  about how he had been asked to join the Order 's fraternity but refused .
Some people who allegedly did n't refuse : former Vice President Garret A. Hobart , former Director of the FBI Louis Freeh , and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman .
Eucleian Society
The Adelphic Society was created by a group of 16 students at New York University in 1832 .
Shortly after , they changed their name to Eucleian , after Eukleia , the Goddess of Repute , Glory , and War .
It became a literary society " “ with a stable source of money coming in from trusts " “ and hosted open forums and lectures ( sometimes held with rival NYU society Philomathean ) .
Although some members were known , most were kept secret , as were the inner workings of the organization .
Documents and internal records kept by the group have had information removed , the name of the Society erased , and nearly all of it is written in symbolic shorthand .
Regardless , the Society 's events were announced in newspapers and became well attended .
One early lecturer and repeated guest was Edgar Allen Poe , who became an important influence .
This also gave rise to the use of ravens in the fraternity insignia and the nickname " ˜Raven Society . '
The Eucleian Society was one of the most progressive , supporting gender equality , abolition , and Native Americans ' rights .
They printed two publications of their own , The Medly and the Knickerbocker , with articles lampooning and satirizing current events and people .
Both became popular well beyond campus .
Despite all of this , interest in the Society died down .
Members were branded social elitists , and membership diminished as Greek fraternities gained prominence .
In current years , the Society has opened up to those without University affiliation .
A notable member of the Eucleian Society is John Harvey Kellogg , who invented corn flakes cereal with his brother , as well as Major Walter Reed , MD , a U.S. army physician who confirmed the theory that yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes .

“ WE know the economy will be a critical factor this year , ” said Lee Scott , the boss of Wal - Mart , as the world 's biggest retailer released its quarterly results on February 19th .
Wal - Mart 's prospects do indeed reflect those of the economy at large — but not in the way you might expect .
With America tipping towards recession , Wal - Mart is doing much better than in the past couple of years when the economy was booming .
Sales increased by 8.3 % compared with the same period last year , to a record $ 106.3 billion .
Mr Scott concluded that in a volatile economy Wal - Mart was “ well positioned to succeed ” .
The secret of Wal - Mart 's meteoric rise over the past five decades has been its obsession with low prices .
It got into trouble in 2005 - 07 when it focused less on “ always low prices ” ( its longstanding motto ) and more on expansion .
Sales growth , productivity and profits fell , while Target and other upmarket rivals snatched market share .
Wal - Mart , the biggest private employer , became a favourite public whipping boy because of its health - care , gender and labour policies .
In February last year Mr Scott 's job was said to be on the line .
“ We used to be quite negative on the stock , because the company threw too much money at new stores , ” says Gregory Melich , a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley , an investment bank .
Wal - Mart has over 7,100 stores worldwide and more than 4,000 in America .
Last summer Mr Melich upgraded his verdict on Wal - Mart , because he saw a “ big strategic shift ” : it reduced its capital expenditure to $ 14 billion for the fiscal year , from $ 18 billion the year before , slowing its expansion to spruce up existing shops instead .
It opened far fewer new shops in January than in previous years .
The economic downturn is another boost for the recovery of the Bentonville behemoth , as cost - conscious consumers defect ( or return ) to the cheapest of the big retailers .
Prices for oil and many foods are at record highs , but Wal - Mart can pass some inflation on to shoppers without losing its low - price leadership .
And it is in the right line of business in hard times .
Its biggest strength is grocery sales , which are not slowing down , and are unlikely to , since they are essential purchases .
Other retailers are in a far harder spot .
Home Depot , America 's number two retailer , is in its sixth quarter of falling sales .
The home - improvement market has been badly hit by the subprime - mortgage meltdown .
Fashion retailers are in trouble , since most people think they can put off buying clothes .
Ann Taylor , a fashion retailer , says it will close 117 of its 921 stores over the next three years .
Even so , analysts predict that overall , retailing will escape a recession this year .
They forecast 3 % growth ( excluding cars and petrol ) compared with 4 % last year .
Retailers with international reach gain from the weak dollar .
Wal - Mart 's operations abroad , which represent one - quarter of sales , grew by 18.8 % in the past three months .
The American government 's fiscal - stimulus package of up to $ 168 billion will give retailers an extra $ 15 billion or so , and Wal - Mart is likely to get the lion 's share .
In tune with the times , the firm with always low prices changed its slogan last year to a new variation on the theme : “ Save money .
Live better . ”
MARCH 12 -- Meet ' Kristen , ' the high - priced hooker who trysted with Eliot ' Client - 9 ' Spitzer last month at that Washington , D.C. hotel .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - JetBlue , Yahoo Inc and Research in Motion plan to offer free , in - flight , Wi-Fi web connections for laptop computers and advanced cell phones , Rim said on Thursday .
The service will allow passengers to access customized Yahoo mail and Yahoo instant messenger services on their laptops or to access corporate e-mails on Wi-Fi enabled versions of the popular Blackberry device from Rim .
According to a spokesperson for Rim the first JetBlue flight offering the service will be on December 11 .
The enlisted men who supervised the training succeeded in convincing me that I never wanted to become a prisoner of war .
I recall that after our " capture " , the sailors — wearing Red Army uniforms — marched the dozen or so of us along the ocean without our boots .
It was very cold , and all our resolve and determination could not prevent our courage from draining out through our wet feet .
They took us to a compound of small huts with dirt floors .
The camp was surrounded by barbed wire , and the entrance was guarded by armed soldiers .
Several times that night I was on the verge of calling the whole thing off .
I suspect that I was not the only one .
We held on because none of us trainees wanted to be the person to quit .
The camp had an array of torture devices , including the infamous " black box " ( which I actually liked because it was the only time I was off the ground and not miserably cold ) , and our captors also threatened executions , though we had the comfort of knowing that they would not carry them through .
We were all interrogated a few times , some of us more than others .
During one interrogation , I was led blindfolded into a room .
Suddenly one of the " enemy " hit me hard in the stomach — a sucker punch that left me doubled over , out of breath .
I think three other people were present , but I was never sure .
Two men grabbed me at my sides .
They put a pole of some kind under my knees and bent me over backward .
My head went down lower than the rest of my body .
The questions ( What is your unit ?
Where are you from ? ) were asked by one man .
But we were not supposed to talk .
I remember that the blindfold was heavy and completely covered my face .
As the two men held me down , one on each side , someone began pouring water onto the blindfold , and suddenly I was drowning .
The water streamed into my nose and then into my mouth when I gasped for breath .
I could n't stop it .
All I could breathe was water , and it was terrifying .
I think I began to lose consciousness .
I felt my lungs begin to fill with burning liquid .
Pulling out my fingernails or even cutting off a finger would have been preferable .
At least if someone had attacked my hands , I would have had to simply tolerate pain .
But drowning is another matter .
Even though I knew that I was in a military facility and that my " captors " would not kill me , my body reacted to the danger it was in .
Adrenaline helped me to fight out of the position in which I was being held .
I can't really explain how I managed to stand up , still with one man clinging to each arm .
I only know how horrible it was .
The experience was probably only a few minutes , but to me it seemed much longer .
Waterboarding has , unfortunately , become a household word .
Back then , we called it " water torture " .
We recognised it as something the US would never do , whatever the provocation .
We must ask our leaders , elected and appointed , to be aware of such horrors ; we must ask them to stop the narrow and superficial thinking that hinges upon " legal " definitions and to use common sense .
Waterboarding is torture , and torture is clearly a crime against humanity .

Kay earned a doctorate ( with distinction ) at the University of Utah in 1969 for development of the first graphical , object - oriented personal computer .
He holds undergraduate degrees in mathematics and molecular biology from the University of Colorado .
Educom Review :
Do you ever worry about how much we 've all become dependent on technology ?
Alan Kay :
Well , I 'm a systems designer , and the main two things you worry about in systems design are proliferation and failure .
In fact the most successful systems that humans have been able to design are ones in which most of the design effort goes into letting the system be able to grow in a fashion that detects and corrects the error , so that the system does n't come apart .
The Internet is a good example of that , because it 's something that did n't require any central control and was n't constructed , the way a clock is constructed .
Another good example is the American Constitution , because the people who designed it realized that it would be very difficult to write laws for how people should live 50 years from their time and place , so they wisely made most of the Constitution a way of dealing with error situations that would come up and a way of keeping bad things from propagating .
They did n't try to tell people how they should live over the next two centuries .
ER : What 's the lesson for software designers ?
KAY : Think of it this way .
The great pyramid of Egypt took several hundred thousand slaves 20 years or so to build .
It was a big pile of rock .
And that 's very much like a lot of software that is built today .
Contrast that to the Empire State Building , which was built by fewer than 3,000 people in less than 11 months .
And if you try and match software against those two different models , there is a lot of software that was done by IBM 30 years ago and is being done by Microsoft today that is like a pyramid .
There is really no software engineering today that would allow us to do something like the Empire State Building .
The reason our group has been successful is that our whole development system is designed to allow us to late - bind things that we discover along the way , things we would not have to find out along the way if we had a real engineering discipline .
ER : In general , do you think the quality of software has gotten better ?
KAY : The overall quality is much worse .
ER : Why is that ?
KAY : Well , because you can make money at software design even if you 're not good at it , and because there 's nothing like the American Medical Association to certify the practitioners .
It 's like in the Middle Ages , when anybody could be a scientist .
You just got one of those pointy hats .
Nobody knew what a scientist was supposed to be able to do .
Anybody can still claim to be a scientist , and you do n't necessarily have to have a Ph.D. to be a scientist , but science works because it is a public forum for debugging other people 's ideas .
And you are not really a scientist unless you are going to participate in that forum .
Whereas in software pretty much anybody who has written a few lines of code in C can claim to be a programmer .
It 's very much more like itinerant laborers working on construction , where the ability to pound a nail into a board does n't make you an architect .
Usually in construction there are building code laws and other kinds of things that require architects and construction engineers to get involved .
But that 's not true in software .
Yet there is an incredible demand for it and that almost always lowers standards .
ER : How should a forum for software development work ?
KAY :
It should work something along the lines of Open Source Software , OSS , which is a not - so - underground movement that I think might have gotten its name from the people at Microsoft , who see it as a threat .
Four of the often - mentioned systems that are rivaling commercial systems are Linux , Python , Squeak , and Beowulf .
You 're no doubt familiar with the Valentine 's Day memo that was leaked from Microsoft .
It 's really quite wonderful to read what they think of this stuff .
Anyway , Open Source Software is software done the way science is done , and the code you write is open to scrutiny and criticism and improvement by people you have never met .
The idea is if you can get an artifact that is both interesting and shows great promise and all of the source code is available ( or in our case where it 's not only available , but the whole system is made for improving itself ) , you have a chance of attracting literally thousands of people .
Some of them of are very high quality and I believe that less than one percent of the really high - quality people that have been doing stuff and helping with Squeak are people we have ever met before or heard of .
The rest just came out of the woodwork , and a lot of them were not Americans .
That was an extremely pleasant development .
I think we expected something from putting it out on the Internet early , but we certainly did n't expect what we got , which is maybe a factor - of - ten more support and help .
And , boy , it has allowed us to make many more releases of the stuff we are doing because there are many more people with very different interests from ours and they tend to find bugs faster than we do .
So it 's all been very good .
And the other thing is if you do objects right , and you have an Internet , then you can have many different object systems proliferating .
You do n't have to standardize them .
In the same way , the Internet does n't need any particular standardization of operating systems or hardware ; you just need to decide to do TCP / IP , which is a very , very low - level messaging protocol .
The same applies to objects .
Even today you can standardize on something like HTTP , which is really a low - level messaging protocol but it's one that 's there , and so in theory any object in a decent object - oriented system can talk to any object from any other object - oriented system right now .
That is going to lead to very good things because it has two principles that have a way of allowing very open and unexpected proliferation and change but also allowing the results of those things to be able to communicate in various fashions with stuff that 's already around .
ER : What is the future for programming as a profession ?
When you think of the top basketball player or the top movie stars , you come to the conclusion they suck a lot of air out of the environment , in the sense that you can only have so many people playing at that level , and everyone else just watches from the seats .
KAY : But science is different .
Newton did n't suck the air out of anything .
He allowed hundreds of thousands of people who could n't do what he did to be scientists because he invented new frameworks like calculus for helping people who were n't as smart as he to be able to think in the same range .
I think that because there is so little of what you call real engineering component in software right now , the best way of doing almost anything is to say , well , it is much more art than skill right now , or it 's much more art than practice right now .
So you are better off to get artists on critical projects .
But that is not going to stay the same , because if you look at how science actually works , as ( Alfred North ) Whitehead pointed out about science , the whole point of it is to be able to allow thousands and thousands of people to participate .
So the whole point of the process is that nobody knows how to transmit to another person how to be as creative as Newton , but we found out how to transmit most of Newton 's creations to other people so they can use them .
That 's what 's cool .
ER :
So you think that programming will flourish as a discipline into the distant future ?
KAY : Oh , yes , absolutely .
The difference between a person who invents a new kind of argument , like Thomas Hobbes , and the people who can argue using that kind of argument , is the important distinction here .
Programming is a form of arguing .
What does n't exist are really powerful general forms of arguing with computers right now .
So we have to have special orders coming in on special cases and then think up ways to do it .
Some of these are generalizable and eventually you will get an actual engineering discipline .
Somebody recently asked me what I am and I answered along the following lines : there is a discipline called mathematics , one called science , and one called engineering , and if those are put in a Venn diagram the intersection of the three is modern - day technology .
Engineering was around a lot longer than science , but there is very little engineering that is done today that is not hooked into scientific investigation and scientific results .
And math is the lingua franca for both of these disciplines .
I would say that , temperamentally , I am basically an idealist , which makes me pretty much of a mathematician .
Scientists tend to be realists , and engineers pragmatists .
I am much more of an idealist than a realist or a pragmatist .
In a way , when I think of myself , I think of myself as a scientist more than a mathematician or an engineer , but when I look at what I have done it has been mostly math and engineering and very little actual science .
So these are just three ways of dealing with those things .
ER :
It is interesting to note that you are frequently found talking about your numerous interests other than mathematics , science and engineering .
You talk quite naturally and knowledgeably about music , about The Federalist Papers , and about history , politics and many other things that do n't seem to be in that Venn diagram .
KAY : Well , they are for me .
If you think of the larger thing having to do with art , then that is the other one , which is the more complicated one .
Because I think people who are basically artistic have a kind of romantic response to just being in the world .
ER : But where does art fit in your Venn diagram ?
You have three circles : math , science and technology .
Is art in there ?
KAY : It is for me .
Basically my whole approach to math is one that 's like what most people call art .
ER : But most people would n't think that .
KAY : Well , that 's because they do n't know math .
The music I like best , composed between 1600 and 1850 or let 's say 1900 , is actually music that tried in various ways to have an underlying mathematical approach .
It 's usually called tonal harmony , but in fact what that is , is a scheme that in many , many ways is very much like what you put in geometry but it 's just not done with triangles .
Any musician who is also a mathematician would know what I 'm talking about right away because tonal harmony was an invention and it was a way of simplifying .
Babylonians knew that some triangles obeyed Pythagoras 's Law because they could measure them , and some of them probably suspected that all triangles would obey A - squared plus B - squared = C - squared .
But the Greeks were the ones who found out how to show that .
Then what they did was show that for that phenomenon there is only one right triangle .
So what the Greeks were about was making the many into one .
Almost everything about tonal harmony in music has that .
And then what is delightful about the kind of music that I like , is that it did n't throw out the baby with the bathwater , did n't throw out the idea of melody , which stems from a completely different source and does n't have a particular Newtonian - type theory about it like tonal harmony does .
[ Composer Henry ]
Purcell even wrote a great piece called something like " The Dispute Between Melody and Harmony , " or " The Tension Between Melody and Harmony . "
That 's what these guys were always working on , always thinking about -- how these two systems played out when you combined them simultaneously .
And the other thing I think is really important is that the Greeks , and I think all the way up into the Middle Ages , the 1600s , used precisely the same term for math and music .
Because to them they were the same thing .
And they certainly are to me .
ER : You talked a moment ago about programming as a form of argument .
How does it rate as a form of creativity ?
KAY : Well , first , it 's important to realize that creativity is not always the solution ; sometimes it 's the problem .
For example , one problem with creativity is that if you are a subsistence society , which humans have been for 80,000 years pretty much , then being too creative could mean disaster .
You see , basically , you learn by failing , and if you are a subsistence society you can't afford to fail because you are too close to the edge of going away .
So there is a lot built into our genes and built into our culture and maybe a biological imperative for kids to learn the common sense of the culture early and commit to it in a conservative way , and this results in this dulling of children that everybody has noticed .
Then you take an exception such as Michelangelo ( and these exceptions are relatively similar to each other in that they have this odd facility of acting really nuts for some periods of time , like imagining carving something incredible out of a block of stone or painting something incredible on a vault - shaped ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ) .
But what Michelangelo could also do , in addition to imagining things , was lie on his back for four years and paint the damn thing .
Most successful artists and successful scientists that I know of are able to be totally crazy in a controllable way .
And especially when faced with the new , when faced with something where all their skills break down , a lot of people really do go nuts , start reacting like nuts .
I think teaching creativity , to the extent that it can be taught , is to try and teach people how to be able to control this .
Kids can do this without being insane when they are five .
And then I think what happens is that society , because of its subsistence - society problem , overcorrects on the kids .
And so most of them are just taught to be dull and they do n't have any of these resources .
Or they go nuts .
They become total right - brainers .
ER : You 've been thinking mostly of science and art so far .
Let 's talk about organizations .
Is there such a thing as a creative organization ?
KAY : Creative organizations -- at least the ones I have been in -- were like science in that they have first - level anarchy and second - level controls .
And that is another problem most people have , is that they try and do all of their structuring of the systems they are in at single levels .
But the Constitution is a perfect example of first - level anarchy and second - level controls
And science is too .
Science absolutely can't allow dogma -- that 's anarchy -- so you have to allow scientists to think and explore and come up with any theory .
And then for this thing to work you have to have the second level of stuff which says , okay , now let 's debug these ideas .
So I would say a very large number of people do n't understand how science works .
ER : How would you teach them ?
What would you do with the curriculum ?
KAY :
The first thing to do is do what [ Maria ] Montessori thought we should do , which is to make sure that the common sense of the child is 20th - century common sense rather than 11th - century common sense .
You just do n't find that in most schools .
Because most schools do n't even have the idea that they should be shaping the child 's common sense .
Most schools think from first grade on they should be teaching kids versions of adult knowledge .
Montessori understood what you are really doing for small kids is you are really trying to teach them a new kind of culture .
So that 's one thing .
And another is to be very careful about how you teach children self - discipline .
One way of doing that is to get the kids involved in artistic projects in which the discipline flows out of the quality levels that you hope to achieve .
Visual three - dimensional , acoustic arts are the ones that work .
A game like football is another way that works : it requires a good amount of discipline because it's a team sport , but on the other hand the opposition team is never really doing what you think , and so a really good athlete is one who is not a robot .
ER : How do you go from there and from Montessori into , let 's say , the college years ?
What would you do beyond high school ?
KAY : Well , this is a cliché , but I loved kindergarten and I loved graduate school but the 16 years in - between were problematic .
A good graduate school is n't anything like most college or high school or middle school or elementary school experiences .
And you have to ask why are those 16 years in between the way that they are ?
ER : Do you have an answer to that question ?
KAY : Well , I do n't have anything that would make a person feel optimistic .
Because you have to think of what are the social reasons and uses for education and these range very widely .
In Europe , they tend to use education to sort people , not so much to teach them .
And over here some of the Horace Mann initiatives were to build people who could work in a non-agrarian world , not just be citizens .
The other problem is that it 's very difficult to set up any kind of organization larger than N that does n't fall back on our genetics for doing things in groups .
Again , the wonder of the world is the American Constitution .
But you would have to travel long and far in this country to find a company that 's set up like the American government .
Companies are set up like monarchies or like single - party totalitarianism .
There is no hint whatsoever that anything has been learned .
The anthropology of most companies is hunting and gathering , not agriculture .
So all of those things are just people recapitulating forms that are partly in their genetics .
And the thing about civilization is that it's a set of inventions , most of which are at odds with our genes , not in accord with our genes .
Almost everything that we think of as being a civilized idea is not something that we are born with .
Civilized ideas are hard to come about and they are hard to learn .
Even something as simple as equal opportunity and equal rights is something that is very hard for people in each new generation to actually understand and make happen .
So there is not a strong set of what this new common sense should be .
You find constant recapitulation into older forms , just like if you go to South Central L.A. , it 's almost an anarchy as far as how kids are brought up .
You find something that 's almost exactly like a traditional society 50,000 years ago .
People are occupying territory and all that stuff .
I think the anthropology of this is pretty clear and the fabric has to be maintained to have civilization .
It basically can be made dynamically stable by people constantly tending to it .
It 's not something that 's statically stable , because our nervous systems are constantly trying to just deal with underlying wants rather than what we actually need .

When Shirley Hale ’s husband dumped her for a younger woman and moved to the Czech Republic , Hale did n’t get mad .
She got a new house .
After selling the family home in 2002 , she bought a house in the suburbs of this old industrial city in northern England and took out a mortgage to fix it up .
By last year , though , Hale had fallen behind on the payments on her “ gorgeous little place ” and was looking at foreclosure -- until a sales agent for a mortgage “ rescue ” company stopped in .
Hale signed over her house for $ 50,000 less than what it was worth .
In return , she says , she was told she could live in it as long as she wanted if she paid the company $ 600 a month .
Six months later ,
Hale learned her home had been sold and the mortgage transferred to one of Britain ’s major sub - prime lenders .
Hale had 28 days to get out .
“ I do n’t even know who owns it now , ” Hale , 72 , said wistfully in an interview in the tiny public - housing apartment she lives in now .
“ It ’s empty still .
. . .
The garden shed has been stolen , all my built - in kitchen has been smashed to pieces , the wallpaper ’s been ripped off .
. . .
They could have let me stay . ”

The American sub - prime mortgage crisis has received attention worldwide , and European officials have been quick to blame lax U.S. oversight of lenders for the international credit crunch that has crippled banks and sent shock waves through the financial markets .
But Europe has its own burgeoning mortgage meltdown -- in Britain .
After years of watching house prices soar even faster than those in America -- modest three - bedroom tract houses in the London suburbs were going for $ 2.2 million at one point -- Britons are now weathering a sharp rise in mortgage defaults .
Moreover , many debt - laden homeowners have no means to salvage their properties because favorable loans are suddenly harder to get .
Desperate consumers are increasingly turning to costly and confusing financial rescue plans that often end , later if not sooner , in the loss of their homes .
Advertisement
The Financial Services Authority , which regulates banking in Britain , warned last month that 1.4 million mortgage holders will face interest - rate resets on their loans this year , with payment hikes of up to $ 420 a month .
Repossessions -- the British term for foreclosures -- jumped 21 % last year , with filings against more than 27,000 homes , according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders .
“ There is potentially a huge number of people who may be in difficulties , ” said Adam Sampson , director of Shelter , a nonprofit group that counsels homeowners seeking to avoid losing their houses to debt .
“ So many of the people we see are husbands and wives who have borrowed against both their incomes .
. . .
A substantial number have never had to verify their income to their lender . ”
Because many borrowers have stretched themselves to the limit , Sampson added , seemingly minor economic changes such as less overtime or smaller bonuses might wreak havoc .
“ All of those things are able to tip them over , ” he said .
Advertisement
And while few borrowers here are “ underwater ” on their loans -- meaning they owe more than their home is worth -- the trend in housing prices is n’t helpful .
Forecasters expect a largely flat market this year , with some naysayers predicting a drop of up to 5 % .

British sub- prime
The Bank of England ’s decision this month to drop its key interest rate a quarter - point to 5.25 % , following a similar reduction in December , was hailed as a boon to homeowners facing rate resets .
But many mortgage lenders , operating on thin margins in a competitive market and having trouble accessing cash in the tight credit market , have elected not to pass on the rate reduction .
Advertisement
As in the U.S. , buyers with bad credit or low incomes are often steered into the sub - prime market , where the prevailing interest rate is around 9.5 % .
Sub - prime loans account for more than 6 % of all the mortgages in Britain .
According to Standard & Poor ’s , 23 % of borrowers with such loans were behind on their payments in 2006 , up 200 % from the previous year .
A report this month by the Intermediary Mortgages Lenders Assn. indicated that although traditional prime lending still predominates , 30 % of all home loans are in the category that includes sub - prime , made to buyers who offer no proof of income or to investors buying property to rent .
The FSA said the growing number of loans issued at high rates , over longer periods and for interest only , is “ cause for concern . ”
Advertisement
Still , sub - prime loans in Britain have features that may insulate the market somewhat .
For one thing , British law requires that borrowers pass a “ stress test ” to prove they can handle not only the low introductory rates but also the higher rates they could face when the obligation resets .
And only about 15 % of British sub - prime mortgages offer a discounted initial rate .
According to the British Council of Mortgage Lenders , British sub - primes also tend not to allow negative amortization , which lets borrowers make such low payments that their loan balances actually increase over time .
Moreover , British lenders have generally avoided “ risk layering , ” such as offering a high loan - to - value mortgage to people with bad credit histories .
Advertisement
And , unlike in the U.S. , where mortgages are often made by one company , then sold to another -- a practice that can encourage risky lending because the firm that makes the loan does n’t keep it -- British lenders largely hold on to mortgages they originate .
“ In the U.K. , the sub - prime market is smaller , and it is less inherently prone to problems , ” said Bernard Clarke , spokesman for the council .
“ But clearly , when you ’re dealing with mortgages to people who have credit - impaired histories , there is almost by definition a greater likelihood of problems in that tranche of mortgages .
And that is going to be compounded by the credit crunch . ”
Troubled borrowers can fall under the spell of the mortgage rescuers .
Consumer groups say these homeowners have sometimes been browbeaten into exaggerating their incomes , lured into “ rent back ” schemes like the one Hale got into with no guarantee of long - term tenancy , assessed thousands of dollars in late payments and finally foreclosed on rapidly and forcefully when they could n’t pay the new loans .

Marked for default
Dawn Newbury , a mother of three in Cardiff , Wales , saw her payments rise from $ 1,510 a month to nearly $ 2,000 when her sub - prime loan ’s interest rate reset .
The lender immediately sought repossession when she fell behind .
Newbury won a reprieve in court , but was hauled back when her payment fell $ 40 short of the minimum .
“ The bailiff was out there , they were drilling through the locks in the back door , ” said Newbury , 45 .
“ My mother was standing there with her back to the door .
If they ’d have kept going , they ’d have drilled right through her . ”
Newbury found another sub - prime lender who paid off the first .
She is now on an interest - only loan at $ 1,500 a month , which will soon go up to $ 1,910 .
Advertisement
“ And then the whole cycle ’s going to start all over again , ” she said .
“ They ’re vultures , I ’m telling you .
They give you the money because they know you ’re going to default , and they know they ’ve got a lovely house coming out of it . ”
British lenders say they welcome new codes of practice to keep out unscrupulous brokers but insist most lending occurs on fair terms in a market that still allows the vast majority of buyers to make payments and earn equity .
The recent alarms “ do little to recognize the important role the sub - prime market plays in helping those with poor or damaged credit histories to enter or reenter the mortgage market , ” the mortgage intermediaries association said .
Still , lenders ’ rush to foreclose may be easing somewhat , Sampson said .
Many learned in the British housing crisis of the 1990s that flooding the market with cheap foreclosures damps prices , leaving lenders with a portfolio of unpaid loans and assets declining in value .

“ I think many lenders in the U.K. have learned that the most profitable way of dealing with mortgage arrears is to try to keep the borrower in the house , ” he said .
“ That way , you have the greatest chance of recovering your debt . ”

le due societa ' : « si è trattato di una tragica fatalita ' »
Morto un tifoso del Parma
Rinviata la partita con la Juventus
Il giovane investito da un bus di ultrà in un ' area di servizio dell ' A21 .
L'autista indagato per omicidio colposo
Rilievi della scientifica sul luogo dell ' incidente ( Elias ) MILANO - Un tifoso del Parma , Matteo Bagnaresi di 27 anni , è stato travolto e ucciso nell ' area di servizio Crocetta Nord , al chilometro 48 dell ' A21 Piacenza - Torino , da un pullman di tifosi della Juventus .
Il mezzo era vuoto e l'autista stava facendo manovra quando è avvenuto l'incidente .
Prima dell ' incidente , nell ' area di servizio ci sarebbero state schermaglie tra le due tifoserie .
Bagnaresi , che viveva a Parma , è morto sul colpo .
L'autista è stato interrogato ed è indagato per omicidio colposo , ma il magistrato non ha disposto nei suoi confronti l'arresto .
Ha ribadito agli investigatori di non essersi accorto di nulla e di essersi fermato in autostrada , a poca distanza dall ' area di servizio dove è avvenuto l'incidente , perché alcuni dei tifosi sul bus gli hanno segnalato che era successo qualcosa .
Bagnaresi è stato colpito vicino alle colonnine di rifornimento di carburanti .
LA VITTIMA - Laureato , lavorava per una cooperativa e viveva nella città emiliana con i genitori .
Faceva parte del direttivo dei ' Boys ' , il gruppo ultrà che domina la Curva Nord allo stadio Tardini , e aveva da poco riottenuto il diritto di andare allo stadio : per gli incidenti del 6 gennaio 2005 tra ultrà parmigiani e bianconeri durante Parma - Juventus era stato raggiunto da un Daspo , il divieto a partecipare a manifestazioni sportive , della durata di 3 anni .
Militante della sinistra antagonista , era attivo nell ' ambito dei centri sociali di Parma che fanno riferimento al Mariano Lupo .
SOLO SFOTTÒ MA NON SCONTRI - Nell ' area di servizio Crocetta Nord ci sarebbero stati degli " sfottò " , non veri e propri scontri , tra tifosi della Juve e del Parma .
La ricostruzione della polizia stradale di Alessandria
Ovest ha chiarito che nell ’ area di servizio si erano incontrati quattro pullman di tifosi del Parma e uno di tifosi juventini .
I ragazzi sono scesi dai mezzi e si sono scambiati frasi ingiuriose e sfottò , ma nessuno è venuto alle mani - precisa la stradale - e non è stato tirato fuori o rinvenuto alcun tipo di arma .
L’autista del pullman dei tifosi juventini , proprio per evitare che dalle parole si passasse a tafferugli e scontri fisici , avrebbe quindi deciso di ripartire e , nel fare manovra , non si sarebbe accorto del tifoso del Parma , finito sotto le ruote .
Diversa la versione fornita da un tifoso juventino ai microfoni di Mediaset : « Stavamo scappando , ci volevano ammazzare , avevano spranghe e oggetti contundenti » .
UN AMICO DELLA VITTIMA - Un tifoso del Parma ha confermato la versione riferita dall ' autista del pullman alla polizia stradale .
« Matteo era vicino alle ruote del bus - ha raccontato - e in retromarcia il mezzo lo ha travolto , poi è ripartito .
L'autista non lo ha visto e non si è accorto di quello che era successo .
Qualcuno di noi si è invece accorto subito dell ' investimento e ha urlato all ' autista di fermarsi , ma lui , forse impaurito e pensando che fossero minacce , ha proseguito » .
Secondo alcune testimonianze di tifosi parmigiani , appena il pullman juventino era giunto nell ' area di servizio Crocetta Nord c'era stato qualche sfottò da parte dei tifosi " rivali " , e per questo l'autista avrebbe deciso di riprendere la marcia , con l'intenzione forse di fermarsi poi in un successivo grill .
ANNULLATA LA PARTITA - La partita di serie A Juventus - Parma che si sarebbe dovuta giocare domenhica alle 15 all ’Olimpico è stata annullata in segno di lutto .
Lo stadio di Torino si è svuotato , in silenzio , appena il pubblico ha avuto dallo speaker la notizia del rinvio .
Sono rimasti soltanto , sul terreno di gioco , i ragazzini delle scuole calcio che avrebbero dovuto assistere a una premiazione di Alessandro Del Piero .
La notizia del rinvio di Juventus - Parma è stata confermata dal club bianconero .
« Juventus e Parma , con il benestare delle autorità competenti hanno deciso di comune accordo di rinviare la partita in segno di lutto » ha spiegato un portavoce .
« Pur trattandosi di una tragica fatalità - affermano Juventus e Parma - le società hanno ritenuto che non ci fossero le condizioni per mandare in campo le squadre » .
Sui campi di calcio di Serie A è stato osservato prima delle partite un minuto di raccoglimento in memoria di Bagnaresi .
La decisione è stata presa dalla Federcalcio d'intesa con la Lega professionisti .
POSSIBILE RECUPERO IL 16 APRILE - È attesa per luned ì la decisione della Lega Calcio in merito alla data del recupero di Juventus - Parma .
La Lega Calcio al momento non può confermare le indiscrezioni che fisserebbero il recupero del match a mercoled ì 16 aprile .
La lega dovrebbe delineare una serie di opzioni da valutare appunto lunedì .
TRAGICA COINCIDENZA -
La morte del tifoso del Parma è avvenuta nella stessa giornata di campionato in cui , nel girone di andata , fu ucciso nell ' area di servizio Badia al Pino , il tifoso della Lazio Gabriele Sandri .
Why does it often seem that men enjoy playing video games more than women ?
Perhaps because they do .
A new study finds that when men play the games , a part of the brain involved in feelings of reward and addiction becomes much more activated than it does in women .
This may explain why men are more likely to report feeling addicted to video games than women are , the researchers say in an online article in The Journal of Psychiatric Research .
The lead author is Fumiko Hoeft of the Stanford University School of Medicine .
Image Credit ... Stuart Goldenberg
For the study , the researchers took a group of 22 young volunteers  half men , half women  and had them play a game as an M.R.I. machine looked at what was happening in their brains .
The study found that in the men , there was much more activity in the mesocorticolimbic system .
New research published in the journal Nature ( 19 July ) has proved the single origin of humans theory by combining studies of global genetic variations in humans with skull measurements across the world .
The research , at the University of Cambridge and funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , represents a final blow for supporters of a multiple origins of humans theory .
Competing theories on the origins of anatomically modern humans claim that either humans originated from a single point in Africa and migrated across the world , or different populations independently evolved from homo erectus to home sapiens in different areas .
The Cambridge researchers studied genetic diversity of human populations around the world and measurements of over 6,000 skulls from across the globe in academic collections .
Their research knocks down one of the last arguments in favour of multiple origins .
The new findings show that a loss in genetic diversity the further a population is from Africa is mirrored by a loss in variation in physical attributes .
Lead researcher , Dr Andrea Manica from the University 's Department of Zoology , explained : " The origin of anatomically modern humans has been the focus of much heated debate .
Our genetic research shows the further modern humans have migrated from Africa the more genetic diversity has been lost within a population .
" However , some have used skull data to argue that modern humans originated in multiple spots around the world .
We have combined our genetic data with new measurements of a large sample of skulls to show definitively that modern humans originated from a single area in Sub- saharan Africa . "
The research team found that genetic diversity decreased in populations the further away from Africa they were - a result of ' bottlenecks ' or events that temporarily reduced populations during human migration .
They then studied an exceptionally large sample of human skulls .
Taking a set of measurements across all the skulls the team showed that not only was variation highest amongst the sample from south eastern Africa but that it did decrease at the same rate as the genetic data the further the skull was away from Africa .
To ensure the validity of their single origin evidence the researchers attempted to use their data to find non-African origins for modern humans .
Research Dr Francois Balloux explains : " To test the alternative theory for the origin of modern humans we tried to find an additional , non-African origin .
We found this just did not work .
Our findings show that humans originated in a single area in Sub- Saharan Africa . "

My years before school and for my first few years were filled with Sesame Street .
I ’d either watch it in the morning or evening .
I have so many memories of the show from growing up .
From Mr. Hooper and his store , to Bert and Ernie teaching us how to share , to Big Bird looking at life as a young , but BIG Bird , everyday you got one hour of quality and educational television .
But one of the segments on that show I looked forward to .
It did n’t come on every day , so when it did come on , it was special !
The Sesame Street Pinball Song !
Sung by The Pointer Sisters , this classic debuted in 1976 .
It is , as you just saw , a pinball going around to different numbers while dodging different obstacles .
It ’s kind of like a magical pinball adventure .
The ball goes into castles , and over moats , around trees and over hills .
There is nothing real special about it .
The music is a quasi 70s disco-ish sound , and the animation is very 70s , but it ’s the retro memories that make this great today .
When ever I go to YouTube and play this clip , or any other like it , I ’m transported back to a kid , and I can remember the excitement that this clip use to bring me when it did air .
Unfortunately , this did n’t air every episode , or maybe I did n’t catch every episode , or at least not in whole , but from what I remember , it was a real treat when this came on .
There were 11 segments for this , and oddly enough , there was never one made for # 1 .
But here is a list , from Wikipedia , of the 11 segments :
# 2 : A Day at the Carnival ( amusement park )
( amusement park ) # 3 : Circus Capers
# 4 : FORE ! ( golf course )
( golf course ) # 5 : The Only Way To Travel ( modes of transportation )
( modes of transportation ) # 6 : Down on the Farm
# 7 : World Tour ( famous world landmarks )
( famous world landmarks ) # 8 : Forest Follies
# 9 : Play Ball ! ( baseball )
( baseball ) # 10 : Medieval Times ( fantasy middle ages )
( fantasy middle ages ) # 11 : Wild Things ( jungle )
( jungle ) # 12 : Sightseeing , USA
I hope you enjoy this trip down memory lane , at least for those of you who were born long enough ago to have see this on Sesame Street .
Let me know what you think of the Sesame Street Pinball Segment ; did you like it or not ?
Mozilla developer ‘ Pavlov ’ wrote up some extensive details on memory use in Firefox 3 .
I highly recommend that you check it out .
I borrowed some of his data and created another view of the results .
For example , here ’s the results from Windows Vista of a number of browsers :
Note that both Safari 3 and IE 8 crashed during the test ( which was a page runner which automatically opened and closed groups of web pages ) so accurate numbers were n’t able to be achieved for them .
Some preliminary numbers show Safari 3 on a similar path to IE 7 ( Stuart mentioned that IE 8 showed a similar path , as well ) .
It ’s great to see the massively - improved memory use of Firefox 3 .
It far excels anything that we offered , previously , and seems to best all other browsers on the platform .
Now , obviously , Windows Vista is n’t the only platform available .
I , personally , use OS X and am interested to see the memory numbers there as well .
One portion of Stuart ’s blog post that I found to be particularly interesting was the discussion of measuring cross- platform browser memory use – and how difficult it can be .
Here ’s how he explains it :
The short summary is Windows Vista ( Commit Size ) and Linux ( RSS ) provide pretty accurate memory measurement numbers while Windows XP and MacOS X do not .
…
On Mac ,
If you look at Activity Monitor it will look like weâ€ ™re using more memory than we actually are .
Mac OS
X has a similar , but different , problem to Windows XP .
After extensive testing and confirmation from Apple employees we realized that there was no way for an allocator to give unused pages of memory back while keeping the address range reserved ..
( You can unmap them and remap them , but that causes some race conditions and isnâ€™t as performant . )
There are APIs that claim to do it ( both madvise ( ) and msync ( ) ) but they donâ€™t actually do anything .
It does appear that pages mapped in that havenâ€™t been written to wonâ€™t be accounted for in memory stats , but youâ€™ve written to them theyâ€™re going to show as taking up space until you unmap them .
Since allocators will reuse space , you generally wonâ€™t have that many pages mapped in that havenâ€™t been written to .
Our application can and will reuse the free pages , so you should see Firefox hit a peak number and generally not grow a lot higher than that .
I think it ’s great to see these numbers come in .
In many ways Firefox 3 is going to be a very different browser from its previous instantiations .
I ’ve , personally , been using it as my primary browser for a while now and have enjoyed the increased performance .
It really does feel – and really even look – like a whole new browser .
If you ’d like to try Firefox 3 , especially without disturbing your current setup , it ’s really easy – and I ’ve even written up instructions to help you out .
WASHINGTON 
When an election campaign coincides with both a crisis on Wall Street and soaring home foreclosures across the country , the traditional ideological battles over “ more government ” or “ less government ” become blurred .
Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , the Democratic candidates for president , claim to have proposed a more activist role for government than either President Bush or the likely Republican presidential nominee , Senator John McCain , and the Democratic rhetoric makes the contrast appear even sharper .
But while their philosophies might seem starkly different , in reality both parties have come to the conclusion that major government involvement is needed to rescue the financial and housing markets .
The ideological clashes are less about whether the government should intervene in the economy , and more about whom it should try to rescue .
Germany Takes on the Neo - Nazis If We Can't Ban 'em , Let 's Bankrupt 'em
Germany 's interior ministers have faced frustrating setbacks fighting the far - right in court .
A new tactic under consideration involves hitting organizations that support the party where it really hurts -- in the wallet .
It is noon on a winter day .
Bhikkhu Tissa has been a guest for a mid-day meal in the home of a married couple , Leona and Ernest , and now sits with them in the family room , sipping a cup of tea .
The windows of the room look out on a snowy landscape .
A fire leaps and crackles in the fireplace .
LEONA : Was everything all right , Bhikkhu Tissa ?
BHIKKHU TISSA : Just fine , thank you .
LEONA : Of course , you know I 'm referring to the food , not the state of the universe !
BHIKKHU : Yes , I thought as much .
It was delicious .
LEONA : The universe is quite another question , right ?
ERNEST : I 've got to apologize for my wife , venerable sir .
She never stops philosophizing !
LEONA : Ernest , my dear husband , I am a woman made for grand ideas !
ERNEST : How well I know .
Are you going to bombard this venerable monk with impossible questions ?
LEONA ( Laughing ) : Oh , I think he can take care of himself .
Anyway , Ernest , you were the one who invited him .
You must have something on that oh - so - serious mind of yours .
ERNEST : Well , I did think it might be useful to have a private little discussion about matters of substance .
LEONA : Do you hear that , Venerable ?
My husband talks like an office memo .
Why then do I love him ?
BHIKKHU ( Smiling over his teacup ) : Wise men refrain from trying to figure out love .
ERNEST : As you know , I 've been getting interested in Buddhism over the last year , and sometimes it seems like it raises more questions than it answers !
BHIKKHU : Oh yes , that often happens at first .
I think it 's a good sign .
If Buddhism is to have a real effect on somebody it must challenge them , make them think of a hundred problems and puzzles they never considered before .
The average person all too often takes things for granted , has a careless , habitual way of looking at the world , and idly believes in unexamined concepts .
But Buddhism kicks the props entirely out from under such habits and reveals many unanswered questions which have been there all along .
LEONA : Are you referring to big stuff like the meaning of life , and so on ?
BHIKKHU : No , just basic laws and relationships that we need to grasp little by little until we can tackle the bigger questions .
Sometimes simple intellectual curiosity can start this process .
Sometimes it's a single provocative incident .
ERNEST : That 's sort of what happened to me — an incident .
I 've been studying Buddhism for a while , maybe with a little more interest than Leona here ...
LEONA : There he goes , bragging already .
EARNEST : ... and then just recently a question arose that has no end of implications .
It has to do with a job offer .
LEONA : Oh , you 're going into this , are you ?
Venerable Tissa , we 've talked this over fifty times and I think he 's crazy — dear , but crazy .
Well , Ernest , tell our guest .
Maybe he 'll straighten you out .
ERNEST : My field is chemistry , Bhikkhu Tissa , and I 've been in and out of academia and private industry over the years .
At the moment I 've got a teaching position at the college that I like pretty well , though it does n't pay a lot .
Recently I got a very attractive job offer from the research division of a local chemical company .
It would mean a sizable increase in salary and a chance to do some creative work in my particular specialty .
Professionally it would be a big step up for me , and , as a matter of fact , I know some of the people there and I think we'd get along fine .
But I can't make up my mind to take the job .
And it 's all because of something you said .
BHIKKHU : What was that ?
ERNEST : You were talking about the Noble Eightfold Path and you mentioned Right Livelihood .
You said one should earn a living without harming others .
Now , does this apply to animals ?
BHIKKHU : Yes , it does .
ERNEST : I thought so .
There 's the problem .
You see , this company has a research laboratory where they test the effects of their chemicals on animals .
I would n't be directly connected with that department , I would n't do any experiments on animals , but still I 'd feel uncomfortably close .
And that bothers me .
BHIKKHU : What do they do to the animals there ?
ERNEST : Toxicity tests , mostly .
That means they poison them — dogs , cats , rabbits , rats , and other animals .
They paint chemicals into the eyes of rabbits and see what concentrations will cause ulcers and blindness .
They force - feed lethal compounds to groups of dogs and see how long it takes for half of them to die .
BHIKKHU : What happens to the other half ?
ERNEST : They might use them again in other tests .
More often they kill them all .
They " sacrifice " them , to use the euphemism .
Sometimes they do autopsies .
LEONA : Ernest , please , you 're making me ill .
ERNEST : I got a brief look at the lab when they were giving me a tour of the company .
Now , I 've known about such labs all my professional life , but I 've never worked in one or really paid too much attention .
But after studying Buddhism a little , I found that it really upset me to see the animals in cages and the instruments and so on .
The guy who was giving me the tour must have noticed because he said , " Do n't worry , your office is far away , you wo n't hear anything . "
" They make noise ? " I said .
And he said , " Oh , not so much " and sort of shrugged .
Since then I literally have n't been able to sleep .
I keep imagining sitting in my office in another part of the building and hearing faint screams coming up through the ventilation ducts or something .
LEONA : This is how he 's been going on , Bhikkhu Tissa .
I tell him he does n't have to have anything to do with animal experiments , so why worry about it ?
ERNEST : Thinking about the suffering of animals , Bhikkhu Tissa , I find my mind wandering out in wider and wider circles , trying to make sense of a world that seems , well , pretty horrible in many respects .
But to begin with , I 'd just like to have your opinion about whether or not I should take this job .
BHIKKHU : I wonder if you would really be satisfied if I said , yes , you should , or no , you should n't .
Sometimes Buddhist teaching has a specific answer to a moral question , sometimes not .
In either case what is important is that the student understand the underlying principles himself so that he does n't just rely on faith in the teacher .
You began your reflections with Right Livelihood , so let 's pick up there .
Right Livelihood means earning a living in a harmless , honest , and inoffensive manner .
The Buddha advised his disciples specifically to refrain from dealing in arms , in living beings , in meat , in intoxicants , and in poisons .
LEONA : You know , that covers a whole lot of occupations , venerable sir !
I mean — making guns , bombs , all kinds of weapons .
And as for living beings and meat , well , you are talking about huge industries there .
And do you mean to say that dealing in all kinds of intoxicants is prohibited — beer , wine , and everything ?
And you could include a host of products under the name of " poisons , " everything from nerve gas to bug spray .
Do you really believe that everybody working in all of these industries is necessarily evil ?
Are they all going to suffer some terrible karma ?
Are they going to hell ?
ERNEST : Hold on , Leona , give Bhikkhu Tissa a chance to answer .
BHIKKHU : The Buddha teaches that for our own well - being and the well - being of others we should avoid these classes of occupations .
Dealing in arms means just what you think — all kinds of weapons and instruments for killing .
Dealing in living beings refers to animals , of course , and it also extends into areas like slavery , or prostitution , or the buying and selling of children or adults in one way or another .
" Meat " refers to the bodies of beings after they are killed .
And poisons are just as you say — all kinds of toxic products designed to kill .
LEONA : Those are immense categories .
BHIKKHU : The categories are wide because the principle is wide : not to engage in occupations which cause suffering , destruction , and death .
Now , you ask whether somebody who works in one of these occupations necessarily suffers misfortune as a result .
LEONA : Yes , what about the perfectly honest owner of a liquor store ?
Or a sporting goods dealer who sells guns to hunters ?
BHIKKHU : Kamma , or karma , means volitional actions by body , speech , or mind .
Kamma produces a result for the doer according to its nature as wholesome , unwholesome , or neutral .
Acts of killing and harming , for instance , will sooner or later bring painful results for the doer .
LEONA : Yes , I understand that .
That 's the practical basis for Buddhist moral precepts .
But if one does n't actually kill or harm or steal , and so on , then it seems that one could be engaged in almost any profession .
BHIKKHU : To sell liquor or guns , assuming one does so honestly , may not in itself bring karmic misfortune .
But with the factor of Right Livelihood the Buddha recognizes the truth that habitual associations strongly influence our thoughts and deeds .
There may be someone , for instance , who works in a slaughterhouse , but whose job is not to kill animals but only to grade meat or operate a conveyor belt .
He may not actually break the precepts or do evil , but this is nevertheless wrong livelihood because his mind is likely to be harmed by the unwholesome atmosphere .
He becomes accustomed to pain and death .
He regards the suffering of living beings as unimportant .
And thus he sinks further into ignorance and becomes easier prey for mental defilements which will definitely cause him sorrow .
The principle is the same for intoxicants or weapons .
Dealing with these , a person becomes indifferent to the delusion and destruction that alcohol and drugs cause , or becomes callous about the killing or maiming of living beings by weapons .
LEONA : But these are popular goods and services .
There will always be somebody to provide them .
BHIKKHU : True , Leona , but it need n't be you .
LEONA : Oh , dear , I can see what you think about Ernest 's job offer !
BHIKKHU : Maybe you are guessing a little too quickly .
Let 's analyze the question further .
Yes , to do painful experiments on animals in one 's work , to wound , poison , or torment them in any way , is certainly a violation of Right Livelihood .
ERNEST : You would condemn such an occupation , then ?
BHIKKHU : Yes .
To inflict pain on living beings — even for the supposed advantage of other living beings — is cruel and short - sighted .
ERNEST : Ah , well !
BHIKKHU : But I would not exactly on that account advise you to reject your job offer .
ERNEST : I do n't understand .
BHIKKHU : I believe you said your job would not involve experimenting on animals , and you would not be directly connected with it .
ERNEST : Strictly speaking , no .
BHIKKHU : Then strictly speaking you would not be violating the principle of Right Livelihood .
According to Buddhism we are karmically responsible only for what we do intentionally and what we order others to do .
Beyond that , it 's up to the individual to decide .
Right Livelihood is a flexible concept that can guide us regarding professions that were unknown in the Buddha 's time .
We have to decide how close we can come to occupations that are definitely unwholesome without becoming contaminated .
Ultimately , almost every profession is somehow related to every other , so we would likely go crazy if we looked for a job that was not distantly , theoretically , harmful to somebody .
Take a big company with many divisions or subsidiaries .
Is somebody in one department responsible for what somebody in another department does ?
Is the typist in New York implicated in the killing of cattle in Texas ?
ERNEST : No , that 's unreasonable , in my opinion .
BHIKKHU : So , it comes down to this : you must be quite sure and satisfied in your own mind that you are not willingly doing any harmful deeds and that you are not encouraging or condoning the ill - treatment of living beings .
ERNEST : Oh , That 's so hard to know ...
LEONA : Well and good , Venerable Tissa .
But do n't we have to balance off harm and benefit ?
I 'm not willing to concede that doing scientific experiments on animals is entirely evil .
Think of the lasting benefits to humanity that come of such experiments .
ERNEST : Uh , Leona , at this lab they 're presently testing oven - cleaner and hair - spray .
LEONA : Oh .
Not the most vital products , I grant you .
ERNEST : And before you go on to cite penicillin or some other wonder drug , I think it 's fair to note that medicines can be developed and tested without recourse to live animal subjects .
We now have sophisticated techniques of computer - modeling and tissue - culture that are accurate and cause no bloodshed .
The fact that animals have been used so much in the past does not prove that discoveries would have been impossible without them , only that that has been the habit , or conditioned reflex , of scientific researchers .
LEONA : Maybe , maybe .
But , Bhikkhu Tissa , I want to get at the philosophical question here .
If some real benefit to humanity can come about through experimenting on animals , even though they suffer , then why not use them ?
Should n't we be concerned with the greater good that will result ?
BHIKKHU : I 'm glad you raise the question of benefit , Leona , because this is where people often go astray when considering Right Livelihood or those troublesome five precepts .
Yes , I agree that we should act for the greater good , but — and here is a question that has sent seekers into the Sangha for centuries — how do we know what the greater good is ?
LEONA : It 's whatever benefits the most people , I guess .
BHIKKHU : Only people ?
What about animals ?
LEONA : Well , people are more important .
BHIKKHU : Indeed ?
To whom ?
LEONA : To people .
Okay , I know it sounds self - serving .
BHIKKHU : Leaving animals out for the moment , suppose some action helps us but harms other people .
How do you evaluate it ?
Where is the greater good ?
LEONA : I guess you just have to choose .
BHIKKHU : On what basis ?
LEONA : Oh , Bhikkhu Tissa , I can see you wo n't be satisfied with anything less than a moral foundation — a religious foundation !
BHIKKHU : Better to say , a foundation on reality .
And the question remains :
How do we know the greater good ?
ERNEST : Through study of the Dhamma , I would guess .
BHIKKHU : Through study and practice of the Dhamma .
The Buddha teaches that we should do certain things and avoid other things , but not on his word alone or the words of our teachers or out of respect for tradition .
We are told to test these teachings in our own minds and in our own practice and then put our faith in the Dhamma as we see its effects .
LEONA : Yes , I will say that is one of the attractive qualities of Buddhism .
BHIKKHU : Let me ask you , what do you think is the ultimate goal of Buddhism ?
LEONA : I know that : to put an end to suffering .
But we can't really call that the greater good , can we ?
We need something more specific .
BHIKKHU : The end of suffering , or Nibbana , is what the entire Dhamma points to .
The Buddha said that just as the great ocean has only one taste , the taste of salt , so the Dhamma has only one taste , the taste of liberation .
In the Buddhist view , every specific goal — to use your word — must be connected to the ultimate goal to be worthwhile .
We have been discussing Right Livelihood .
Now , Right Livelihood is not the ultimate goal but in a sense it recapitulates the whole .
We want to escape the suffering involved with making a living — the disagreements , difficulties , guilt , anxiety , and so on .
To accomplish this we first of all have to place ourselves in conditions where such unpleasantness is least likely to arise ; that is , in those occupations which are peaceful , non-threatening , un - disturbing to the conscience , and compatible with high ideals .
Second , we see to it that we conduct our business or perform our job in a scrupulously fair and honest manner .
This frees us from the suffering inherent in trickery and cheating .
It helps us get along with our co-workers and the public at large and gives us the security of a good reputation .
Finally , by getting our livelihood with energy and effort in a lawful , honest , and harmless manner , we liberate ourselves from self - contempt and the disgust of base money - grubbing , so that one large area of our lives is protected from the worst danger — the danger of our own misguided action .
Thus we enjoy the satisfaction of honorable work .
This is purification of the mind with regard to livelihood .
ERNEST : It seems that the Buddha overlooked nothing that might contribute to happiness .
But still , even if we behave in the manner you suggest , we can't be sure that making a living is going to be free of problems .
LEONA : Yes , everybody — good , evil , and average — complains about his or her job .
Even in the most blameless work there 's some suffering .
BHIKKHU : Very true .
Right Livelihood has a beneficial ripple - effect we cannot see the end of , but certainly it will not eradicate all suffering .
There are , if you remember , seven more factors of the Noble Eightfold Path to develop .
LEONA ( Laughing ) : Ah , I might have known !
This Buddhism is nothing if not methodical !
There 's a sort of — well , a sort of beauty about the way it fits together — like an exquisite watch .
ERNEST : Or like the molecular structure of DNA !
All three laugh .
LEONA : This business of getting through life is certainly complicated .
We started with rabbits in cages and now where are we ?
ERNEST : One eighth of the way to enlightenment ?
LEONA : Oh you !
But let 's get an answer from the venerable monk .
Okay , I see the need for Right Livelihood in a practical sense , but why do we need to link it with anything else ?
Why buy the whole deal , so to speak ?
BHIKKHU : I think , Leona , that you 've forgotten what you just said .
You noted that even a perfectly blameless livelihood will not remove all suffering .
Now , how much more suffering is there in life ?
LEONA : Oh , heaps and heaps !
BHIKKHU : Are you willing to endure it ?
Are you ready for it ?
LEONA : No , not at all , no , categorically no .
BHIKKHU : Do you think you can escape it simply by wishing to ?
Do you think that suffering — disease , old age , loss , grief , and so on — will just pass you by ?
LEONA ( Sighing ) : No , I do n't think that .
BHIKKHU : Well , do you believe you have any power in the matter ?
LEONA : Maybe .
I do n't know .
I 'm not sure .
BHIKKHU : Buddhism teaches that we do have power to reduce and ultimately eliminate suffering .
When somebody makes even a small effort to follow the basic precepts he reaps an immediate benefit in the form of a pacified mind .
Good qualities — peace - bringing qualities — are strengthened and bad qualities are ever so slightly weakened .
When somebody makes a really systematic and conscientious effort to avoid killing , stealing , lying , sexual misconduct , and taking intoxicants , he fortifies himself further .
When he pursues the good by acting out of benevolence and compassion he stores up benefit for the future .
Then when he tries to purify his mind as well as his deeds he is moving positively to the greater good — Nibbana , deliverance , the end of sorrow .
ERNEST : I do n't doubt what you say , venerable sir , but with all due respect , we are lay people living very much in the world , with many responsibilities and burdens .
How can we realistically concern ourselves with getting to Nibbana ?
BHIKKHU : Nibbana is n't a place to get to .
It 's not even a state of mind .
The Buddha called it simply the end of suffering .
This is a goal that should concern everybody regardless of his or her worldly station .
The Noble Eightfold Path is a transcendent way that leads out of the world to the inconceivable bliss of Nibbana , but it is also consistent with an active life in the world along the way .
I mean by this that the Dhamma protects us now , in our daily problems and challenges , and later , in the kind of future our deeds will lead us to .
Some people , when they hear the transcendent promise of the Dhamma , are elated .
Others , like you , perhaps , are a little worried , thinking that they are not ready to ascend any spiritual summits .
Really , there is no cause for worry .
If we apply ourselves to solving immediate problems as the Buddha teaches , then higher goals will simply come into focus in their own time .
We need only remind ourselves that there lies ahead of us a greater good which is timeless , steady , and ultimately accessible .
Simple moral restraint and deeds of charity and the practice of mindfulness in the household life cannot fail to build a foundation for wisdom .
ERNEST : I have an instinct that what you say is true .
That 's why I 'm trying to order my life at least to the extent of giving wisdom a chance to arise .
But I 'm not sure .
Life is often mysterious , like a wandering in the dark .
BHIKKHU : You are right .
Life is very mysterious .
But in the Buddhist system even that mystery is a suitable theme for meditation .
For instance , look out the window here .
From where we sit we can't see the ground , only that blank gray sky and a few snowflakes drifting past .
If we did n't know better we might think those snowflakes just appear spontaneously in our field of view and whirl out of it again into some kind of oblivion , without a reason , uncaused , absurdly appearing and disappearing .
LEONA : That would be just delusion , just ignorance .
BHIKKHU : But because we have some experience , because we have at one time or another stuck our heads out the window , we know that snow falls from the clouds overhead and it piles up in drifts on the ground beneath .
We see where it comes from and where it goes .
It 's the same with the larger questions of life : investigation destroys ignorance .
Somebody might keep moral precepts just out of fear , or tradition , or habit — and there 's nothing really wrong with this , it 's still a help and protection .
But sooner or later most people think , " Why am I really following these rules ?
Where will they lead me ? "
If a monk or somebody tells them the purpose is to get rid of suffering , then , if they 're intelligent , they want to find out for themselves how and why .
LEONA : Exactly , exactly .
BHIKKHU : The Buddha discovered and made known the path to deliverance .
Now , it 's a sorry old world we live in , but that path is still open , friends , it is still open .
ERNEST : Perhaps Leona and I are following it already , even without being fully aware .
But I would hate to think , Bhikkhu Tissa , that all the mystery must go out of life .
BHIKKHU : Ignorance must go , but mystery in the sense I think you mean comes even more alive in the objects of our experience .
Our wonder at the infinite and ineffable is an intuition of Nibbana itself .
Looking here through this plain glass window on emptiness — even though we have no illusions about where those snowflakes come from and where they go , still we find it peaceful and uplifting to gaze out on those random crystals .
ERNEST : Yes , that 's true .
But why should that be ?
Bhikkhu Tissa smiles , says nothing , gazes thoughtfully out the window .
LEONA : Perhaps because — if I might be so bold — because looking out in that dimensionless space we re reminded of our connections to infinite things .
I mean , the flake that bumps against our windowpane here is connected to the clouds and the clouds to the whole atmosphere and the atmosphere to the space beyond , with its matter and energy and vast laws of generation and destruction .
One can't help feeling part of a cosmic drama , so to speak .
ERNEST : Ah , what a philosopher you are , Leona !
LEONA : And what of it ?
I think Venerable Tissa would approve .
That 's what Buddhism teaches , is n't it ?
Investigation ?
BHIKKHU : Yes , and when we investigate we see connections , and when we see connections we are motivated to act in certain ways .
ERNEST : But why act at all ?
Is n't passive contemplation enough ?
BHIKKHU : No .
The mindful observation of the world that the Buddha recommends reveals that intentional deeds have results for the doer .
We are where we are — in fortune or misfortune , peace or trouble — as a result of what we have done in the past .
Where we go in the future depends on what we do now .
LEONA : Are you talking about rebirth ?
Well , that seems to me like a rather weak motivation , since rebirth is not at all apparent to me .
It may very well be true , but I mean to say that I just do n't see it in front of me as a reality the same way I see other facts about mind and matter that Buddhism talks about .
I 've read that sutta you referred to where the Buddha says we should n't accept any teaching until we see for ourselves that it is true .
BHIKKHU : I see you remember the first part of the Kalama Sutta , but do you remember the second part ?
LEONA : The second ?
BHIKKHU : After giving specific examples of wrong reasons for believing a teaching , the Buddha goes on to lead the skeptical Kalamas into the Dhamma .
He asks them whether greed , hate , and delusion are wholesome or unwholesome and whether they lead to suffering or not .
The Kalamas make the obvious answer that they are unwholesome and lead to suffering .
In response to further questions they agree that the absence of these defilements and the positive cultivation of morality lead to blessing and happiness in this life .
If this is so , the Buddha goes on to say , then there are four consolations for whomever is devoted to virtue .
First , if there is a future world and if good and bad deeds have results for the doer , then the virtuous person knows himself safe and can expect a happy situation .
Second , if there is no rebirth and if deeds have no future effect , then he at least lives happily in this world , without worry .
Third , if evil things happen to evildoers , then he , who does no evil , is secure and free from harm .
Fourth , if no evil things happen to evildoers , then he in any event will not meet with evil fortune .
LEONA : That 's well said .
Even a hardened skeptic would have to admire that reasoning .
And if one goes that far one would have to admit that it would be wise to pay more attention to one 's behavior and even set out on a more systematic path of spiritual practice .
ERNEST : Such as the Noble Eightfold Path , Leona ?
LEONA ( Laughing ) :
Why yes , now that you mention it .
We keep coming back to that , do n't we ?
BHIKKHU ( Smiling ) :
Well , we should come back to it .
But I hope you understand that this path is a path of practice and self - development and mindful investigation .
It 's not necessary at the outset to believe in rebirth or other difficult facets of the Dhamma .
We need only bear these teachings in mind and watch as the evidence accumulates in our own experience .
LEONA : That 's fair , that 's certainly fair .
I 'd say a certain amount has accumulated already .
I can see that good and bad deed have effects here in this present life , and if those effects go beyond , say to a future birth , well , I 'm open - minded about the matter .
Tell me this , please .
These connections we were speaking of — do they exist between animals and human beings ?
Can human beings be reborn as animals and vice versa ?
BHIKKHU : We must first note that according to Buddhism there is no self or soul that is literally born again , but rather a chain of causes or a stream of life that springs up now here , now there , according to conditions .
But in ordinary , conventional language we can certainly say that a human being can be reborn as an animal or vice versa .
It all depends on the individual 's kamma , his or her accumulated deeds .
LEONA : Ah , here we have the core of your opposition to cruelty to animals .
We are related to them .
We may even become them .
BHIKKHU : In the Buddhist view all sentient life is related .
The differentiations are temporary , fluctuating , and merely provisional .
Countless living beings go wandering through the endless cycles of samsara , being born high or low , in this world or that , with much suffering or little suffering .
ERNEST : Hence the great Buddhist emphasis on compassion .
Yes , I see .
We are all part of an organic whole .
BHIKKHU : Yes , all sentient life is organic and inter-related , but you should not make the common , romantic mistake of thinking that this " whole " is good .
Samsara is , to one degree or another , suffering throughout , and we beings trapped in samsara are suffering .
ERNEST : All the more reason for compassion , then !
BHIKKHU : Quite so .
And here is a point of Dhamma I want to emphasize especially .
One 's own ultimate welfare and the welfare of other beings are perfectly harmonious .
The life of moral restraint is a life of service to others , because it protects others , soothes them , and inspires them to similar effort .
When we follow the path and strive to purify our minds we set incalculable reverberations going in the hearts of other beings .
Never doubt that the Dhamma conduces to the greater good , even when circumstances seem to push us toward shabby expediency .
The law of kamma sees to it that in the long run deeds work out according to their nature , so we should always take the wide view , always strive for detachment in our reflections , so that we can make wise choices .
ERNEST : If one lives as you suggest , being diligent in practicing Dhamma , could one be reborn in a heavenly world , a world of bliss ?
BHIKKHU : Yes , that 's possible .
ERNEST : Would n't unadulterated bliss be as good as Nibbana ?
Would n't that be the end of suffering ?
BHIKKHU : No , the so - called heavenly worlds are not perfect refuges for two reasons .
First , all worldly bliss is adulterated .
There is suffering in even the highest realms .
It is very fine and attenuated , but it exists .
In the ultimate sense , pleasure itself is suffering , a dis-ease , a kind of irritation to the mind that deprives it of peace .
The second reason is that even though life in those planes is said to be very pleasant and long , it is still impermanent : it is going to come to an end ; it can not be relied upon forever ; hence there is anxiety and uncertainty even for beings living there .
LEONA : A flawed heaven .
How gloomy !
BHIKKHU : Actually , this human world is considered an especially fortunate place to be born .
The beings in higher realms are so drenched with pleasure that they have little inducement to strive for deliverance .
And the animals and beings in the unhappy lower planes are too unintelligent or too miserable to make spiritual progress .
This human world with its puzzling mixture of pleasure and pain often makes people think .
LEONA : Indeed it does that !
BHIKKHU : We really need not speculate about other planes of life when our own provokes us to search for liberation .
And now , of course , though the world is full of misery , still we have the priceless treasure of the Dhamma , which the Buddha discovered and made known to cure suffering and free beings from the wheel of birth and death .
ERNEST : Bhikkhu Tissa , it seems the Dhamma is a very demanding teaching .
BHIKKHU : And we are demanding people , are we not ?
We demand pleasure and security and comfort — and we demand them to be permanent !
This is impossible , of course , because the universe is not under our control .
So we suffer .
And then we demand an end to suffering , preferably through no exertion of our own .
We want an escape from old age and illness and death , but , as the Buddha says , this can not be got by mere wanting , and not to get what one desires , that is suffering , too .
ERNEST : True , true .
We are indeed contrary creatures !
I see the justice of what you say — we have to make an effort if we really want to accomplish anything .
But the question I ask myself is , how much do I want to accomplish ?
BHIKKHU : Nobody can answer that question but you .
ERNEST : Considering my limitations I sometimes wonder if I could n't sort of stop half - way , as it were — just practice basic morality and try to live a modest life and keep out of trouble .
BHIKKHU : The way of Dhamma is a way that goes against the stream of the world and the world 's desires .
If you cease to struggle against the current , do you think you will just remain stationary ?
ERNEST : Well , no , considering the nature of my mind .
LEONA : Going with the flow just wo n't make it , huh ?
BHIKKHU : Going with the flow means succumbing to craving and clinging , which pull us down to suffering .
It is said that the Dhamma protects the Dhamma - farer .
This means that one who resists craving and clinging , who makes an effort against the worldly stream , becomes stronger by that very effort , just as when we exercise a muscle we strengthen it .
By overcoming even small problems with mindfulness and detachment we find ourselves increasingly able — and willing — to surmount spiritual obstacles .
I think that if you try to apply the Dhamma in life you will quickly notice within yourself the growth of confidence .
ERNEST : There 's something in that .
I do feel some confidence — just a little bit !
BHIKKHU : The Buddha said that a follower should examine his teaching in the way that a goldsmith analyzes gold — carefully inspecting , refining , testing it before concluding that it is real .
So if you have undertaken to practice the Dhamma even a little , then please reflect on the result of that practice and see how you feel about it , see whether you feel cheered and inspired to go a little further .
ERNEST : Here we are — Leona and I — offering a meal to a monk and listening to him preach — something I would have thought ridiculous a year ago !
I guess that says something .
LEONA : To me , Bhikkhu Tissa , the Dhamma is appealing because it seems to satisfy both the intellect and the emotions .
I 've never been a religious person , mainly because I could n't believe passionately in the supernatural .
On the other hand , the materialistic philosophies leave me cold , because they have no understanding of the mind and what for lack of a better word I will call the transcendental .
They are earthbound and infinitely depressing .
Then there is the swarm of cults and quasi-religions which are both hysterical and intellectually incoherent .
Whew !
It 's enough to make me an absolute agnostic .
Except ... agnosticism is itself a blind belief !
Now I 've studied the Dhamma a little bit , and while I do n't understand everything , I find it , well , refreshing .
As I said , it fits together intellectually and it gives scope to the desire for transcendence , the impulse to become purer or wiser than we now are .
Just this morning , before you came , I read a passage in one of Ernest 's books that summarized the Dhamma as clear , visible , leading onward — something succinct like that .
BHIKKHU : " Well expounded is the Dhamma by the Exalted One , directly visible , immediately effective , calling one to come and see , leading onward , to be personally realized by the wise . "
LEONA : That 's it .
As clear a statement as I 've heard .
Now , if it can fulfill that promise ...
BHIKKHU : The truths of the Dhamma are for us to examine and confirm .
We have to remove the obstructions to our understanding by practicing morality and training ourselves in the art of concentration .
When the conscience is clear and the mind can hold steady on the objects of attention , then wisdom arises of its own nature .
We do n't create it .
ERNEST : But wisdom is not the end , is it ?
BHIKKHU : No .
Wisdom is the sword we use to cut off defilements , to clear a path for ourselves out of the jungle and into the open air .
ERNEST : Buddhism grants us immense freedom of action , does n't it ?
LEONA : And immense responsibility , it seems .
If all planes of existence are somehow tied to suffering then probably we should use that freedom of action to get freedom ... of being !
Or I might say , if it is possible to escape suffering and gain enlightenment , then if we do n't try , our misery would be really our own fault .
ERNEST : What a predicament .
Bhikkhu Tissa , you were right when you said that Buddhism challenges us .
BHIKKHU : The problem of existence and its solution are both contained within the Four Noble Truths .
The truth of the omnipresence of suffering in samsara and the truth of its arising out of craving point out our plight .
The truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the way to accomplish that point out the escape from this plight .
So you see , there is darkness and light — the darkness of pain and ignorance and confusion , and the light of understanding and deliverance .
Life for the intelligent person should be a journey from dark to light .
ERNEST : But how long and how fast ?
BHIKKHU : As long as it takes and as fast as you wish .
ERNEST : Well , it 's a little frightening , but it 's exhilarating , too .
In time I might actually be able to make sense out of the universe !
Already I feel a certain tension between my miserable old habits of mind and my urge to pursue the Dhamma further .
It is sort of dazzling to think that I can walk down the street like anybody else but still be practicing mindfulness , or still be reflecting on impermanence , suffering , and non-self .
I wonder if I should n't be living in a cave or a jungle !
BHIKKHU : You 'd still be dealing with the same mind in a cave , Ernest .
Better to investigate in your own house — I mean , this very body and mind .
The world is to be found there , and liberation from the world .
Arising and passing away , suffering , and the empty , flickering personality can be seen and examined within .
Wisdom is n't a treasure we can prospect for in the Himalayas ; it appears only when conditions are right for it , when the mind is settled , not distracted .
LEONA : When I read the words of the Buddha I get a feeling of immense wisdom , and yet he does n't answer some questions about the origin of the universe , about what happens to an enlightened person after death , and so on .
Now , I 'm sure he had good reasons for not answering what might be extraneous questions , but still ...
BHIKKHU : Never forget , Leona , that the Buddha was not out to build a reputation for himself , or to be a human computer spewing information , or to dazzle the ignorant with amazing secrets .
He was out to cure suffering .
He was a supreme genius , but he never lost sight of his practical purpose : to teach suffering and the way to the ending of suffering .
He taught what was necessary .
Whatever else he may have known it is useless to speculate about .
Once , when the Buddha was seated in a forest with a company of monks , he took up a handful of leaves from the ground and showed them to the monks .
He asked them which were more numerous , the leaves in his hand or the leaves in the entire forest .
The monks reasonably noted that the leaves in his hand were very few compared to those in the entire forest .
The Buddha then said that those in his hand were as the truths he had revealed to them , and those in the whole forest were as the truths he knew but had not revealed .
LEONA : And why had n't he revealed them ?
BHIKKHU : Because , the Buddha said , they were not useful , they did not lead to dispassion , to tranquility , to higher knowledge , to enlightenment .
Remember , the Buddha had no need to teach at all .
He had attained enlightenment , he was free , he had vanquished suffering .
There was nothing further he needed to do .
Yet he did act , he did exert himself .
Why ?
Simply because of his all - embracing compassion .
He taught his followers everything they needed to know about suffering and how to conquer it themselves .
He held back nothing of value .
Before he died he declared that as a teacher he had never had a " closed fist . "
He gave unstintingly of the Dhamma that pointed to liberation , entrusting it to his followers who have preserved it and honored it and offered it as the supreme refuge for a weary world , even to this very day .
ERNEST : That 's an encouraging thought .
If the Buddha had no personal need to teach anything to anybody yet did teach for the rest of his life , then surely he thought that the teaching would be effective , that his followers , even though they were n't Buddhas , could still attain enlightenment through their own efforts .
BHIKKHU : Yes , indeed .
The Buddha is sometimes called the great physician for the ills of the world .
He does n't cure by magic or laying - on of hands or divine power .
He prescribes for us the medicine of the Dhamma and instructs us in how to use it .
LEONA : But the patients have to be willing , do n't they ?
BHIKKHU : Oh yes .
Some people complain about the emphasis on suffering in Buddhism ; they prefer not to think about it .
They suffer , they know they suffer , but they do n't realize that suffering is a deep and terrible spiritual disease .
Only when they take a close look at their situation do they fell moved to do something about it .
It 's like a man who smells smoke in his house .
If he 's intelligent he investigates and sees that his house is on fire .
Rather than waiting to be burned , he looks around for an escape and makes use of it promptly — he climbs out a window and slides down the drain - pipe .
What the Buddha teaches us first of all is that our house is on fire — on fire with greed , with hate , with delusion , burning with sickness , old age , death , lamentation , despair .
ERNEST : The truth of suffering , in short .
BHIKKHU : And then the Buddha points out the reasons for this suffering and what can be done about it and how there might be ease and relief for us instead of anxiety and pain .
And , more than this , the Buddha shows how our lives may become calmer , wiser , and purer , and how we may in fact achieve what we hardly can imagine : enlightenment , a radiant and unassailable security .
LEONA ( Sighing ) :
It 's a shame we are not living in the time of the Buddha himself .
BHIKKHU : Ah , but we are , Leona .
We are !
The Buddha says that whoever sees the Dhamma sees the Buddha .
And the Dhamma is not only written in books , it is written in the elements of the world as well .
LEONA : What do you mean ?
BHIKKHU : The three characteristics of existence — impermanence , suffering , and non-self — spring up everywhere for the benefit of the diligent meditator .
Look at the flames there in the fireplace , snapping and curling and flickering in front of our eyes .
LEONA : Ah , impermanence , yes , of course .
BHIKKHU : Yes , both an instance and an emblem of the changing nature of reality .
ERNEST : Transience and change .
BHIKKHU : And more than that .
Do n't you see in those wavering sheets of fire and those sputtering little flames something futile and weary ?
They leap up , they fall back , they smolder and fail .
ERNEST : An incompleteness , a restlessness .
You might call it suffering !
BHIKKHU : And within that chemical reaction we call fire , within that shifting light and heat what 's really going on ?
Is the fire one stable thing and the log another ?
Does the wood stay the same while the fire just happens to it ?
LEONA : No , they 're both changing , there 's only change .
The wood is always changing to something else .
You could say it 's not being , it 's only becoming .
Therefore ...
ERNEST : Therefore it 's not a self !
Just non-self .
Well , Bhikkhu Tissa , this is something .
Even my own fireplace can instruct me the Dhamma .
BHIKKHU : And why stop there ?
Out the window there we can see that it 's snowing a little harder .
There !
See that swirl of wind ?
Look at the flakes spinning against the grayness .
What do they suggest to you ?
LEONA : Change .
Impermanence .
And the there 's the sadness of it — I do n't know why , it 's just the wandering , the endless unease .
We could call it suffering , sure .
And as before , in that change , in that process , I do n't see any persisting element .
No self .
Just like the fire .
BHIKKHU : Just like the fire .
And yet the one is blazing hot and the other is icy cold .
Still the same truths are manifest in both .
Do you see the principle I am getting at ?
LEONA : I think I do .
All the world is food for contemplation .
BHIKKHU : And above all , do not neglect your own body and mind .
That 's where craving clings the tightest , that 's where ignorance resides .
LEONA : You are assuming , of course , that I 'll keep investigating the Dhamma .
BHIKKHU : I am assuming it .
LEONA ( Smiling ) :
Well , you 're right , I guess .
Ca n't quit now .
I 'll keep going a little further .
ERNEST : Going toward what , Leona ?
LEONA : Why ...
Let 's call it the greater good , shall we ?
ERNEST : Why not ?
LEONA : It seems it 's possible to live deliberately , and if so , I think one ought to live for the benefit of oneself and others .
ERNEST : And others , yes .
Speaking of that .
Uh , Leona , talking to this venerable monk has made me sure that I do n't want to — I mean , I could n't possibly accept that job at the chemical company .
LEONA : Oh , Ernest .
As for the job ...
ERNEST : No , really , you have to see — I just would n't feel ...
LEONA : Peace , husband of mine !
There is no dispute .
ERNEST : Say what ?
LEONA ( Smiling , laying a hand on his arm ) : Under no circumstances can you accept that job .
You are happy where you are .
You do n't want to be even distantly connected to the suffering of animals .
I understand that now .
I respect it .
Venerable Tissa is skillful , I think , in nudging us in the direction of the Dhamma .
ERNEST : But you were so in favor of the job .
LEONA ( Shrugging ) : Ah , well .
Impermanence !
ERNEST : You 're a remarkable woman , Leona .
LEONA : It depends on who 's doing the remarking !
But enough .
Let 's not weary this tolerant monk any more today , all right ?
Look , Ernest , the snow is coming down harder .
Maybe you had better drive Venerable Tissa home .
ERNEST : You do n't have a " home , " do you , Bhikkhu Tissa ?
Just a monastery .
BHIKKHU : There 's no real home for any of us short of Nibbana .
But yes , perhaps it 's time to go .
ERNEST : Thank you for your time .
BHIKKHU : And thank you for your food .
LEONA : You are the one who 's given real food , Bhikkhu Tissa .
ERNEST : We appreciate your teaching .
BHIKKHU : I 'm glad you do .
But the fire teaches , too .
And the snow .
And your own hearts .
ERNEST : Shall we go , then ?
They rise .
Bhikkhu Tissa , wrapped up in his robes , follows Ernest out the door into the sudden cold and light of the snowy day .
Leona stands on the doorstep and watches them go down to the car .
The wind gusts and the snow falls harder , blurring the landscape and the vanishing figures .
At the car , Bhikkhu Tissa turns , smiles , and waves .
Or does he wave ?
She is not sure .
Maybe he has pointed at the chaos of snowflakes , or the invisible clouds , or the ghostly horizon of the rooftops .
Then the car rolls away .
Leona stands gazing after for a moment .
The world seems huge and full of silence .
Snow — dust blows from the limbs of an oak .
Lynn Edward Harris , born Lynn Elizabeth Harris , 09/13/50 at 6:12 p.m. P.D.T. in the city of Orange , California , USA , south of the Los Angeles County line .
On November 8th , 1973 at age 23 Harris was clinically diagnosed by a team of specialists as possessing a rare , complex , congenital condition known as " True Hermaphroditism " [ Intersex ] with undescended , sub - sized ovotestes i.e. " gonadal mosaicism " found in approximately 1 - in - 25,000 births .
[ Statistic source : New England Journal of Medicine , 01/14/98 . ]
Due to ambiguously - formed genitalia at birth [ stunted penis ; divided scrotum ; and vagina ] , Harris , ( mal ) assigned " female " by both parents and pediatrician , was raised as such and continued living in said social gender role until age 29 ( 1979 ) --- six years after the disclosure of this fixed , irreversible , yet - evolving biological state .
After puberty , minor neurological problems eventually abated .
Sexual development remained at a pubertal level while naturally - occurring virilization of secondary characteristics compounded .
As Harris ' anatomy had developed clearly along non-female lines i.e. no breasts , no milk glands , no child - bearing hips , no menses , sterility ; early beard growth , male vocal chords , male skeletal structure , male musculature , male libido , male genetic patterning , he felt justified to elect to live full - time in the male social gender role beginning February , 1979 .
For the following four years ( 1979 to 1983 ) he lived in a sexual legal limbo , still carrying the original - and - only , valid female I.D. which now appeared both obsolete and fraudulent .
On numerous occasions when asked for proof of identification , he was accused of strangely utilizing a ' counterfeit ' or ' stolen ' I.D. card belonging to some woman .
Desire for a permanent legal remedy to rectify all I.D. , thus making it consistent with his outward persona , had become crucial .
The subject approached the Superior Court , County of Los Angeles , wrote his own petition and pled his own case for 1 ) a change of middle name from " Elizabeth " to " Edward " ; and 2 ) a re-issued birth certificate changing the sex designation from " female " to " male " .
Based upon his unusual , documented medical history , on February 18 , 1983 the Court , realizing the case had merit , granted the two - part request by favorably adjudicating Case # 437625 .
With the judge 's signature , Lynn Elizabeth Harris no longer existed :
She had become a legal non-entity .
Within a 30 - day grace period following the Court proceeding , said change was registered as legally required with the Social Security Administration , the Secretary of State , and the State Registrar of Vital Statistics .
State and public agencies , intended to function as " subservient " to the courts , are obligated to enforce and comply with all rulings as handed down .
In a blatant and unconscionable fashion the Vital Statistics Branch dared to supersede the Superior Court and rejected the simple filing of the matter because -- as was stipulated in their California Health and Safety Code -- ' no plastic surgeon 's affidavit of surgery had accompanied the approved , submitted petition . '
However , within said code , no clause existed which mandated one 's person to ' go under the knife ' in order to obtain " characteristics of the opposite sex " -- whatever they may be .
Since any type of " sex reassignment " surgical procedure to define his ambiguous anatomy had never been his objective at any time , in his petition Harris -- even after having investigated the pros and cons -- disavowed any need for possible risk of mutilation , disfigurement , and / or rejection of foreign implants .
Unequivocally , Lynn Edward Harris had proven to the Court -- but not to the Sacramento bureaucrats who , then , deigned to issue an amended Birth Certificate reading " Lynn Edward Harris " / " Female " -- that Nature had bestowed upon him " characteristics of the opposite sex " from birth .
Harris , denigrated by this mockery of his civil status , was already making preparations to sue the state and / or approach an Appellate Court for enforcement of his case which had seen prior favorable adjudication .
After a four - month delay , the Chief of the Vital Statistics Branch fully recanted and admitted to having mis-handled the filing from the start .
Finally , the preferred middle name combined with , not an amended , but a brand new Certificate of Live Birth with sex designation listed as " male " was formally issued on June 2 , 1983 .
All records of the original female middle name and female birth certificate from 1950 were permanently frozen and sealed for life .
This case , which the Vital Statistics Branch could never define in their terms as having " an opposite sex , " has gone uncontested and unchallenged by other bureaucratic , legal , and medical authorities .
Subsequently , Harris is presumed to have set the landmark or legal precedent in California , if not the nation , of one 's obtaining a legal sex revision without benefit of any cosmetic or reconstructive " sex reassignment " - type surgery .
Further details are outlined in Harris ' copyrighted [ as yet unpublished ] autobiographical manuscript , " More Lives Than One " .
Harris has become a pioneer / spokesman for Intersex freedoms and transgender social justice ; an advocate for a moratorium on surgeons ' gratuitous , so - called " corrective " or " normalizing " genital operations , customarily performed on Intersexed neonates before they reach an age to render informed consent --- unless dramatic genital ailments or malformations ( often caused by life - threatening metabolic disorders ) are present and surgery is warranted .
Genital modification is not a panacea .
It could facilitate one 's " apparent " social sex ( re ) classification on paper ; but it could never automatically revamp ones " actual " or " true " ( often inconsistent and conflicting ) chromosomes , genes , gonadal composition , glandular / hormonal output , overall brain circuitry and , in turn , one 's inherent gender identification and sexual proclivity .
Mr. Harris and his case since garnered publicity and media exposure in six different countries and now appears on the world wide web .
He has also amassed over 100 credits as a widely - published author , collaborator and contributor of articles in academic textbooks , journals , anthologies , and popular books in the burgeoning field of Human Sexuality ; and as a guest lecturer / panelist at universities , colleges , medical trade seminars , private sector organizations ; and on nationally - syndicated radio and television programs .
Lynn Edward Harris is single , resides in Los Angeles , California , leads a mainstream lifestyle and is a devotee of all classic arts , cultural events , antiques , travel , and metaphysics .
