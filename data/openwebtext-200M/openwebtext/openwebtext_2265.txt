Poorly designed ballots continue to plague U.S. elections , even after Congress set aside $ 3 billion to overhaul voting systems to prevent a recurrence of the flawed Florida ballots that deadlocked the 2000 presidential race , a study out today concludes .
Problems with confusing paper ballots in 2002 , absentee ballots in 2004 and touch - screen ballots in 2006 led thousands of voters to skip over key races or make mistakes that invalidated their votes , according to the study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law .
" In the big election meltdowns … where thousands of votes were lost , ballot design was the primary cause , " says Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center .
BETTER BALLOT : Varied ballot designs are ' literacy test for voters '
Ballot designs could play a big role in mistakes made at the polls this fall because of an infusion of new voters who registered for this year 's presidential race and the introduction of new voting machines in parts of 11 states with 15 million potential voters .
Since passage of the Help America Vote Act in 2002 , states have spent more than $ 2 billion in mostly federal funds to overhaul their voting systems .
Congress approved spending of up to $ 3 billion because of problems in the 2000 presidential race in Florida .
A deciding factor in that race was the confusion caused in Palm Beach County by the " butterfly ballot , " which required voters to punch a hole beside their candidate 's name in a strip between two facing pages that listed the presidential contenders .
Despite all the spending since then , mostly on new electronic voting systems , not enough attention has been paid to ballot design , the new study warns .
" There has not been a documented instance where a computer has fouled up the vote by itself , " agrees Kimball Brace of the consulting firm Election Data Services .
The study 's conclusion , endorsed by many federal and state election overseers , is leading counties and election system manufacturers to improve ballot designs by the November election .
Starting this week in Ohio , ballot design experts will show officials how to avoid the kind of voter confusion in Florida 's 13th Congressional District in 2006 .
More than 18,000 Sarasota County voters skipped that race , which appeared above a more prominently displayed race for governor on the same screen .
Republican Vern Buchanan won the congressional race by 369 votes .

The prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hizbullah will go through next week , Lebanese sources told the Kuwaiti news agency on Tuesday morning .
According to the report , the deal will be carried out in two stages over the course of a month .
On the first day of the initial stage , Hizbullah will hand over the remains of IDF soldiers who fell in the Second Lebanon War while Israel will return the bodies of Hizbullah fighters killed in battle with Israel , as well as the bodies of Palestinian gunmen killed since 1978 – this following an Israeli decision to completely close the cemetery for enemy combatants in northern Israel and transfer all those who are buried there .
On the second day of the first stage , Hizbullah will release the two captive Israeli soldiers , Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev , in return for Lebanese prisoner Samir Kuntar and four Hizbullah fighters imprisoned in Israel .
The second stage will go through a month 's time after the completion of the first , and will entail Israel releasing Palestinian detainees and / or prisoners .
The number and identity will be left to Israel 's discretion .
Estimates are that Israel will release female prisoners , minors and those in poor health .
The Lebanese sources added that the agreement with Hizbullah includes an undisclosed clause pertaining to the exchange of intelligence , which will see Hizbullah handing over a report regarding its efforts to obtain information regarding the fate of Ron Arad .
Israel , in turn , will provide information regarding the four Iranian diplomats who went missing in 1982 during the IDF 's incursion into Lebanon .
UN : Hizbullah has n't rebuilt south of Litani
Meanwhile a report issued by UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon two years after the Second Lebanon War , asserts that there " is no evidence " of Hizbullah building a new military infrastructure in south Lebanon , Lebanese daily al - Ahkbar said .
The report , which examines the implementation of UN Resolution 1701 in Lebanon , contradicts Israeli claims that Hizbullah has rehabilitated its strength south of the Litani River .
It will be released in its entirety next week .
The report also determines that Israel has yet to complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon , and says that IDF troops still maintain control over part of the border town of Ghajar .
This , the report said , may continue to be a source of tension in the region .
It ’s a story that the American media totally ignored .
Our wonderful “ independent ” reporters collectively decided last week that it simply was n’t news that Hillary revealed she ’d be nuking Iran if they attacked Israel , and that it was n’t news that she ’d like to extend the US nuclear umbrella to Israel ’s neighbors .
That means we’d be nuking Iran if they attacked Jordan , Egypt , maybe even Saudi Arabia .
Show of hands :
How many Americans are willing to start a nuclear war for the Saudis ?
Well , it seems even the Saudis are n’t too keen on the idea .
They criticized Hillary this week , we learn via a Boston Globe editorial entitled “ Hillary Strangelove ” ( the Globe is one of the few American papers to even write about this issue ) .
They said she was as stupid as Bush :
The Saudi paper called Clinton ’s nuclear threat “ the foreign politics of the madhouse , ” saying , “ it demonstrates the same doltish ignorance that has distinguished Bush ’s foreign relations . ”
A British Foreign Ministry official was n’t very pleased either :
“ While it is reasonable to warn Iran of the consequences of it continuing to develop nuclear weapons and what those real consequences bring to its security , it is probably not prudent in today ’s world to threaten to obliterate any other country and in many cases civilians resident in such a country . ”
The Globe says that Hillary has done real damage to the reform effort in Iran :
ON THE EVE OF ISRAEL?S INDEPENDENCE DAY , BOY SCOUTS PARADE DOWN THE STREET WITH DRUMS AND FLAGS .
Natsot BUT , HERE IN THE ARAB TOWN OF SHFAR - ahm A PARADE OF ARAB SCOUTS WHERE ISRAELI FLAGS ARE RAISED AND CARRIED THROUGH THE STREETS UNDERSCORES THE COMPLICATED POSITION OF THE 1.3 MILLION ARABS WHO MAKE UP 20 PERCENT OF ISRAEL?S CITIZENS .
SOME , LIKE ORSAHN YAH - SEEN , THE ARAB MAYOR OF SHFARahm , FEELS THAT ISRAEL IS HIS COUNTRY AND SUPPORTS CELEBRATING ISRAEL?S ANNIVERSARY ?
ORSAN YASSIN , ARAB MAYOR OF SHFARA ?M :
The flag represents me .
I am a citizen of Israel .
I am a Palestinian .
I am an Arab .
A Palestinian and a citizen of Israel .
This is me .
This is how I define myself .
This is my country and this flag is my flag .
I believe in that .
BUT , AS ISRAEL TOASTS ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY , THOUSANDS OF ARABS WILL PROTEST WHAT THEY CALL THE ?
NAQBA , ?
OR THE DAY OF CATASTROPHE .
FOR THESE ISRAELI ARABS , THE FOUNDING OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL CAME AT THEIR EXPENSE .
THE SITUATION OF ISRAELI ARABS IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX .
WITH THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION , THERE IS ALREADY AN IMPRESSIVE LEVEL OF JEWISH - ARAB COEXISTENCE IN PARTS OF ISRAEL .
AND ISRAELI ARABS ARE BETTER INTEGRATED WITH MORE POLITICAL FREEDOMS THAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF OTHER ARABS .
NONETHELESS , MORE THAN 60 YEARS LATER , MANY ISRAELI ARABS FEEL INCREASINGLY UNWANTED AND FAR LESS WELL OFF THAN ISRAELI JEWS .
THERE ARE THREE TIMES AS MANY ARAB FAMILIES BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AS JEWISH ONES .
AND , LAND IS AN ESPECIALLY SORE POINT ?
CLINTON BAILEY , ISRAELI SCHOLAR AND EXPER ON BEDOUIN CULTURE : Land has always been at the heart of the struggle .
The Jews always thought of themselves as a people without a land , looking for a land without people .
Well , there were people here , there were Palestinians here .
IN 1948 , AFTER THE UNITED NATIONS ESTABLISHED THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN WHAT WAS ONCE PALESTINE , ARAB ARMIES ATTACKED JEWISH SETTLEMENTS .
IN RETALIATION , THE ISRAELI MILITARY EVACUATED AND DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN VILLAGES IN THE NORTH .
AND , IN THE INTERVENING SIXTY YEARS , ARABS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO RESETTLE THEM .
AND , TODAY THOSE VILLAGES REMAIN EMPTY ?
EXCEPT FOR A FEW GRAZING ANIMALS ?
BATTLE SCARS OF THE CONFLICT THAT GAVE BIRTH TO ISRAEL ?
MA ?
AROUF NEI ?MI ASHQAR , FORMER RESIDENT OF IQRIT : I miss everything in Iqrit , to every little soil , to the air , I miss the flowers , the trees .
THE ABANDONED VILLAGES TAUNT FORMER RESIDENTS , LIKE MAH-AH -ROOF NAH-MEE AHSH-KAR WHO LONGS TO RETURN TO HIS VILLAGE OF ORIGIN , IH - CRIT ASHQAR WALKS TO IH - CRIT EVERYDAY TO MAINTAIN ITS CHURCH AND CEMETERY - THE ONLY THINGS LEFT OF THE VILLAGE ?
MA ?
AROUF : All we want is to come back .
We do not want to be dead in our village .
We do not want to come only carried in boxes .
We want to live and bring up generations here and return to our history .
This is what we want .
ASHQAR SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT?S REFUSAL TO LET HIM RETURN TO HIS VILLAGE MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN .
MA ?
AROUF : I am an Arab , Christian hold the Israeli ID card .
We are proud to hold this identity , but we lack a lot of pride .
All the time I come to my destroyed land , while I see on the other side people expanding their territory and building houses while I have an Israeli identity , but cannot build or add a straw on my land .
Where is our pride ?
IN 1953 , THE ISRAELI PARLIAMENT RETROACTIVELY DECLARED THE CAPTURED VILLAGE LAND TO BE STATE PROPERTY FOR EITHER SETTLEMENT OR SECURITY PURPOSES .
CLINTON BAILEY :
The government wanted to lay claim to it and be able to use it // first and foremost , for it ? s
Jewish citizens .
//
If Israel has any raison d?etre // it has to be a place where Jews can come to .
AND SO , ISRAELI ARABS WATCH AS THEIR FORMER LANDS ARE FARMED OR BUILT UPON BY JEWISH NEWCOMERS ?
DAWOOD BAH - DUR USED TO VISIT THIS CRUMBLING MOSQUE IN THE FORMER VILLAGE OF ROB-SEE -YEE WHERE HE WAS BORN .
HE OFTEN TOOK HIS WIFE AND GRANDCHILDREN TO PASS ON THE LEGACY OF FAMILY LAND THAT WAS LOST .
Progress May Not Be Lethal After All
After much protest and anxiety , an Ikea opens in Brooklyn and turns out to not be so horrible .
Every person in America protests Rupert Murdoch ‘s purchase of the Wall Street Journal , but it ’s actually looking pretty good .
Back in 1966 , Time magazine predicted that “ remote shopping , while entirely feasible , will flop — because women like to get out of the house , like to handle the merchandise , like to be able to change their minds . ”
( On the other hand , Time believed in the Internet : “ One thing people almost certainly will want is electronic ‘ information retrieval ’ : the contents of libraries and other forms of information or education will be stored in a computer and will be instantly obtainable at home by dialing a code . ”
Ironically , that shrewd prediction is spelling big trouble for Time and other magazines . )
It is probably hard to think of any progress or disruptive technology that has n’t been met with fear , anxiety , and predictions of failure .
What are your favorite examples ?
The mayor of New Orleans ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city as Hurricane Gustav grew in ferocity , while the governor of Louisiana urged residents across the state to get out harm 's way .
Early Sunday , a hurricane warning was issued for parts of the northern Gulf Coast -- including the city of New Orleans --- by the National Hurricane Center .
The public advisory called for disaster preparations to be rushed to completion .
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin told residents of the city 's West Bank , which is threatened by weak levees along at least one canal , they must evacuate starting Sunday at 8 a.m. , while those in the rest of the city must leave starting at noon .
" I must tell you this is the mother of all storms ... I 'm not sure we 've ever seen anything like it , " he said at a press conference Saturday evening .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , meanwhile , said the state on Saturday was in the process of calling 195,000 residents that live south of Interstate 10 to encourage them to heed a rash of mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders .
Now that is the kind of reaction one would expect in a perfect world .
I think we could all learn a thing or two from good ol ' Portugal .
Why do these ham and eggers have a single fan anywhere ?
Because corporations invest millions of dollars into molding a group of soulless sellouts into a brand they can market to the masses .
These guys are a product not a rock and roll band .
If they shove it down our throats enough , we do n't have a choice but to accept it .
Just look at the way this guy is posturing and preening on the stage .
He yanks his guitar off , grabs a quick swig from his bottled water ( not beer by the way , probably avoiding empty calories ) , and slings it into the crowd .
This piece of shit looks like he is acting .
I 'm sure he 's thinking this is a great opportunity to gain a little street cred .
But this crowd is n't buying it , they have n't heard I Wanna Be A Rockstar played a thousand times in the background of every T.G.I.
Friday's , or American Eagle .
On the other side of the coin , I do n't think they even have the frame of reference to know how shitty these buttplugs are in real life .
Nope , this reaction is based on pure talent alone , and those boos say it all .
This is the second song ,
In less than three minutes , this crowd of thousands picked up on the fact this talentless group of hacks do n't deserve to waste even two more minutes of their time .
Nice .
Just in case this all sounds a little too much like a conspiracy theory , here is a little evidence to back up our point of view .
Da Da Da DaDaaaaaaaa ... I 'm lovin ' it .
This autographed original portrait of Albert Einstein , taken by famous photographer Yousuf Karsh , is now up for auction .
Everyone has heard of the mad scientist or the absent - minded professor .
But a look at some of the ordinary and extraordinary imperfections of a few great minds reveals that geniuses are just like us .
Albert Einstein , who came up with the theories of special and general relativity , enjoyed the company of other women while he was married .
His second wife was his first cousin .
He lived with her for five years before divorcing his first wife with whom he had a child before they were married .
Charles Darwin , father of evolutionary theory , agonized as a single man over whether or not to marry at all .
He drew up a list of pros and cons , saying a wife was “ better than a dog anyhow … but [ a ] terrible loss of time . ”
He married soon thereafter , his lifelong mate .
More of the same
Richard Feynman , a Nobel prize - winning physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb and figure out the source of the shuttle Challenger explosion , visited strip clubs nearly daily near his home in California .
He mainly worked on lectures and equations there .
But for breaks , Feynman would watch the dancers and draw them .
His wife , his third marriage by this time , was fine with this .
Sigmund Freud , who revealed the psychology of the unconscious in his numerous writings and was generally a nice guy , got into intense verbal scraps with his male friends due to his unresolved feelings of omnipotence , according to John Simmons , author of “ The Scientific 100 ” ( Citadel Press , 2000 ) .
On the home front
Isaac Newton , who arrived at three laws of motion and a law of gravity that explained that the physical world was governed by mathematics , was reared by his grandmother after his father died and his mother remarried a man whom Newton loathed , Simmons writes .
Newton had a tendency toward unnecessarily bitter and violent rages with his colleagues and friends , and he did some mid-life career hopping , including a lackluster stint in Parliament .
Marie Curie , who discovered radioactivity , lived with her husband in a sparsely furnished apartment because she hated housework .
While the couple did their research in a leaky shed , they had little money and would cheer themselves up by sitting next to the stove with a cup of hot tea .
She later received two Nobel prizes .
Paul Erdos , one of the 20th century ’s greatest mathematicians and whose work laid the foundations for computer science , lived out of a suitcase and was a poor earner for most of his life .
He said property was a nuisance and relied on the kindness of friends for food and clothing .
What makes genius ?
Not convinced that geniuses are just like us ?
Simmons says the true similarity lies in how nurture meets nature .
In other words , the talents that geniuses are born with , such as math , cognitive and creative skills , must be nurtured socially and economically in childhood or they die on the vine , with rare exceptions , Simmons told LiveScience .
Same goes for “ the rest of us ” and our slightly less spectacular talents .
“ The scientific genius who grew up in grinding poverty is an exceedingly rare bird , ” he said .
“ If it seems there was a great flowering of scientific genius out of Eastern Europe beginning in the late nineteenth century , it was due in large part to a developing middle class , a stable family life , and secular opportunities for both men and women . "
January is Genius Month at LiveScience .

Smart People Choke Under Pressure Simple Writing Makes You Look Smart Expanse of Knowledge Delays Big Ideas Big Brains Not Always Better
Two years ago , this was my life : I worked in a converted warehouse in Hoxton , east London .
It was a bright , young company ; the work was brain - achingly demanding and we put in long hours .
There were often drinks after work .
Weekends consisted of hungover mornings in bed and longer alcohol - sodden lunches with friends .
Resolutions to take more exercise and see more of the insides of theatres / museums were daily broken .
Yesterday , at 5.30 am , I was to be found swaying to and fro in the dark , attempting to coax my toddler son back into his cot for another hour 's sleep .
His cries of " sha " ( lights ) and " poi " ( porridge ) were a bad omen and I soon conceded .
On came the lights and we made our weary way downstairs .
Some four hours later , after making porridge and changing two nappies and reading a dozen or so tractor - related pieces of toddler literature , I was at baby group .
There I talked to a group of mothers about the spate of bird - flu - style viruses sweeping the nation 's children while Jack swapped bird - flu - style viruses with their kids .
By midday we were home , fed and Jack was unconscious in his buggy .
It was my first proper break of the day - I washed up , cleaned and then made a stew for tea .
In the afternoon I pushed Jack , a spade and a fork round to the allotment in the wheelbarrow ; after a short amount of digging he got bored and we went to the swings .
At 7 pm , after almost 14 hours on the go , Jack went to bed .
I washed up , cleaned up , watched telly with a can of beer , then went to bed early .
This is my life .
Last week , a report found that there are now in the region of 200,000 " househusbands " in this country : I am one of them .
Like blue whales , we rarely meet and when we do , we cluster .
I know about eight other househusbands , although , to be pedantic about it , most of them are part - timers , splitting the domestic stuff with their partners .
And part - time is not full - time ; there is a profound difference .
I do n't work part - time or freelance from home .
I have abandoned my career to raise our son and , perhaps one day , his sibling .
I fully intend to work outside the home again , but there will be no option of going back to what I did before - it was n't that kind of a career .
When I fill in forms now , under occupation I write " househusband " .
This was n't the original plan .
The original plan , I think , was for us to have a gap year - a year off together with the new baby , me not working , my girlfriend on maternity leave .
But by the end of the year , the plan had evolved .
We 'd greenshifted and downsized during that year off ( ie moved to the country and spent all our savings ) and we'd become quite used to being poor and having nothing worse to worry about than dog shit on the village green .
There was also the fact that our son had been premature and we 'd spent three months of that first year hanging around a hospital ; we were n't ready to hand him over to a third party .
So it was decided that my girlfriend would work four days a week , and I 'd work none .
Well , apart from all the domestic stuff .
And so Jack gets me .
A lot of his mother too , but a lot more of me .
I suspect the overall package I offer him is of the same quality , but more physical and more outdoorsy than he'd get with his mother .
A great deal of time is spent in the garden ; me gardening , him moving stones from one place to another , or eating soil .
When it rains we make indoor slides from table tops .
We laugh and roll and rough each other up .
We cook together and go hunting for tractors and diggers .
He rides everywhere on my shoulders ; a proper little emperor .
It is difficult , being a househusband ; certainly more difficult than I had imagined .
The practical aspects of parenting - naps , meals , baths , bedtimes - are well established .
So are the basics of keeping house .
None of it is the least bit difficult , once you know how .
But a lot of it is boring .
And the hours ... they start when it 's dark and cold , and they last for an unreasonable amount of time .
There is little time to yourself ; no time for mulling over your emails , or surfing the web , or popping out for some pleasure shopping .
There 's no breakfast and a shower before work .
You live and sleep on the shop floor .
I realise that the complaints I have are the complaints of a billion housewives since women started keeping cave ; looking after children and a home is low - status , poorly rewarded and self - esteem sapping .
It 's also hard to do well .
It turns out that being a househusband is very much like being a housewife - what sex you are makes very little difference .
Of course there are short periods when Jack entertains himself with pots or pans , or in his sandpit .
But these periods cannot be relied upon , or scheduled round .
The actual work of househusbanding may only take five hours a day but those five hours are smeared across the 13 hours that Jack is awake in a wholly unpredictable manner .
Worse still , the job never really ends .
Even when my girlfriend is home , I 'm still at the coalface , still changing half the nappies and cooking half the meals , and still very much with Jack .
Weekends are like weekdays , but with help and adult company .
There are no Friday nights in the pub with the sense of another week completed and a job well done .
It is relentless .
Then there 's the bonus scheme : there just ai n't one .
A career offers tangible opportunities for progress , defined by increased cash and kudos .
Keeping your child physically and emotionally healthy and your home a nice place to live takes an enormous amount of physical and emotional work .
Yet it is the minimum expected from you .
It is difficult to excel .
You 're never going to be told by your boss or a member of your team that you 're good at your job .
Nobody will ask your advice .
It 's never going to be better than it is now .
It is not exactly the same as being a housewife .
For starters , the word " housewife " is loaded down with negative associations ; " househusband " sounds New Man , experimental , softy - liberal , empowered - ludicrous , maybe , but an act of choice .
I suspect that it 's a lot easier being a man in a woman 's world , than the other way around .
But when you tell people you 're a househusband , it is very much like telling someone that you are a housewife : there is no follow - up question .
What do you do ?
I 'm a househusband .
Oh , they say .
And that 's it , end of conversation .
Although I might then get asked what my wife does .
A recent conversation with a full - time - turned - part - time househusband friend of mine flushed out the fact that he felt " demasculinised " , as he put it , by the whole thing ; leaving the wage - earning role to his wife had left him mildly unsettled .
Me , I have no problem with any of that .
In fact , I do remember , even at 5.30 am , that working in an office involves stresses , strains and uncertainties that I do n't miss one bit .
That may partly be the erosion of the self - esteem thing , though .
After 18 months at home , the thought of going back into the workplace is genuinely scary .
My brain feels atrophied .
Once upon a time I could be told a phone number and write it down the next day .
Nowadays , I have to look up my postcode .
When I do get ground down , when it feels really relentless , I have to be reminded that this is not for ever .
Housewives once went from school into marriage and had little hope of doing any interesting work even when their children had left home .
I 've spent an inordinate amount of time in higher education , and had not one but two careers .
I hope at some point to have some sort of third career , and I just about cling on to enough self confidence to find that prospect exciting .
When I remember all this , I remember that my househusbanding is a huge privilege .
This is the ( extended ) gap year that I never took ; I 'm travelling emotionally , if not geographically .
I 'm learning about myself , developing the patience and sympathy that I never even thought I lacked .
Best of all , Jack and I like each other .
I 'm always pleased to see him .
We spend nearly every waking hour together , yet when I 'm not with him I miss him .
I know what " poi " and " sha " mean .
I do get some time off , courtesy of my girlfriend , to go fish or meet friends .
Above all , I know in every bone of my body that I will never regret this .
I will not lie on my deathbed and think , oh , how I wish I 'd spent less time with my son .

Running , it turns out , is not a sport for most people in China .
And when they do run , their style is , to Western eyes , a bit unusual .
Joseph Kahn , a deputy foreign editor for The Times who just returned from five years as Beijing bureau chief , said athletics in China was mostly confined to sports academies that train young people to be Olympians .
Otherwise , exercise takes place in the morning in parks , where people do yoga and tai chi and run backward , which they think helps with balance .
“ Rarely do people run on the streets , but not never , ” he said .
Some athletes who have competed in Beijing said they were defeated by the conditions there .
Jeremy Horgan - Kobelski , a mountain biker , entered a race in Beijing last September .
He started coughing soon after the race began , and his coughing fits were so severe that he had to drop out halfway through .
Almost everyone had trouble , he said , with only 8 of 50 cyclists finishing the race .
Still , you can avoid the worst of one pollutant , ozone , by running in the morning .
Levels peak at midday .
And there is some evidence that you can develop tolerance to ozone over a five - day period , said Kenneth W. Rundell , director of respiratory research and the human physiology laboratory at Marywood University in Scranton , Pa .
Added to the air pollution is the pollen .
The Chinese government has warned that August is pollen season , and counts are expected to be high .
I ’m bringing over - the - counter pills containing the decongestant pseudoephedrine , a drug that is banned for Olympians under antidoping regulations but is legal for non-Olympians like me .
But Randall L. Wilber , a senior sports physiologist at the United States Olympic Training Center , told me that heat and humidity would take a bigger toll .
“ We ’re actually focusing very , very heavily on heat and humidity as opposed to air pollution , ” he said .
Endurance athletes who exercise in heat and humidity can become acclimated in about two weeks .
The body adjusts by increasing the plasma volume , making it easier for the heart to pump blood to muscles and to the skin , for cooling .
In addition , when you are acclimated , sweating starts sooner and the sweat is more profuse and more diluted .
Absolute Power , No Responsibility : White House reaction to the Department of Justice hiring scandal Eric Brewer
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008

It had been two days since the Department of Justice released a report accusing itself of illegally discriminating against political enemies in its hiring of supposedly independent judges and prosecutors , and no one in the White House press corps had bothered to ask the administration for its reaction .
As usual , I 'd been trying , but the press secretary rarely calls on me .
Wednesday was going to be the last briefing in Washington for at least a couple of weeks , so I went in for one more try .
The question I hoped to ask :
Any reaction to the Inspector General 's report that found that the Department of Justice illegally discriminated against Democrats in the hiring of non-political judges and prosecutors ?
Followed up if necessary by : Does the President take responsibility for the failed leadership that allowed the nation 's top law enforcement agency to break the law and abandon its long tradition of independence from politics ?
I attended both the morning " gaggle " and the more formal , televised briefing in the early afternoon .
The gaggle was sparsely attended .
I was one of only six reporters sitting in the first two rows , so I thought my chances were pretty good .
Dana Perino called on the other five they asked about the housing bill , offshore drilling , and Iran 's defiant nuclear enrichment programbut then Perino abruptly ended the session after just 13 minutes .
A couple of hours later I went back for the briefing .
The room was crowded , but again I got a good seat in the second row .
This time , however , the second reporter called on I believe it was Jim Axelrod of CBS asked my question .
Here 's his exchange with Ms. Perino : Q Dana , what 's your reaction to the Justice Department report where they -- the report essentially says , yes , that there was inappropriate influence on politics and ideology that was part of our hiring and firing practices ?
MS .
PERINO : Well as I have read the coverage of it -- I have n't read the report , but as I read the coverage of it , there 's obviously information in there that would cause concern to anybody .
And we agree with Michael Mukasey that -- the Attorney General -- that there was concern .
There should be concern any time anyone is improperly using politics to influence career decisions .
We believe that is improper .
We could absolutely not defend that .
And we are pleased that the Attorney General has taken steps to change it there at the Justice Department .
Q Can I infer from that that President Bush is disappointed in Alberto Gonzales ?
MS .
PERINO : I think that if you look at the report , and it is in line with what the Attorney General said at the time , which was that he was not aware of that going on .
And so I do n't think there 's anything -- disappointment does n't necessarily go to the Attorney General .
Q
You do n't think it would change -- it does n't change the President 's -- MS. PERINO : No , I do n't .
The whole situation -- the whole situation in terms of the politicization -- or accusations of politicization -- if you look at career hires that should not have had any sort of questions put towards them as to what sort of party they represent , or what affiliation they might belong to , or who they might vote for -- those are inappropriate for career positions .
And the President is glad that the -- Attorney General Mukasey made sure that that is no longer ongoing at the Justice Department .
And it 's nothing that we could defend , and we never have .
Q
But you wo n't go so far as to say that , looking at Alberto Gonzales 's Justice Department , President Bush is disappointed this was going on ?
MS .
PERINO : Well , I think that we are -- overall disappointment in the situation , sure .
So she " [ has n't ] read the report , " but then a moment later , defending Alberto Gonzales 's innocence , she tells the reporter to " look at the report . "
And " overall disappointment in the situation " is a pretty weak condemnation .
It almost sounds like she 's saying , " I 'm sorry we got caught . "
But what 's interesting here is how this case illustrates the conflict between the Bush administration 's " unitary executive " theory and reality .
Under the unitary executive theory , ALL executive power resides solely in the president .
And the Bush administration has tried hard to achieve this .
What it has led to , however , is the loss of independence in institutions that Americans have traditionally demanded have some degree of independence and so we see U.S. attorneys fired for not prosecuting Democrats , the military creating a propaganda arm to support a politically - motivated war , NASA and EPA scientists censored if they want to talk about global warming , et cetera .
Applied to an extreme , the unitary executive theory would absolve all underlings in the executive branch of any responsibility for their actions , since all they are doing is carrying out the orders of the President .
But on this point , the administration has been grossly inconsistent .
When soldiers at Abu Ghraib applied the enhanced interrogation techniques dreamed up in the Oval Office , it was they who were punished , not the all - powerful POTUS .
Similarly , in the current Department of Justice hiring scandal , it is the henchmen Monica Goodling and Kyle Samson who are being blamed .
Jim Axelrod asked if the President was disappointed in Alberto Gonzales .
But how could he be ?
Under the unitary executive theory , Gonzales had no independence he was merely one more cog carrying out the President 's will .
In Amazing Fantasy # 15 , the great American philosopher Stan Lee wrote , " With great power , comes great responsibility . "
The new George W. Bush version goes , " With absolute power , comes no responsibility . "

There are a lot of wrong perceptions about the datastore in Google AppEngine .
People both familiar and foreign with AppEngine do n't really understand what the datastore is .
There is a deeper system underneath the nice API we are given .
Understanding the guts can help us understand the skin .
We may also find there are times when we must shed the skin for new clothing .
The biggest misconception about the datastore is the assumption that " kinds " are anything like " tables " .
You could use a set of entity kinds similar to the way you would use a set of tables , but they simply are different beasts , entirely .
A table controls a strict requirement on the structure of its rows .
Every entity , on the other hand , is free to hold any properties of allowed types .
The published Model API is all an abstraction provided to give us a nice interface on top of an otherwise much looser foundation .
Many people would be very surprised to learn that a given kind does n't actually require anything of its entities , but from the right angle it makes perfect sense .
Meeting the kind of scalability requirements the datastore is designed for places interesting limitations .
Schema changes can't get in the way when you could have such a large dataset that no operation can ever effectively operate on the entire set at once .
This means what was a simple matter of ALTER TABLE in SQL is practically impossible in this new world , as the logistics behind updating and migrating potentially millions of entities to a new schema grows beyond the acceptable resources to give to a schema change .
However , if we allow flexibility , we simply start creating new entities in the updated form and be sure that when we load one of the previous versions , we 're prepared to use or upgrade it on the spot .
For this and other reasons , allowing all entities to be free - form is the simplest direction to provide the foundation we need .
With a better understanding of our foundation we can better understand the abstractions in google .
api.ext.db , with the Model subclasses most AppEngine developers know .
I 've seen quite a few people asking about migrating to changes in their db .
Model subclasses , not understanding why or how their existing entities will change to match the newly defined properties .
The behavior and how to work with it is a lot easier to understand when you view the individual entities are independent property bags , and not rows following a defined column schematic .
We can also come to understand db .
Expando as closer to the wire , so to speak , than its stricter Model cousin .
Perhaps a more exciting gain from this different view of the datastore is that we are n't bound by the published Model - centric API at all .
In fact , we can access the underlying Entity class directly , providing us with a simple , persisted mapping object , without anything building on top of it .
If we need some structure to our persistence , but the provided API simply is n't to taste , then an understanding of this layer gives us what we need to build our own variant datastore API .
We may even use this understand to provide implementations compatible with previous ORM solutions , but powered by the entities and BigTable , rather than traditional SQL databases .
The possibilities open up with our deeper understanding .
The more variation we have in what everyone is doing on AppEngine , the more value it has to all of us .
Take this information and do some exciting .
Share it and we 're all reap the benefits .

It makes me a little uncomfortable , it 's a little sinister to me , when the teenage rebellion is controlled and sanitized by a big corporation .
There has to be some rebellion , or else it 's not rock and roll .
The Jonas Brothers ...
I 'm sure they 're fine young kids , and their music 's not for me , it 's for young people , I understand that , but my point is -- they 're kind of too clean .
With the purity rings , symbolizing that you 're saving yourself for marriage .
Now , I 'm thinking -- what kind of a rock star is this ?
What kind of a rock star is this ?...
Ferguson was in a Scottish punk band , was a drug addict , almost suicided and is now clean -- and strong enough to make nightly jokes about using drugs and still not relapse .
Rock and roll cred established .
What 's he saying ?
He defines rock and roll as rebellion ; now , and now laments is a genre .
You might say that actually , the Jonas Brothers are rebellion because they are rebelling against the established credo of rock and roll ( sex , drugs , etc ) , but that 's a ruse as well , they are n't the ones rebelling ; they were selected by an industry that is trying to change it 's image .
To illustrate this , take a look at the other promise ring wearer , Katy Perry , whose song , " I Kissed A Girl " has disturbed me for a long time , disturbed me because it is so not disturbing .
In case you do n't have kids or contracted rubella as a fetus , here 's the chorus :
I kissed the girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
Hope my boyfriend do n't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Do n't mean I 'm in love tonightI kissed a girl and I liked itI liked it
That 's as raunchy as it gets .
Anyone who lived through the bicurious 90s knows that this kind of " kissing the girl " is about boys .
It 's about being sexy for boys , even if the boy does n't know you did it , you still feel you are even more attractive to them .
But this is by no means cutting edge material .
I will grant you that the song is technically , and artistically , more brilliant than anything by Coldplay .
Ok , you got me there .
Yet the song is everywhere , not just pop song everywhere , but everywhere everywhere .
Here are three news media outlets that have no business writing about music , writing about her .
And always the topic is sexuality , as if she 's opening ( or closing ) doors or something .
I had a huge argument with a friend about that song .
My position was that such a benign song -- this is old news -- has a popularity that cannot be explained by the seemingly relevant topic of kissing a girl , there must be something else to it .
Why would the music industry choose to push this specific song , so much ?
His position was that it was MTV et al , targeting the older people , the ex-MTV generation -- e.g. me -- trying to entice them back with songs that play on their ( unfulfilled ) fantasies .
" Why else would they be in lingerie ?
Young guys do n't care about lingerie , unless it 's a thong .
They 're programming to the older crowd . "
Maybe , but why this song ?
Why not a million other more risque songs ?
So here is this not at all provocative video , completely old news to anyone 21 - 45 , yet it is everywhere .
Go ahead and watch it , tell me why .
No nudity .
She 's pretty , but come on , she 's no Taylor Swift .
Song is catchy , but again ...
I call your attention to the last five seconds of the video .
In the final scene , she wakes up next to her sleeping boyfriend .
Ooohh -- is he going to find out how naughty she is ?
Will he be jealous or turned on ?
Is it fantasy or real ?
Here 's the thing .
Her boyfriend in the video is black .
If that realization does n't have any impact on you at all , you are my point .
You may be so progressive that you do n't even notice race , but I can assure you race is still a gigantic issue , for both races .
We have a scenario where two maybe - sort - of taboos are present in a video , but one is highlighted as a real taboo , and the other as completely and utterly ordinary , meriting no comment or explanation .
I 'm pretty sure depending where you live in America , you 'll either agree or disagree with her hierarchy .
In all the Katy Perry discussions , blogs , and articles , no one noticed the race issue , no one thought to mention it , nothing .
What they went all Manchurian Candidate about was that she kissed a girl .
" Well , maybe that 's what she believes . "
She does n't have anything to do with it .
She did n't make a video , then go Jet Li the MTV program director 's office door , slap him in the face with the reel , and say , " This is f-ing awesome , play this ! " " oh - oh - oh right away Mrs. Perry !
Right away ! "
The video was directed , manufactured .
The guy in her bed is n't random , they selected an actor .
It was n't accidental he was black , they picked him because he was black .
Indeed , he 's DJ Skeet Skeet , a friend of her real life black rapper / boyfriend Travis McCoy .
Nothing here is random ; even her name , Katy Perry , was selected because her real name , Katy Hudson , risked confusing her with Kate Hudson .
She changed her name to differentiate herself from someone else .
They are constructing an image , they are telling you a story .
So what 's happening here is that MTV is n't saying , " wow , this is so shockingly sexy , she kissed a girl . "
MTV is actually resetting the culture , it is telling you , telling a generation of kids , that kissing a girl is shocking and sexy .
" But it is n't shocking , you can't simply declare that it is .
Much more shocking porn is everywhere . "
Actually , that 's the genius of this .
Reconstruct adolescent sexuality to the old days of maybe you catch a glimpse of a worn and melted Playboy down by the creek .
Online porn saturates , overloads , it stops becoming arousing and starts getting frustrating , " where the hell is the exact pic I need to get off ? "
MTV can't compete with that .
Music can't compete with that .
In your face , up yours , all that .
Those vibes are now elsewhere .
So it 's recreating a niche by recreating a culture .
Clean , sober , and hip - hop light .
So that when you turn the amp up just a little , it catches everyone 's attention .
" Holy crap !
She kissed a girl ! "
I 'm not sure if I should be appalled that sexuality has been commandeered by MTV et al , or I should just be relieved they 're pushing popcorn not penetration .
Back to the Craig Ferguson .
The music industry has to make good boys cool because there 's a glut of bad boys everywhere else , and MTV and the music industry can't compete .
Sex is no longer cool .
What 's cool now ?
Status .
Narcissism .
Rich is the new porn .
But poor Craig Ferguson .
He makes the point that rock and roll is supposed to be about rebellion -- theoretically getting a big inaudible cheer from the teenagers -- " this guy may be old , but at least he gets it ! "
But he does n't .
That cheer came from his viewers -- who have an average age of 50 .
He 's talking to a bunch of old guys , people who still think Smoke on The Water meant something .

When designing a UI we usually go right from a quick paper sketch to HTML / CSS .
We skip the static Photoshop mockup .
Here are a few reasons why we skip photoshop :
You ca n’t click a Photoshop mockup .
This is probably the number one reason we skip static mockups .
They are n’t real .
Paper is n’t real either , but paper does n’t have that expectation .
A Photoshop mockup is on your screen .
If it ’s on your screen it should work .
You ca n’t pull down menus in a Photoshop mockup , you ca n’t enter text into a field in a Photoshop mockup , you ca n’t click a link in a Photoshop mockup .
HTML / CSS , on the other hand , is the real experience .
Photoshop gives you too many tools to focus on the details .
When you use Photoshop you ca n’t help but pay attention to the details .
The alignment , the specific colors , the exact shapes , the little details that may matter eventually but they certainly do n’t matter now .
The start is about the substance , not about the details .
Details are for later .
The text in Photoshop is not the text on the web .
Once you ’re looking at a static Photoshop mockup you can’t quickly change the text without going back into Photoshop , changing the text , saving the file , exporting it as a gif / png / jpg , etc .
You ca n’t post it online and tell someone to “ reload in 5 seconds ” like you can when you quickly edit HTML .
You have to say “ Give me a few minutes … ” .
Also , type in Photoshop never seems to be the right size as type in HTML .
It just never seems to feel the same .
It does n’t wrap the same , it does n’t space out the same .
Photoshop puts the focus on production , not productivity .
Photoshop is about building something to look at , but about building something you can use .
When you ’re just worried about how it ’s going to look , you spend too much time on production value .
HTML /CSS lets you be productive .
You ’re constantly moving forward towards something more and more real with every change .
Photoshop is repeating yourself .
Ok , so you ’ve spent 3 days on a mockup in Photoshop .
Now what ?
Now I have to make it all over again in HTML / CSS .
Wasted time .
Just build it in HTML / CSS and spend that extra time iterating , not rebuilding .
If you ’re not fast enough in HTML / CSS , then spend the time learning how to create in HTML / CSS faster .
It ’s time well spent .
Photoshop is n’t collaboration friendly .
I sorta touched on this before , but let me hit this point again : HTML / CSS lets you make a change , save , and reload .
That ’s our collaboration flow .
“ Here , let me change this .
Reload . ”
These changes take seconds .
“ Here , let me float this left instead of right .
Reload . ” Seconds .
No selecting a tool , changing a few items around manually , saving , exporting , uploading , giving people the new file name , etc. HTML / CSS is build for rapid iterative prototyping while Photoshop … is n’t .
Photoshop is awkward .
You ca n’t help but know your way around Photoshop after working in it for 10 years , but I still find it awkward to get simple things done .
Working with a pen feels so much more natural to me than going back to the toolbar over and over .
A pen can draw anything , but in Photoshop you need to use the text tool to type , the shape tool to draw a shape , the menu bar to adjust this or that , etc .
None of this is to say we think Photoshop is bad or a waste of money or time , but for us we ’ve found that going straight into HTML / CSS affords us the best iterative and creative experience .
HTML / CSS is real in a way Photoshop will never be .
A total of 330 strikes have been recorded so far this year and all of them were illegal because they were not led by the trade union and did n’t follow the law , reported the Vietnam National Confederation of Labour at a conference in Hanoi on June 16 - 17 .
The confederation ’s Vice Chairman , Mai Duc Chinh , said that under the current regulations , only grassroots trade unions have the right to organise strikes , but this regulation is unrealistic because there is no mechanism to protect trade union leaders and most employers do n’t positively cooperate with trade unions .
Most leaders of grassroots trade unions assume many jobs so they do n’t have much time for this job .
Their skills as trade union leaders are also very poor , Chinh said .
He also said that the rules on compensating companies for losses caused by illegal strikes are unfeasible .
For example , a company in HCM City lodged a case with the court but its petition was rejected because it was unable to define the major subject of the lawsuit among 10,000 workers participating in the strike .
Since the amended Labour Code took effect on July 1 , 2007 , illegal strikes have continued to increase in number .
Under the current law , labourers are not allowed to go on strike in conflicts of rights but must bring the conflict to court .
They can go on strike if conflicts of interest are not solved by negotiations .
Labourers must compensate their employers if the court finds that their strikes were illegal .
Deep Packet Inspections ( DPI ) violate online privacy and Net NeutralityWashington , DC – Today as part of the FCC field hearing at Carnegie Mellon University on broadband and the digital future , the American Civil Liberties Union will submit written comments about how Deep Packet Inspections ( DPI ) and other practices threaten Americans ’ online privacy and a neutral Internet .
The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
“ The Internet has become one of the most important methods of communication in history because of neutrality rules .
The Commission must use the information from today ’s hearing on broadband and the digital future to take steps to ensure that speech and association on the Internet remain free .
“ Corporate gatekeepers , like Comcast , jeopardize the very existence of the Internet as a forum for speech .
The Commission has the challenging , but far from impossible job of immediately restoring neutrality to the Net while avoiding censorship .
Thus , the Commission should not resort to unconstitutional license conditions such as mandatory and automatic filtering -- the Internet should remain a zone free of any gatekeepers or censors .
“ The ACLU also urges the Commission to scrutinize the growing practice of Internet Service Providers examining their customers ’ Internet habits .
Using Deep Packet Inspections ( DPI ) , ISPs know everything we do online .
DPI allows ISPs to have access to all of your searches , friends and family , anything you read and email , any sites you visit and any comments you post .
DPI is a virtual strip search for you and your computer .
“ DPI already has a short sordid history associated with abusing personal information .
Companies like NebuAd and Phorm built business models using their ability to eavesdrop on Internet users ’
Web surfing for the purpose of serving ads .
Under the guise of applying differential pricing based on the speed , volume , application preferences , or even the substance of content , service providers could snoop on every facet of user activity .
“ This ISP practice not only threatens our online privacy , but also the neutrality of the Internet .
ISPs can now use a free speech forum to discriminate based on the content of the communications .
This kind of scrutiny is ripe for abuse , especially where there is money to be made .
We would never give the post office the power to route mail according to the content of a letter .
The Commission must ask some very hard questions about the reasons for this scrutiny . ”
ACLU activists from the area plan to attend the hearing .

Just one glass of orange juice a day could increase risk of diabetes
Orange juice , with its lack of fibre , can send a spike of sugar levels through the body , which may lead to diabetes in some people
Just one glass of orange juice a day could significantly increase the risk of diabetes .
Research shows that fruit juices , regarded by many as a healthy way to start the day , raise the odds of a form of diabetes linked to poor diet and obesity by up to a quarter .
Eating whole pieces of fruit however , cuts the likelihood of developing the disease which affects 2.5 million Britons .
It is thought the lack of fibre in juices may cause dangerous spikes in blood sugar levels , according to researchers from the Harvard Medical School in the U.S .
Britons work their way through more than two billion litres of fruit juice each year - the equivalent of 36 litres for every man , woman and child .
Many enjoy a morning glass as part of their recommended five - a- day fruit and vegetable intake .
But nutritionists have warned that moderation is vital .
People should aim to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables for overall health .
The link between Type 2 diabetes and fruit juice was made by tracking the health and habits of more than 70,000 female nurses over an 18 - year period .
This found three portions of fruit a day reduced the risk of diabetes by 18 per cent but just one serving of fruit juice increased the risk .
Those who drank three glasses of apple juice a month were 15 per cent more likely to have developed diabetes than those who got through less than once glass a month .
One glass of orange juice a day raised the risk by 24 per cent , the journal Diabetes Care reports .
Overall , a glass of fruit juice a day increased the odds of developing type 2 diabetes by 18 per cent .
The researchers said : ' Our findings of a positive association of fruit juice intake with hazard of diabetes suggest that caution should be observed in replacing some beverages with fruit juices in an attempt to provide healthier options .
' Moreover , the same caution applies to the recommendation that 100 per cent fruit juice be considered as a serving of fruit . '
Dr Joanne Lunn of the British Nutrition Foundation said : ' Juices have their place .
They provide a good shot of vitamin C but we have to watch them because they can be quite high in sugar . '
Around two million Britons have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and a further 500,000 are thought to have it but do not realise they do .
Diabetics do not produce enough insulin , a hormone vital for converting sugar into energy , or they make insulin that does n't work properly .
Blood sugar levels are initially kept in check through a tightly - controlled diet and exercise regimen .
However , most suffers will need tablets or insulin injections as they get older .
Doctors fear an epidemic of Type 2 diabetes in the UK because of unhealthy lifestyles and are already seeing the condition being diagnosed at much younger ages .
Pav Pank of Diabetes UK , said : ' It is very unlikely the consumption of fruit juices alone increases the risk of developing diabetes .
There are a number of factors such as being overweight , especially around the waist , an unhealthy diet and a lack of physical activity . '

From the St. Petersburg Times ...
Two pieces of malicious software detected Thursday have been removed from Pinellas County 's voting tabulation system .
The two bugs , known as Flush .
G and W32. SillyDC , work in tandem and go from computer to computer redirecting Internet browsers to sites the user has n't selected , officials said .
The worm is carried through removable media like USB drives , is easily detected and , officials say , rather harmless .
Pinellas Deputy Supervisor of Elections Rick Becker said the worm is n't the kind of Trojan horse that would be used to corrupt a computer voting system and was unsure just where it came from .
And yet , we 're often told by voting machine companies that viruses can't get into these systems .
Then there are the election officials who have bought into these systems , yet know nothing about them , who respond to the public and the media as if they do , regularly making ridiculous claims that such problems can't happen because " at no time are our systems connected to the Internet . "
Whether they are or are n't , it 's an absurd response .
Malicious software can get into the system any number of ways , via non-Internet networking , USB thumb drives , etc .
It can then undedectably affect an election without detection .
In the Summer of 2006 , after my organization , VelvetRevolution.us , was given a Diebold touch - screen system from an insider source , we loaned it to Prinecton for testing and they were able to insert a vote - flipping virus via the memory card which could pass itself from machine to machine and flip an entire election without detection .
And , of course , on the first day of Early Voting in the now - infamous FL - 13 Congressional race in 2006 where 18,000 votes mysteriously and still - inexplicably disappeared , a malicious viral worm took down a key part of the network infrastructure on which the registration system ran , grinding voting to a halt that day .
Similarly , exclusively reported thereafter , the scientists who studied the ES&S voting machines used in that FL - 13 election discovered that the ES&S touchscreen systems --- used in some 16 different states --- were also vulnerable to the same type of virus that Prinecton was able to insert into the Diebold machines .
To this day , despite being told about it by the scientists who discovered the problem , the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission ( EAC ) refuses to warn jurisdictions that use the same machine model about its vulnerability , even though it was described as potentially even more serious than the one discovered in the Diebold systems .
Other than that , everything 's fine .
Nothing to see here .
Move along , folks .
Dear Senator Obama .
The US economy is in the worst economic crisis in decades , arguably since the great depression .
Housing is collapsing , state budgets are in shambles , unemployment is soaring , and the US dollar is sinking .
Things are going to get even worse when the commercial real estate bust picks up steam .
We have seen six bank failures already this year .
There are 90 more banks on the problem list .
Many of them will fail .
Meanwhile , Treasury Secretary Paulson and President Bush are both stressing " The U.S. economy is fundamentally strong , diverse and resilient . "
Indeed , Paulson speaks of the " strong dollar policy " at every opportunity .
The vast majority of citizens in the United States know that the above statements by President Bush and Paulson are lies .
What we really need is for politicians to face the public and state the truth .
The Truth Is Easy To See
The US can no longer afford to be the world 's policeman .
Congress has been spending beyond its means .
Deficit spending is cheapening the US dollar .
Cutbacks and sacrifices have to be made .
Interest On The National Debt Is $ 377 Billion
US Banking System Is Unsound
25 . Of the $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits , the total cash on hand at banks is a mere $ 273.7 Billion .
Where is the rest of the loot ?
The answer is in off balance sheet SIVs , imploding commercial real estate deals , Alt - A liar loans , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds , toggle bonds where debt is amazingly paid back with more debt , and all sorts of other silly ( and arguably fraudulent ) financial wizardry schemes that have bank and brokerage firms leveraged at 30 - 1 or more .
Those loans cannot be paid back .
What can not be paid back will be defaulted on .
If you did not know it before , you do now .
The entire US banking system is insolvent .
Congress Must Be Held Accountable
The 100 Year 's War
Horrendous Ethanol Policies
Why We Are In This Mess
Biggest Party Wall Street Ever Had
The Problem Cannot Be The Solution
We are a shareholder - owned company with a public mission .
We exist to expand affordable housing and bring global capital to local communities in order to serve the U.S. housing market .

That dampens proceeds from the federal tax on motor fuel : 18.4 cents a gallon on gasoline , 24.4 cents a gallon on diesel .
Revenue from the tax goes to the Highway Trust Fund , with most of it designated to the highway account , which finances construction and repair of roads , and a much smaller share to the mass transit account .
The highway account had a balance of about $ 8 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year , and the expectation was that it would have some $ 4 billion by year ’s end .
But it has been emptying faster than anticipated , and the Bush administration now projects that at some point in the next fiscal year , beginning Oct. 1 , it will hit zero , causing payments to be made from it only as revenue arrives .
Ms. Peters predicted a shortfall of $ 3.1 billion .
Transferring the money from the transit account would require Congress ’s approval , according to Congressional aides .
And it is sure to face opposition .
“ Robbing Peter to pay Paul is not the way to go , ” said the president of the American Public Transportation Association , William W. Millar .
“ The administration proposal is shortsighted and would mean that the mass transit account would be reduced to the point where there would not be enough money to fund the federal transit program in 2010 , even at the current level . ”
Last week the House passed a bill that would spend $ 8 billion of general tax revenue on highways .
But the White House said President Bush ’s senior advisers would recommend that he veto any such provision , and called for borrowing from the mass transit account instead .
That account is currently in surplus , the White House said , and the transfer “ would not harm transit spending and would not increase the deficit . ”
Nikon 's flagship P6000 point - and - shoot is official , and pretty much everything we heard .
Besides long - awaited RAW support ( not on Macs , sorry ) , the 13.5 - megapixel shooter has built - in GPS geotagging , Nikon 's DSLR controls , manual pop-up flash ( which is so fun to play with it 's almost worth the $ 500 price of admission by itself ) and other pro-ish features for more manual control .
The lens is a 4 x wide - angle , and it 'll do up to ISO 3200 at full resolution , or 6400 at three megapixels .
The most oddball feature ?
An Ethernet jack .
So it 's like a free trip to 2001 to boot .
Here 's all the details and another shot .
What looks to be the upcoming Nikon Coolpix P6000 has leaked , showing a picture of the high - end …
NEW COOLPIX P6000 OFFERS DIGITAL SLR SHOOTING CONTROL IN A COMPACT CAMERA

The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and the Association of Corporate Travel Executives ( ACTE ) are asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to review a decision that allows border patrols to search US citizens ' laptops for no reason .
The two groups filed an amicus brief ( PDF ) with the Court , asking it to rehear the case and , hopefully , reverse the decision .
They argued that the decision is a violation of citizens ' Fourth Amendment rights that protect them from unreasonable search and seizure .
The case goes back to 2005 , when a US citizen named Michael Arnold returned to the US from the Philippines .
A Customs and Border Patrol agent asked Arnold to fire up his laptop and browsed through two folders on the machine 's desktop , labeled " Kodak Pictures " and " Kodak Memories . "
After finding a photo that " depicted two nude women , " the search continued , turning up what the agent believed may have been child pornography .
Arnold 's computer was then seized and he was arrested .
In the resulting court case , Arnold argued that the search was unreasonable and a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights .
Arnold claimed that a laptop was more like " home " and " the human mind " than a typical closed container and that searching it required a reason .
A district court agreed that Arnold 's argument that a laptop was different from normal closed containers like luggage , which are routinely examined by border agents without particular cause .
A three - judge panel from the Ninth Circuit Court ruled on an appeal of the case in April of this year , however , and overturned the district court 's decision .
The panel said that border agents are free to routinely search citizens ' laptops and other electronic devices because they already have wide latitude to search suitcases , purses , wallets , and other documentation without reasonable suspicion .
Even if they do n't see anything of interest , they can still simply search and confiscate your laptop and other electronic gadgets like external hard drives , phones , and PDAs , simply because they feel like it , and all in the name of national security .
The EFF and ACTE now argue that the Court 's decision essentially renders useless the Fourth Amendment and puts citizens ' privacy and identities at risk , because border patrols can confiscate laptops and make full copies of their contents .
As anyone traveling with a laptop knows , our machines can contain personal and professional communications , banking information , legal information , tax documents , photos , ( in the case of journalists ) communications with confidential sources , and more — all of which can simply be copied over to a government computer and used however the government pleases .
" [ T ] hese random searches give businesses and individuals a reason not to travel across US borders to conduct business , and they force businesses to expend significant resources protecting confidential information , " reads the brief .
The two groups argue that , because of the volume of information stored on a laptop , the level of privacy invasion at a border search is " enormous , " not to mention that computers often contain information that users may not know about or have tried to erase .
Basically , the EFF and ACTE say that the information contained within does n't quite compare to rifling through the selection of N'Sync bobblehead dolls that I voluntarily packed away in my suitcase , or the pocket change rolling around at the bottom of my bag .
Embarrassing , perhaps , but not a clear and open window directly into every aspect of my life — even the parts I 've tried to erase .
" [ T ] he panel decision failed to appreciate the constitutional concerns raised when border agents randomly search and seize laptop computers from international travelers , " conclude the EFF and ACTE .
They ask that the Court require only reasonable suspicion of a crime before border agents may search the contents of someone 's computer , and expect a decision from the Court on whether to rehear the case within the next few months .

The genes of a European person can be enough to pinpoint their ancestry down to their home country , claim two new studies .
By reading single - letter DNA differences in the genomes of thousands of Europeans , researchers can tell a Finn from a Dane and a German from a Brit .
In fact a visual genetic map mirrors the geopolitical map of the continent , right down to Italy ’s boot .
“ It tells us that geography matters , ” says John Novembre , a population geneticist at the University of California , Los Angeles , who led one of the studies .
Despite language , immigration and intermarriage , genetic differences between Europeans are almost entirely related to where they were born .

This , however , does not mean that the citizens of each European nation represent miniature races .
“ The genetic diversity in Europe is very low .
There is n’t really much , ” says Manfred Kayser , a geneticist at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands , who led the other study .
One - letter differences
Kayser ’s and Novembre ’s teams uncovered the gene - geography pattern only by analysing hundreds of thousands of common gene variants called single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) across the genomes of people from about two dozen countries .
SNPs are places in the genome where one person ’s DNA might read A , while another ’s T .
Though the teams worked independently , they used some of the same DNA samples , which were gathered by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline to help hunt for genes linked to drug side effects .
The researchers recorded the results alongside the country of origin for each subject as well as that of their parents and grandparents when possible .
For each subject , the researchers decoded half a million SNPs .
However , to get an overall assessment of the difference between any two genomes , the researchers used a mathematical trick that scrunched the hundreds of thousands of SNPs into two coordinates , with each person ’s genome represented by a point .
The greater the distance between two points , the greater the difference in their genomes .
When both teams plotted thousands of genomes on a single graph along with their country of origin , a striking map of Europe emerged .
Spanish and Portuguese genomes clustered “ south - west ” of French genomes , while Italian genomes jutted “ south - east ” of Swiss .
These cardinal directions are artificial , but the spatial relationships between genomes are not .
In general , the closer together two people live , the more similar their DNA .
The same is known to be true of animals .
Predicting origins
The map was so accurate that when Novembre ’s team placed a geopolitical map over their genetic “ map ” , half of the genomes landed within 310 kilometres of their country of origin , while 90 % fell within 700 km .
Both teams found that southern Europeans boast more overall genetic diversity than Scandinavians , British and Irish .
“ That makes perfect sense with the major migration waves that went into Europe , ” says Kayser , noting Homo sapien ‘s European debut 35,000 years ago , post-ice age expansions 20,000 years ago , and movements propelled by the advent of farming 10,000 years ago .
In each case , members of established southern populations struck north .
“ A pattern in which genes mirror geography is essentially what you would expect from a history in which people moved slowly and mated mainly with their close neighbours , ” says Noah Rosenberg , a geneticist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .

George and Laura Bush to divorce after election because of Condi Rice ?
Many US tabloids have been flooded with rumors of George W. Bush ’s family misfortunes recently .
The latest gossip is about George and Laura Bush to divorce after November elections .
George and Laura Bush to divorce after election because of Condi Rice ?
Italy ’s La Repubblica newspaper wrote with reference to The National Examiner tabloid that George and Laura Bush were planning a divorce after the presidential election in the USA .
According to the supermarket tabloid , George and Laura Bush hardly ever speak to each other .
George feels very unhappy and does not want Laura to leave him .
However , the newspaper wrote , Laura is tired of everything ; she is determined to live her own life .
The couple still keeps their relationship alive just because they are contractually obliged to stay together during George W. Bush ’s presidency ; it is not a matter of feelings at all .
They are both certain that they have rendered a huge service to their country .
They pretend that their marriage is still alive in spite of the fact that it was buried long ago .
The divorce will be kept a secret until the president retires , the newspaper wrote .
The tabloid dwells upon the reasons which could lead to the possible divorce .
The newspaper believes that George .
W. Bush has been having an affair with US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice .
A former employee of the presidential administration told The National Examiner that Laura Bush once spent her night in a hotel to stay away from the White House .
Laura Bush will reportedly be paid $ 20 million in case she divorces her husband .
It is worthy of note that it was not the first time , when US tabloids wrote about George W. Bush ’s affair with Condoleezza Rice .
Ms. Rice became the center of tabloid gossip in the USA two years ago in July .
Many US newspapers wrote back then that Condi had a love affair with President Bush .
Wayne Madsen , a national security expert , wrote in 2006 that George W. Bush confessed during a session with his psychologist that he was attracted to other women .
Bush reportedly named Condoleezza Rice as an object of his fantasies .
Laura Bush soon heard of the rumors .
The first lady spent that night in Washington ’s May Flower Hotel .
Tabloids wrote that Laura Bush had escaped from the White House after an argument with President Bush which happened because of his supposed affair with Condoleezza Rice .
Evil tongues recalled the story of a Freudian slip which happened to Ms. Rice during an official meeting in Washington .
Condoleezza Rice , who is always meticulous in the choice of her words , reportedly said the following : " As I was telling my husb — " before abruptly breaking off and correcting herself : " As I was telling President Bush . "
Ms. Rice has earned the reputation of the Bush ’s family friend .
She became close to President Bush mainly because of the fact that she is the only person who finds a common language with Bush to teach him wisdom of foreign politics .
Indeed , unlike her predecessor , Colin Powell , Ms. Rice is in a very close relationship with President Bush .
She talks to him on the phone at least once a day .
Mark McKinnon , former media advisor for President Bush , said that it would not be hard for Condoleezza Rice to take a higher position because this woman has unlimited political potential .
“ She 's a superfecta : a Republican , a woman , an African American and secretary of state , " he said .
" I do n't think there 's a hotter star on the Republican political horizon than Condi Rice , " McKinnon said .

FORT RILEY , Kan . 
When Specialist Jeremy Hall held a meeting last July for atheists and freethinkers at Camp Speicher in Iraq , he was excited , he said , to see an officer attending .
But minutes into the talk , the officer , Maj . Freddy J. Welborn , began to berate Specialist Hall and another soldier about atheism , Specialist Hall wrote in a sworn statement .
“ People like you are not holding up the Constitution and are going against what the founding fathers , who were Christians , wanted for America ! ” Major Welborn said , according to the statement .
Major Welborn told the soldiers he might bar them from re-enlistment and bring charges against them , according to the statement .
Last month , Specialist Hall and the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , an advocacy group , filed suit in federal court in Kansas , alleging that Specialist Hall ’s right to be free from state endorsement of religion under the First Amendment had been violated and that he had faced retaliation for his views .
In November , he was sent home early from Iraq because of threats from fellow soldiers .
Last week I attended a coaching seminar where Marc Lammers , the coach of the Dutch women 's national field hockey team , gave the keynote speech .
This team is the most successful in World Cup history , having won the title six times .
While listening to his speech I started to realize why this team has achieved such outstanding results .
Their success is owed , to a great extent , to his way of coaching .
Marc Lammers has discovered critical ingredients that can unleash the power of a team , as a whole , and each individual that is part of the team , in unforseen ways .
I was truly inspired .
This article summarises the principles he discovered and describes how they can be applied in software development .
Being a ScrumMaster myself , I realized that the principles he discovered can be applied in my own Scrum team too .
The reason is that they are , in essence , applicable to all kinds of teams , no matter whether they assemble cars , play hockey or develop software .
In this article I 'd like to share some of Marc Lammers ' coaching secrets and experiences revealed during that seminar and how they can be translated into the daily Scrum / project practice .
With this knowledge you probably wo n't be able to win the World Cup , but if you do n't watch out you might make your development team perform beyond your own and your customer 's wildest expectations .
Principle 1 :
Use the power of effective communication
Marc Lammers :
In the early days of my coaching carrier I spent considerable amounts of energy to make myself understood .
So , I explained my brilliant coaching strategies to my team in lengthy speeches .
In order to make sure that they got my message I used to ask : ' Did everybody understand ? '
To my satisfaction they all nodded .
However , the way they played proved that they apparently did NOT understand .
Seemingly they did not listen to me .
Consequently , I started to talk louder , more aggressive and confronting .
Unfortunately , it did not help .
When I told my own coach that with this bunch of untalented deafos nothing serious could be achieved , he told me that it was all my fault .
He showed me the results of communication research , which discovered the following : ' One can remember :
10 % of what we hear
35 % of what we see
55 % of what we hear and see
70 % of what we rephrase
90 % of what we rephrase and do .
This opened my eyes .
I started to use open questions , made them rephrase my strategies and created room for dialog and interaction .
Not only did they better understand my concepts I also started to grasp their concerns , from which I could learn a great deal .
From then on I had a seamless match between what was spoken before the game and what was finally played . "
Related to Scrum , I can use this lesson in all areas where knowledge or information is exchanged .
Think of design sessions , communication of requirements to developers or business people , explaining the development process to a business person or new team member , you name it .
In all these areas mutual understanding can be dramatically improved when using open questions , dialog style communication , rephrasing etc. , because it forces all participants to reveal what they really understand or think .
This in return is the basis for a trustful and respectful relationship , which is , in my eyes , the most important productivity accelerator there is .
I already had discovered some of these laws in my daily Scrum practice .
Nevertheless , it is a precious reminder of how much benefit effective communication can bring .
Principle 2 :
Only a different way of doing produces different results
The communication story above contains another important principle .
When Marc Lammers was experiencing that his initial way of communicating did not work , he first tried harder , instead of reflecting about what he was doing .
I think that 's human .
Whenever we do not get the expected result we are biased to think that we just did n't try hard enough .
As a result , we work more hours , talk harder , use more energy , work on the weekend and so on .
In most cases we wo n't get far with it , as Marc 's own experience proves .
Only when he took a totally different stance towards the problem did he accomplish the desired result .
There are many cases where this principle applies .
Think of how Scrum facilitates estimates .
Instead of working with function points that are not related to the capacity a particular team can deliver , Scrum relies on empirical team velocity and complexity points , which proved to be surprisingly accurate in practice .
So , instead of refining function point analysis and bring it to perfection , Scrum takes a total different approach , which excels in simplicity and accuracy .
Another example where this principle often is mistreated is the tendency to ask people to work overtime when a deadline is approaching , which apparently cannot be met with the current effort .
Though it might be necessary incidentally , structurally it is proven that this approach is a mere treatment of symptoms , and in the long run it is useless .
It does not only have severe consequences for team spirit and the health of team members , it also harms the quality of the software .
The bug rate increases , and with it the workload to fix the introduced bugs .
As a result , there is significant risk that things get worse by tackling this problem with overtime .
Scrum offers a more promising way to deal with this problem in the form of an emergency procedure , which in essence is a concrete application of the described principle .
When it becomes evident that a deadline cannot be met , Scrum 's emergency procedure suggests to consider the following actions : first , hold a retrospective to see which major impediments can be removed to boost productivity .
Second , if no significant productivity improvements are discovered by applying Procedure One , think of which concrete tasks can be outsourced to an expert .
This expert will not be part of the team , but only solve isolated tasks for which the team does not have the expertise .
Third , if there are no such tasks , try to re-scope .
Finally , if the client does not agree with re-scoping , the sprint has to be aborted .
As a summary , having the courage to radically reconsider and change the current way of doing is the only structural solution in the long run .
Even though it is a challenging choice to take in practice , the chance of achieving the expected goal is much higher than if the team is sent on a death march .
Principle 3 :
Innovation is a powerful means to produce better results , not a goal by itself .
Moreover , be aware of the side effects .
Marc Lammers :
" I 'm constantly looking for innovation .
During the Olympic Games I felt that I could not see critical parts of the game well enough from outside the field in order to give advice about how to play corners .
We used to analyse video fragments after the game but for me this was too late .
I wanted it realtime .
After some unsuccessful trials with a laptop that was connected to the tv-camera with a long cable I came up with the idea of video classes .
These are a set of glasses with little screens in it on which I see all the tv-cameras capture .
I got in touch with some engineers and some months later I could test the first prototype .
From then on I could give much more detailed advice to my players .
There are three important things to mention when working with innovations I 'd like to share with you :
Innovation must always serve a purpose .
I 've been tempted many times to innovate for the sake of innovation , which does not lead to an improvement .
There must be a clear challenge innovation has to solve .
Each innovation has growing pains .
Do n't expect it to work the first time .
It needs tweaking and tuning until it gives you the competitive advantage you want .
Innovation causes resistance .
Everything that 's new frightens people .
This fact has two implications :
First , when you encounter resistance you probably found a real innovation , so be proud of yourself .
Second , find a way to deal with resistance .
Do n't expect others to embrace your novelty .
Give the others time to adapt and get used to it . "
I 'm convinced that if software development took these simple wisdoms seriously , many more projects would succeed .
It teaches me the following :
Regarding purpose :
From my experience , lack of purpose is most evident when looking at the way tools are used .
I 've seen many projects that are tool - centred instead of result - oriented .
The main concern is not about delivering good software , but how to use the tools as efficiently as possible .
That 's why the " start - out - without - any - sophisticated - tools " probably works so well in practice .
Using a whiteboard and some stickies is often much more effective than a sophisticated chain of tools , because it forces the team to interact and focus on the challenges at hand .

Regarding growing pains :
Most changes in a project environment cause growing pains .
No matter whether a new member joins the team , a new technology is chosen , a new process is used etc. expectations tend to be too optimistic .
Knowing that growing pain is a natural consequence of change enables us to get a realistic rather than optimistic view through which we can anticipate accordingly .

Knowing that growing pain is a natural consequence of change enables us to get a realistic rather than optimistic view through which we can anticipate accordingly .
Regarding resistance :
For example , when introducing agile development practices such as Scrum in organisations , resistance is a common response .
Marc 's story taught me to expect such a reaction and find ways to deal with it , rather than to judge and fight against it .
When introducing something new , patience and attention to the resistor 's concerns are much more effectual than relentless persuasion and pushing for change .
Principle 4 :
Continuously challenge your way of working
Marc Lammers :
" Our training program included many 30 meter sprints .
The team excessively had to train this , because for ages it is common practice to train 30 meter sprints .
Then I had this idea to analyse the running pattern during a game .
In order to achieve that , we equipped each player with a GPS for some training sessions .
Analysis of the data showed that , on averag, e a player performs 15 meter sprints rather than 30 meter ones .
Due to that we were able to make our training plan better match our real needs .
Another small improvement was born . "
This story teaches me two things :
Keep asking yourself WHY you do the things you do .
Is a particular activity done because ' we always ' did it , or does it really add value to the whole ?
What concrete value does it add ?
Is it in proportion to the work that needs to be performed ?
If you can't come up with a satisfying answer for the questions above , start measuring .
Measuring is knowing .
Measuring allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the countermeasures or adjustments and to see whether an improvement has been achieved .
Measuring can be something simple as ' just stop performing a particular activity and see what happens ' .
From my experience much time is wasted daily because the way of work is simply taken for granted and not questioned .
The mere repetition of a task over a time makes it seem justified , even if it does not add value at all .
When looking for productivity improvements , questioning the established way followed by measuring change is very effective .
Principle 5 :
Focus on people 's strengths not weaknesses
Marc Lammers :
We had this player that would n't score , because her backhand was miserable .
I did everything to train her backhand but without success .
She hardly improved despite our huge effort .
Since the focus was on her backhand it was no wonder that the other players passed the ball to her backhand she could n't really handle .
When I was close to desperation I asked her how she would like the ball to be played ?
She answered : ' actually here , on my forehand ' .
Convinced that she was no good at all we started training her forehand .
What I saw I could hardly believe : nearly all the passes she got she handled smoothly and swiftly .
After some intensive training with her forehand she tripled her scoring as well as her self - consciousness .
My initial approach shows how dull uniformity is created .
I wanted to improve her backhand skill from a 4 to a 6 assuming a scale of 10 , whereas her forehand was naturally an 8 but because it was not trained it became a 6 too .
After training her forehand she increased from an 8 to a 9 making her outstanding .
What a terrible waste it was to focus and try to improve on her weakness instead of her strengths . "
Whenever a team member does n't function the way he / she should ( e.g. undisciplined , inexperienced , chaotic , unfriendly etc. ) , the focus naturally lies on these negative aspects of that person .
This story teaches me that , by consciously scanning a person for skills rather than shortcomings , a much better result can be achieved for both the person AND the team .
It 's a matter of finding a way to live with the negative aspect of that person and foster the good ones .
Principle 6 :
Give the team controllable challenges
Marc Lammers :
" Before the start of a game I thought it was a good idea to motivate the team with phrases like : ' we really need to win , otherwise we 're out ' .
The effect was rather the contrary , it did not help them to perform better .
Initially I was wondering why .
Now I know .
The problem is that the individual player has no chance to influence the outcome of the game by himself .
Even though she does his very best there are too many other factors she cannot control and which can be decisive for the outcome .
This lack of control made them tensed and nervous hindering them to function optimally .
I realized that winning or losing is merely the result of the way we play .
The good news is that each individual player CAN influence the way she plays .
So instead of talking about winning or losing before a game we carefully repeat our strategy before a game as well as the personal things each player has to pay attention to .
That 's concrete and much better controllable .
Through this approach they are much more relaxed and in a condition to bring the very best out of them .
Our results proved that . "
For me as a ScrumMaster this shows me how little value there is in telling a team that we must deliver a certain amount of functionality in a year from now .
It 's beyond their control and therefore not motivating .
Even in a single sprint , it makes little sense to remind the team of its commitment to deliver the agreed functionality since it only increases pressure .
If a lack of pressure is the problem it might be effective but in most cases that 's not the real issue .
Marc 's lesson teaches me to focus on the next little productivity improvement the team or a team member can achieve .
Is there an impediment that keeps them from not delivering ?
Can we hire an expert for a technology the team is not acquainted with ?
Is pair programming an option for those who get stuck but do n't call for help ?
Is time spent on valueless documents ?
Such concrete problems can be controlled and their resolution automatically leads to more productivity and therefore increases the chance to meet the project schedule .
Principle 7 :
Look around in your ' own world ' and you only see limitations .
Look at other ones and you see possibilities .
Marc Lammers :
" In hockey , there are 38 ways how corner can be played .
During a match I instruct my team how it has to play it .
In order to do that I developed a sophisticated body sign language all players had to learn by heart .
The problem was that the competition recorded and analysed this language and finally decoded it .
Consequently , they knew , what I was up to and my competitive advantage was under pressure .
Coincidentally , I was invited to join the Dutch cycle team during the Tour de France .
By chance I discovered that they used radio sets to stay in touch with the cyclists .
I thought : ' wow , if we had this , I could regain my competitive advantage at once . '
When I returned home , I secretly studied the rules , where nothing about radio communication was mentioned .
Therefore , I correctly assumed that it must be allowed .
I got in touch with a company that produces radio sets in the size of an earplug , since the ones cyclists use are too bulky .
After some adjustments the first prototype was operational .
The beautiful thing was that we kept our innovation top secret and continued using the body sign language in order to confuse the competition .
For 1,5 years we were able to stay undetected and fool the competition before they found out . "
Agile and Scrum , partly is the result of another discipline 's best practices , namely Toyota 's lean principles , that were adapted to the software industry .
Apparently someone else had this idea before …
Porting the story above to Scrum , I realize that when Scrum is combined with practices from related methodologies it can become considerably more powerful and suitable .
To mention some examples , I personally had good experiences with the Unified Process 's architectural - centric , risk - und usecase - driven approach , XP 's sustainable pace philosophy as well as test - driven development and ( customized forms of ) pair programming .
Combining and playing with the ingredients of other methodologies creates the process that suites your needs .
This story has taught me to look differently at other areas that are not related to software development and see what it can contribute .
There is a bunch of good stuff out there , discovering and integrating it into our own world is the art .
Principle 8 :
If a goal is perceived as important then motivation is high
Marc Lammers :
" From a financial perspective it is madness to become a hockey player .
They are paid a scholarship , which is hardly enough to survive .
In spite of the dire financial reality applicants wait in queues to join .
The notion that they can win and be part of that winning team , which gets media coverage all over the world , is much more powerful than money or whatsoever . "
From a rational point of view it should not make a difference for which purposes a developer writes a class .
In practice it does .
It is a huge difference whether the very same class is written for a technical library of an internal utility project or for the new NASA website from which the next expedition to Mars can be followed in real time .
Marc 's lesson reminds me that the best way to motivate a team is to make them feel that what they are doing is important and makes a difference .
Certain projects have this perception by nature .
Upon delivery they get media coverage , are part of an advertising campaign or it has impact on society .
In these cases not much needs to be done .
However , the majority of projects have much less visibility , even though they can be very challenging .
With relatively little effort motivation and work , pleasure can be boosted by improving the project 's visibility and importance .
For example :
Celebrate a successful release .
Invite ' important ' people and let them give a speech to express appreciation and the importance of the project to them ;
Tell the organisation what you 're doing , by communicating a new release or project progress to users ( do n't forget to add a picture of the team ) , write about it in the company newsletter etc .
Invite the head of department or CEO to visit your project and introduce him to the team .
Realizing the importance of motivation can be the critical factor to make productivity soar .
Conclusion
Most of the principles described in this article sound like common sense .
However , keep in mind that the application of these has made the Dutch hockey women the best in the world .
As with all theories and principles the art is to use and apply them in practice .
When I heard Marc Lammers talking I became aware of how he does that : with joyful enthusiasm , lots of self - reflection and an eager spirit for discovering and experimenting with new ways of doing .
This brings me to my last principle :
Combine a competitive spirit with fun and a healthy portion of self - reflection and all of the principles above come naturally .
It 's as simple as that .

Any major steps by the Bush administration to control air pollution or reduce emissions of heat - trapping gases came to a dead end on Friday , the combined result of a federal court ruling and a decision by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency .
In the morning , a federal appeals court struck down the cornerstone of the administration ’s strategy to control industrial air pollution by agreeing with arguments by the utility industry that the E.P.A. had exceeded its authority when it established the Clean Air Interstate Rule in 2005 .
The court , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , said the rule , which set new requirements for major pollutants , had “ fatal flaws . ”
A few hours later , the E.P.A. chief rejected any obligation to regulate heat - trapping gases like carbon dioxide under existing law , saying that to do so would involve an “ unprecedented expansion ” of the agency ’s authority that would have “ a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy , ” touching “ every household in the land . ”
Taken together , the developments make it clear that any significant new effort to fight air pollution will fall to the next president .

From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 21 )
I want to help you , but unfortunately I do not have a savings or checking account .
Is it possible to have a check sent to me directly ?
I would then use this check to open a bank account ( Key Bank has free checking for a limited time so please hurry ) .
I am very excited about this opportunity .
I have never been good with money so you can only imagine how happy I got when I read your email .
My grin is ear to ear baby .
I know you said this is confidential but I had to share it with my friend Brad Fairyman .
He was a little skeptical but I told him " NO BRAD , I will not let you rain on my parade ! "
He thinks I should ask you for proof but I said " the proof 's in the check .
Yeah baby ! "
Between me and you Albert , Brad has always been a little jealous of me ever since my promotion .
I 'll tell you that story another time though .
Anyways , do you ever see yourself coming out to Barlow , Oregon ( Pop. 125 ) .
I was born and raised here so I can show you all the hot spots .
You are a nice guy and I think you would like it here .
With this new money your sending me , I 'd love buy a drink at Flash Dancers ( a fine eating establishment located just off the interstate ) .
My wife Agnus works there .
Meeting Agnus was the best thing that has ever happened to me until now .
I think you will like her .
Anyway Albert , let me know if you can send a check and I will tell you where to send it .
I do n't want you to send it to my house because I would like to surprise Agnus .
You see , her weight has ballooned from 145 to 190 in the past two years and she really wants to join that Jenny Craig program .
I always told her , " NO AGNUS , it 's too expensive and this is the weight that our lord and savior Jesus Christ wants you at . "
Now with this money , I can make her dream come true .
Jeez Ablert , you are like our guardian angel or something .
Thanks
Mike

From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 23 )
Albert ,
I can't tell you how excited I was to find 2 emails from you in my computer this morning .
I know I 'm supposed to keep this secret , but I could n't help but to tell Agnus ( my wife ) about your email .
She was so excited , she took me out to dinner at a restaurant called Roy Rogers .
Anyway , I 've been so excited , but I 'm kind of scared too .
As I said before , my friggin ' friend Brad Fairyman always tells me to be careful about things , and I promised I would .
Now , listen here Albert , I BELIEVE YOU .
I want to help you but I have a couple of questions :
1. I noticed your name changed between emails .
Your first email you were Albert Fredthe ( Chief Accounting Officer ) .
Now your just Albert Fred .
What happened ?
Personally , I think Fredthe is a beautiful name , so I would go with that .
2 . As I said before , I want to help you , but do n't currently have a bank account .
Rumor has it that Key Bank is going to give me $ 10 to open up a checking account in November , so I might wait until then
3 . Brad suggested that I get some type of picture of you or something , just so I know you 're real .
If you can email me one , that would be great .
( Try not to be laying down in the picture , my wife might get the wrong idea ) .
Anyway Albert , I have to get going so that I can work on the car ( I think the Carburetor is acting up again ) .
I can't wait for you to see it .
It 's a Chevy Nova with peanut butter interior .
A real beauty !
I know ever since Jeff ( my real dad ) left , I have trust issues ( or so my guidance counselor used to say ) , BUT I DO TRUST YOU .
Please be patient with me because I want to help you .
If there is one word to describe me , it is " HELPING OTHERS " .
Thank you .
Mike
PS - Are you a doctor as well ?
I noticed you sign your name with DR .
Is being a CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER a hobby for you ?
If you are a doctor , Agnus has a condition I 'd like to talk to you about .
I 'll wait for your response just in case the DR .
stands for something else .
Let me know .
From Albert Fred to Mike Hunt ( Oct. 23 )

NOTE : KINDLY SEND ME YOUR TEL , FAX AND MOBILE NUMBER FOR EASY COMMUNICATION .
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 24 )
Dear Albert ,
I have attached a photo of my wife ( Agnus ) and I .
This is a glamour shot so it was expensive .
You should feel lucky to have a copy of it .
We had to drive all the way to Portland , OR .
That was the same day we bought these matching Ruff Ryders medallions .
Are you a DMX fan ?
Agnus and I always pretend that I 'm DMX and she is EVE .
RUFF RYDERS !
WE IN HERE !
Anyways , I thought you were going to send me a photo of your family ?
I was thinking , if this is such secret information , should n't we talk in secret code ?
Lets at least stop using our real names .
From this point forward , I want to be Mr. Bo Jangles .
I will also refer to my wife Agnus as Elle MacPherson .
I think you should pick a name .
I have five suggestions if you do n't have anything in mind :
1. Mr. Bukkake
2. Ryan
3. Lil' Homey
4. Apple Jack
5. 008
If you like one of those names , let me know ASAP .
Also , is it safe to talk by phone .
How can you tell if a line is secure .
Elle MacPhearson says she thinks our phone is tapped because she always hears two clicks when she talks to her girlfriends .
I have to go my friend ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
PS - Have you seen the new Christina Aguilera video .
I think it 's cool but Elle MacPherson thinks she looks like a slut .
From Albert Fred to Mike Hunt ( Oct. 24 )
I AM VERY HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU MR BO JANGLES I AM NOW MR .
BUKKAKE , I LIKE
THE NAME AND I WANT US TO BEFOVER PARTNER IN BUSINESS AND IN FRIENDSHIP .I
TRUST YOU AND I LOVE YOUR WAYS .I LIKE RUFF RYDERS AS WELL AND WITH P.DIDDY
I WANT YOU TO REPLY ME BY E MAIL I WILL LIKE YOU TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME ON E
MAIL.I WANT YOU TO SEND ME YOUR BANK SO THAT THIS FUND WILL BE TRANSFER INTO
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT .
PLEASE ALWAYS GET INTOUCH WITH ME ON THIS E MAIL.I AM VERY
HAPPY FOR YOUR WONDERFUL REPLY AND I LOVE YOU .
I WILL BE EXPECTING YOUR REPLY .HAVE A NICE DAY WITH YOUR WIFE .
MR .BUKKAKE
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 25 )
Dear Mr. Bukkake ,
I 'm glad to hear that you 're down with DMX too .
I know we have only known each other for a week or so , but I have to tell you ... you 're already like a brother , or possibly a father , but not my father , because he walked out on my mom and I hate him for that .
I 'm sorry , you probably do n't want to hear about my " family issues " , but I can't help it .
I will never forget how special you made me feel when I read your email and you wrote , ( and I quote ) : " I LOVE YOU " .
Around here , a guy usually gets his ass kicked for saying that to another guy , but I know you really meant it .
Elle MacPherson already loves you too and is cleaning out a spot in the basement for you to stay when you can get out of here .
( You are n't allergic to cats are you ? )
I am going to go try to open up a bank account in November , but I may need some help .
I 'm not really good at money and am hoping to do it well .
Do you think they will have Snoopy checks ?
I hope so .
No ... I mean I REALLY hope so .
( Snoopy was my nicname in band ) .
Are you married ?
If so , Elle MacPherson would love to talk to her , and maybe she can come out and visit
too .
Elle MacPherson gets lonely and says I'm " neglectful " .
I tell her ( in my best DMX voice ) : " Shut up bitch and go make me a sandwich ! " .
Then I tell her I 'm joking .
You see , I love my wife , but I have to keep it real , you know ... straight thuggin' .
Anyway , I hope to see of a picture of you soon .
I bet you 're handsome .
Just promise me one thing .
When you come over here , do not hit on my wife .
I know she 's way too good looking for me , but she 's mine anyway .
I got to go , the people 's court is on .
Peace out ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
( How old are you anyway .
You sound pretty young )
From Albert Fred to Mike Hunt ( Oct. 25 )
DEAR MIKE HUNT ,
IN RERGARDS TO YOUR E MAIL MESSAGE , I KOWN YOU ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE MAN AND I WANT YOU TO KOWN THAT I AM IN NIGERIA AND I YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE PAYMENT OF US$ 4,500 DOLLARS FOR THE APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT WHICH WILL DETERMINE YOU AS THE BONAFIDE BENEFICIARY OF THE SAID FUND .
YOU MUST MAKE THE PAYMENT OF US$ 4,500 DOLLARS TO MR JOHN OKEKE LAGOS NIGERIA BY WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER TODAY.SO THAT I WILL SECURE APPROVALS OF THE FUND BY THIS APPLICATION FORM WHICH YOUR BANKING INFORMATION WILL BE USE TO EFFECT THE PAYMENT .
KINDLY DO THAT TODAY .I WILL BE EXPECTING YOUR REPLY .
ALBERT FRED
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 25 )
Dear Mr. Bukkake ,
I have no idea why you have decided to stop using our code names .
I 'm acting like a trained professional and you 're coming off like an bush league armature .
DON'T BLOW THIS FOR US MAN !
I have another problem that I need your expert advice on .
Remember my ex-friend / co - worker Brian Fairyman ?
Well , he wants in .
He also wants his code name to Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) .
He 's threatening to take this to the FBI , CIA , Humane Society and the NCAA if we do n't make him a partner .
Now Mr. Bukkake , we have two choices : 1 . make him a partner or 2 . take him out .
I have attached a photo of Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) .
As you can tell from the picture , he means business .
My gut tells me we can trust him .
If you disagree , will have to go with option number 2 .
Unfortunately , you 'll have to perform option number 2 by yourself .
Do n't ask me why , you 're just going to have to do it .
I looked up ticket cost on priceline .com for a round - trip flight from Nigeria to Portland , OR and it 's not going to be that bad .
If we decide to go with option 2 , I will have Elle MacPhearson pick you up and take you to the drop - off point .
I would pick you up but I feel that Elle MacPhearson blends into a crowd better .
Plus she speaks English , Spanish , Ebonics , Sign Language , and Pig Latin .
She is also a master of disguise if you two get in a bind , she can make you look exactly like Richard Gere in Pretty Woman .
She will be equipped with 3 Ninja Throwing Stars and Knumchuks .
If you prefer another type of weapon , let us know .
If your wondering where I got the idea for option 2 , please rent American Ninja 4 : The Annihilation starring Mike Dudikoff , David Bradley and directed by Cedric Sundstrom .
It 's a fool - proof plan my fiend .
If you think Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) can be trusted , than option 1 it is .
If you can't do option 2 , then we will definitely be going with option # 1 because the last thing we need is a representative from the Humane Society on our tail .
I think he would be a good partner , I just do n't liked to be bossed around .
My real father use to call me fat and tell me " get your lazy ass of the couch and get me another beer boy . "
I would say " YOUR NOT THE BOSS OF ME ! "
Then he would tell me that he was going to take a hit out on me through Jenny Craig .
He use to pick up the phone and pretend he was talking to her .
Scared the hell out of me and forced me to always look over my shoulder .
Needless to say , I do n't like being bossed around .
Since you will be going to the video store later , I would also like to suggest some other movies that you could learn a thing or two from :
1. Jame Bond : From Russia with Love
2. Conspiracy Theory starring Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson .
3. Breakin' 2 - Electric Boogaloo starring Turbo and Ozone .
4. Yental
5. Austin Powers 1
If we are going to do this we are going to do it right .
I feel these movies are " must haves " for anyone in the spy / undercover / pimp / gangsta game .
Look how much I 've learned since Monday .
Mr. Bukkake , I trust you .
Tally Hoe !
Mr. Bo Jangles

DR . ALBERT FRED
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 28 )
Mr. Bukkake ,
What happened to you ?!
Are you losing your mind ?
You 're using our REAL NAMES AGAIN .
I mean , that 's the kind of stuff the NCAA and PETA use to bring smart guys like us down .
Do you not understand I am trying to help you out .
You write me about being secret and then I hear from some Dr. Ulaoma Okoro .
Who is that ?
Is everybody in Nigeria a Doctor ?
( Actually , if they are ,
Agnus has a question about a wart . )
Anyway , back to the point .
All of you are very unprofessional and from now on , I 'M IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT .
Now , I was watching some reruns of " You ca n't do that on television " and it gave me an idea :
Let 's use some super secret codes so that nobody will understand what we are talking about , except for us .
I am an expert in talking like a
spy ( I own a lot of James Bond movies ) .
So here is the plan :
You HAVE to use these words or else people will know what we are doing .
From now on we are going to use code words for the following :
the phrase " doing business " is now " break dancing " the word " bank account " will now be referred to as " Stephanie " all the following numbers will change :
0 = x
1 = purple
2 = ^^
3 = linebacker
4 = bling bling
5 = " It 's nice outside "
6 = <->
7 = LIAR !
8 = zero
9 = zoro
For exampel ...
I am ^^linebacker years old .
( I am 23 years old ) .
Please understand , this code is for you and I 's protection .
Now for the " Stephanie " .
I found my friend Ariel ( Lord of Darkness ) 's library card number for his " Stephanie " .
The number is x bling bling LIAR !
" It 's nice outside " zero purple purple " It 's nice outside " ^^ x bling bling zoro <-> LIAR !
He said if that does n't work , he has some McGift Certificates .
By the way , who is this " John Okeke " guy anyway .
I do n't like his name .
It sounds gay .
Is he gay ?
I hope not .
Anyway , we should go .
I 'm looking forward to break dancing with you Mr. Bukake .
Love ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
From Albert Fred to Mike Hunt ( Oct. 29 )
MR. BO JANGLES ,
IN REGARDS TO YOUR E MAIL MESSAGE , I UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT YOU WANT US TO USE CODE FOR COMMUNICATION .THE ONLY CODE I PREFER IS MY NIKE NAME WHICH IS MR .

MR.BUKKAKE
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 29 )
Dr. Mr. Bukkake ( AKA : Forgetful Partner ) ,
I 'm glad you have come to your senses about our code names .
I was talking to Elle MacPhearson yesterday and she thinks you stop using the name Mr. Bukkake because you do n't like it .
I told her that I think you are a forgetful person .
I have a cousin who cannot remember to open the sliding glass door when he runs out of the house .
Every time he runs to go outside he smacks right into the glass door .
He 's a good example of a forgetful person .
He 's also mentally retarded so we cut him some slack .
Are you mentally retarded ?
If not , ALWAYS USE THE CODE NAMES !!!!!!!
Anyway , Elle MacPhearson is forcing me to give you the option to pick a new name .
She came up with five new names if you do n't like Mr. Bukkake .
I personally hate all of them .
I think Mr. Bukkake is a fine name .
Anyway , here they are in no particular order :
1. Dr. Papshmear
2. Nutty Blumpkin ( this one is actually not that bad )
3. Jeff
4. The Cleveland Steamer
5. DJ Jazzy Jeff
If you want to change your name , let me know .
Speaking of forgetful , I went to Western Union this morning .
I wore a disguise .
Elle MacPhearson made it .
I 'm supposed to look like Robin Williams .
I have attached a photo of it so you can see just how good Elle MacPhearson is at make up and disguises .
Anyway , Mr. Know - It - All , that 's Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) by the way , let me use his bike to drive over there .
He said it would be better because someone could recognize my car and know it 's me .
It 's a 10 Mile ride so you can only imagine how tired I
was .
You can also imagine how shocked I was when I got there and they had know idea who MR JOHN OKEKE LAGOS NIGERIA was .
They had never heard of him .
They had no clue what I was talking about .
Then I thought maybe you left me a message there with instructions .
I said " do you have a message for a Mr. Bo Jangles from a Mr. Bukkake ? " and they just laughed at me .
Everyone was laughing ; other customers , cash register girl , cleaning guy and the manager .
I had n't been laughed at like that since I performed " We Built This City " by Starship at my six grade talent show .
Needless to say , we will no longer be using Western Union .
Those guys are assholes !
So no you tell me Mr. Bukkake .
Is this a game to you ?
Do you like to send me on
wild geese chases ?
I peddled ten miles with this Robin Williams disguise on .
It was hot out .
You told me to tell Western Union about sending Mr. John Okeke money and that 's what I did .
They laughed at me .
I AM NOT AN ANIMAL !
I peddled back to hear more ridicule from Arial ( The Lord of Darkness ) .
He 's like " ha ha " and " you 're just Mr. Bukkake 's ass clown . "
These types of things hurt my feelings man .
I know I come off super tough but there 's another side of me .
That whole Western Union experience reminds me of the movie Glitter with Mariah Carey .
Anyway , get it together Mr. Bukakke !
You 've turned this whole operation into one big giant butt - fuck - a- thon .
Stop shooting from the hip .
You are letting me and Elle MacPhearson down .
I 'm going to ask you a question and I want a serious answer :
Mr. Bukkake , ARE YOU AFRAID OF SUCCESS ?
If you are , than maybe I should work with Okeke directly .
I 'm sure he would n't be happy to hear about the Western Union debacle .
I 'm taking it down from love to like .
I like you and I think you are forgetful .
Mr. Bo Jangles
DISGUISE PHOTO
EBOLA MONKEY NOTE : OK , now me and my buddy were sure that Albert was n't going to respond .
Look at this photo .
It looks nothing like the original photo I sent of Mike Hunt and his girlfriend .

I LOVE YOU FOREVER .
MR.BUKKAKE ,
From Micahel Hunt to Albert Fred ( Oct. 30 )
Mr. Bukakke ,
You know you really put me in an emotional cunundrum .
First off , you are the first man to ever tell me he loves me .
Not even my rotten , no good abandoning father ever said that .
( You know what I would do to him if I had him alone in a room ?
Of course you do n't , you 're not me Mr. Bukakke .
I would scare him really bad and make him crap his pants .
Then I would stick his nose in it ...... just like they do puppies ! )
Anyway , stop interrupting me .
Back to the point .
One moment you love me and I can see us being best friends the rest of our lives , the next minute you 're forgetting to use our knik names ( Yes , Mr. Bukakke , that is how you spell knik name ... not NIKE , that 's a shoe .
Remember Mike Jordan ? )
Anyway , I have love for you Mr. Bukakke .
I really do .
I know somewhere deep inside you are a good man .
I just think you got a lot of growing up to do .
There is no " I " in team , but apparently there is an " I " in Mr. Bukakke .
I want to help you transfer money , but you know what , the $ 300,000 or so that I would get may not be worth the emotional pain you put me through .
To be honest Mr. Bukakke , I have spent the past 14 hours with a box of Kleenex and a 24 pac of Milwaukee 's Best .
( They had a special at Sav - Mart ) .
Agnus has asked why I 'm crying and I tell her I just got done watching " The Bridges of Madison County " with Clint Eastwood and tell her to shut up and make me a sandwich .
I do n't have the heart to tell her about your unprofessionalism .
As for the Western Union fiasco , you had me believing it was as easy as " Give my buddy in Nigeria some money " .
It was n't .
I do n't think you understand how it made me feel when they laughed at me .
I mean , they laughed for a good 10 minutes .
As I rode away in my costume on my bike , I heard a couple of them shouting : " Ride on MonkeyBoy , I think the circus is accepting applications ! "
That stings .
I have needs .
I am a loving person who was trying to do the right thing FOR YOU !!!
Now , I do n't want to be a " Negative Nelly " , but I 'm starting to doubt that $ 300,000 is worth the heart break this whole situation is causing me .
I love you , and would like to help you , but you make me doubt myself .
My inner child is saying FORGET IT , but my wife is saying GET US SOME MONEY FOR ONCE YOU LAZY A__HOLE !
( My wife no longer lets me curse ) .
Anyway , what should I do now ?
Hmmm .
Only time will tell .
Maybe I 'll try to get to Western Union today .
I need to have Elle MacPhearson think of a new disguise because I will not be laughed at again .
Do you know who Western Union 's competitor is ?
If so , do you know their prices ?
Maybe you can do a cost analysis / breakdown / comparison .
Just so we know we are not getting screwed .
Mr. Bo Jangles
I 'm really beginning to hate Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) .
I wish we would n't of made him a partner .
He seems to just want to make fun of me which is not cool .
It 's to bad because we could have been the next " Kagney and Lacy " or " Laurel and Hardy . "

MR BUKAKK E ,
To Albert Fred from Mike Hunt ( Oct. 31 )
Dear Mr. Bukakke ,
I went down to complete the transaction this morning but had second thoughts .
You see , I do n't think you respect me as a person .
Over the past week , our relationship has gone from 0 to 73 miles per hour .
It is truly a classic tale filled with suspense , action , drama , gatorade , and suspense .
I got to thinking yesterday after I met with my therapist .
I have no friends ( except for my dog , Mr. Winkle , who I have attached a photo of in the message ) .
This forces me to eat massive amounts of food .
I know what your
thinking , what about Elle Macphearson ?
She 's great and all , but she 's more of wife than anything .
Do you know what I mean ?
Have you ever heard the song " No Tears " by Scarface .
There is a verse that goes :
" I 've got my pistol pon cock
Ready to lick shots non-stop
Until I see your monkey - ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit
you muthafuckas know who run it
So when you put this muthafucka to the test
You gotta realize somethin ( you fuckin with the very best )
I 've got this killer up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother , so I talk to my diary "
That song is like me speaking from the heart .
My therapist says I need to take medication but I do n't think I do .
My archeologist says it 's just Winonaryder syndrome .
I 'm rambling .
Forgive me .
Now if you would just let me finish .
Besides Mr. Winkle , you are my only friend .
Mr. Winkle and I hang out a lot .
I always dress him in funny outfits .
We go fishing , we go to the movies , judo classes , have our own rap group , and eat .
He says that if you and I are as good of friends as we claim to be , then I should know as much about you as you do me .
So I compiled a list of things that I want to know about you before I break dance with you .
1 . Send me a photo of you .
2 . Send me a photo of your family ( ex. wife , brother , sister , dog )
3 . Tell me about where you live .
I hear Nigeria is nice in the winter .
I would like to go there one day and see the Eiffel Tower and those crazy kangaroos that are always running around .
4 . What was it like becoming a doctor ?
5 . What was it like growing up Jewish ?
6 . Who do you think is more sexy Ricardo Montalban or Eric Estrada ( circle
one ) .
7 . Would you say you listen or wait to talk ?
Please answer all these questions and include photos .
I just want to know you better Mr. Bukakke .
You are my second best friend next to Mr. Winkle .
Waiting anxiously for your reply ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
PS - Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) says you would totally like him better than me if all three of us met .
Please tell me that is not true .
For Paul 's sake , the guy still wears a Members Only jacket .
He 's got to be the only member left in that club .
PSS -
You are a doctor so you might know this :
Are McDonald 's French fries as fattening as everybody says they are ?
EBOLA MONKEY NOTE : Is n't Mr. Winkle the cutest dog you have ever seen .
Go ahead , try to look at him without smiling .
EBOLA MONKEY NOTE : OK , PrePaid Legal was n't doing anything for him .
Lets try Amway now .
Maybe he will respond to a little multi-level marketing .
From Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) to Albert Fred ( Oct. 31 )

To Albert Fred from Mike Hunt ( Oct. 31 )
Dear Mr. Bukakke ,
I am writing you with terrible news .
I hope you are sitting down .
Today ....
Oh my god .
OK OK .
Pull it together Mr. Bo Jangles .
Today , we lost a true American icon .
They got Jam Master Jay from Run DMC Mr. Bukakke .
It was a head shot .
He died immediately .
The only suspect the police have is some guy named Herve Villechaize who goes by the alias Tattoo ( he sounds mean ) .
I was actually on my way to the bank to send you over $ 1000 when I heard the news .
I turned around and ran home because I figured you would want to know .
I 'm sorry .
You must be devastated .
You might already know this .
This could be why you have n't written me back and answered my questions .
I am just as upset as you are .
Mr. Winkle wo n't even eat or get out of bed .
I 'm not sure if I 'm going to tell Elle MacPhearson today .
It might be too much .
I will keep you posted as more news on the situation is leaked by the Humane Society .
Jam Master Jay 's death makes me start to second guess the lifestyle that guys like me , you , Al Capone , Tony Soprano , Bobby Bouche , Jack Meoff , and Dirk Digler lead .
What do you think ?
My grandpapa use to say " If you lead a pony to water , you can still get that bird to the bush . "
Now I know what he meant .
SO TRUE .
What are your thoughts ?
Please send me photo of yourself and your family immediately .
Your face will bring me comfort .
Also , how would you feel about me coming out to Nigeria .
Mr. Winkle and I could use a vacation after this tragic event .
I could bring you the money .
Just a thought .
I like you ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
PS - I think Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) is a bed wetter .
He has rubber sheets on his bed .
What do you think ?
Please answer me as soon as possible .
PSS - I picture your wife to look like Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth .
Am I close ?
Please send a picture .
PSSS - How is the skiing in Nigeria ?
I bet it 's amazing .
If I come out , will you take me skiing ?
PLEASE o Please o Please .
PSSSS - Mr. Winkle tells me to tell you hi .

Dear Bukakke ,
Thank you for the lovely photos of you and your wife .
You two look very happy .
That must have been some party .
We have parties like that in America but we call them " orgies . "
If I come to Nigeria , you must take me to a party .
If you come to Oregon , I will take you to an orgy .
Deal .
Do you think I should come to Nigeria ?
I think it would be a good idea .
I could bring you the money .
Please let me know .
By the way , does your wife cook ?
My wife tosses salad .
It 's amazing .
I will have her toss your salad if you visit .
She also can make tube steak that melts in your mouth .
Have you ever had a New York Style Taco ?
They are good too .
My sister Jenna is in town for the weekend so I will not get a chance to write you .
I will go to the bank today .
If everything goes right , we will be rich men .
I 've attached a photo of my sister Jenna and I at a orgy / party that we attended last spring .
I 'm very excited because I do n't get to see my sister too much .
She makes movies in Los Angeles and is always busy .
She does n't speak to my family much .
She is very beautiful , unlike me .
Elle MacPhearson does not like her too much .
She gets mad when I watch her movies .
Between me and you , I think Elle MacPhearson is jealous of my sister 's looks .
What do you think of my sister ?
Do you have a sister ?
I would like to buy you a gift for your generosity .
Do you like watches , clothes , analbeads , or c-rings ?
Maybe I could buy your wife some botox or a jizz catcher .
I feel it 's the least I can do for you .
You are a really great guy Bukakke ( I noticed from your last email that we are close enough to drop the whole macho " Mr. " parts to our names ) .
Guys like you always give a reach around .
To infinity and beyond ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
EBOLA MONKEY NOTE :
Yes fellas , that 's Jenna Jamison with some guy .
From Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) to Albert Fred ( Nov. 1 )
Mr. Bukakke ,
What 's up ?
I 'm beginning to think you are not too serious about making making money .
But then I realize , WHO WOULDN'T APPRECIATE BEING THEIR OWN OWN BOSS !
NOBODY .
I 'm telling you now Mr. Bukakke , you would do do very well at Amway .
I think you would have first year income potential potential of at least US $ 22,000 .
That would probably increase to at at least $ 27,000 within 5 years .
That is probably more money money than you have ever seen .
Think of how many Eminem CD 's you you could buy with that .
You could probably lure some attractive women women with that kind of dough , too .
I 'm sure the above paragraph has convinced convinced you that you NEED Amway .
I 'm sure you realized realized you can turn your somewhat miserable life into GOLD and RICHES RICHES if you only accept the opportunity I offer you .
I'M TRYING TO TO GIVE YOU FREE MONEY , AND YOU'RE TELLING ME " HMM , I THINK I WOULD RATHER SIT SIT ON MY ASS ALL DAY AND LOOK AT THE FINE DIRT IN NIGERIA " .
Help me help you Mr. Bukakke .
You could be on on your way to
Krystal and fine ass women ... OR you can not listen to me and be content riding riding mules all day .
---------------
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER YOU ----------------------
Mr. Bukakke , simply provide me with the names names of 10 people ( friends and family included ) who you think would benefit selling Amway products .
Do Do not tell them too much , as you will probably screw it up .
Just say " My friend Ariel Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) was telling about this great business opportunity that is is expanding into our local area ( Nigeria ) and thought you might want to be your own boss ! "
They They will love you Mr. Bukakke .
For doing this , I WILL WAIVE THE APPLICATION APPLICATION FEE OF US $ 45.00 JUST FOR YOU .
Your sucker friends will still have to pay pay .
Please respond quickly as I have only a limited number of positions to fill in Nigeria .
Your Loving Friend Friend ,
Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness )

WHAT IS YOUR TEL AND FAX NUMBER .

I WILL BE EXPECTING YOUR REPLY .
BUKAKKE .
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Nov. 4 )
Dear Bukakke ,
Sorry I did not write you sooner .
I 'm afraid I have some bad news .
I 've been in the hospital for three days .
I was released last night .
While riding my bike to the bank on Friday to transfer the funds , I was unexpectedly mugged by five Mexican guys on the street .
They beat me to a pulp and took everything .
My money order for $ 4500 , shirt , left shoe , Ruff Ryder medallion , and bike were all stolen .
I managed to escape the beating without too much harm other than a broken right arm ( the arm I use to write ) , broken jaw , pulled hamstring , black eye ( left ) , and a bruised ego .
The doctor says I can't eat solid foods for a month but I will lose some weight , which is a good thing .
He also said that my vision in my left eye will go from pitch black to blurry in about a week .
The doctor said he had not seen a man take a beating like that since Rodney King .
The police have not caught these evil men but expect they were part of a local latino gang called Menudo .
All I can do now is wait and pray for revenge .
My sister Jenna tells me " six wrongs do n't make it right " but I want the voices in my head want those bastards to burn in hell .
I 'm just happy to finally be home with Elle MacPhearson and Mr. Winkle .
Do you think you can stall the bank on the payment ?
I need time to come up with the money .
The $ 4500 is all that Elle MacPhearson and I had in our life savings account and I do not know when I will get that back .
Or maybe you could ask your father to let us borrow the money till I can come up with it .
Maybe he could talk to the bank for us .
I know you said he is a king so I 'm sure he has a lot of influence with the banks .
Another option we have is my mom .
She has saved up $ 5000 to donate the " Make A Wish " ( foundation which grants the wishes of children with life - threatening illnesses ) .
There is a small boy named Timmy who only has a couple of months to live .
My mom has grown quite fond of him .
Timmy wish is to be visited by Pam Anderson ( the actress from Baywatch ) in the hospital and her fee for a public appearance is $ 5000 ( non-negotiable ) per visit .
Pam also requires that she gets $ 50 ( every fifth one is half off ) per photo taken with her and there must be a catered assortment of finger foods on hand .
As you can see , little Timmy is going to cost my mom a small fortune but for some reason she wants to make his dream come true .
If I can convince her to loan me that money until the transaction is completed than I could pay her back double what she loaned me .
Than she can sponsor two visits for Timmy if she wants .
I figure this will only delay Timmy 's visit from Pam another two weeks .
He has a couple of months to live so I 'm sure he would n't mind waiting .
What 's two weeks when you have waited this long , right ?
Do you think this is a good idea ?
Should I ask my mom ?
I need your advice .
I do not want to let you down .
Your loving brother and partner ,
Mr. Bo Jangles

BUKAKKE ,
EBOLA MONKEY NOTE : OK , Ariel has tried everything to get a response but no luck .
Well , might as well come clean .
From Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) to Albert Fred ( Nov. 5 )
Bukakke ,
I think it is time to come clean .
I may have been been a little dishonest up until this point .
I feel really bad bad about it , but I kind of feel like this whole whole thing has been some type of scam , you know know , like the ones on the internet .
Here is the the story and I hope you are n't too upset :
My real name is is Brad Fairyman Fellow ( which should n't shock you , that 's where my email email came from ) .
I am 37 years old and a very lonely man man .
I am currently stuck in a personal rut .
I have no REAL REAL job ( I 'll explain Amway in a moment ) .
I have a fear of commitment commitment , a nasty addiction to Doritos , an odd odd odor to me , and have not been with a woman woman since that time in South Central .
I used to be somebody .
Way Way back in the late 1980's , I used to host a TV program program about animals .
I love animals .
They are crazy .
The show was called " Brad Fairyman Fellow 's Safari Planet " .
Maybe Maybe you 've heard of it , it was big with the Latino Males 17 - 34 market .
I used to have all types of animals animals on the show , like Abby from Santa Barbara and rabbits that
gave themselves themselves haircuts .
After awhile , the animals turned on me .
This parrot stole stole my credit card and started ordering gold plated cages .
I was straight straight broke .
I had this snapping turtle try to bite me Bukakke !
I do n't want to get bit !
Anyway , the the animals started getting to me , sending me death threats and telling me I was " a little little fruit who wore lipstick and funny hats " .
I knew I had to get out .
But how how you may ask ?
I thought the answer was get rich quick schemes .
My stepdad Eduardo introduced me to to a million get rich quick schemes , including this crazy chain letter I sent to people about transferring transferring funds into their bank account .
Little did I realize I had no funds funds , and was only trying to scam them out of money .
I also had this idea , " The Pet Rock Rock " .
But my stepdad , Eduardo , stole that idea and is now a thousander .
Anyway Bukakke , this is the path I 've headed headed down ever since .
Amway is a pyramid scheme .
Which if you do n't know , means means that you are promised tons of money , but only see any money once you get a million million people to sign up underneath you .
That is why I asked you for all of your your friends names and accidentally referred to them as " Suckers " .
Mr. Bukakke Bukakke , I do n't know if I can feel good about you joining Amway .
Anyway , IF you still want to be in the Amway Amway business , I recommend you fill out the Personality Profile questions below and and I will forward it to the right person :
1. Full Name
2. Address
3. Social Security #
4. Blood Type
5 . Do you own a car ?
6 . Have you or any family member ever worked at Starbucks before ?
7 . Do you have any pets
8 . What would you like your username to be ?
9 . What would you like your password to be ?
10 .

11 . If you could be any type of plant , what type of plant would you be ?
12 . Have you ever tried to scam anybody out of money ?
13 .
Have you ever taken a child 's dream away , especially if they are terminally ill ?
I 'm sorry I may have deceived you , but I I feel much better now that everything is now in the open .
Much love ,
Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness )

BUKAKKE ,
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Nov. 5 )
Dear Bukakke ,
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you .
I had to go to the doctor and get a new pain medication .
I had an allergic reaction that made me bloated .
Not like Mathew Perry bloated when he was binge drinking but more like Anna Nicole Smith on her reality show .
I looked huge plus it gave me a rash .
I 'm OK now .
I 'm just really hungry because the only thing I can eat is soup .
I have to suck it through a straw .
Whatever you are feeling , I do not want you to feel guilty .
It 's my fault I got beat up .
I should have never been out at night with that much money .
You just kept telling me how urgent it was .
I know I would feel a little guilty if you got beat up .
Regardless , this beating is completely my fault .
I talked to my mother last night .
She wo n't give me the money .
She 's afraid that Timmy will die before I get her the money back and because I 've pretty much been a failure all my life , she does n't trust me .
It was hard to really communicate with her because my jaw is wired shut .
I have to write on a pad and paper while she yells at me .
She said that Pam Anderson has blocked out one day next week to fly up to Oregon and visit Timmy before he dies .
Her next free day is n't till April 2003 .
I 've seen his photo and
I do n't think he will make it .
Besides , if my mom does n't get Pam Anderson than she 'll have to go with Shannon Doherty ( Beverly Hills 90210 , Charmed ) and she 's a bitch .
I kept trying to push the issue and promise her that I could get her double the money but she did n't believe me .
She also could n't believe that I would jeopardize a dying child 's dream for money .
Then she got mad .
You never want to make mother mad .
I had n't seen her get that mad since she found those wire hangers in my closet as a kid .
Regardless , she 's not going to give me the money .
What should we do ?
Have you talked to Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) ?
He 's conveniently disappeared .
I would n't doubt that he did n't have me robbed .
I 've got to go .
Elle MacPhearson just made me some vegetable soup without the vegetables .
Mr. Winkle says hi .
Thanks
Bo Jangles
EBOLA MONKEY NOTE :
He did not answer the 3 questions on the last email .
Let 's see if we can get him to ask what these types of questions have to do with Amway .

EBOLA MONKEY NOTE : Whoa , check out the size of this guy 's hands .
He looks like a half mutant , half LL Cool J .
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Nov. 7 )
Dear Bukakke ,
Thank you for the concern .
Also , thank you for the lovely photo of your friend .
He looks like LL Cool J in a zoot suit .
That 's crazy .
Tell him I like his Bling Bling , the ice he rocks on his wrist and his cute chubby hands .
Anyway , I have been sleeping a lot since my attack .
The pain killer makes me real sleepy .
I pass out unexpectedly all the time .
Hopefully , Icajkjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjkl ' ; ; ; ; ; ;;;
Sorry , I just passed out and my head hit the keyboard .
See what I mean .
Elle MacPhearson makes me soup all the time .
The good news is that my weight is gone down from 345 to 337 .
Yeah !
I do n't know when I will be back on my feet again .
Do you think I should just take / steal the money from my mom ?
I could just go over there while she is sleeping and write a check to myself .
By the time she finds out , we should be rich and I can pay her back twice the amount .
You tell me if this is a good idea .
Have you talked to Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) ?
He will not return my calls .
Mr. Winkle does not trust him .
Do you ?
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind ,
Bo Jangles
From Albert Fred to Mike Hunt ( Nov. 8 )

She will be so happy when I pay her back twice the amount .
With this extra money , Timmy can get as many photos with Pam Anderson as his little heart desires .
Only you and I know what 's best .
Hopefully , operation " Hand Job " will go as expected .
Good news , my bruised ego is gone and my hamstring is better .
Now if only my broken arm and jaw would heal .

EBOLA MONKEY NOTE : Wow , is he persistant or what ?
I guess he really needs the money .
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Nov. 12 )
Dear Bukakke ,
Sorry for the delay on writing you .
The last few days have been horrible .
I took your advice about taking the money from my mom on Friday .
VERY BAD MOVE MR .
BO JANGLES .
I 've spent the last few days in the county jail .
YES , jail .
Did you get that ?
One more time , JAIL .
Let me just give you a play by play of the night .
Fri - 9:34 PM
Proceeded to my mothers house wearing a disguise made by Elle MacPhearson .
Painted face like those black dudes in the movie Dead President 's ( Lorenz Tate directed by the Hughes Brothers .
I know what your thinking " Good Idea . "
It 's a scary looking disguise and it does n't draw a lot of attention .
Listened to 50 cent song " How to Rob " on the way there for inspiration .
Kept a mental picture of me and my ex-friend Mr. Bo Jangles drinking Pina Coladas on a tropical island bathing in all of the money that we were going to make .
9:46 PM - Entered mother 's house from rear window .
Mother was attending a Barry Manilow and Ja Rule feat .
GWAR Concert ( Together Forever Tour ) .
9:49 PM - Ate some of my mother 's Baba Ganoush ( my mother is 1/16 Lebanese ) while inspecting the refrigerator .
It was delicious .
9:57 PM - Located mother 's check book near small penis shaped vibrating massager in draw in bedroom .
Made check out myself in the amount of $ 4500 bones .
9:58 PM - Lost balance knocking over dead father 's Urn , spilling my poor father 's ashes all over myself and the room .
Ashes stuck to my white make - up , making me look like Sambo .
Very upsetting .
10:15 PM - Went down to JJ's Rib Shack and Cash Checking Services at Yo Service ( JJRSCCS , Inc ) to cash check made out to me .
JJ took one look at me and thought I was impersonating Sambo because of my black face .
Being that I am white as Wonder Bread , they did not think it was too funny .
Four black guys decided to take it out on my ass .
Do n't worry Mr. Bo Jangles , I
blocked all their punches with my face .
They re-broke my arm and ego along with spraining my ankle .
10:33 PM - Ambulance and Police show up and prevent these Reverse Racist Mothers from killing me .
Find my mother 's check and start getting suspicious about why I am wearing all black and have my face painted .
I do n't answer in words .
I just start making movements with my hands and pretending that I am a mime .
They were n't buying it .
10:46 PM - Barlow PD puts me in a holding cell with more black dudes , a drunk white guy named Bo Siphus who said he wanted to recruit me for his gang , and a Philapino drag queen that looked like Christina Aguilera from the Lady Marmalade video .
They said they needed to talk to my mom before letting me go .
11:41 PM - Police notify my mother about the check .
She decides to press charges .
I 'm arrested for breaking and entering , check cashing fraud , and doing a bad impersonation of Ted Danza who once did a bad impersonation of Sambo at Whoopi Goldberg 's roast .
Saturday 12:55 AM
- Elle MacPhearson comes down to the Barlow Police Station to bail me out .
Does n't have the money .
She panics and tells the police everything .
About you , Ariel ( The Lord of Darkness ) , me , the bank , the money , your wife and how she went with a white guy in college , our code names , all the disguises , and how we were going to be rich .
After they stopped laughing hysterically , they arrested Elle MacPhearon on charges of Conspiring to Conspire and Evasive Maneuvering .
They put her in a cell with a bunch of Mexican Gang chicks .
She had a big Lesbian guard named Beth .
It was horrible .
Saturday - Stayed in Jail .
Sunday - Stayed in Jail .
Monday - Spent the day in Jail .
Are you getting this ?
Let me say it again : YOUR BRIGHT IDEA LANDED ME AND ELLE MACPHEARSON IN JAIL .
Monday 8:35 PM
- A detective John Kimble comes to pay me a visit .
He 's from Austria .
He tells me that they are going to let us go because of our good behavior and they are tired of laughing at us .
He also decides to tell me about something called the Nigerian 419 scam .
Have you heard of this ?
I bet you have Albert ( If that 's even your real name ) .
He told me that there is a group of Nigerians that send out these types of emails and take innocent peoples money .
That 's crazy !
He also wants me to go undercover
and wear a wire like they do in the Sopranos and bring this operation down .
I REFUSE TO DO THAT .
One thing I am not is a rat .
Are you a rat ?
Rat bastard .
What were you going to do with the money I sent you ?
Was there really money for us or were you going to go blow it on hookers and Garfield poster ?
BE HONEST .
When you got over here , were you going to kidnap me and sell my organs on the black market like they do in Nigeria .
For John 's sake , Elle MacPhearson was going to toss your wife ?s salad .
Her favorite dish .
Since I 've gotten involved with you , I 've been severely beaten by a Mexican gang , four black guys , the police , and became Nasty Nate 's bitch in jail , spent three days in a cell , my mother will never talk to me again , tried to steal the last wish of a dying child who just wanted to meet Pam Anderson , destroyed my father 's ashes while trying to steal my mother 's money for you , and lost my life savings .
Plus , Mr. Winkle and Ariel ( The Oh fuck it Brad Fairyman wo n't talk to me .
And you say you love me .
Explain yourself and this Nigerian Scam now !
Tell me .
If you love me , you will tell me the truth .
Bo Jangles
PS - I will never go to Nigeria if this is how Indian people act .
Screw the Eiffel Tower , those crazy kangaroos , all your zany schemes , and your stupid snow skiing .

I 'm sorry to hear about your wife and you being sick .

BUKAKKE .
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Nov. 19 )
Dear Mr. Bukakke ,
I am sorry to hear about your wife 's fading health .
I remember when I was first diagnosed with Wynonaryder syndrome .
It was very tough on my family , especially Mr. Winkle .
I will be more than willing to let you move in with me and Elle MacPhearson if your wife kicks the big one .
You can stay in the basement .
I will take you to a local strip club and we will find you a new wife .
A white chick ( you can get her back for dating that white dude in college ) .
Anyway , I just got back from the court .
I am to pay a $ 5000 fine for attempting to steal the money from my mom .
Because we do not have the money , we will probably lose our home .
I do not want you to feel guilty for this although it is your fault .
You are my friend and you have too much on your mind .
I know , I know .
Friends do n't usually get friends beaten , robbed , thrown in jail , disowned by their mother , thrown out of their house , and force them to do bad things to dying children .
Please do not feel guilty .
I 'm sure god will forgive you .
If not , you will probably burn in hell .
I probably will too but when I talk to God , I 'm going to try to blame everything on you .
There 's and old saying in Oregon ; " Two ducks can flock to the weather , or tickle your ass with a feather , but they ...
Oh shit , I forgot the rest .
My grandfather use to say it .
He was an old crazy man .
Always pissing and shitting himself .
I 'm sure you know what the saying means .
I am still waiting for you to send me a photo with you holding a sign that says " Mr. Bukakke . "
Then I will believe you .
Oh , I 've got good news .
I have feeling in my right arm again .
That should ease your guilty conscious a little .
Please send the photo with the sign today .
To infinity and beyond ,
Mr. Bo Jangles
From Albert Fred to Mike Hunt ( Nov. 20 )
DEAR DEAR MR BO JANGLES ,
I WILL SEND MY FRIENDS PICTURE TO YOU HOLDING A SIGN THAT SAYS MR .
BUKAKKE , I AM NOT FEELING FINE AND I DON'T GET MYSELF BECAUSE OF MY WIFE.IF ONLY YOU CAN INTRODUCE ME TO A NEW WHITE GIRL AS MY WIFE ON THE INTERNITE TODAY .MY BODY , SOUL AND SPIRIT WILL BE HAPPY FOR THAT .
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT TODAY SO THAT I CAN APPLY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE FUND FRON THE GLOBAL BANK .
I TRUSTED YOU AND YOU KOWN THAT EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU IS ALL YOUR FAULT .
YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS WITH CARE AND I KOWN YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME .
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AS MY BROTHER AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS YOU .
I WILL BE EXPECTING YOUR REPLY .
BUKAKKE ,
From Mike Hunt to Albert Fred ( Nov. 20 )
Dear Mr. Bukakke ,
Good idea .

After your wife bites it , you can enjoy many women .
It is a good way to be .
I will take your picture to Flash Dancers today and shop it around to some white girls .
I think they will be anxious to meet you .
After all , you are a prince .
When I find a good one , I will take a digital photo of her and send it to you .
As far as who is at fault for my hardship , we will just have to let God decide that .
You say it 's me , I know it 's you .
Lets not get caught up in the menusha of things .
Will let play out .
You are very much my friend .
Through good times , and bad times , I 'll be on your side forever more .
That 's what friends are for .
I will be anxiously waiting your photo .
Give your wife my regards and tell her , for me , " Hey , shit happens . "
That should put a smile on her face .

Summary
This visually explosive FBI document reveals the secret symbols organized pedophiles use to recognize each other and is likely to be of broad interest to readers , especially parents .
Wikileaks has verified the document .
The classification codes in used in the document ( different parts have different classifications ) are :
LES Law Enforcement Sensitive FOUO For Official Use Only U Unclassified
Wikileaks believes the information will be of assistance to parents and other care givers in recognizing pedophiles .
Wikileaks affiliated journalists obtained the document via " child erotica " networks in Spain , which raises the question of how this FBI document came into the hands of individuals so close to the people it is meant to be investigating .
Pedophiles who sexually abuse children as well as those who produce , distribute , and trade child pornography , are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences .
To specifically indicate the pedophile ’s gender preference , members of pedophilic organizations encourage the use of descriptions such as “ boylove ” , “ girllove ” , and “ childlove . ”
1
These symbols have been etched into rings and formed into pendants , and have also been found imprinted on coins .

( U) Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences ( U// FOUO )
This intelligence bulletin addresses Crimes Against Children Standing Intelligence Requirements Set contained in Q - FBI-2200-005-06 , HRWC CAC-VI .
A.5 . ( U//LES ) Pedophiles , to include those who sexually abuse children as well as those who produce , distribute , and trade child pornography , are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences .
To specifically indicate the pedophile 's gender preference , members of pedophilic organizations encourage the use of descriptions such as " boylove " , " girllove " , and " childlove . "
1
These symbols have been etched into rings and formed into pendants , and have also been found imprinted on coins .
( U ) The BoyLover logo ( BLogo ) is a small blue spiral - shaped triangle surrounded by a larger triangle , whereby the small triangle represents a small boy and the larger triangle represents an adult man .
2
A variation of the BLogo is the Little Boy Lover logo ( LBLogo ) , which also embodies a small spiral - shaped triangle within a larger triangle ; however , the corners of the LBLogo are rounded to resemble a scribbling by a young child .
3 Images of the BLogo and LBLogo symbols are depicted below .

(U//LES ) FBI investigations in several cities have uncovered several symbols used by pedophiles to proclaim their attraction to children .
After a seizure of a subject 's computer in connection with an Innocent Images case in the Jacksonville Division , a Computer Analysis Response Team forensic examiner came across an unfamiliar symbol that was integrated into a Web site banner named " ATBOYS .COM , where the " A " in " ATBOYS " was actually the BoyLove symbol and written as follows : TBOYS.com .
It was further determined that " ATBOYS " is an acronym for Attracted To Boys . 5
These pedophilia symbols also appear on Web sites such as one of the banners advertised on www.boylover.net, shown below .6 UNCLASSIFIED

In another incident , FBI Sacramento was alerted by the California Department of Justice about an unusual marking on a coin .
Research of the marking concluded that the BoyLover logo ( BLogo ) was imprinted on the front of the coin , and the phrase " Kids Love Pedos " was engraved on the back of the coin .
7 ( Coins depicting the BLogo are pictured on page one . )
The appearance of the BLogo on coins is another method used by pedophiles to announce their sexual preferences .
( U ) Pedophilia symbols on jewelry , coins , Web sites and other effects are indicative of advertisement methods used by child sexual predators to promote their cause .
Pedophile activists advocate for the social acceptance of sexual relationships between adults and children .
These organizations seek to decriminalize sexual relationships between adults and children and to legalize child pornography based on their belief that children have the ability to consent to sexual acts .
( U//LES ) Identical or similar jewelry and symbols as described in this intelligence bulletin should raise suspicion of possible pedophilia activity when found during searches .
Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on Web sites .
During examinations of computer files , investigators should be conscious of subjects who try to conceal child pornography by labeling them with symbols instead of the typical suggestive explicit names .

This was the first US war crimes trial since World War II A US military jury at Guantanamo Bay has convicted Osama Bin Laden 's former driver of supporting terrorism .
The verdict on Salim Hamdan is the first to be delivered in a full war crimes trial at the US prison in Cuba .
The jury found Hamdan guilty of five of eight charges of supporting terrorism but acquitted him of two separate , more serious , charges of conspiracy .
A sentencing hearing is now under way .
Hamdan , a Yemeni aged about 40 , faces a maximum sentence of life in prison .
The White House said the trial was fair and looked forward to more tribunals .
The defence team has said it plans to appeal , while rights groups have condemned the trial as unjust .
' Vital role ' Hamdan , who was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 , was initially impassive when the verdict began to be read out .
But the BBC's Kim Ghattas , at the trial , said he later appeared to break down in tears .
HAMDAN CHARGES
Conspiracy : Found not guilty on two counts of conspiring with al - Qaeda to attack civilians , destroy property and commit murder Providing support for terrorism :
Found guilty on five counts , including being the driver and bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden , a man he knew to be the leader of a terrorist group Found not guilty on three other counts
Profile : Salim Hamdan
Send us your comments Timeline : Al - Qaeda
Our correspondent says the defence team 's appeal could go as far as the Supreme Court .
One of the defence lawyers , Michael Berrigan , said : " Is material support a war crime ?
The defence believes it is not .
That issue will go forward on appeal . "
The jury of six military officers had deliberated for about eight hours over three days in the first US war crimes trial since World War II .
The prosecution had said Hamdan played a " vital role " in the conspiracy behind the 9/11 attacks .
But defence lawyers said he was a low - level employee .
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says US President George W Bush will hope to use the conclusion of the first full trial as evidence that the Guantanamo Bay system does actually work .
In its first response , the White House said Hamdan had received a " fair trial " .
Spokesman Tony Fratto said : " The Military Commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process ...
We look forward to other cases moving forward to trial . "
However , defence lawyers had said they feared a guilty verdict was inevitable and that the system was geared to convict .
Rights group Amnesty International said the trial was " fundamentally flawed " and called for all the remaining military tribunals to be halted and for proceedings to be moved to civilian courts .
' Guilt by association ' Hamdan had admitted working for Bin Laden in Afghanistan from 1997 to 2001 for $ 200 ( £ 99 ) a month , but said he worked for wages , not to make war on the US .
About 270 suspects remain in detention in Guantanamo Bay
The defence said the case was " guilt by association " .
But the prosecution said Hamdan was an " uncontrollably enthusiastic warrior " for al - Qaeda .
Prosecutor John Murphy had said : " He has wounded , and the people he has worked with have wounded , the world . "
About 270 suspects remain in detention in Guantanamo Bay .
Among the dozens of other inmates due to be tried there in the coming months are men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks .

From religious fundamentalism to pseudoscience , it seems that forces are attacking the Enlightenment world view – characterised by rational , scientific thinking – from all sides .
The debate seems black and white : you ’re either with reason , or you ’re against it .
But is it so simple ?
In a series of special essays , our contributors look more carefully at some of the most provocative charges against reason .
The results suggest that for all the Enlightenment has achieved , we still have a lot of work to do .
Editorial : How to make reason more reasonable
How humans dared to know
The 21st - century passion for “ Enlightenment values ” owes a lot to the 18th century .
Philosopher A. C. Grayling discusses where those values come from and what they mean today
1 : Reason stands against values and morals
Shaping a moral and humane world requires more than reason , says Archbishop Rowan Williams
2 : No one actually uses reason
If we had to think logically about everything we did , we ’d never do anything at all , says neuroscientist Chris Frith .

3 : I hear “ reason ” , I see lies
Science is routinely co-opted by governments and corporations to subvert people ’s ability to make their own decisions , say sociologist David Miller and linguist Noam Chomsky .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan angrily rejected a New York Times report on Friday that said U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded members of Pakistan ’s spy agency helped plan the suicide bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul last month .
“ Rubbish , ” Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi responded when asked to comment on the report while in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo , where South Asian leaders were attending a regional summit .
“ Such news items keep appearing , ” Qureshi said .
The New York Times this week reported that a senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) confronted Pakistan earlier this month with evidence of ties between members of its Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and al Qaeda - linked militants , as well as their involvement in the Kabul bomb attack .
Two senior Indian diplomats were among 58 people killed in the July 7 attacks .
The newspaper reported on Thursday that unidentified U.S. government officials said communications had been intercepted between Pakistani agents and militants who carried out the attack .
“ No one has given any evidence to us .
It ’s just an allegation , ” foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq told Reuters from Colombo .
However , Defence Minister Ahmed Mukhtar , in remarks aired by Pakistan television on Thursday , said U.S. officials had accused ISI members of tipping off al Qaeda - linked militants before U.S. missile attacks on targets in Pakistani tribal lands .
Pakistan ’s new Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani , who returned from his first visit to the United States on Thursday , was due to meet his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh in Colombo on Saturday .
The meeting of the two leaders is taking place against the backdrop of strained relations between the nuclear - armed neighbors .
The Kabul attack , breaches of a 2003 ceasefire between Indian and Pakistan forces in the disputed Kashmir region , and media speculation of Pakistani links to a series of bomb attacks on Indian cities have all contributed to the worsening atmosphere .
India said the 4 ½ year - old peace process was “ under stress ” following the attack on its Kabul embassy .
Before his departure for Colombo , Gilani said Pakistan wanted the eight - member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to become an effective grouping and wanted to bolster relations with all of its neighbors .
“ We have bilateral relations with all neighbors .
We want good relations with India , with Afghanistan , with all neighbors , ” he told reporters .
Polar bears under threat :
Now sharks are after them too
Already threatened by a thaw of ice around the North Pole , the polar bear 's title as the top Arctic predator may under challenge from a shark .
Scientists researching how far sharks hunt seals in the Arctic were stunned in June to find part of the jaw of a young polar bear in the stomach of a Greenland shark , a species that favours polar waters .
" We 've never heard of this before .
We do n't know how it got there , " Kit Kovacs , of the Norwegian Polar Institute , said of the 4 inch bone found in a shark off the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard .
" We ca n't say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear " or ate a carcass , she said .
" We do n't know how active these sharks are as predators . "
Endangered : A polar bear shakes off its coat
Most shark experts contacted said it was likely the bear was dead before the shark found it .
Even a young , two - or three - year - old bear would be a ferocious opponent for a Greenland shark , which can grow to up to 23 feet and weigh more than a tonne .
" It sounds like a scavenge , " said Steve Campana , head of the Canadian shark research laboratory at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
He said he had not heard of a shark eating a bear before and it was a " million dollar question " for researchers as to whether Greenland sharks attack live bears .
Bits of animals including caribou have been found in Greenland shark stomachs in the past -- scavenged or attacked swimming .
Campana said there was even a myth that the sharks could leap out of the water and seize caribou standing on ice .
" There 's no possibility a Greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill , " said Jeffrey Gallant , co-director of a Canadian - based Greenland shark education and research group .
Scavenger : A Greenland shark like the one that was discovered with the remains of a polar bear inside its belly
Sonja Fordham , deputy chair of the shark specialist group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature , said more research was needed into the Greenland shark 's habits .
" Greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish ... but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating , " she said .
The United States this year listed polar bears as threatened under the U.S .
Endangered Species
Act because their sea ice habitat is shrinking , apparently due to global warming .
A thaw may mean that bears spend more time in the water .
But less chill waters are unlikely to lure other big sharks , except perhaps the porbeagle , to polar regions , Campana said .
Most sharks favour much warmer conditions .
Killer whales , however , have been spotted further north in recent years .
" Both walruses and polar bears are powerful in the water .
Both could handle most potential predators , but not killer whales , " Kovacs said .
Gallant said warming was unlikely to help the Greenland shark catch bears .
" The Greenland shark simply cannot afford the risk of injury nor the expenditure of energy required to kill such a large and dangerous animal , with or without the help of global warming , " he said .
" There is far easier prey to be found . "
Kovacs also said : " For polar bears the greater risk is a loss of habitat .
These other things will be ancillary . "
' Who says there are no bees ?
15,000 just landed in my lunch '
Shoppers were stunned when a massive swarm of thousands of honey bees touched down in a busy city centre .
Around 15,000 insects gathered in Queen Street , Exeter , at around lunchtime on Tuesday .
While some people darted for cover , others stood and watched the aerial acrobatics .
The local beekeeper was called in to remove the somewhat confused bees
Invasion : 15,000 bees descended on Bella Italia restaurant in Exeter city centre
After around five minutes , the swarm flew underneath a table outside Bella Italia , setting up camp for several hours .
The swarm of over 15,000 bees was roughly a metre in diameter and around an inch thick .
Speaking from inside Bella Italia , supervisor Joe Heginworth , 18 , said : ' I 've never seen anything like this before .
' There 's a pile of people outside watching them and taking photographs on their mobile phones . '
Special ops : A local bee - keeper arrives to deal with the swarm ...
Brenda Cann , 62 , saw the bees arrive from outside Queen Street News , where she works .
She said : ' They were coming down from the direction of the High Street .
' They near enough stretched across the whole of Queen Street , but I was n't really worried .
' A lot of people were coming in to ask what was going on . '
A police spokesman said members of the public started to report the swarm from around 1.30 pm .
' One call said there was a large colony of bees coming up from the pavement and they were concerned someone might get stung , '' he said .
... while a team of police officers was despatched to provide back up
The bees were cordoned off to prevent anybody getting too close for comfort .
Milly Lefebvre , 37 , was on her lunch break from the Royal Albert Memorial Museum , in Queen Street , when she spotted the commotion .
' It seemed to be a huge amount of bees in a very little space , ' she said .
' There was still a group of teenagers having coffee next to them .
It was quite surreal .'
Exeter City Council 's pest control team was called in to remove the insects with the help of local beekeeper , John Baston .
Mr Easton , 64 , said the bees probably stopped for a breather while looking for a new home .
He said some swarms could be aggressive and caution should be taken when dealing with them .
' I was collecting a similar swarm last week and I received 50 stings on the back of one glove alone , ' he said .
' Under those circumstances , if you are not protected it can be quite dangerous .
' My advice for anyone who comes across a swarm is to leave them alone and call an expert . '
Mr Easton , who has kept bees for 25 years , said he removed the swarm by gently picking up a chair the majority had settled on before shaking it above an open hive .
' The idea was for the queen bee to fall into the hive and the others to stay in there with her , ' he added .
Mr Easton said he would take the bees home and give them 20 Ibs of sugar syrup before checking them several times for signs of disease .
' If they are free of disease I will continue to build up their stores to see them through the winter , ' he said .
A council spokeswoman said : ' It 's the time of year for bees to swarm and it's not unusual for swarms to appear in the centre of Exeter . '

On Thursday , August 7th , Georgian armed forces entered into the breakaway region of South Ossetia to assert Georgian governance of the region - a de facto ( yet largely unrecognized ) independent republic that has support from neighboring Russia .
Russia responded on August 8th by sending its own military into Georgia - not only into region of South Ossetia - but also into the nearby breakaway republic of Abkhazia and deeper into Georgia itself .
Many Airstrikes and ground skirmishes have taken place since , with several parties calling for a cease - fire , but no agreement as yet .
Those paying the highest price for the war are the South Ossetian civilians , which may have suffered ( depending on who is reporting ) between 100 and 2,000 deaths to date .

When opening my last two cellphone bills , I could hardly believe my eyes : instead of the usual $ 30 to $ 40 per bill , I was faced by a grand total that could push a destitute student into bankruptcy : $ 1,200 .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
I had spent the last six weeks in Washington D.C. and my cellphone had been the only way to keep in touch with my computer - less boyfriend in Vancouver .
A closer look at my bills revealed that in 13 hours of talking to him , I had accumulated $ 970 in roaming charges .
For the less tech - savvy among us , roaming charges refer to the costs I have to pay for using a network other than the one operated by my cellphone provider .
Roaming is a lot cheaper in Europe .
Over the past few years , the European Commission introduced a number of regulations that limit such fees and make owning a cellphone more affordable .
Coming from Europe , I had ( wrongly ) expected that North America would operate under similar regulation .
Like the new 15 - cent charge for incoming text messages , roaming charges seem to be another way mobile phone providers pad their bottom lines .
The Canadian government has thus far been reluctant to regulate .
But that could change in the wake of a new Facebook group against the 15 - cent charge that has already attracted more than 36,000 members .
" It 's a government that 's listening to the boardroom tables rather than to the kitchen tables of the country , where people sit down to pay their bills and they can see that they are being ripped off , " said opposition leader Jack Layton , whose New Democratic Party launched the Facebook campaign .
Roaming charges capped across Europe
For more than a year , European telecommunication companies have been legally bound to offer a " Euro rate " for voice roaming in all countries of the European Union .
The maximum charges are $ 0.90 per minute for outgoing calls and $ 0.45 for incoming calls .
The rates are based on a report commissioned by the EU government , which revealed that the former average charge of $ 1.80 for voice roaming " could not be explained by underlying costs . "
Customers has been billed about five times what cellphone companies had to pay on operational costs .
For roaming , main costs are the purchase of airtime minutes from a foreign network provider .
Before the " Euro rate , " roaming charges accounted for $ 13.3 billion or 5.7 per cent of the total revenue of Europe 's mobile telephone industry .
Not coincidentally , $ 1.80 is about what Bell , Telus and Rogers charge their costumers today .
For voice roaming in the United States , Bell charges $ 1.74 for outgoing calls .
Rogers bills $ 1.70 and Telus $ 1.45 .
Incoming calls are charged as well at $ 0.50 to $ 0.75 per minute .
How much Bell , Telus or Rogers actually spend on airtime minutes for U.S. network providers is guesswork .
Spokespeople for Bell and Rogers told The Tyee that this information is confidential .
" We never give out information to the public about our revenues , " said Bell spokesperson Allison Johnson .
Most expensive data in the world
Similar to roaming charges , there is a widening gap between European countries and Canada for prices of text messaging .
In Europe , no incoming calls or text messages are charged .
While at the moment , prices for incoming messages are about the same as in Canada , the EU government recently brought in a proposal which could reduce the costs for sending text messages within all EU countries by as much as 70 per cent .
In Canada , prices for text messages jumped by 50 per cent over the last year from 10 to 15 cents .
By charging for " inbound " text messages , costs doubled overnight for what is already the most expensive data on the planet .
According to a study done by a space scientist at the University of Leicester , sending a ten - cent SMS text message using a cellphone is more than four times costlier than transmitting data from the Hubble Space Telescope .
That inevitably raises the question , how can world - shattering messages like ' How RU ' or ' CU later ' be more expensive than data from outer space that revolutionized the world of astronomy ?
What 's a fair price ?
Telus and Bell claim they have to charge more for text messages because Canadians are texting so much .
" The growth in text messages has been nothing short of phenomenal , " Telus Mobility spokesperson Anne-Julie Gratton told the Ottawa Citizen .
" This volume places tremendous demands on our network and we can't afford to provide this service for free anymore . "
But Canadians send only 45.4 million text messages per day , according to the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association .
British mobile phone users send 55 million text messages daily and Germans send 63 million .
In both of those countries , incoming messages are free .
" The strain on the networks argument is embarrassingly inaccurate , " said Richard Smith , professor at Simon Fraser University and publisher of the Canadian Journal of Communication .
" It is incredible that they are able to straight - facingly say something like that . "
Text messaging seems to consume nearly no resources at all and with its $ 100 billion revenue , it is incredibly profitable .
" The radio frequency impact of delivering a text message is very low , " says Ian Bell , a Vancouver - based technology executive .
" I could basically run the entire world 's text messaging network on my Mac Mini at home .
It would n't have a significant impact . "
Considering the low operational costs , entrepreneur Bell said the only fair charge for incoming text messages would be zero .
36,000 join NDP Facebook group
Another explanation for the price of these charges would be the lack of either regulation or competition among Canada 's telecommunication companies .
" If the cellphone companies continue to be anti-competitive ... and Canadians continue to use cellphones the way they have , we have a growing rationale and a call for regulation , " Smith said .
Regulations like the ones introduced by the European Commission are unlikely to become reality in Canada anytime soon .
Minister of Industry Jim Prentice was an open enemy of the 15 - cent charge , but changed his mind after a meeting with the heads of Bell Mobility and Telus .
In a public statement , he said that the government had no intention of introducing new legislation to regulate the pricing policy of cellphone companies .
The NDP's Layton mocked the Tory minister 's about - face .
" They went to have a meeting with the CEOs of the telephone companies , and the CEOs of the companies told them to get lost , " Layton told The Tyee .
" These companies do n't seem to realize that ... airwaves are public trust .
They do n't belong to somebody in private , and so a certain basic standard of fairness and accessibility needs to be provided . "
Competition is coming
It is striking that the tiny sum of 15 cents can attract 36,000 members to a Facebook group and outrage the nation for weeks .
Maybe the reason for that is not the money itself , but " what lies beneath " as Michael Geist , law professor at the University of Ottawa , writes in his blog : " The Canadian cellphone market is discouragingly uncompetitive and expensive by world standards .
Fixing those issues will require more work than a couple of press releases and hollow assurances that Canadian consumers enjoy plenty of choice . "
Geist 's last comment likely refers to Prentice 's recent statement that " the telecommunications market in Canada is dynamic " and that " choice is available . "
" What the telephone companies are doing is making money while they can , " said SFU professor Smith , " but competition is coming really hard and fast . "
For example , Globalive Communications won 30 licences at an auction for new wireless spectrum held last month .
The Toronto - based company could emerge as a new national cellphone carrier .
Whether or not such competition will have a considerable impact on cellphone charges remains to be seen , said Smith .
" It 's hard to tell right now what will actually happen ... but when there are four , five , six people in the business , it will be less easy for them to not compete . "
It is unlikely that the wireless market will have changed significantly by this October .
That 's when I will next travel to Washington D.C.
This time , instead of investing $ 970 in talking to my boyfriend on the phone , I 'll just buy him a ticket : for $ 970 , I could buy three round trips .

Tyee stories :
Look around you at the bodies of the extremely old - when was the last time you recall seeing an obese centenarian ?
Excess fat held over the years is a killer , and the oldest people are very rarely overweight .
I noticed a paper today that works backwards from medical and mortality data to further support the same conclusion :
There has been ongoing debate about the health risks associated with increased body weight among the elderly population .
One issue has not been investigated thoroughly is that body weight changes over time , as both the reasons and results of , the development of chronic diseases and functional disabilities .
Structural models have the ability to unravel the complicated simultaneous relationship between body weight , disability , and mortality along the aging process .
Using longitudinal data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey from 1992 to 2001 , we constructed a structural model to estimate the longitudinal dynamic relationship between weight , chronic diseases , functional status , and mortality among the aging population .
A simulation of an age cohort from 65 to 100 was conducted to show the changes in weight and health outcomes among the cohorts with different baseline weight based on the parameters estimated by the model .
The elderly with normal weight at age 65 experience higher life expectancy and lower disability rates than the same age cohorts in other weight categories .
The interesting prediction of our model is that the average body size of an elderly cohort will converge to the normal weight range through a process of survival , senescence , and behavioral adjustment .
Become fat and stay fat , in other words , and you 'll remove yourself from the picture much sooner than would otherwise be the case .
In addition , your health in the years ahead will be much the worse for it .
Do as you will with your life , but do n't say you were n't warned .
SysTest Labs , LLC , one of four federal testing labs responsible for certifying our nation 's voting systems , is under investigation for failing to document or validate its test methods .
The lab is also accused of using unqualified personnel to run these highly technical tests .
Emails from the lab indicate possible collusion with voting system vendor , ES&S , whereby SysTest 's " test approach takes into consideration " actions that will " ensure certification " of the M650 and M100 optical scanners .

An August 8 , 2008 letter from the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) and SysTest details these issues :
" In addition , there were instances discovered where testing was performed by personnel who had not been qualified to perform the testing . "
The NIST letter goes on to report another , more serious violation :
" [ A ] nother issue has surfaced which may be interpreted as improper behavior between an independent testing laboratory and its client .
This issue is documented in a letter from the EAC ... dated July 25 , 2008 .
The letter cites a situation ... where SysTest may be ' allowing and inviting manufacturers to play an inappropriate role in the development of test plans ' which " would be a significant violation " of ISO and NIST rules , " and as such could affect SysTest 's accreditation status . "
On July 16th , Ron Thomas of SysTest sent an email to Election Systems & Software ( ES&S ) regarding the ongoing certification of two of ES&S ' optical scan voting systems being used in Ohio , by setting the goals of speedy tests and ensuring certification .
On July 25th , the EAC took exception to Thomas ' email that :
" contains language in which SysTest sets a goal ' to ensure certification ' of [ a ] manufacturer 's system .
This statement may be read as an inappropriate promise of certification . "
The EAC then warned SysTest that EAC - accredited voting system test labs " are responsible for the independent testing of a voting system to the appropriate standards and should not have as the end goal the certification of the voting system . "
administrative oversight .
These violations , if true , could result in revocation of SysTest 's accreditation as a federal voting system certification lab .
On August 11th , SysTest denied all allegations in an email to the New York State Board of Elections .
Adding to SysTest 's woes with NIST and the EAC , SysTest approved Sequoia / Dominion 's ImageCast ballot marking device for use in New York , which sports a convenient slotted hole that enables ballot stuffing into the locked ballot box .
We provide an exclusive video here .
Whether it loses accreditation or not , how can voters rely on SysTest 's competency in testing voting systems , when it failed to catch such an obvious defect as a huge ballot stuffing hole on top of the Sequoia / Dominion machine ?

GSC Game World Public Relations Director Oleg Yavorsky says S.T.A.L.K.E.R. : Shadow of Chernobyl failed to perform to expectations in North America because American gamers have trouble understanding eastern European games and gameplay .
In an interview with Eurogamer , Yavorsky said GSC Game World aims for audiences as broad as possible , but differences in " cultural mindsets " make their games less interesting and appealing to Americans and Asians than they are to Europeans .
" Most of our successful games were based on big historical elements , such as with Cossacks , " he said .
" Cossacks were pretty well known in Europe , so ultimately that game was more appealing to a European audience than to other audiences .
I hear it discussed a lot that European games struggle to find an appeal in North America , for example , just because they 're based on different settings and characters , with different stories being told . "
Those cultural differences extend in attitudes toward core gameplay , Yavorsky added , suggesting the Russian and eastern European markets are far more receptive to unforgiving , " hardcore " games than those in North America .
" Big companies always want you to make your game as easy as possible , so that any really non-intellectual person can play it , " he said .
" They want all sorts of tutorials to guide the player through , and this is something we 've always been very resistant to . "
" In our market we 're used to having cheap games , " Yavorsky continued .
" That means all our audience play a lot of games and hence they 're really hardcore about them - they want really challenging games , and they do n't need to be guided through with basic explanations like , ' This is your gun ; this is how you move . ' "
" But then , everything , even up to the color spectrum and how bright your game is , can be an issue .
It seems that to appeal to North America you need really flashy , bright games , and you can see that every eastern European game is very dark , " he added .
" In the end , I guess this just comes down to our culture and history - we 're different people , and that 's that . "
GSC Game World is currently at work on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. : Clear Sky , a prequel set one year prior to the events of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. that will offer improvements to the game 's AI and interface , new weapons and monsters and large amounts of new territory to explore .
The game is currently set for release at the end of August .

Notes
Static and Dynamic Routing
Static Routing - manually assigned by the Admin user entering the routes ( Routed Protocols - IP , IPX and AppleTalk )
Dynamic Routing - generated / determined by a Routing Protocol ( Routing Protocols - RIP I , RIP II , IGRP , EIGRP , OSPF , NLSP , RTMP )
Dynamic
1 ) With Dynamic Routing , routers pass information between each other so that routing tables are regularly maintained .
2 ) The routers then determine the correct paths packets should take to reach their destinations .
3 ) Information is passed only between routers .
4 ) A routing domain is called an Autonomous System , as it is a portion of the Internetwork under common admin authority .
5 ) Consists of routers that share information over the same protocol .
Can be split into routing areas .
Routing Protocols
I ) Interior ( within an autonomous system - AS - group of routers under the same administrative authority )
a) Distance Vector - understands the direction and distance to any network connection on the internetwork .
Knows how
many hops ( the metric ) to get there .
All routers w/ in the internetwork listen for messages from other routers , which are sent
every 30 to 90 seconds .
They pass their entire routing tables .
Uses hop count for measurement .
1 ) Used in smaller networks
that are have fewer than 100 routers .
2 ) Easy to configure and use .
3 ) As routers increase in number , you need to consider
CPU utilization , convergence time , and bandwidth utilization .
4 ) Convergence is due to routing updates at set intervals .
5 ) When
a router recognizes a change it updates the routing table and sends the whole table to all of its neighbors .
1 ) RIP - 15 hop count max
2 ) IGRP - 255 hop count max , uses reliability factor ( 255 optimal ) , and bandwidth
3 ) RTMP
b) Link State - understands the entire network , and does not use secondhand information .
Routers exchange LSP?s ( hello
packets ) .
Each router builds a topographical view of the network , then uses SPF ( shortest path first ) algorithm to determine the
best route .
Changes in topology can be sent out immediately , so convergence can be quicker .
Uses Bandwidth , congestion for measurement ; Dijkstra 's algorithm ;
1 ) Maintains Topology Database .
2 ) Routers have formal neighbor relationship .
3 ) Exchanges LSA ( Link State Advertisement ) or
hello packets with directly connected interfaces .
4 ) These are exchanged at short intervals ( typically 10 sec ) .
5 ) Only new info is
exchanged .
6 ) Scales well , however link ? state protocols are more complex .
7 ) Requires more processing power , memory , and bandwidth .
1 ) OSPF - decisions based on cost of route ( metric limit of 65,535 )
2 ) EIGRP - hybrid protocol ( both Distance - Vector and Link State ) , Cisco proprietary
3 ) NLSP
4 ) IS -IS
II ) Exterior
1 ) EGP ( Exterior Gateway Protocol )
2 ) BGP ( Border Gateway Protocol )
Solutions to Problems with Routing Protocols 1 ) Define the maximum number of hops -
When the number of hops reaches this predefined value , the distance is considered infinite , thus the network is considered unreachable .
This does stop routing loops , but only limit the time that packet can travel inside the loop .
2 ) Split horizon -
The packets can not be sent back to the same interface that they originally came from .
During the updates , one router does not send updates to the router that it received the information from .
3 ) Route poisoning -
The router sets the cost / distance of routes that are unreachable to infinity .
Used with hold - down timers
4 ) Triggered updates -
The router sends updates of the routing table as soon as it detects changes in the network .
Does not wait for the prescribed time to expire .
5 ) Hold - Downs -
After the router detects unreachable network , the routers waits for a specified time before announcing that a network is unreachable .
The router will also wait for a period of time before it updates its routing table after it detects that another router came online ( Router keeps an entry for the network possibly down state , allowing time for other routers to re-compute for this topology change ) .
Hold - downs can only partially prevent counting to infinity problem .
Prevents routes from changing too rapidly in order to determine if a link has really failed , or is back up
RIP , IGRP , OSPF , IS-IS , EIGRPIPX RIP , NLSP , EIGRPRTMP , AURP , EIGRPoccur when routing tables are not updated fast enough when one of the networks becomes unreachable .
Due to the slow convergence ( updates of routing table between all routers ) , some routers will end up with incorrect routing table and will broadcast that routing table to other routers .
This incorrect routing tables will cause packets to travel repeatedly in circles.occurs when packets end up in a routing loop ; hop count increases with every pass through a router on the network
Encapsulation Types
Encapsulation 802.2 sap 802.3 novell - ether Ethernet II arpa ( Internet Standard ) Snap snap
Wan Service Providers
1 ) Customer premises equipment ( CPE ) - Devices physically located at subscriber ?s location ; examples : CSU / DSU , modem , wiring on the customer 's location
2) Demarcation ( or demarc ) -
The place where the CPE ends and the local loop portion of the service begins .
( Usually in the " phone closet " ) .
3 ) Local loop - Cabling from the demarc into the WAN service provider ?s central office ; wiring from customer 's location to the nearest CO
4 ) Central Office switch ( CO ) - Switching facility that provides the nearest point of presence for the provider ?s WAN service ; location of telephone company 's equipment where the phone line connects to the high speed line ( trunk ) ; Regional Telco Office where the local loop terminates ( the Telco location nearest you )
5 ) Toll network -
The switches and facilities , ( trunks ) , inside the WAN provider ?s " cloud . "
DTE - the router side and receive clocking
DCE - the CSU / DSU side and provide clocking
WAN Devices
Routers -
Offer both internetwork and WAN interface controls
ATM Switches - High - speed cell switching between both LANs and WANs
X.25 and Frame - Relay Switches - Connect private data over public circuits using digital signals
Modems - Connect private data over public telephone circuits using analog signals
CSU / DSU ( Channel Service Units / Data Service Units ) - Customer Premises Equipment ( CPE ) which is used to terminate a digital circuit at the customer site
Communication Servers - Dial in / out servers that allow dialing in from remote locations and attach to the LAN
Multiplexors -

Administrative Distances for IP Routes
Administrative Distances are configured using ip route command :
Example : ip route 154.4.55.0 255.255.255.0 195.23.55.1 85 ( where 85 is the administrative distance )
IP Route Administrative Distance Directly connected interface 0 Static route using connected interface 0 Static route using IP address 1 EIGRP summary route 5 External BGP route 20 Internal EIGRP route 90 IGRP route 100 OSPF route 110 IS - IS route 115 RIP route 120 EGP route 140 External EIGRP route 170 Internal BGP route 200 Route of unknown origin 255
Switching Terminology
Store - and - Forward ?
copies entire frame into buffer , checks for CRC errors before forwarding .
Higher latency .
Cut - Through ?
reads only the destination address into buffer , and forwards immediately ; Low latency ; " wire - speed "
Fragment free ?

Multiple Loop Problems ?
complex topology can cause multiple loops to occur .
Layer 2 has no mechanism to stop the loop .
This is the main reason for Spanning ?
Tree Protocol .
Spanning - Tree Protocol ( STP ) IEEE 802.1d . ?
developed to prevent routing loops ; uses STA ( Spanning - Tree Algorithm ) to calculate a loop - free network topology ; allows redundant paths without suffering the effects of loops in the network
Virtual LAN?s ( VLAN's ) ?
sets different ports on a switch to be part of different sub -networks .
Some benefits : simplify moves , adds , changes ; reduce administrative costs ; have better control of broadcasts ; tighten security ; and distribute load .
Relocate the server into a secured location .

Bush says the surge in Iraq is working .

But a report released by the General Accounting Office says otherwise .
What a concept : someone actually took the goals the Bush administration laid out in January 2007 for the “ surge ” , and one - by - one analyzed them to see if they had actually been accomplished , as claimed .
Not only is the surge not meeting its stated goals , but it is looking more and more like another rat hole , down which we will be pouring American and Iraqi lives and trillions of dollars for the next 100 years or more .

New Rochelle , NY , August 25 , 2008 — Borrowing and sharing of prescription medications is a serious medical and public health concern .
A survey of nearly 7,500 women of reproductive age found that this is common practice among more than one - third of this population , according to a report published online ahead of print in Journal of Women 's Health , a peer - reviewed journal published by Mary Ann Liebert , Inc .
The paper is available free online at http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jwh.2007.0769
A study designed to describe patterns of prescription medication borrowing and sharing among various groups of adults revealed that women of reproductive age ( 18 - 44 years ) are more likely to report this practice ( 36.5 % ) than are other aged women ( 19.5 % ) .
In the overall survey of more than 25,000 women and men , 28.8 % of women and 26.5 % of men reported ever borrowing or sharing prescription medications .
In a paper entitled " Prescription Medication Borrowing and Sharing among Women of Reproductive Age , " Emily Petersen , Sonja Rasmussen , Katherine Daniel , Mahsa Yazdy , and Margaret Honein , from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC , Atlanta , Georgia ) and Oak Ridge Institute for Science & Education ( Oak Ridge , Tennessee ) , report that allergy medications ( 43.8 % ) and pain medications ( 42.6 % ) were the types of drugs most commonly borrowed or shared by reproductive - aged women .
The authors emphasize some of the risks involved in using another person 's prescription drugs , including unanticipated side effects , complications of incorrect use , drug - drug interactions , antibiotic resistance , and risk of addiction .
Of great importance for reproductive - aged women is the risk of teratogenic effects on a developing embryo or fetus if the women were to become pregnant while taking the medication .
" This study confirms what many health care providers suspect , " says Susan G. Kornstein , MD , Editor - in - Chief and Executive Director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Institute for Women 's Health , in Richmond , VA .
" It is clear that patients need to be counseled about the potential risks of sharing and borrowing medications , especially if they are women of reproductive age . "

Director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale return to Gotham City for a bold , brooding big - screen summer thrill ride .
But all eyes will be on Heath Ledger as the Joker : a young actor 's blaze of glory
Heath Ledger is n’t here .
It ’s July 2007 , in downtown Chicago , and the actor was originally scheduled to be shooting a scene in which he uses a pencil as a lethal weapon .
But the sequence has been postponed , and Ledger has the day off .
Instead , we ’re watching the cameras roll on a somewhat less riveting moment in The Dark Knight : Billionaire Bruce Wayne , exhausted from his late - night crime - fighting escapades , slumps into a chair and falls asleep in the middle of a business meeting .
That ’s right , we ’re watching Batman take a nap .
No matter .
Ledger is all over this set in another way — he ’s all that anyone working on the movie wants to talk about .
Director Christopher Nolan calls Ledger ’s acting in the film ” fearless . ” Christian Bale , the Caped Crusader himself , says it ’s ” intense — a superb performance . ”
And Morgan Freeman , who plays inventor Lucius Fox ( his job in today ’s scene is to chat with Wayne after the Bat nap ) , chimes in with a simple ” extraordinary . ”
Even before a single frame of the film has been seen , Ledger ’s twisted turn as the Joker — a part once played by no less an icon than Jack Nicholson — is already building buzz as a dazzling , demented tour de force .
Six months later , in January 2008 , it will suddenly , shockingly , become much more .
With The Dark Knight , Nolan and Bale return to Gotham City for a second , even moodier and more savage installment of the superhero franchise they revamped in 2005 with Batman Begins .
The movie delivers on its promise , pitting Batman against the freaky new fiend in psychotic cosmetics who robs banks and blows up hospitals for the sheer anarchic kick of it .
Most of the familiar faces ( and one new Two - Face ) are on board , including wry butler Alfred ( Michael Caine ) , stalwart police detective Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) , and lawyer - slash - love interest Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal , taking over the role from Katie Holmes ) , as well as a new crusading district attorney named Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) .
The Dark Knight has everything fans expect from the series : gizmos like a sleek new ” Bat Pod ” motorcycle , eye - popping stunts ( most performed the old - fashioned way , with real stuntmen and real explosions ) , and , of course , the brooding Bale , arguably the best , certainly the most serious actor ever to growl under the cowl .
Still , when the film opens July 18 , Ledger will be Topic A .
His turn in The Dark Knight would have been widely talked about this summer even if the 28 - year - old actor had n’t died of an accidental prescription - drug overdose last January .
It might have even earned him another Oscar nomination ( it still could , posthumously ) .
Now the performance is shrouded in tragedy , though , and may well be Ledger ’s last cinematic testament ( it ’s unclear what Terry Gilliam will , or can , do with the actor ’s unfinished footage from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus ) .
And that loads The Dark Knight with a poignancy its creators never anticipated .
Certainly one they never desired .
Along with the grief it caused friends and family , Ledger ’s death cast a shadow of uncertainty over the film .
It had Warner Bros . reexamining its entire marketing plans for the movie , conducting taste tests on the appropriateness of Ledger ’s clown face on publicity stills and in trailers .
Hardly the way the studio had hoped it would be launching its biggest summer thrill ride .
NEXT PAGE : ” The guy had serious nuts .
I needed someone who would n’t be afraid of the comparison with Jack Nicholson .
This was an actor who was n’t afraid to bury himself in his character — to a massive extent . ”

New War Brewing : US , Israel Take Dangerous Steps
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
GENEVA — The U.S. , Israel and Iran are playing a very dangerous game of chicken that soon could result in a new Mideast war .
U.S. intelligence has concluded that Iran is not working on nuclear weapons .
But the Bush administration and Israel , recently joined by France , are issuing increasingly loud threats of military action to frighten Iran into halting its nuclear enrichment program .
Iran insists its nuclear program is entirely for civilian use .
Tehran is alternating between conciliatory statements and threats to retaliate against any attack by inflicting economic chaos on the global economy .
Europe fears the economic damage a war against Iran would bring far more than Iran ’s nuclear program .
Senior Israeli officials are openly threatening to attack Iran ’s nuclear installations before President George W. Bush ’s term expires .
Early this month , Israel staged a large , U.S. - approved exercise using F - 15s and F - 16s to rehearse an attack over 900 miles — precisely the distance to Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The highly regarded American journalist Seymour Hersh just confirmed that the U.S. Congress authorized a $ 400 - million plan to overthrow Iran ’s government and incite ethnic unrest .
This column reported a year ago that U.S. and British special forces were operating in Iran , preparing for a massive air campaign .
Israel ’s destruction of an alleged Syrian reactor last fall was a warning to Iran .
This week a Pentagon official claimed an Israeli attack on Iran was coming before year - end .
Other Pentagon and CIA sources say a U.S. attack on Iran is imminent , with or without Israel .
The Bush administration is even considering using small tactical nuclear weapons against deeply buried Iranian targets .
Senior American officers Admiral William Fallon and Air Force Chief Michael Mosley recently were fired for opposing war against Iran .
According to Israel ’s media , President Bush even told Israel ’s Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that he could not trust America ’s intelligence community and preferred to rely on Israeli intelligence .
AIR BLITZ
Intensifying activity is evident at U.S. bases in Europe and the Gulf , aimed at preparing a massive air blitz that may include repeated attacks on 3,100 targets in Iran .
Other sources say Iranian Revolutionary Guard installations will be barraged by cruise missiles .
In Washington , Congress , under intense pressure from the Israel lobby , is about to adopt a resolution calling for a naval blockade of Iran , an overt act of war .
Pro-Israel groups have been airing TV commercials claiming Iran is attacking American troops in Iraq and threatens the U.S .
The Bush administration ’s last desperate act , its Gtterdmmerung , could be war with Iran .
UN weapons inspectors concur with U.S. intelligence that there is no proof Iran is working on nuclear arms , but the neocon war party in Washington is determined to loosen a final Parthian shaft by striking Iran .
Israel asserts the right to maintain its Mideast nuclear monopoly by destroying all fissile - producing reactors in the region .
Iran vows to retaliate against Israel with its inaccurate Shahab missiles , shut the Strait of Hormuz and mine the Gulf , producing worldwide financial panic , severe fuel shortages , and $ 400 — $ 500 per barrel oil .
Iran likely will attack U.S. forces in Afghanistan , Iraq and Kuwait , and strike Saudi and Kuwaiti oil facilities .
Canadians in Afghanistan could also become targets .
GRAVE DAMAGE
The embattled Bush administration ’s bunker mentality is leading to war that will gravely damage long - term U.S. Mideast interests .
A single Iranian missile hit on Israel ’s reactor would do more damage to the Jewish state than all its previous wars .
Besides , Israel cannot destroy Iran ’s nuclear infrastructure .
A U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran will guarantee Tehran decides to build nuclear weapons .
Israel and Iran have turned their regional rivalry into a confrontation that threatens all .
Iran ’s supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , not its bombastic President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , controls that nation ’s military and insists Iran will not produce nuclear weapons .
Israel claims it faces a second holocaust .
Iran says Israel ’s nuclear forces threaten its existence .
The dogs of war are being unleashed .

Heim in his earlier days - but how might he look now ?
Enlarge Image
Israel 's chief Nazi hunter has arrived in southern Chile to step up the hunt for the Nazi fugitive Aribert Heim .
Heim - known as Dr Death - is believed to be in the Patagonian regions of either Chile or Argentina .
Efraim Zuroff , of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre , will spend two days in Chilean Patagonia before crossing to Argentina .
Heim tortured and killed prisoners in Mauthausen concentration camp in World War II , but fled Germany in 1962 before authorities were able to arrest him .
Chilean and Argentinean newspapers have published pictures of Heim in 1950 , 1959 and how he might look now .
These are also displayed on posters advertising the search .
" In the last few days we 've received information from two different sources , both relating to Chile , which we think have very good potential , " the director of Israel 's Simon Wiesenthal Centre , Mr Zuroff , said .
" The reason we are going [ to Patagonia ] ... is of course the fact that Heim 's daughter lives in Puerto Montt , and we think there is a strong likelihood that he might be in that area or in the area between Puerto Montt and Bariloche [ Argentina ] . "
On the trail of ' Dr Death ' The Simon Wiesenthal Centre , along with the German and Austrian governments , has offered $ 495,000 ( 315,000 euros ; £ 250,000 ) for information leading to Heim 's arrest .
Although he would now be 94 , they believe Heim is still alive because his family has yet to claim around $ 1.6 m sitting in a German bank account in his name , says the BBC's Gideon Long in Santiago .
In order to make the claim , his family would have to prove he is dead .
The search for Heim is part of Operation Last Chance , a final bid to bring Nazi war criminals to justice more than 60 years after the end of WWII .
Body parts
Heim kept meticulous notes of his activities at Mauthausen .
According to Holocaust survivors , he performed operations and amputations without anaesthetic to see how much pain his victims could endure .
Injecting victims straight into the heart with petrol , water or poison were said to have been his favoured method at Mauthausen .
" His crimes are fully documented by himself , because he kept a log of the operations that he carried out , " Mr Zuroff said .
" He tortured many inmates before he killed them at Mauthausen , and he used body parts of the people he killed as decorations . "
After the war , Heim was detained by US forces , but later disappeared .
He practised medicine in the German town of Baden - Baden until 1962 , when he fled the country after being tipped off that the authorities were about to prosecute him .

What are these ?
Goldfish Keyring with Live Goldfish
China does n’t have the best record when it comes to animal rights and this latest “ shocking ” abuse further proves the point .
In waterfront Qingdao , vendors were selling heart shaped plastic keychains sealed with a live goldfish inside .
Since the keychains are completely sealed there is very little air and no way to feed the fish inside .
â€ œThe fish would survive just a few hours , and would be lucky to make it from the manufacturers to the point of sale .
We are shocked and appalled .
It is a gimmick and shows no respect for the animals at all . ”
One of the 2008 Olympics mascot HuanHuan was printed on the bag and although it is not an official Olympic item , it just goes to shows a complete lack of respect for all the fish who will die in these keychains .

Enlarge By Serkan Senturk , AP Iraqi refugee Suzan and her daughter Aya , seen here on May 8 in Istanbul , Turkey , fled their home in Iraq after Islamic extremists threatened to kill Suzan unless she closed down her hairdressing shop .
She paid a smuggler $ 18,000 to sneak her and her daughter from Turkey to Greece , but they only made it as far as Edirne , near the Greek border , where the smuggler vanished .
ISTANBUL , Turkey 
In the depths of despair , Suzan doused herself and her 14 - year - old daughter with gasoline and prepared to set them both on fire .
The Iraqi refugee 's dream of reaching Europe was dead .
Suzan , a hairstylist , had fled her homeland months earlier under threat from Islamic extremists and paid a smuggler $ 18,000 to sneak her and her daughter Aya from Turkey to Greece .
But when they reached Edirne , near the Greek border , the smuggler vanished .
Suzan returned to Istanbul , where she feared the only fate for her and Aya was prostitution .
" My dream was like a sand castle taken down by a big wave , " Suzan said .
" I did not want to see the day when me or my daughter are forced to leave the right path . "
Only Aya 's last - minute pleas stopped her from lighting them both ablaze .
" Please , mama , I kiss your feet , do n't do it , " Aya begged .
" She was in my arms , soaked with gasoline and shivering from fright ... I was so very desperate , and there was no way out , " Suzan recounted , crying at the memory and holding Aya .
She spoke to The Associated Press on condition her full name not be used because she fears deportation by Turkish authorities .
The desperation of Iraqi refugees appears to be fueling an increase in illegal migration into Europe — and in the activities of smugglers who exploit these refugees .
On June 23 , the law enforcement agency Europol carried out what it called one of the biggest coordinated sweeps against smuggler networks , arresting 75 people in nine European countries .
The sweep was code - named " Operation Baghdad , " a nod to the new importance of Iraq as a source of migrants .
An unspecified number of both the smugglers and the migrants were Iraqi .
While it's hard to gauge the extent of illegal immigration , Europol says asylum applications filed in European countries are an indirect indicator .
Such applications increased 10 % between mid-2006 and mid-2007 .
The situation has been exploited by organized crime groups , Europol said in a March report .
Up to 2.5 million Iraqis have fled their country over the past five years .
Most are in neighboring Syria , Jordan and Turkey , where their status is uncertain , they are barred from working and their money is running out .
So many are now trying to get into Europe .
A tiny portion of these Iraqi refugees can resettle legally in Europe or the United States .
Sweden has given shelter to about 40,000 Iraqis since the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq — far more than any other Western country .
And after a slow start , U.S. authorities said last month that they had taken in around 5,800 Iraqis so far this fiscal year .
But others have little hope .
Even those who have gained legal status in Syria , Jordan or Turkey are usually not allowed to work , meaning they must find jobs under the table or live off rapidly dwindling funds brought from Iraq .
Some , like Suzan , lose hope in the complicated process of applying for refugee status and resettlement abroad .
Suzan 's application to the U.N. refugee agency was rejected because Turkey was her second country of arrival .
Refugees are supposed to apply for status in the first country they arrive in , under most circumstances .
Suzan and Aya now rent a cinderblock apartment with broken windows and cracked walls for $ 200 a month , and she washes dishes for about $ 8 a day in Istanbul .
Turkey is a frequent launching point for illegal migrants to Europe , due to its borders with Greece , which has a huge coastal area and about 2,000 Aegean islands that allow for easier entry .
More than 112,000 migrants were caught sneaking into Greece last year , including 12,945 Iraqis , the second largest group after Albanians .
Nearly 2,000 Iraqis were caught by Greek authorities in the first three months of this year .
Ahmad Raouf , a 32 - year - old Iraqi , is one of those who successfully made it — reaching Sweden in March .
Raouf paid a trafficker $ 16,000 to take him to Stockholm via Turkey and Greece less than two months ago .
The smuggler gave him a fake passport , and soon after Raouf arrived in Sweden , he turned himself in , hoping for political asylum .
" Not all the smugglers are bad , " Raouf said in a telephone interview from Stockholm .
" He was very nice to me ... and was with me the whole trip and did not take a penny until I arrived . "
But for others , the smuggling attempt can lead to disaster .
A 35 - year - old Iraqi widow , who asked to be identified only by her last name , Abdul - Fattah , said she fled Baghdad with her two children in 2005 after her husband was killed by Shiite militiamen .
She applied to the U.N. refugee agency in Syria for resettlement more than a year ago but said she never heard back .
So Abdul - Fattah sold all her belongings and borrowed money from friends to pay $ 15,000 to an Iraqi smuggler who promised to get her and her children to Belgium from Syria .
Earlier this year , the smuggler gave her tickets and fake visas to the Central African Republic instead .
After landing in the capital Bangui , Abdul - Fattah said she was detained by police and sexually harassed .
" I have never been so humiliated or touched that way , " Abdul - Fattah sobbed in a telephone interview .
She and her children were deported to Libya , then to Damascus .
She has considered putting her children up for adoption because she can no longer provide for them .
" Vulnerable and devastated are just words .
What I feel is far worse , " she said .
" My husband is gone as well as my home , and now my money . "
Back in Damascus , with no money and no job , she and her children sleep on the floor in the basement of a friend 's building and live off charity from the Iraqi community .
" I was n't stupid when I gave away the money , I was just sinking in a sea of fear and desperation , " she said .
" He ( the smuggler ) duped me with his promises of living an easy life in Europe .
I wish someone had chopped off my hands before I handed him the money . "

PEOPLE touch each other a lot , even strangers .
We shake hands , slap backs , kiss and caress .
Such behaviour can increase co-operation , which is good from an evolutionary point of view .
It has even been shown that waitresses who touch patrons tend to be tipped more generously .
It is known that stroking rats can raise the level of oxytocin , a hormone active in the brain and implicated in various social interactions , such as maternal attachment .
In humans higher oxytocin levels have been linked to physiological phenomena like contractions during childbirth , or orgasm .
But the link to physical contact is so far unclear .
Interestingly , the level of hormone appears to rise in people who are trusted .
And more of it seems to inspire greater generosity towards strangers .
This prompted Vera Morhenn of the University of California , San Diego , and her colleagues , to examine the physiological mechanism underlying this and to see whether munificence towards strangers could be manipulated through touch .
In their experiment , published in Evolution and Human Behavior , they split 96 male and female graduate students into three groups .
The first and second received a professional massage but the third did not .
Then the first and third group took part in a “ trust game ” .
Participants were paired at random and seated in front of a computer , physically removed from their anonymous partner .
Each also got $ 10 in cash , supposedly for showing up .
The rules stipulated that for each pair , one person , the giver , could cede a part of their money to the other , the trustee .
This amount would then be tripled and credited to the trustee , who was subsequently prompted by the computer to sacrifice a part of his stash by returning some to the giver .
Standard game theory predicts that in an anonymous one - off exchange like this the trustee ought to keep the gift and not reciprocate .
The giver , too , ought to refrain from donating , since his sacrifice is bound to remain unrequited .
Yet that is not what tends to happen with real people .
Givers often give and trustees frequently return the favour .
( Studies of identical and non-identical twins suggest that co-operative behaviour in trust games is heritable . )
In effect , the giver 's donation reflects his confidence in the trustee 's willingness to reciprocate .
In other words , it signals trust .
To test the physiology , Dr Morhenn took blood samples at the start and end of each game and looked for changes in oxytocin levels .
She found no effect in the massaged group who did not participate in the game , implying that trust does indeed act as some sort of trigger .
But in the players the hormone rose in those who were massaged and fell slightly in those who were not .
Despite receiving statistically identical trust signals from givers , the massaged trustees with their higher oxytocin levels returned a whopping 243 % more than their unrubbed counterparts .
A clue to why evolution might favour such a double - trigger mechanism may come from the other finding that women appear more susceptible than men to tactile manipulation .
Perhaps that is to ensure maternal care of their own brood .
If so , such effects seem to extend beyond the mother 's bosom .

Once oil passed $ 140 a barrel , even the most rabidly right - wing media hosts had to prove their populist cred by devoting a portion of every show to bashing Big Oil .
Some have gone so far as to invite me on for a friendly chat about an insidious new phenomenon : “ disaster capitalism . ”
It usually goes well — until it does n’t .
For instance , “ independent conservative ” radio host Jerry Doyle and I were having a perfectly amiable conversation about sleazy insurance companies and inept politicians when this happened : “ I think I have a quick way to bring the prices down , ” Doyle announced .
“ We ’ve invested $ 650 billion to liberate a nation of 25 million people .
Should n’t we just demand that they give us oil ?
There should be tankers after tankers backed up like a traffic jam getting into the Lincoln Tunnel , the Stinkin ’ Lincoln , at rush hour with thank - you notes from the Iraqi government … .
Why do n’t we just take the oil ?
We ’ve invested it liberating a country .
I can have the problem solved of gas prices coming down in ten days , not ten years . ”
There were a couple of problems with Doyle ’s plan , of course .
The first was that he was describing the biggest stickup in world history .
The second , that he was too late : “ We ” are already heisting Iraq ’s oil , or at least are on the cusp of doing so .
It ’s been ten months since the publication of my book The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , in which I argue that today ’s preferred method of reshaping the world in the interest of multinational corporations is to systematically exploit the state of fear and disorientation that accompanies moments of great shock and crisis .
With the globe being rocked by multiple shocks , this seems like a good time to see how and where the strategy is being applied .
And the disaster capitalists have been busy — from private firefighters already on the scene in Northern California ’s wildfires , to land grabs in cyclone - hit Burma , to the housing bill making its way through Congress .
The bill contains little in the way of affordable housing , shifts the burden of mortgage default to taxpayers and makes sure that the banks that made bad loans get some payouts .
No wonder it is known in the hallways of Congress as “ The Credit Suisse Plan , ” after one of the banks that generously proposed it .

A new BitTorrent site has appeared which will allow scammers and spammers to infect its users with spyware , malware and viruses .
An admin of TrafficLoader.com says that no bad torrents will ever be removed from the site and is inviting people to upload malicious software to infect torrent users .
Here at TorrentFreak we get a few emails each week announcing the arrival of new BitTorrent sites but there are so many , we ca n’t possibly write about them all .
Instead , due to time limitations , we write about ones which are topical in some way or offer some interesting or unique features .
Today we report on a new torrent site which does indeed have an interesting feature , although most wo n’t appreciate it .
One of the main drawbacks of using P2P software such as Limewire , is that the content on the network ( Gnutella ) is unmoderated – anyone is free to put up whatever they like , be it music , movies or TV shows .
Of course , others use this lack of moderation as a green light to upload viruses , spyware and other malicious software .
Equally , one of the great strengths of BitTorrent ( at least from a harm - reduction point of view ) , is that .torrent files are uploaded to torrent sites where staff work hard to filter out as much of the malicious software as they can , making BitTorrent relatively malware - free .
Of course , this great system falls apart if you ca n’t trust the people running the site .
People expect anti-pirates like MiiVi to be ‘ the enemy within’ , but who needs those when you have ‘ friends ’ like the guys at new torrent site , TrafficLoader.com .
TrafficLoader.com ( and its forum , pdls.info ) has n’t been setup for the benefit of BitTorrent users , it will be used by spammers , scammers and virus peddlers to spread their malicious software among the community ( and make money off it ) .
One of the admins called ‘ Satty ’ says that no registration is needed to upload torrents to the site and none will ever be removed .
The site does have a notice – ‘ Viruses , spyware , affiliate links and everything related is strictly prohibited ’ but do n’t believe it – Satty says these rules do n’t apply to his friends in the PPI ( Pay Per Install ) community .
A few days ago the site was pretty bare with relatively few torrents and it was clear that most of them contained malware .
It was suggested to Satty that it might be a good idea to have some genuine torrents too , to help disguise the bad torrents .
Now things are starting to ‘ improve ’ on the site with many more torrents added recently which do n’t immediately appear to be malware .
In the last few days , TrafficLoader cosmetically ‘ cleaned up ’ the site to remove porn adverts in order to appear more genuine but unfortunately , someone as well as TorrentFreak noticed that they made a big mistake :
“ Why would you [ Satty , admin ] put a forum for ppi on a publicly scraped site , a.k. a here ??
Do you just want ppl to find out shit is full of malware ? ”
Just in case they did want people to find out , hopefully this post will help them get the word out .
For those that want advice on how to avoid bad torrents in the future , try one of our guides .

The US has said it will not hesitate to defend its interests and those of its allies as Iran continues missile tests .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the US had increased its security in the region and Iran should not be " confused " about US capabilities .
Iran has tested missiles , including one that could reach Israel , over the past two days .
Meanwhile French energy giant Total has said it will not invest in Iran because it is too politically risky .
Israel says its spy plane has a sophisticated early warning system Israel has responded to the missile tests by putting on display one of its aircraft that it says can spy on Iran .
The state - run Israel Aerospace Industries says it has equipped its Eitam aeroplane with sophisticated intelligence - gathering systems .
Speaking on a visit to Georgia , Ms Rice said : " We take very strongly our obligation to defend our allies and we intend to do that .
" In the Gulf area , the United States has enhanced its security capacity , its security presence and we are working closely with all our allies ... to make [ sure ] they are capable of defending themselves . "
She added that it was about time Iran " got on the right side of the international community " .
' Gesture of defiance '
The Iranian military said on Thursday that its Revolutionary Guards had carried out further medium - and long - range missile tests overnight , following tests on Wednesday .
Tensions mount over Iran Easy gas riches on hold for Iran
The tests included the first night test of the Shahab - 3 missile , said to have a range of 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) , along with shore - to - sea , surface - to - surface and sea - to - air missiles , state media reported .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says this appears another gesture of defiance following the international condemnation of Wednesday 's tests .
Media reports appeared to be delivered as a matter of pride .
Gen Hoseyn Salami , the Guards ' air force commander , said the tests demonstrated Iran 's " resolve and might against enemies who in recent weeks have threatened Iran with harsh language " .
State media quoted him as saying : " Our hands are always on the trigger and our missiles are ready for launch . "
Meanwhile , the head of Total , Christophe de Margerie , told the Financial Times the company 's planned development of the huge South Pars gas field in southern Iran would not go ahead .
" Today we would be taking too much political risk to invest in Iran because people will say : ' Total will do anything for money ' , " he said .
Total was the last major Western energy group to have seriously considered investing in the country 's huge gas reserves .
Analysts say the move will be a big blow to the Iranian energy industry - it means Iran is now unlikely to significantly increase its gas exports until late into the next decade .

A few weeks before her imprisonment she wrote Israel ’s Minister of Defense , Ehud Barak , explaining her decision to become a conscientious objector .
 I have been to the occupied Palestinian territories many times , and even though I realize that the soldier at the checkpoint is not responsible for Israel ’s oppressive policies , that soldier is still responsible for his conduct 
She summed up her letter to Barak with the following words :
 The bloody cycle in which I live  made up of assassinations , terrorist attacks , bombings , and shootings  has resulted in an increasing number of victims on both sides .
It is a vicious circle that is sustained by the choice of both sides to engage in violence .
I refuse to take part in this choice . 
While Vardi is the first woman to be imprisoned this year , she is part of a broader movement of Shministim , high - school seniors who refuse to be conscripted due to the military ’s oppression of the Palestinians .
Two other conscientious objectors , Udi Nir and Avichai Vaknin , were imprisoned earlier this month and a few others are likely to follow suit .
Like many other Shministim , Vardi ’s conscientious objection is also rooted in a wider pacifist position , which explains why she refused to wear a military uniform once imprisoned .
The prison authorities are not sympathetic to such acts of defiance and immediately placed her in the isolation ward , which , according to existing reports , is a site of abuse .
Vardi is in prison because the military conscientious committee did not accept her appeal .
In early March 2008 , Vardi testified in front of the committee , recounting her years of activism against the West Bank separation barrier and the dispossession of Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the South Hebron hills .
She explained to the committee members  made up of officers as well as civilians  that as a pacifist her conscience prevented her from being part of an occupying power .
She added that instead of serving in the military she was willing to carry out two years of civil service in Israel and had already secured a position with the Tel - Aviv based rights group Physicians for Human Rights .
Converting military service into civil service is common practice among Israeli women ; in fact , it has become routine among religious women .
Vardi ’s appeal was , accordingly , not exceptional or strange .
The appeal , however , was rejected , because , in the military committee ’s opinion , it was based on political convictions rather than a sincere conscientious belief .
This spurious separation between politics and conscientious principles was originally formulated by Israel ’s two court philosophers , professor Asa Kasher from Tel - Aviv University and professor Avi Sagi from Bar Ilan University .
These moral philosophers ( Kasher is also one of the authors of the Israeli military Code of Conduct which among other things provides moral grounds for assassinations [ pdf ] ) , have spent much of their time arguing that people who refuse to serve in the military due to its colonial and repressive actions and policies are doing so in order to advance a specific political agenda and not due to conscience .
According to Kasher and Sagi , conscientious objection is , by definition , divorced from politics ; therefore anyone who refuses to serve in the military because he or she wants to end Israel ’s occupation of the Palestinian territories ( a political position ) simply cannot be a conscientious objector .
The military was , of course , delighted to adopt the philosophers ’ distinction and has repeatedly used it to reject the appeals of conscientious objectors like Vardi and to put them behind bars .
On the day of her imprisonment Vardi told her father that she would not bow down to the powers that be regardless of how the military presents her case .
 The occupation is cruel ,  she said , and my conscience will simply not allow me take part in the oppression of another people . 
While she has yet to study moral philosophy , eighteen year - old Sahar Vardi understands something basic that Kasher , Sagi and their cronies are determined to elide : conscientious concern for one ’s country and neighbors is intricately tied to action .
As Joseph Raz from Balliol College , Oxford , points out ,  there is no doubt that [ conscientious objection ] covers the case of military service , for calling on people to be ready to kill when ordered , or calling on them to engage in activities which perpetrate an occupation with the subjugation of people to the indignities and humiliation which occupations involve are clear cases where the right applies .
It is , after all , the duty of respect for human beings , perhaps the most fundamental of all moral duties , which serves the guiding principle for the Israeli refuseniks .
It is also the foundation of the right to conscientious objection .

Most people probably think of change when they hear the word evolution , but some of evolution 's most amazing molecular inventions have stuck around hundreds of millions , even billions of years .
The complex protein machinery needed to express genes , metabolize energy sources , reproduce sexually , and lay out body plans has remained in place largely unchanged in spite of the tremendous variety we see in the living world .
These constant core cellular processes are why biologists could crack the universal genetic code by experimenting with bacteria , and why we gain insight into cell division and cancer by studying yeast .
The big question , argue the authors of The Plausibility of Life , is not how evolution keeps inventing new genes - it's how evolution can produce so much variety when the basic processes change so little .
Later in the book Kirschner and Gerhart are going to argue that these basic systems have persisted so long because they are versatile , that they posses features which make them well - suited to facilitating the biological diversity we see today .
We 'll come to that argument later ; today we 'll take a closer look at the core conserved molecular systems that carry out the most basic cellular functions .
1. Metabolism and Gene Expression
When molecular biology was really taking off as a science , most of the field 's future Nobel Laureates were doing their experiments with bacteria .
The process of moving information from genes , encoded in DNA , to proteins , which carry out most of the physical work in the cell , is one of the oldest molecular systems around .
All known organisms on earth use the same basic process to express genetic information : a gene is read out and transcribed into RNA by one set of proteins , including the critical one called RNA polymerase .
The RNA is taken up into a large complex called a ribosome , and translated into protein .
All cells do this , and all cells use the same core protein machinery .
There are many accessory proteins involved as well , and the accessory proteins are not always conserved .
But the basic machinery is .
Take for example , a piece of the ribosome : you can line up the protein sequence of the same piece from humans , yeast and bacteria , and you can see the similarity ( each letter stands for a different amino acid ; recall that a protein is a linear chain of amino acids ) :
How to read this : the little marks at the bottom indicate amino acids that are identical or chemically similar .
Especially similar sequences are boxed in red .
The sequence is similar , and the proteins fold up into very similar final structures .
Whether you are a human , yeast , or bacteria , you use the same basic proteins to express the information encoded in your DNA .
Not only do we share gene expression machinery with bacteria , we also share many of the chemical reactions and enzymes that power the cell .
Many of the enzymes that break down sugar , as well the class of chemical wizards called the P450 cytochromes are found in all life .
What this means is that these incredibly useful systems were invented early in the history of life , and they have served all forms of life well ever since .
Evolution does n't have to reinvent proteins to metabolize sugar over and over ; once was enough .
2. Sex , Chromosomes , and Cell Division
The next major evolutionary innovation that Kirchner and Gerhart note is the evolution of eukaryotic cells , that is , cells whose genetic material is packaged into chromosomes and kept in a nucleus .
This was a major step forward , away from the bacterial lifestyle .
Eukaryotes include single - celled critters like amoebas and yeast , as well as all plants , animals , and fungi ( yeast are actually fungi ) .
The story here is the same : the basic protein machinery responsible for the unique features of eukaryotic cells are conserved in all eukaryotic cells .
The proteins that package DNA into chromosomes and the proteins that control and carry out cell division have been conserved through one billion years of evolution .
Sex has been conserved as well .
Not what we typically think of as sex , but the process at the cellular level arose long ago .
For example , Yeast reproduce sexually - yeast are single cells , and do n't make sperm or eggs , but they do undergo the same process of meiosis involved in producing human reproductive cells .
After meiosis , two yeast cells can fuse to create a new organism with two copies of each chromosome , just like a fertilized human egg .
From our perspective , this process is not what we imagine when we think of sex , but from system for sexual reproduction was invented about a billion years ago , and it has served eukaryotic cells well ever since .
3. Sticking Together : Multi-cellularity
The next major molecular innovation discussed by Kirschner and Gerhart is the development of organisms made up of more than one cell .
This type of thing has happened multiple times in evolution .
The evolution of animals and plants are the obvious examples , but it's also happened independently in fungi ( mushrooms ) , and slime molds ( and elsewhere ) .
There are many different ways to be multicellular , and at this point , Kirschner and Gerhart purposely limit their focus to animals .
Animals are all multicellular in the same way , meaning that the same basic protein components that hold cells together and enable them to communicate with each other have remained the same .
Sea urchin cells use the same molecular glue to holds cells together that we do , and they also use of the same cell - to - cell communication pathways .
4. Body Plans
Finally , the protein toolbox to make body plans - to determine front and back , top and bottom , to generate limbs or wings - was a major evolutionary invention that has been modified over and over ( but never rebuilt from scratch ) to create worms , starfish , flies , lizards , and us .
For example , a regulatory protein called PAX6 is involved in making eyes in a mouse , and also makes eyes in flies .
This one of the most interesting lessons scientists have learned in the past two decades : the tremendous variety of animal body plans does not involve building new protein systems from scratch , it just involves tweaking existing ones .
The system already in place has tremendous potential to produce millions of different body forms .
Detecting Evolution
How do we know these systems evolved ?
In truth , this is a side issue in our main intellectual thread ; scientists generally are not interested in re-establishing evolution over and over again .
That evolution occurs has been well - established by 150 years of scientific research .
In contrast , understanding how evolution works is an area of active research , and this is the question that The Plausibility of Life is focused on .
Still , in the public arena the conversation keeps coming back to how scientists know evolution happens .
There are many ways to answer this question , and here I 'll focus on two lines of evidence for the antiquity of the major cellular systems we 've just discussed .
1 . The same but different : the pattern of differences and similarities in the gene sequences themselves are what we expect evolution to produce .
We 've just learned that the machinery involved in transferring information from DNA to proteins is essentially the same in all life , from bacteria to us .
But the genes making up this machinery are not exactly the same , as you can see in the figure above : over time , mutations are going to change things , and after several billion years , differences have accumulated between the human and the bacterial versions of these genes .
Where those differences accumulate is the key clue : those parts of a gene most important for function have experienced little change , while the less - important portions change significantly .
This is natural selection at work : a mutation that destroys the function of a critical gene will cripple an organism , while a mutation in a less important portion of the gene will accumulate as evolutionary noise .
The human and bacterial ribosome proteins do not look designed .
The differences between the proteins are largely random differences , they are not differences important for making a human instead of a bacterium .
You can't explain the pattern of similarities and differences by saying a designer made one version for just right for humans and one perfect for bacteria , because the differences between these two versions are random ; they are not relevant to the function of the protein .
The pattern of differences you see is what you expect evolution to produce .
And we can go further : look closely at the above figure again .
You can see that the human and yeast proteins are more similar to each other than they are to the bacterial protein .
This is because yeast and humans shared a common ancestor more recently than they shared a common ancestor with bacteria .
The similarities and differences , found in the genes of all life , follow the pattern of a family tree .
Your genes are more similar to the genes of your siblings than they are to the genes of your first cousins , and there are even more genetic differences between you and your second cousins .
Why ?
Because you share more recent common ancestors with your siblings ( the ancestors being your parents ) than you do with your cousins ( with your grandparents being the common ancestors in the case of first cousins , great - grandparents in the case of second cousins ) .
2. Molecules and fossils match :
The family tree evident in the DNA of all life is reinforced by the fossil record .
The protein machinery for controlling body plans discussed by Kirschner and Gerhart is shared by all animals , but not plants ( which have a significantly different set of protein tools ) ; thus this protein machinery probably evolved later than the evolutionary split between animals and plants .
And that is in fact when animal body plans start showing up in the fossil record : much , much later than the split ( seen in the fossil record ) between animals and plants .
The order of invention of these conserved cellular processes ( observable only with modern molecular biology technology ) correlates stunningly well with the changes we see in the fossil record .
And the genes involved in these core cellular processes show differences and similarities that follow the pattern of a family tree , very similar to the one that evolutionary biologists put together before we knew how to read the DNA sequences of genes .
Coming back to our main thread , we can see that , in spite of the huge variety we observe in the living world , several major core cellular systems were put in place early in life 's history and have remained ever since .
Is there something about these systems that makes them well - suited to producing novelty in evolution ?
Their existence would seem to make things easier : instead of reinventing complex systems from scratch to produce major new groups of organisms , evolution can use the same basic set of tools , over and over , to continually produce new modes of life .
This is the third installment of a series of posts on an interesting recent book by the accomplished biologists Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart .
In this book , the authors lay out what they see as the most important research agenda for molecular biologists in the 21st century .

Mazda has played a huge role in making the Rotary engine as popular as it is today .
Beginning with the RX - 7 and evolving into the RX - 8 , it has made quite an impression on most of the people who experience its potential .
Now , Mazda is moving the rotary into the alternative fuels category , which should only increase the already growing fan base .
Mazda 's rotary engine has always been known for its power , but it was lacking in the fuel economy department .
Emissions were also a little under par with other vehicles of comparable size .
The answer to this problem can be found in the use of Hydrogen .
The next generation RX - 8 , which will most likely be named the RX - 9 , will feature a dual - fuel capability .
It can run on normal petroleum fuel and offer the performance that we have come to expect from the Mazda Rotary engine .
When you feel like cutting some emissions and the amount of fuel you are burning , you can switch over to Hydrogen .
Mazda reports fuel economy increases of up to 20 when running on Hydrogen .
As with all things , there is a downside .
That 20 % drop in fuel consumption will cost you about the same percentage under your right foot .
Mazda is predicting that most people will use this to run around the city until more performance is needed , at which point petro will be switched on .
Mazda has been working with the Hydrogen powered RX - 8 for over 8 months .
The current prototype , called the RX8 HYDROGEN RE , has been a complete success .
The newer Premacy MVP has also seen its fair share of tests and seems to be holding up very well .
The next - gen RX - 8 will come in either a close ratio manual or the less enticing automatic gearbox putting power to the rear wheels .
Mazda has also hinted that it will be taking styling cues from the Taiki concept originally seen at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show .
Sales should start sometime in 2012 .

SAN FRANCISCO  Intercepting Internet traffic , and spying on the communication between two computers , is a gold mine for hackers .
Now Carnegie Mellon University researchers hope software they 've built will make it harder for criminals to hit that jackpot .
The software , a free download for use with latest version of the Firefox Web browser , creates an additional way for people to verify whether the site they 're trying to visit is authentic .
TECHNOLOGY LIVE : More on computer security Most browsers already alert users when a site appears bogus .
One way is by warning that a site that claims to be equipped to handle confidential information securely has n't been verified by a third party , like VeriSign or GoDaddy.com
Those are two of many companies that sell so - called Secure Sockets Layer certificates , which generate the padlock icon in the address bar .
The problem , the Carnegie Mellon researchers say , is that many people are perplexed about how to proceed once they get one of those warnings about a bad certificate .
Some click through , going on to malicious sites that steal their personal information , while others retreat , skipping over harmless sites that used less expensive , " self - signed " certificates .
So the researchers — David Andersen , Adrian Perrig and Dan Wendlandt — created a program that performs a novel extra step .
It can tap into a network of publicly accessible servers that have been programmed to ping websites and record changes in the encryption keys they use to secure data .
Any discrepancy can be a sign that hackers are rerouting traffic through machines under their control , a pernicious type of attack known as a " man in the middle . "
As a result , the new program either overrides the security warning if a site is deemed legitimate , or throws up another warning if the subsequent probes reveal more red flags .

" The people who say I am shifting to the center apparently have n't been listening to me . " ... Barack Obama
If you 're like me I 've had difficulty supporting the policy positions of Barack Obama lately .
Suddenly he 's transformed himself from a candidate of change to the disingenuous , calculating politician he actually is in hopes of winning the broadest possible voter appeal in the Fall .
The Democratic presidential candidate 's favorite son recent tour of the Middle East / Europe supports my contention and was momentous for obvious reasons .
Foremost was to rekindled Obama 's commitement to bring the troops home from Iraq .
However , observers exercising judicious skepticism could n't help but notice similarities to Bush 's rhetoric from the previous seven years .
It was designed to buttress any lingering doubts global capital financiers might have about further investing in our warfare state as silent partners .
This shrewd , smooth - tongued politico from Illinois conveyed to the gilded parasites exactly what they wanted to find out as well .
For example , speaking in Berlin last week the suave Obama reiterated many of the same persuasions used by the avowed outlaw he hopes to succeed offering similar assurances that he 's COMMITED to the ongoing terrorist war .
Interspersed amongst his flowery presentation were assurances the United States would remain dedicated to a " new dawn " in the Middle East by transferring the militarist front from Iraq to engagement in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Adopting another line from Bush he implied it 's our " shared destiny " to remake the Muslim bloc countries into an open - ended vision western nations find more patronizing to their interests .
For the corporate elitists listening in the audience that was the compelling statement they were waiting to hear , affirmation they could continue profiting from Bush 's morass of greed .
These proclaimations alone should have been a harbinger of where Barack Obama intends to lead the nation if elected President but earlier renunciations prior to departing on the audition tour overseas were prognostic indicators of his imminent shift in political beliefs for the sake of national Party expediency .
Betting an inattentive public would be desensitized by media coverage or ( lack of ) the tiresome trivia devoted to the general elections , consultants serving his executive bid dazedly advised him to reposition himself on such stalwart domestic issues as campaign finance , handguns , prisoner executions , NAFTA and FISA in anticipation discontented autonomous and Republican voters would find refuge with him .
Although tweaking disputable political questions is nothing new for our major party affiliations to give them the appearance of accoutability , FISA is where I refuse to concede .
There can be no wiggle room for either the executive branch of our government or Congress who 's required to keep the former in check by upholding the basic Constitutional doctrines they swore to keep intact .
Amy Goodman of DEMOCRACY NOW !
recently posted an exchange of two Obama supporters whom she interviewed for her radio program on July 26 which capsulizes the utter divide this quarrel poises .
Glen Greenwald , a blogger at Salon Magazine defends the Constitution while a legal scholar , Cass Sunstein tries to justify the candidate 's recant of his former position .
Sunstein :
Yes , I think it 's -- this is widely misunderstood .
What the bill is n't is basically a bill that -- whose fundamental purpose is to give immunity .
It 's a bill that creates a range of new safeguards to protect privacy , to ensure judicial supervision , to give a role for the inspector general .
So it actually gives privacy and civil liberties a big boost over the previous arrangement .
It also does contain an immunity provision , which Senator Obama opposed .
He voted for the substitute bill that did n't have that .
But he thought that this was a compromise which had safeguards for going forward , which made it worth supporting on balance , compared to the alternative , which was the status quo .
So there 's been no fundamental switch for him .
He 's basically concerned with protecting privacy .
And this is not his favorite bill , but it 's a lot better than what the Bush administration had before , which was close to free reign .
Greenwald :
Well , you know , it 's one thing to defend Senator Obama and to support his candidacy , as I do .
It 's another thing to just make factually false claims in order to justify or rationalize anything that he does .
The idea that this was n't a reversal is just insultingly false .
Back in December , Senator Obama was asked , " What is your position on Senator Dodd 's pledge to filibuster a bill that contains retroactive immunity ? "
And at first , Senator Obama issued an equivocal statement , and there were demands that he issue a clearer statement .
His campaign spokesman said -- and I quote -- " Senator Obama will support a filibuster of any bill that contains retroactive immunity " -- " any bill that contains retroactive immunity . "
The bill before the Senate two weeks ago contained retroactive immunity , by everybody 's account , and yet not only did Senator Obama not adhere to his pledge to support a filibuster of that bill , he voted for closure on the bill , which is the opposite of a filibuster .
It 's what enables a vote to occur .
And then he voted for the underlying bill itself .
So it 's a complete betrayal of the very unequivocal commitment that he made not more than six months ago in response to people who wanted to know his position on this issue in order to decide whether or not to vote for him .
That 's number one .
Number two , the idea that this bill is an improvement on civil liberties is equally insulting in terms of how false it is .
This is a bill demanded by George Bush and Dick Cheney and opposed by civil libertarians across the board .
ACLU is suing .
The EFF is vigorously opposed .
Russ Feingold and Chris Dodd , the civil libertarians in the Senate , are vehemently opposed to it ; they say it 's an evisceration of the Fourth Amendment .
The idea that George Bush and Dick Cheney would demand a bill that 's an improvement on civil liberties and judicial oversight is just absurd .
This bill vests vast new categories of illegal and / or unconstitutional and warrantless surveillance powers in the President to spy on Americans ' communications without warrants .
If you want to say that that 's necessary for the terrorist threat , one should say that .
But to say that it's an improvement on civil liberties is just propaganda .
Obama 's centrist strategy was preordained from the time he won the Democratic nomination and entered into the general primary for the Presidential sweepstakes .
Some call it smart politics but recent history reveals both Al Gore and John Kerry lost by employing this tactic .
I prefer the term betrayal of the public trust to describe the course of action he 's pursuing and predicted last November the eventual nominees of either party would embrace such methods .
Eight months ago I wrote :
" I 'll be voting for the individual who has presented me with the best plan to restore democracy to America .
The first year agenda must include the prosecution of Bush / Cheney for war crimes , reinstate citizens ' privacy rights , suspend international trade agreements , criminalize offshore banking , close loopholes in campaign finance laws , reverse the deregulatory policies of the present Administration and withdraw from unwarranted international engagement so our tax dollars can pay for the needs of our own people . "
None of the present candidates for PRETENDER TO THE THRONE meets these expectations .
They recite ad nauseam , soundbites written for them designed to mollify both the media and the message they convey to voters who are starving for substantive plans to address the escalating problems of the nation .
That was the false promise Barrack Obama conned us into believing and reneged on while McCain has only failed , recycled GOP ideas from the past to offer .
Billary was previously exposed as an enabler of worldly solutions in the primaries .

Could injections of vitamin C help treat cancer ?
That ’s the suggestion from a new study in mice – and trials are already under way to test similar injections in people .
But some cancer specialists are sceptical , and fear that desperate patients will be prompted to start taking large doses of the vitamin .
That may be dangerous , because antioxidants such as vitamin C could undermine the effectiveness of standard cancer drugs and radiation therapy .
Excitement over the idea of treating cancer with vitamin C grew in the 1970s after the Nobel prize - winning chemist Linus Pauling suggested that it helped terminally ill patients survive for longer .
However , in 1985 , two placebo - controlled trials found no effect of taking vitamin C pills .
Advertisement
In the current study , researchers led by Mark Levine of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda , Maryland , gave vitamin C to mice intravenously .
Oxidation boost
The researchers injected immune - deficient mice with cells from three aggressive human cancers – ovarian and pancreatic tumours , plus a form of brain cancer called glioblastoma – and found that vitamin C injections slowed tumour growth by up to 53 % .
By injecting into the bloodstream , Levine explains , it is possible to get much larger amounts of the vitamin to a tumour than is possible with oral supplements .
While vitamin C is usually an antioxidant , under these circumstances it causes the formation of hydrogen peroxide , a powerful oxidising agent that kills cancer cells .
Levine suggests that intravenous vitamin C could be a useful addition to conventional cancer therapy .
His team has also found that women in a preliminary clinical trial are getting similar doses of vitamin C to those seen in the experimental mice .
“ It ’s pharmacologically achievable , ” Levine says .
That trial , led by Jeanne Drisko of the University of Kansas in Kansas City , aims to recruit 50 women to test the safety of giving intravenous vitamin C , plus other antioxidants given orally , on top of existing therapies for ovarian , cervical or uterine cancer .
Although there is little evidence that it works in humans , Drisko ’s clinic also offers intravenous vitamin C to paying patients .
Self - medication risks
Meanwhile , the Cancer Treatment Centers of America ( CTCA ) in Zion , Illinois , is testing the safety of intravenous vitamin C in late - stage cancer patients for whom there is no other treatment option .
So far , 10 out of a planned 18 patients have been enrolled into the trial .
Definitive answers on the effectiveness of intravenous vitamin C will only come from subsequent larger trials .
But given recent experiences with a drug called DCA , which some patients began taking without medical supervision after reading about promising results on cancer cells , there are concerns that patients may take matters into their own hands by injecting themselves with vitamin C or taking large doses of vitamin C pills .
Many cancer patients take antioxidant vitamins , often without telling their doctors .
While Drisko and other backers of complementary approaches suggest that antioxidants can aid therapy and reduce side - effects , conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are thought to work in part by generating free radicals which kill cancer cells .
Because antioxidant vitamins can mop up these radicals , they may interfere with cancer therapy , other researchers warn .
“ You want to make sure you ’re not taking supplemental vitamins , ” says David Agus , an oncologist at the Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles .

Senator Obama , you 've asked of your supporters to believe not just in your ability to do the same , as concerned and caring American citizens who love our country .
I hear your clarion call , and I believe .
I believe in you as a candidate and as a leader .
And I believe that the American people , in this crucial time for the future of our country , are coming together to stand up for our freedom .
I believe that the people who support you and who believe in you are speaking loudly and clearly .
I believe you will hear them and will uphold your promise to oppose any FISA bill which includes immunity for for the telecommunications companies which unlawfully went along with President George W. Bush 's program of warrantless wiretapping of ordinary American citizens .
It is at times like these , with our country on the brink of losing some of the greatest attributes that define us as a nation , that we must step up to the crucial role that destiny has handed us .
This is a defining moment in the history of our country .
Do we let ourselves be taken into an age of fear , mistrust , and paranoia , forever feeling that we are being watched and that everyone is a spy ?
Or do we hold our heads up , unafraid , and as Americans declare that enough is enough ?
We do n't want any more of the paranoid culture of fear that is seemingly the Bush administration 's meager vision of our future .
We are tired of being told that as Americans we must mistrust and be afraid .
We must stand , tall and united , against those who seek to turn the United States into a surveillance society .
We must stand up and say " NO ! " to those who would turn us into a nation of fearful , isolated citizens , fearing each other , fearing the government , fearing the massive technological complex which has been turned to the ignoble end of monitoring our every word in some misguided attempt to provide an illusory security at the very real cost of our highest ideals .
A government which operates on the basic belief that it must keep its citizens silent and fearful through some sort of all - seeing , all - hearing intelligence apparatus is a government which has already destroyed that which it seeks to defend .
If we forsake our highest ideals of liberty in the name of defending ourselves from a foreign enemy which seeks to take our freedom , then we have already handed them the victory which they seek .
For in so doing we have indeed allowed them to destroy our greatness and our freedom by intimidating us into doing their work for them .
A proud group of your supporters who believe in your call for hope and a new kind of politics , and who also realize the importance of the FISA telecom immunity issue , has come together and organized themselves on your website .
We are among your most loyal and enthusiastic supporters .
Our group has already grown to more than 2,000 members in just a couple of days , and it continues to grow as I write this .
Please , Senator Obama , reject the politics of fear on national security , vote against this bill and lead other Democrats to do the same !
A proud supporter ,
Steve Elliott

I would n’t term the problem I ran into last Friday a disaster , but it certainly cost me several hours of time trying to find a workaround .
Culprit # 1 : Rails
Rails ’ ActiveSupport added a handy little method called #chars to the String class .
In and of itself this does n’t seem like such a bad thing , and a lot of other handy methods in ActiveSupport are built on top of #chars .
However , as we ’ll see , taking advantage of Ruby ’s open classes to extend core types has a way of drawing the unwanted attention from the Law of Unintended Consequences .
Culprit # 2 : Ruby
It ’s not set in stone anywhere , but there ’s a fairly well accepted convention in open source projects that versions are divided into a major version , a minor version , and a tiny or patch version .
New major versions indicate API - breaking changes .
A new minor version may introduce new features , but existing code should continue to work as - is .
And a new tiny version indicates that the API remains fixed ; the only difference is that bugs have been fixed and security holes patched .
Ruby 1.8.7 is a minor release masquerading as a tiny release .
Among the features backported into 1.8.7 from Ruby 1.9 is a new #chars attribute .
Unfortunately , it is incompatible with the Rails 2.0 implementation of #chars .
This , incidentally , is a prime example of one of the subtler ways that patching the core classes can bite you .
Even if you are adding new methods rather than re-writing existing ones , the chances are good that someone else will have the same idea only with a slightly different implementation and semantics .
Bang , incompatibility .
Culprit # 3 : MacPorts
We have an app which has not yet been ported to Rails 2.1 .
This , in itself , would not have been a problem ; we can keep running it under Ruby 1.8.6 with Rails 2.0 , no problem .
However , I have a nasty habit of trying to keep my software up to date .
So I run sudo port upgrade outdated periodically , and watch all the errors from unmaintained ports go scrolling across my terminal for 24 hours or so .
The last time I did this , one of the ports that did manage to build was Ruby .
Version 1.8.7 .
The next time I ran our app , it of course promptly crashed .
This is the point at which I discovered something I had n’t realized about MacPorts : it has no downgrade path .
Coming from the world of Debian , Ubuntu , and apt - get , I just expected any package management system to handle the case where the user specifies an older version to be installed .
In fact , there ’s a way to do it in MacPorts , but it ’s painful .
Fail .
So there I was with a broken app , no time in the iteration to upgrade it to Rails 2.1 , and no easy way to get back to Ruby 1.8.6 .
Lame .
Rescue
After bitching and moaning on Twitter for awhile , I decided Bob helps those who help themselves , so I took a look at the crash backtrace I was getting .
I traced it back to a line in vendor / rails / activesupport/lib/activesupport/core_ext/string/access.rb :
def first ( limit = 1 ) chars [ 0 ..( limit - 1 ) ].to_s end
In the Rails 2.0 version of String #chars , # chars returns an Array or Array - like object which can be subscripted with # [ ] .
The Ruby 1.8.7 version , by contrast , returns an Enumerable : : Enumerator .
“ That ’s easy enough ” thought I , and , fully expecting that patching this one issue would just reveal another incompatibility , and another , and another … , I changed the code to :
def first ( limit = 1 ) chars.to_a [ 0 ..( limit - 1 ) ].to_s end
Lo and behold , the app worked perfectly .
Of course , YMMV .
But as a quick kludge this one was surprisingly painless .
Lessons Learned
Here ’s what I took away from this experience :
Be wary of adding methods to core classes .
What could possibly go wrong ?
More than you think .
Patch releases should be true patch releases .
It ’s tempting to include a neat new feature as a bonus –
again , what could possibly go wrong ?
Resist this urge .
Macs are shiny , but for industrial - strength development support , nothing beats a Debian - based system with APT .
Every now and then taking a clawhammer to vendor code is the shortest ( short - term ) way from point A to point B. Personally I prefer to either keep this kind of change local or , if necessary , version it with something like Piston , rather than maintaining it as a monkey - patch .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) The U.S. and several other nations recently attended a Codex meeting this month in Calgary , Canada to discuss food labeling .
The Codex Alimentarius Commission implements the Joint FAO / WHO Food Standards Program , the purpose of which is to protect the health of consumers and to ensure fair practices in the food trade .
The Codex Alimentarius ( Latin , meaning Food Law or Code ) is a collection of internationally adopted food standards presented in a uniform manner .
One of the principle reasons for this forum was to discuss the necessity , or lack of necessity as the U.S. sees it , to set up mandatory labeling of GM ( genetically modified ) and GE ( genetically engineered ) foods for consumers .
South Africa ( SA ) and many African countries are strong dissenting voices of the U.S. policy that all GM / GE foods are considered equal to non-GM / GE foods and are in fact deemed safe under a 1992 George H. W. Bush Executive Order .
Under this official policy , all GM / GE foods are not required to undergo any kind of safety testing before entering the market .
Below you will find the exact policy of the FDA concerning GM food : " FDA relies primarily on two sections of the Act to ensure the safety of foods and food ingredients .
Generally , whole foods , such as fruits , vegetables , and grains , are not subject to premarket approval .
The primary legal tool that FDA has successfully used to ensure the safety of foods is the adulteration provisions of section 402 ( a ) ( 1 ) .
The Act places a legal duty on developers to ensure that the foods they present to consumers are safe and comply with all legal requirements .
FDA has authority to remove a food from the market if it poses a risk to public health .
Foods derived from new plant varieties developed through genetic engineering will be regulated under this authority as well " [ 1 ] .
Hence , nearly every modified food in the U.S. is completely untested for safety .
This is very noteworthy for two reasons : ( a ) the U.S. leads the world in GM / GE foods ( with up to 80 % of its prepared and prepackaged foods being modified ) ; and ( b ) every other nation besides the U.S. tests all GM / GE food before they are put into the food chain .
Several African nations have dubbed GM / GE foods as " lethal " and believes the U.S. is fulfilling a population reduction strategy in Africa .
During the CODEX meeting , SA , who has been demanding that Codex provide them with distinct and mandatory GM / GE labels , presented a 10 - page document expressing this view .
In this document the following critical points were made : 1. Unmet Religious and Ethical Concerns of Christians and Jewsa .
Corruption of Divine ProtectionSouth Africa pointed out that in nearly every country there are various religious groups with differing beliefs when it comes to ingesting certain foods .
South Africa stated that these " religious and ethical concerns must be noted and respected through global mandatory labeling of foods derived from genetic engineering and biotechnology must take into account ethical and religious concerns " [ 2 ]
( CCFL , 2008 , p. 1 ) .
For example , kosher Jews and Halal Muslims would wish to know whether the corn they were eating had been modified with a gene from pigs .
Similarly , vegetarians would certainly wish to avoid vegetables which contained animal genes inserted into them and have an ethical right to know if this was the case .b. Moral and Ethical ProtectionSA contends that Codex and the WTO ( World Trade Organization ) assure protection of the moral , ethical and religious rights of Christian and Jewish believers .
Therefore , mandatory labeling is essential to ensure these rights are preserved .
If , for example , a Christian believed that God created the heaven and earth as well as all living creatures ( including food ) , then a serious ethical concern would arise if he or she wanted to avoid such modified foods but had no realistic way to do so .
2 . Unintended Consumer Health Effectsa .
Psychological and Emotional HealthSA rightfully argued that the introduction of GM / GE foods violate the principles and mandates of Codex which are in place to protect the health of the consumer .
In Norway , a report on GM / GE foods stated that , " some customers may experience strong ethical , religious , emotional or other objections for purchasing certain foods .
These perceived risks may influence their health .
These aspects of health should also be considered when the needs for new standards are discussed " [ 2 ] .
Hence , the labeling of GM / GE foods should be mandatory under such an assumption .b.
Unknown Effects of Consumption of GM / GE Biotech FoodsDue to the lack of testing on GM / GE foods , safety is a significant concern for many individuals .
These individuals may wish to avoid such food out of legitimate concern for their well - being .
Antibiotic - resistant super diseases may be created if the antibiotic gene inserted into most GM foods would transfer into the consumer .
Furthermore , some concerning results have been evinced from animals consuming GM / GE foods .
GM DNA has been found in every organ ( including fetuses ) of animals eating these types of food .
Additionally , numerous studies have shown many deleterious short and long - term effects from the consumption of GM / GE foods .
For example , spermicide - containing corn , which was developed with funds from the USDA , and results in complete sterility in males has been rampant in the food chain for some time .
Without proper labeling of these types of foods , there is no way to protect the fertility of males .
Several other recent studies are detailed below : *
In 2005 and 2006 , researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that female rats who were fed glyphosate - tolerant GM soya produced an excessive number of stunted pups with over 50 % of them dying within three weeks .
The other half were all sterile .
This experiment was repeated several times with the same result [ 3 ] .*
Between 2005 and 2006 in the Warangal district of Andhra Pradech in India , thousands of sheep died while grazing on residues from Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis , which is a type of bacteria which is toxic to some types of insects ) cotton crops [ 4 ] .*
In 2003 , villagers in the Philippines ' south suffered mysterious illnesses when a Monsanto Bt maize hybrid came into flower .
At least five have died and many villagers tested positive for antibodies to the Bt protein while others still remain chronically ill [ 5 ] .*
Between 2001 and 2002 , 12 cows died in Hesse , Germany after consuming Syngenta GM maize ( Bt176 ) , while many others had to be slaughtered due to mysterious illnesses [ 6 ] .*
From 2002 to 2005 , researchers from four Italian universities published articles indicating that GM soya adversely affected pancreatic , hepatic ( liver ) and testicular cells in young mice [ 5 ] .*
In 2005 , Australian researchers at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra reported that a harmless protein in beans ( alpha - amylase inhibitor - 1 ) caused inflammation in the lungs of mice and elicited increased dietary sensitivities to other proteins when transferred to peas [ 7 ] .*
In 1998 , researchers reported damage to every organ system of young rats who were fed GM potatoes containing snowdrop lectin [ 8 ] .
In the same year , researchers in Egypt found analogous effects on the guts of mice fed Bt potato [ 9 ] .*
In 2002 , Aventis , later named Cropscience , submitted research to regulators in the U.K. reporting that chicken fed glufosinate - tolerant GM maize Chardon LL were twice as likely to die prematurely than chickens in the control group [ 10 ] .c.
Nutrient Non-EquivalenceSA contend that plants genetically modified may not be nutritionally equivalent , bio-available and can possibly possess toxic anti-nutrients [ 11 ] .
There is no nutritional information for such foods , which raises the possibility that the modified nutrient could be toxic .
Different and modified forms of nutrients may be present , which may make these foods unsafe .
South Africa concluded that the risks from GM / GE food fall outside the realm of non-modified food and therefore , require strict labels.d .
Post Market Surveillance Impossible Without LabelingSafety concerns are never over once food reaches consumers .
For example , The National Institutes of Science in the U.S. reported in June of 2004 that workers processing GM celery contracted severe rashes , especially when exposed to direct sunlight .
Labeling would allow handlers and consumers to become cognizant of potential risks involved with eating and processing such types of foods .
Based on the principles of Codex , SA stated that it would be inconsistent and dangerous to adopt anything other than mandatory labeling of GM / GE foods .
Furthermore , the absence of adequate labeling of GM / GE foods essentially equates to human experimentation without informed consent .
According to Nuremberg Code ,
" The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential .
This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent ; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice , without the intervention of any element of force , fraud , deceit , duress , over - reaching , or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion ; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved ... all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected ; and the effects upon his health or person , which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment " [ 12 ] .
According to SA , mandatory labeling will allow implied informed consent , which will allow consumers to opt in and out of the experiment if they choose to do so .
After SA had submitted their highly researched rationale behind the mandatory labeling of GM / GE foods , the U.S. and its allies ( e.g. , Canada , Mexico , Argentina , Australia , New Zealand , Malaysia , Indonesia ) jumped all over them and stated that extensive research clearly supports that GM / GE foods are safe , therefore , no labeling is necessary .
This is obviously not the case ( as presented by SA ) and delineates the inter- meshed interests and historical marriage between U.S. and large food corporations ( i.e. , Monsanto , who produces up to 90 % of GM / GE seeds and foods ) .
Following the overwhelming condemnation of SA 's paper from the U.S. and the extra procedural requirements the U.S. pushed for because of these comments , the SA government had it subsequently withdrawn .
As a result of this development and the constant battles with the corporations of the U.S. and their biased agendas , SA called another meeting and declared they would circumvent Codex and create their own labeling system with or without their agreement .
Countries like Swaziland , Kenya , Ghana , Egypt , Cameroon , Sudan , Nigeria , South Africa and several other African countries with Japan , EU , Switzerland , Norway and many other countries stated their commitments to the mandatory labeling .
The meeting concluded with an agreement to eliminate all previous labeling documents and keep the door open for the future possibility of international labeling of GM / GE foods at a later date , which was strongly opposed by the U.S.References : 1.

Last week was hardly the first time that we have found ourselves scratching our heads in anguished confusion about what , exactly , President Bush is trying to achieve by trashing the Constitution at Guantánamo Bay .
But the sentencing of Osama bin Laden ’s driver , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , to five and a half years in prison is a good moment to stop and reflect .
For years , Mr. Bush and his supporters have been telling the world that it is necessary to hold prisoners without charges , to abuse them in ways most civilized nations consider torture , and to deny them basic human rights because of the serious threat they pose to America .
These are “ dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield , ” Senator John McCain , the Republican presidential candidate , said in a statement on Wednesday .
The administration considered Mr. Hamdan such a priority that it took his case all the way to the Supreme Court , insisting Mr. Bush had the power to hold anyone he deemed an enemy combatant for as long as he wanted under any conditions he wanted .
Mr. Hamdan ’s trial was the first by a military commission in Guantánamo .
We use the word “ trial ” loosely .
The proceedings were marked by secret testimony by secret witnesses .
The former chief prosecutor in Guantánamo testified that he quit after being told that these trials could not produce acquittals .
In the end , Mr. Hamdan was found guilty only of providing material support to terrorists and was sentenced to five and half years  a term he might complete before year ’s end .
Still , in the twisted world of Mr. Bush ’s prison camps , it is unclear if Mr. Hamdan will be released after serving his sentence .

MCCAIN : And some of those tactics - you mention the war in Iraq - are like that we use in the military .
You go into neighborhoods , you clamp down , you provide a secure environment for the people that live there , and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control .
And you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement , etc , etc .
Today , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) spoke to the National Urban League , a group " devoted to empowering African Americans to enter the economic and social mainstream . "
When an audience member asked him how he planned to reduce urban crime , McCain praised Mayor Rudy Giuliani 's efforts in New York Cirty before invoking the military 's tactics in Iraq as the model for crime - fighting :
Jon at PERRspectives :
But long before the American military 's community policing in Baghdad became a model for Baltimore , John McCain ( along with many other Republicans ) seemed to suggest that Sadr City was as safe as San Diego .
Dating back to 2002 , McCain repeatedly downplayed the dangers U.S. troops would face in Iraq , all in the name of helping to sell the coming war against Saddam .
But in extolling the progress of the surge over the past 18 months , McCain 's cheerleading has at times taken on almost comic extremes .
One of his more surreal moments came on April 1 , 2007 ( literally April Fool 's Day - you can't make this stuff up ) .
Wearing a bulletproof vest and guarded by " 100 American soldiers , with three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships overhead , " McCain briefly toured a Baghdad market to demonstrate that the American people were " not getting the full picture . "
Were the Individualist Anarchists Really Socialists ?

Were the Individualist Anarchists Really Socialists ?
In his book Equality , William B. Greene commented on the system of Socialism , â€ œIn socialism , there is but one master , which is the state ; but the state is not a living person , capable of suffering and happiness .
Socialism benefits none but demagogues , and is , emphatically , the organization of universal misery . . . socialism gives us but one class , a class of slaves.â€  ( 90 )
And yet it was commonplace for nineteenth - century Individualist Anarchists to call themselves â€ œSocialists.â€ 
Their wide - spread adoption of the labor theory of value and dislike for capitalismâ€ ” often considered to be hallmarks of Socialismâ € ” only strengthened their apparent connection with the left .
Moreover , Josiah Warrenâ€ ” arguably the founding figure of the traditionâ€ ” had ideological roots deep within the socialistic Fourierite movement , and was a student of Owenâ€™s .
These ties continued well into the days of Liberty .
For example , the First Workingmanâ€™s International consisted largely of Bakuninists ( Communist Anarchists ) and Individualist Anarchists .
Despite their many attacks upon capitalism , however , the Individualist Anarchists consistently advocated the free market as the remedy for the capitalist system .
We have never advocated the abolition of private property .
We have always maintained that the development of the highest and truest individualism in human character requires the possession and therefore the existence of personal property .
But while stoutly maintaining the right of each individual to his own earningsâ € ” the right of each individual to an equitable share of natural material upon which to create property by laborâ € ” we have also contended for the principle of Mutualism , the principle of Co-operative Communism . ( 91 )
One reason why Individualist Anarchists sometimes adopted the label â€ œSocialistâ€ is that the meaning of the term has changed with time .
In the nineteenth century , a common meaning of the term â€ œSocialistâ€ was â€œone who advocated an organization of society that allowed laborers to receive the full product of their labor.â€ 
Within Individualist Anarchism , this goal was stated as Cost the Limit of Price .
But Individualist Anarchists also advocated Sovereignty of the Individualâ € ” that is , they were committed to creating a voluntary society in which the basic unit was the autonomous individual .
Indeed , in the theoretical construction of Individualist Anarchism , Sovereignty of Individual preceded Cost is the Limit of Price and served as its foundation .
Thus , although the Liberty circle agreed that profit was theft and big business had allied with government to promote usury , their primary commitment was to a voluntary society and to the right of contract .
Tucker described the ideal society as â€œsociety by contract.â€ 
This commitment to contract led the Individualist Anarchists to vigorously oppose State - supported usuries , such as interest and , yet , defend the practice of charging interest in the context of a free market .
Paying interest on a loan might be foolishness and akin to helping a thief rob your house , butâ € ” as long as the interest resulted from a voluntary contractâ€ ” they defended the practice .
Tucker wrote ,
The monster that Liberty invites true reformers to help battle down and exterminate is the State , whose purpose is , first , to enforce unjust contracts through forcible defense of monopoly , and , second , to make effectual protest impossible by defending ill - gotten property from the natural retribution which attends tyranny and theft .
â€ œLiberty , therefore , must defend the right of individuals to make contracts involving usury , rum , marriage , prostitution , and many other things which it believes to be wrong in princi-ple and opposed to human well - being .
The right to do wrong involves the essence of all rights .
( 92 )
All that Tucker required was that the â€œwrongâ€ result from contract and not from force .
In the presence of a contract , everyone had the right to make a foolish , self - destructive decision , and no one had the right to interfere in the voluntary process .
Although the Individualist Anarchists sometimes referred to themselves as Socialists , they adamantly rejected the school of Socialism that rose to dominance and which is almost a synonym for Socialism proper today : State Socialism .
In an essay entitled â€ œState Socialism and Anarchism : How Far They Agree , and Wherein They Differ , â€ Tucker captured the difference be -tween Individualist Anarchism and State Socialism .
Tucker opened by stating that there were two extremes battling within the Socialist tradition , each of which adhered to a principle antithetic to the other .
â€œThe two principles referred to are AUTHORITY and LIBERTY , and the names of the two schools of Socialistic thought . . . are , respectively , State Socialism and Anarchism . . . . [ T ] here is no half - way house between State Socialism and Anarchism.â€  ( 93 )
These two forces were flowing from the very center of the Socialist tradition and an ultimate conflict between them was inevitable .
On one side would stand the State Socialists who wished to use government to institute justice for labor : these factions included the eight - hour men , the trade - unionists , the Knights of Labor , the land nationalists , and the greenbackers .
On the other side would stand the Anarchists who wished first and foremost to eliminate the State .
Before detailing the battle to come , Tucker explored the common ground shared by the opposing groups .
â€œThe economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his â€ ˜Wealth of Nationsâ€™ , â€ ” namely , that labor is the true measure of price .
â€ 
But Smith never examined the social and political implications of that observation .
That task was left to â€ œJosiah Warren , an American ; Pierre J. Proudhon , a Frenchman ; Karl Marx , a German Jew.â€ 
Each of them reached common conclusions that led them to condemn usury , especially in its three most dominant formsâ€ ” interest , rent , and profit .
Moreover , they each rec-ognized that usury survived due to an alliance between busi-ness and the State , which resulted in monopoly privileges being granted to an elite class of society .
This point of agreement , however , was also the juncture at which State Socialism and Anarchism parted ways .
â€ œHere the road forked .
They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left , â€ ” follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty .
Marx went one way ; Warren and Proudhon the other .
Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism.â€ 
State Socialism became the doctrine â€ œthat all the affairs of men should be managed by the government , regardless of individual choice .â€
Marxâ€™s solution to the various monopolies was to create one vast monopoly known as the State , which would absolutely control individual action .
Although State Socialists maintained that only the economic sphere would be controlled and not the private sphere , Tucker disputed the very possibility of limiting State intrusion .
In a passage predicting the Commu- nist State , he wrote that State Socialism was â€œdoomedâ€ to end in â€œa State system of hygiene , prescribing what all must and must not eat , drink , wear , and doâ€ ; a code of State morals , schools , hospitals , nurseries that raised children at public expense , and finally â€œa State family .â€ 
The latter would consist of â€œscientific breeding , in which no man and woman will be al - lowed to have children if the State prohibits them.â€ 
This stood in stark contrast to Anarchism , the doctrine â€ œthat all the affairs of men should be managed by individuals or voluntary associations , and that the State should be abolished .â€ 
Thus , Individualist Anarchism can be said to have branched off economically from the Socialist tradition and become an ideological movement in its own right .
What made it branch away was the fact that its basis was not economic , but moral , and it was a morality of radical Individualism .
In the final analysis , it is not clear that Individualist Anarchism ever had a rightful place within the Socialist tradition as we use the word â€ œSocialismâ€ today .
Indeed , a philosophy of Individualism that was so radical as to deny the very existence of society cannot be considered collectivist in any politically meaningful sense .
With its stress upon contracts and voluntary society , Individualist Anarchism constituted an entirely original and distinct tradition upon the American landscape .

Insight into this seeming contradiction within nineteenth - century Individualist Anarchism can be gleaned from the words of key figures of that tradition .
Moses Harman , for example , answered whether he was a Communist with the words , One reason why Individualist Anarchists sometimes adopted the label â€ œSocialistâ€ is that the meaning of the term has changed with time .
In the nineteenth century , a common meaning of the term â€ œSocialistâ€ was â€œone who advocated an organization of society that allowed laborers to receive the full product of their labor.â€ 

Each of them reached common conclusions that led them to condemn usury , especially in its three most dominant formsâ€ ” interest , rent , and profit .
Moreover , they each rec-ognized that usury survived due to an alliance between busi-ness and the State , which resulted in monopoly privileges being granted to an elite class of society .
This point of agreement , however , was also the juncture at which State Socialism and Anarchism parted ways .
â€ œHere the road forked .
They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left , â€ ” follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty .
Marx went one way ; Warren and Proudhon the other .
Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism.â€ State Socialism became the doctrine â€ œthat all the affairs of men should be managed by the government , regardless of individual choice .â€
Marxâ€™s solution to the various monopolies was to create one vast monopoly known as the State , which would absolutely control individual action .
Although State Socialists maintained that only the economic sphere would be controlled and not the private sphere , Tucker disputed the very possibility of limiting State intrusion .
In a passage predicting the Commu- nist State , he wrote that State Socialism was â€œdoomedâ€ to end in â€œa State system of hygiene , prescribing what all must and must not eat , drink , wear , and doâ€ ; a code of State morals , schools , hospitals , nurseries that raised children at public expense , and finally â€œa State family .â€ 
The latter would consist of â€œscientific breeding , in which no man and woman will be al - lowed to have children if the State prohibits them .â€
This stood in stark contrast to Anarchism , the doctrine â€ œthat all the affairs of men should be managed by individuals or voluntary associations , and that the State should be abolished .â€ 
Thus , Individualist Anarchism can be said to have branched off economically from the Socialist tradition and become an ideological movement in its own right .
What made it branch away was the fact that its basis was not economic , but moral , and it was a morality of radical Individualism .
In the final analysis , it is not clear that Individualist Anarchism ever had a rightful place within the Socialist tradition as we use the word â€ œSocialismâ€ today .
Indeed , a philosophy of Individualism that was so radical as to deny the very existence of society cannot be considered collectivist in any politically meaningful sense .
With its stress upon contracts and voluntary society , Individualist Anarchism constituted an entirely original and distinct tradition upon the American landscape .

It is commonplace for left historians to refer to 19th century individualist anarchists , including those surrounding Benjamin Tucker 's Liberty , as socialists .
The following excerpt from my much lengthier essay entitled " Economics : The Money Debate " examines and dismisses that claim .
( The essay is accessible in the archive by clicking articles on the toolbar and , then , proceeding to " Individualist Anarchism -- History . "
Or , click here .
The indicated footnotes are from the longer essay . )
In his book Equality , William B. Greene commented on the system of Socialism , â€ œIn socialism , there is but one master , which is the state ; but the state is not a living person , capable of suffering and happiness .
Socialism benefits none but demagogues , and is , emphatically , the organization of universal misery . . . socialism gives us but one class , a class of slaves.â€  ( 90 ) And yet it was commonplace for nineteenth - century Individualist Anarchists to call themselves â€ œSocialists.â€ 
Their wide - spread adoption of the labor theory of value and dislike for capitalismâ€ ” often considered to be hallmarks of Socialismâ € ” only strengthened their apparent connection with the left .
Moreover , Josiah Warrenâ€ ” arguably the founding figure of the traditionâ€ ” had ideological roots deep within the socialistic Fourierite movement , and was a student of Owenâ€™s .
These ties continued well into the days of Liberty .
For example , the First Workingmanâ€™s International consisted largely of Bakuninists ( Communist Anarchists ) and Individualist Anarchists .
Despite their many attacks upon capitalism , however , the Individualist Anarchists consistently advocated the free market as the remedy for the capitalist system .
From horrifying stories of contractors raped in Iraq to the seeming near - daily stories of disappearing female soldiers , it 's begun to feel — even to the military brass — like there just might be something in need of fixing right now .
It probably does n't help that about 80 percent of female soldiers on average ( 90 among female Marines ) complain of unwanted sexual touching .
So , from setting up a sexual assault ward to making assault reports anonymous to working with the nonprofit Men Can Stop Rape to enlist the male members of the armed forces in helping the problem , the military is at least trying to do something .
Of course , it comes a little late for some women ( as it always does ) , but when the problem in the military is only a microcosm of the problem in the society , the military is n't going to do any better at stopping it tomorrow than the rest of us will .
Female Soldiers Cite Sexual Assaults [ MSNBC ]

UPDATED : Beloved Jezebel commenter and amateur statistician
Abby points out that the actual report ( the 2006 Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members , currently slightly besieged by server requests ) says that , according to Abby , " 6.8 % of active duty military women reported unwanted sexual contact — and of that 6.8 % , 78 % reported unwanted sexual touching .
Meaning : the percentage of women who reported unwanted sexual touching was actually ... a bit over 5 % . "
It 's still not good , but it 's better than MSNBC would have — and did have — us believe .
Massachusetts Raises Cigarette Tax $ 1.00 a Pack
As you can read here Massachusetts ’
Governor Deval Patrick has signed a bill that will increase the tax on cigarettes by $ 1.00 a pack to a total of $ 2.51 a pack .
Once again a tax is being imposed on a group of politically incorrect people to help to pay for the government ’s penchant for overspending .
The mostly absent , vying for a cabinet position in a Barack Obama presidency governor of Massachusetts had no problem getting into town to pass more taxes onto the people who were foolish enough to vote for him .
The part about the cigarette tax that irks me the most ( and I am a non-smoker ) is n’t just that this tax unfairly targets a small percentage of the people , it is n’t even the fact that this tax is imposed on this group of people while all the other lesser taxed people benefit from it , it is the fact that this tax hurts the poor much more than anybody else .
Let ’s face it , the less fortunate are hit harder by this tax than anyone else , plus they are addicted so it makes them easy targets .
The government knows that they can keep on raising the tobacco tax because the people that use the product ca n’t stop using the product .
The fact that Democrats claim that they care about the poor and less fortunate while evil Republicans only care about themselves is what really ticks me off about this .
This tax increase went into effect , and in some cases before the bill was even signed ( more on that in my next post ) , because the Massachusetts government was so eager to increase revenues before the start of the new fiscal year .
The Massachusetts government does n’t care about the residents , it only cares about how much of the resident ’s money can it steal .
And they are doing a great job at stealing money .
If this were the 1700 ’s the tobacco would find it ’s way to the bottom of the fucking harbor .

Vestas to Test World 's Longest Turbine Blades
August 15th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Does n’t it seem fitting that Vestas Wind Systems , the world ’s largest manufacturer of wind turbines , should be the maker of the world ’s largest wind turbine ?
Well , they ’re not – at least not yet .
Today , Vestas revealed plans ( pdf ) for a new research and development center on the Isle of Wight ( UK ) that will test what company officials are calling “ the world ’s longest turbine ” blades .
[ social_buttons ]
While Vestas did not say exactly how long the new prototype turbine blade will be , their largest turbine currently in production , the V - 90 , has blades that measure 44 meters in length .
The largest wind turbine currently in operation is the 6MW Enercon E - 126 , which has a rotor diameter of 126 meters ( 413 ft ) .
The new development center will accompany an existing Vestas plant on the Isle of Wight that has produced turbine blades since 2000 .
The new facility is expected to become operational in 2010 .
Vestas ‘ second quarter net profit rose 27 % to 65 million euros ( $ 96 million ) as revenue rose 2.5 % to 1.09 billion euros .

CINCINNATI  From his months - old French bistro , Jean - Robert de Cavel sees restored Italianate row houses against a backdrop of rundown tenements in this city ’s long - struggling Over - the - Rhine neighborhood .
He also sees a turnaround for the district , thanks to plans to revive a transit system that was dismantled in the 1950s : the humble streetcar line .
“ Human beings can be silly because we move away from things too quickly in this country , ” Mr. de Cavel said .
“ Streetcar is definitely going to create a reason for young people to come downtown . ”
Cincinnati officials are assembling financing for a $ 132 million system that would connect the city ’s riverfront stadiums , downtown business district and Uptown neighborhoods , which include six hospitals and the University of Cincinnati , in a six - to eight - mile loop .
Depending on the final financing package , fares may be free , 50 cents or $ 1 .
PHILADELPHIA -- Sheriff John Green has spent 37 years in law enforcement .
But these days he 's best known around town for the law he wo n't enforce .
With the economy soft and thousands of Philadelphians delinquent on their mortgages , Sheriff Green this spring refused to hold a court - ordered foreclosure auction .
His move raised eyebrows on the bench and dropped jaws among lenders and their attorneys , who accuse him of shirking his duty to enforce legal contracts .
It also prompted a sweeping , court - endorsed deal , scheduled to go into effect next week , that aims to help homeowners avoid foreclosure .
Even as Congress moves forward with a federal plan that could insure up to $ 300 billion in refinanced mortgages , Mr. Green 's unilateral approach has pushed Philadelphia to the leading edge of local responses to the national crisis .
" More of our neighbors , our families and our friends are falling behind on their mortgages and losing their homes " to foreclosure , the 60 - year - old Mr. Green writes in a " Declaration of Neighborhood Stability " on his Web site , www.phillysheriff.com.
" My staff and I watch the suffering every day and witness the heart - wrenching scenes as families lose their primary means of wealth - building and face eviction . "
Mr. Green 's 241 - person sheriff 's department is the armed wing of Philadelphia County courts , charged with transporting prisoners , securing courtrooms and auctioning off foreclosed properties at sheriff sales .
In a city beset by poverty and crime , Mr. Green has emerged as an unlikely blend of lawman , politician , spiritual leader and social worker .

- We realized that auction buyers would be the big adopters of
systems like ours , so we approached eBay who wouldn ' t take our ads
because of an exclusive agreement
- We found out that eBay had relationship with LinkExchange -- they sold
a lot of ads in eBay

e Bay pages as per their arrangement , effectively doing an end run
around eBay 's refusal , getting out ads on their pages against their
wishes

told them that I have a product that would make their job easier ;
could they introduce me to their boss ? "
- End result : an inbound sales call was redirected and turned into a

window pointing to a specific URL when the file was played
- We used this as advertising
Don 't short this stuff :
- As programmers , we have a tendency to bury ourselves in coding when things
get tough
- Some problems can ' t be solved with tech

ACLU warns against ' no rules ' surveillance apparatus Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Troubling indications are emerging that the government is building a massive , virtually oversight - free domestic surveillance apparatus that could be cataloging private information on untold numbers of innocent Americans all under the guise of fighting terrorism , a new report warns .
The American Civil Liberties Union is calling for increased oversight of the Bush administration 's National Strategy for Information Sharing , which calls for " fusion centers " to allow local , state and federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies to share information on Americans .
The group warns that the Bush strategy essentially deputizes every police officer into the intelligence community and points to protocols that encourage officers to report innocent everyday activities as evidence of the strategy 's potential for abuse .
" Fusion centers push local law enforcement to become the eyes and ears for a larger national security state , " Jay Stanley , one of the author 's of a new ACLU report ( .pdf ) , said on a conference call Tuesday .
The ACLU first raised questions about the fusion centers ' potential for abuse in a December report .
Its Fusion Center Update , released Tuesday , points to reported abuses that have occurred in just the last six months .
Mike German , the reports ' co-author , says the very nature of centers that share information among various organizations at all levels of government invites abuse .
" In a multi-agency environment where it 's unclear which rules apply , very quickly no rules apply , " he said .
In its report , the ACLU warns that the fusion centers , whose origins pre-date 9/11 , seem to be laying the groundwork for precisely the type of society George Orwell warned about .
Overall , it is becoming increasingly clear that fusion centers are part of a new domestic intelligence apparatus .
The elements of this nascent domestic surveillance system include :
 Watching and recording the everyday activities of an ever - growing list of individuals
 Channeling the flow of the resulting reports into a centralized security agency
 Sifting through ( data mining ) these reports and databases with computers to identify individuals for closer scrutiny
Such a system , if allowed to permeate our society , would be nothing less than the creation of a total surveillance society .
The ACLU is " very pointedly looking at Congress to do its job here " in imposing safeguards on the fusion centers , said Caroline Fredrickson , head of the group 's Washington legislative office .
Not only can these centers lead to decimation of First Amendment rights -- the ACLU points to police infiltration of anti-war protesters , harassment of journalists and surveillance of Muslims -- but they also stretch the already - thin resources of local police forces , making fighting actual crime that much more difficult .
" The federal government is actively encouraging these state and local law enforcement officers to expand the bounds of what they do in their communities , " German said .
" To become intelligence collectors and not just law enforcement officers . "

Russia 's actual physical invasion of Georgia has garnered much of the headline space devoted to the two countries , but the conflict is playing out online as well .
Attacks against the Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's website first occurred in late July , but gathered relatively little attention .
Security investigators from the United States Computer Response Readiness Team ( US - CERT ) monitored the attacks , and stated that they did not appear to be a test run for a major assault .
Whether those attacks and the current situation are directly linked or not , the same group may be ultimately responsible for both .
The blog RBNExploit claims to be functioning as an unofficial news branch of the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and has released a server routing map it claims demonstrates evidence of Russian malfeasance .
From the blog : " the latest server routing map ... shows the Russian based servers AS12389 ROSTELECOM , AS8342 RTCOMM , and AS8359 COMSTAR , controlling all traffic to Georgia ’s key servers .
For example here AS28751 CAUCASUS NET AS Caucasus Network Tbilisi , Georgia & AS20771 DeltaNet Autonomous System DeltaNet ltd 0179 Tbilisi Georgia .
" Even the Turkish ( often RBN controlled ) server AS9121 TTNet is now being blocked via COMSTAR , we understand via colleagues in Istanbul , the Turkish authorities are trying to regain control of these servers and provide direct routing to Georgia . "

The group claims that Georgian official websites cannot be trusted , and that the country 's websites are now under external control .
If true , it 's that much more difficult for other nations and peacekeeping forces to gain a proper understanding of what is happening inside Georgia .
Both sides agree that the separatist capital of South Ossetia , Tskhinvali , has been smashed , but Georgia blames Russia 's " disproportionate use of force , " while the Russians blame Georgia for shelling the city .
The current disaster is the result of more than a decade of brinkmanship between Russia and the former Soviet republic .
Georgia was forcefully annexed by the USSR in 1921 and spent decades as a Soviet Socialist Republic ( Joseph Stalin was Georgian ) .
As happened in Estonia , a group of Georgians actually fought with the Nazis in World War II , in the hopes of freeing themselves from Soviet rule .
This sort of " traitorous " activity did not sit particularly well with the Soviets ; the later dissident movements of the 1960s and one particular peaceful demonstration in 1989 were all brutally repressed .
Georgia declared itself independent from the USSR on April 9 , 1991 , but problems with separatist groups in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have dogged the country since independence .
Georgia 's new president attempted to forcibly take control of Tskhinvali , and while Russia did not intervene at that point ( being rather occupied with its own problems ) , it would soon take an interest in the two separatist movements .
By then , Gamsakhurdia would be out of power .
A coup in December 1991 , overturned his government , and the country disintegrated into civil war for the next three years .
After former USSR Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was elected president , Georgia entered into peacekeeping agreements with Russia over South Ossetia in 1992 .
The situation with South Ossetia was never resolved , and later separatist conflicts turned violent .
I 'm not touching very much on Georgia 's other separatist movement in Abkhazia , but Russia 's decision to support that region 's claim to self - governance did little to stabilize the situation in South Ossetia .
Georgia 's problem with South Ossetia ( and that region 's desire to secede ) has n't changed much since 1992 , but the circumstances surrounding the conflict have been entirely reshaped .
Russia is now an active participant in the conflict , and has proposed unifying North Ossetia ( currently a part of Russia ) with South Ossetia as one solution to the problem .
Georgia , meanwhile , wants to join NATO — a goal Russia vehemently opposes .
So far , the information coming out of Georgia has been garbled .
CNN reports uncertainty regarding how many Russian jets have been shot down , and some confusion regarding both military and civilian casulties .
If Russia ( or the RBN acting on behalf of Russia ) is behing the systemic lockdown of Georgian Internet access , it may mark the first time a government has simultaneously deployed military and cybermilitary assets in an attack on another country .
In terms of keeping the rest of the world guessing at what , exactly , may be going on , the strategy seems to have worked .

Boids
Description
if ( do_name ( ) != ' Home ' ) : ?> endif ?>
The Boids library provides features to implement coordinated animal motion such as bird flocks and fish schools .
The code is based on Craig W. Reynolds flocking model and Conrad Parker 's pseudocode .
Essentially , a boid , a single element in the flock , has three simple steering behaviours :
Separation : steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
steer to avoid crowding local flockmates Alignment : steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
steer towards the average heading of local flockmates Cohesion : steer to move towards the average position of local flockmates
The beauty of it is that the flock does n't have a predefined flight path , or any math describing its motion ; a flock is totally and naturally self - organising .

How to get the library up and running
Put the boids library folder in the same folder as your script so NodeBox can find the library .
You can also put it in ~/ Library / Application Support / NodeBox / .
boids = ximport ( " boids " )
Creating a flock
The flock ( ) command returns a new flock consisting of n boids , that are caged in area starting at coordinates x and y and having a width w and height h .
flock ( n , x , y , w , h )
The returned flock object has a number of properties :
flock .
scattered : will be True when the flock is scattered in confusion .
: will be when the flock is scattered in confusion .
flock .
has_goal : will be True if the flock is thronging around a certain point of interest .
: will be if the flock is thronging around a certain point of interest .
flock .
flee : will be True if the flock has a goal , but is actually running away from it .
The returned flock object also has a number of methods .
The primary method is flock .update ( ) , which you usually call at each frame in an animation :
flock .
update ( shuffled = True , separation= 10 , alignment= 5 , cohension= 100 , goal= 20 , limit= 30 )
Each time flock.update( ) is called , the boids move another step in their flight pattern .
There are six optional parameters .
By default the flock is shuffled to ensure fluid movement of all individual boids .
You can play around with the other parameters to get different flocking behavior .
flock .
scatter ( chance= 0.005 , frames= 50 )
flock .
perch ( ground = None , chance= 1.0 , frames= lambda : 25 + random ( 50 ) )
flock .
goal ( x , y , z , flee= False )
flock .
nogoal ( )
flock .
copy ( )
The flock .scatter ( ) method undoes the boids 's cohesion and alignment .
The flock has a chance between 0.0 and 1.0 each of scattering during each update .
Once scattered , the confusion lasts the given number of frames .
The flock . perch ( ) method controls the boids 's resting behavior .
Boids whose y- position becomes larger than ground have a chance between 0.0 and 1.0 of resting .
Usually , chance is 1.0 : when you hit the ground you can't continue flying , a chance less than 1.0 would indicate water .
A boid will rest for the given number of frames .
The flock .goal ( ) method defines a point the flock finds interesting and has a tendency to move towards , and crowd around .
The flock .nogoal ( ) method removes the current goal .
The boids in a flock
A flock object returned from the flock ( ) command is a list of individual boids .
You can easily loop through it :
flock = boids .
flock ( 10 , 0 , 0 , WIDTH , HEIGHT ) for boid in flock : print boid .
x , boid .
y
Each boid object has a number of useful properties :
boid.x : the horizontal position of the boid .
: the horizontal position of the boid .
boid.y : the vertical position of the boid .
: the vertical position of the boid .
boid.z : the depth of the boid .
: the depth of the boid .
boid.angle : the boid 's current heading .
: the boid 's current heading .
boid .
is_perching : will be True when the boid is resting on the ground .

Dear EarthTalk :
How is it that hydrogen can replace oil to run our cars ?
There seems to be a lot of controversy over whether hydrogen can really be generated and stored in such a way to be practical ?
-- Stephane Kuziora , Thunder Bay , ON
The jury is still out on whether hydrogen will ultimately be our environmental savior , replacing the fossil fuels responsible for global warming and various nagging forms of pollution .
Two main hurdles stand in the way of mass production and widespread consumer adoption of hydrogen “ fuel cell ” vehicles : the still high cost of producing fuel cells , and the lack of a hydrogen refueling network .
Reining in manufacturing costs of fuel cell vehicles is the first major issue the automakers are addressing .
While several have fuel cell prototype vehicles on the road — Toyota and Honda are even leasing them to the public in Japan and California — they are spending upwards of $ 1 million to produce each one due to the advanced technology involved and low production runs .
Toyota hopes to reduce its costs per fuel cell vehicle to around $ 50,000 by 2015 , which would make such cars economically viable in the marketplace .
On this side of the Pacific , General Motors plans to sell hydrogen - powered vehicles in the U.S. by 2010 .
Another problem is the lack of hydrogen refueling stations .
Major oil companies have been loathe to set up hydrogen tanks at existing gas stations for many reasons ranging from safety to cost to lack of demand .
But obviously the oil companies are also trying to keep customers interested in their highly profitable bread - and - butter , gasoline .
A more likely scenario is what is emerging in California , where some 38 independent hydrogen fuel stations are located around the state as part of a network created by the non-profit California Fuel Cell Partnership , a consortium of automakers , state and federal agencies and other parties interested in furthering hydrogen fuel cell technologies .
The benefits of ditching fossil fuels for hydrogen are many , or course .
Burning fossil fuels like coal , natural gas and oil to heat and cool our buildings and run our vehicles takes a heavy toll on the environment , contributing significantly to both local problems like elevated particulate levels and global ones like a warming climate .
The only by - product of running a hydrogen - powered fuel cell is oxygen and a trickle of water , neither of which will cause any harm to human health or the environment .
But right now 95 percent of the hydrogen available in the U.S. is either extracted from fossil fuels or made using electrolytic processes powered by fossil fuels , thus negating any real emissions savings or reduction in fossil fuel usage .
Only if renewable energy sources — solar , wind and others — can be harnessed to provide the energy to process hydrogen fuel can the dream of a truly clean hydrogen fuel be realized .
Stanford University researchers in 2005 assessed the environmental effects of three different hydrogen sources : coal , natural gas , and water electrolysis powered by wind .
They concluded that we ’d lower greenhouse gas emissions more by driving gasoline / electric hybrid cars than by driving fuel cell cars run on hydrogen from coal .
Hydrogen made using natural gas would fare a little bit better in terms of pollution output , while making it from wind power would a slam - dunk for the environment .

The dangers of too much detox
By Martin Hutchinson
Good - but in moderation A woman was left disabled after following a " detox " diet which involved drinking large quantities of water .
Although doctors stress the need to avoid dehydration by drinking enough fluids , drinking more than enough is a different matter .
The human body may be mostly water , but you can have too much of a good thing .
In the most serious cases , " water intoxication " can kill , and there is , say experts , scant evidence that drinking even slightly more water than usual can improve your health .
The current popularity of detox diets which recommend drinking many litres of water a day , and drinking even when not thirsty , could cause problems if taken to extremes , they say .
The claim is that drinking more than usual can do everything from improving your skin tone to " flushing out " toxins from your body .
You should n't be drinking massively over and above what you feel with comfortable with
Ursula Arens
British Dietetic Association
However , the amount of water actually needed in a day varies from person to person , and depends on other factors such as climate , and exercise , says the British Dietetic Association .
Flawed industry Ursula Arens , a dietician , said that there was a difference between normal consumption of one or two litres a day , not just in the form of water , but also from coffee , tea , and juice , and constant , ritualistic consumption of water throughout the day .
" You should n't be drinking massively over and above what you feel with comfortable with , when you 're not thirsty , in a mechanical way . "
She said that the evidence supporting the whole " hydration industry " was flawed .
" If you 're a top sportsman , earning £ 10,000 for a single game , I can understand the need to focus intensely on your hydration , but not if you 're someone just doing a couple of lengths at the swimming pool .
" It 's just a great marketing opportunity , nothing more . "
She said that the science of detoxing was unsupported by evidence , partly because its precise effects on the body had never been defined .
She added : " The body already has perfectly good ways of getting rid of toxins - mainly in the liver , and it's hard to see how consuming more water would affect these . "
' No evidence '
Others are more scathing about the fashion for both detoxing and taking frequent sips from an ever - present bottle of mineral water .
Kidney specialist Professor Graham MacGregor said there was no evidence that either had any benefit .
People should drink when their body tells them to - when they get thirsty
Prof Graham MacGregor
St George 's University of London
He described how too much water could " overwhelm " the body 's natural mechanisms for keeping levels in balance .
" The body already has a brilliant system for doing this , but if water levels in the blood rise too high , it just can't cope . "
If vast quantities of water are taken , salt in the blood gets too dilute , he explained .
When the salt solution in the blood is weaker than the solution in the cells and organs it supplies , water passes into those cells and organs .
In extreme cases , this causes organs such as the brain to swell up , and can stop it working properly , putting the drinker in serious danger .
Professor MacGregor said : " This is n't just a problem with water - we used to see patients who had been diagnosed with ' water intoxication ' after drinking 20 pints of beer . "
" In normal circumstances , then people should drink when their body tells them to - when they get thirsty .
" Anything else is completely unnecessary , and will just leave you standing in the queue for the toilet .
" Detox diets are a complete con in that respect . "

What are these ?
UC Irvine researchers have identified the brain mechanism that switches off traumatic feelings associated with bad memories , a finding that could lead to the development of drugs to treat panic disorders .
Scientists from UCI and the University of Muenster in Germany found that a small brain protein called neuropeptide S is involved in erasing traumatic responses to adverse memories by working on a tiny group of neurons inside the amygdala where those memories are stored .
" The exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories , " said Rainer Reinscheid , pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences associate professor at UCI .
" These findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears , such as posttraumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders . "
The study appears in the July 31 issue of Neuron .
In tests , scientists exposed mice to situations that caused adverse memories .
The scientists saw that when NPS receptors in amygdala neurons are blocked , the traumatic responses to bad memories persisted longer .
In turn , when scientists treated the mice with compounds activating these receptors , traumatic responses disappeared faster .
After a traumatic experience , environmental cues often become associated with the bad experience and re-exposure to the same environment can trigger fearful emotions or even panic attacks , according to Reinscheid .
Other research has shown that forgetting such negative experiences may require " new learning , " such as re-exposure to the place where the original experience occurred but this time without any harmful consequences .
Reinscheid said this process , called the extinction of memories , occurs in both humans and laboratory animals such as mice .
Until this study , scientists did not know about the specific neurons and molecules involved with extinction learning of fear memories in the brain .
Previous work by Reinscheid 's group has shown that NPS is involved in regulating wakefulness and anxiety .
Last year , they found evidence that a particular genetic variant of the NPS receptor may increase vulnerability to panic disorder .
Stewart D. Clark , Naoe Okamura , Dee M. Duangdao , Yan - Ling Xu of UC Irvine , and Kay Juengling , Thomas Seidenbecher , Ludmila Sosulina , Joerg Lesting , Susan Sangha and Hans - Christian Pape of the University of Muenster also worked on this study , which was funded in part by the National Institute of Mental Health .

World 's largest beanbag - agglomerate it for free !
( berkeley )
Reply to : see below
Date : 2008-02-08 , 1:40 PM PST
Do you want the world 's largest beanbag ?
I thought so .
Large enough to sleep two in dreamy comfort , just barely small enough to fit through your door .
In fact , you kind of have to " pour " it through your door .
Do n't get discouraged , it * will * fit through .
unless you have a small door .
I made this beanbag myself - surely you did not think you could buy the world 's largest beanbag in any store !
because you cannot .
it is made from lavish gray cordury and filled with 120 cubic feet of foam beans .
it is in good condition ( maybe a little pet hair ) .
but - oh yes , did i mention that it has been cat peed ?
we have cleaned it so it does not smell , the problem is that our cat has just discovered ( as you will ) that the pluush bean -y texture of the bag is oh - so - pleasurable , much nicer than his litter box .
we can't keep him away from it !!
so we cleaned up the mess but now we gotta keep em separated .
so you benefit .
in case you are wondering what this famous beanbag looks like , this is it here :
https://www.instructables.com/id/bean-bag-sofa-%2f-bed/
that is the actual one in the photo , it is not an imitation .
ok here 's what you need to do : bring a vehicle and 50 feet of rope , and 1 - 2 friends .
the beanbag will just barely fit in an 8 - foot pickup bed , otherwise it 's going on your roof .
you will strap it around in 3 places , putting the rope through your windows .
you will drive no more than 30 mph , because this thing has a larger volume than your vehicle and the wind will push the beans around .
just sit back and enjoy your time as the laughingstock of the roadway .
it will be like a minivan on top of your car , except the minivan on top is made of jello and it wants you to eat that yummy jello while you are driving , and it is coming at you through your windows so you can eat it while you are driving !
ok maybe it is more like ' attack of the killer slime mold ' .
so hopefully you do not have to drive too far with it , because every couple miles you will have to wrangle the beast back on top .
i mean how could you eat another bite at this point ?
i drove it to san mateo with it once so i know this is possible .
ok so the beanbag is waiting for you RIGHT NOW !
it is on the sidewalk outside xxx Allston Way in Berkeley .
right now it is on the sidewalk .
there is NO NEED to ring the bell , or call , or email , so you can come get it and nobody will know it was you .
first come first serve .
its a sunny weekend so it will be in good condition when you get it .
if it is n't there somebody took it , i'll try to delete the ad when i notice it is gone .
care : in the future if you want to clean it more extensively , here is what i recommend : you can drain out and dispose of the beans , then wash the cover in your laundry machine .
you can get a full load of replacement beans ( aka " regrind " ) for about $ 30 from Bay Foam in Hayward .
OECD European gas production looks set to peak in 2008 .
After that , falling production combined with rising demand will see OECD European gas imports wanting to rise from current 197 BCM per annum to 442 BCM per annum by 2020 .
Where will this gas come from and how will rising European imports affect N America and the rest of the world ?
[ With Centrica and EDF announcing hefty retail gas price increases in the UK this week , I thought it was worth reposting this story that was first published in December 2007 .
The follow on story Daddy will the lights be on at Christmas ? , is perhaps more pertinent this year than last . ]
Executive summary
As of 2006 , OECD Europe produced 55 % of its own natural gas with the majority of gas imports coming from Russia and Algeria .
OECD Europe has three main gas producers - Norway , The UK and The Netherlands .
Norwegian gas production is undergoing a major expansion , but this is forecast to halt at 130 BCM per annum next year for political resource conservation reasons .
UK and Dutch gas production are in decline , and combined OECD Europe indigenous gas production looks set to peak in 2008 .
Gas consumption has been rising at 2.6 % per annum since 1980 and there are a number of reasons to suggest that rising demand for gas will continue into the future unless it is checked by high price or shortages of supply .
It is believed that Russia will do what she can to maintain gas exports to OECD Europe .
But with their three biggest gas fields - Yamburg , Urengoy and Medvezhye - in decline , maintaining supplies from second tier assets will be a major challenge .
In order to maintain supplies to the OECD Europe , supplies may have to be cut to other countries .
Algeria , Egypt and Libya will all see expansion of gas production in the years ahead , but will also experience growth in indigenous consumption , especially in Egypt .
Gas exports from these North African states are forecast to peak in 2015 .
They may provide an additional 33 BCM of exported gas to the European market .
OECD Europe gas imports are forecast to grow from current 197 BCM per annum to 442 BCM per annum by 2020 - if we see business as usual growth in demand and consumption .
Where will this additional 245 BCM come from ?
Some may come from N Africa and some from West Africa and Qatar .
It seems unlikely that an increase in imports on this scale will be possible and that high price and shortage will ration supply .
This market driven outcome may hit the poorer nations hardest and one may suspect this may have a destabalising effect .
Introduction
This post will provide a production forecast for Europe 's main gas producers ( the UK , The Netherlands and Norway ) ; it will examine existing import patterns in Europe 's main gas consumers ( Germany , Italy and France ) and the ability of gas exporters to meet growing OECD European demand - Egypt , Libya , Algeria , and in particular Russia .
This article was initiated as part of study of UK gas security .
The UK faces rapidly falling gas production and an equally rapid expansion of imports and the key question for the UK is where will this gas come from ?
This will be dealt with in a separate post .
There are a number of ways to divide Europe for economic analysis .
I have chosen to break out data for European states that are members of the OECD .
This includes the important oil and gas producer Norway , which is not a member of the European Union ( EU ) but excludes the Baltic States , Romania and Bulgaria which are EU members but have not yet joined the OECD .
Figure 2 Map of the European Union .
Turkey is a member of the OECD but lies mainly outside of Europe and is not included in this study .
Turkey is a major importer of gas , especially from Russia .
Data sources and gas units
Throughout this article I have used data from the 2007 BP Statistical Review of World Energy .
I have also used billion cubic metres ( BCM ) as the standard unit for gas measurement .
According to BP , 1 BCM is equivalent to :
35.3 billion cubic feet ( BCF )
0.73 million tonnes of liquified natural gas ( LNG )
36.0 trillion British Thermal Units ( BTU )
6.29 million barrels oil equivalent ( BOE )
Gas production forecast
OECD Europe gas production is dominated by three countries - the UK , The Netherlands and Norway , with lesser but significant quantities produced by Denmark , Italy , Poland and Germany .
Figure 3 OECD Europe gas production and conceptual forecast .
The UK
The changing face of gas production in the UK lies at the heart of Europe 's emerging gas problem .
In 2003 , the UK was a net exporter of gas to Europe but with peak production in 2000 and production now falling at 8.7 % per annum it had become a net importer by 2004 .
The challenge facing the UK gas industry will be the subject of a detailed post .
Figure 4 UK gas production and consumption history
The UK forecast is based simply on extrapolating the 8.7 % decline to 2020 by which time production is forecast to be 26 BCM per annum .
At peak in 2000 , the UK produced 108 BCM per annum and in the space of 20 years the UK will have gone from net exporter to a major importer , being dependent upon imports of over 80 BCM per annum .
This view on decline of UK gas production is shared by the UK BERR ( Department for Business and Enterprise Regulatory Reform - formerly the DTI ) .
See for example Figure 5.2 in this report .
The Netherlands
The Netherlands is home to OECD Europe 's largest gas field .
Discovered before WWII , the full extent of the Slochteren Field did not become apparent until the post - war years .
It was the discovery of this field in the Permian Rotliegendes sandstone that sparked the exploration for gas and then oil in the North Sea .
Figure 5 Europe 's largest gas fields .
Data for Slochteren from Rembrandt Koppelaar .
Troll and Ormen Lange from the NPD .
Slochteren lies onshore in the Groningen area of northern Holland and dwarfs the giant Norwegian gas fields of Troll and Ormen Lange .
Further fields were found around Slochteren in the on - shore and off - shore areas .
Slochteren was never produced flat out and the Dutch government has laterally set a production cap on the field .
In the period 2006 to 2015 this cap is set at 425 BCM over the 10 year period .
NAM ( the Shell - Exxon operating consortium ) can optimise production over this time frame but strictly within this overall limit .
The production cap on Slochteren has resulted in a long drawn out production plateau analagous to that seen in the Saudi super giant oil fileds - a very enlightened production strategy on behalf of the Dutch government .
Figure 6 Dutch gas production and forecast based on data provided by Rembrandt Koppelaar .
The smaller offshore fields are showing a decline similar to the UK .
Note that the volumes here are substantially larger than quoted by BP ( see Figure 7 ) .
Rembrandt suggested this could be due to adjustment by BP for the energy content of the gas .
The other fields were not subject to regulation and are now in decline in similar manner to the UK gas fields .
According to Rembrandt , Slochteren will also begin to decline naturally after 2015 and the bottom line is that Dutch gas production is now in an irreversible decline phase .
The forecast for the Netherlands is based on data kindly supplied by Rembrandt .
This has smaller fields declining at a similar rate to the UK , while Slochteren has a somewhat lower decline rate .
Figure 7 History of Dutch gas production and exports .
Figure 8 Destinations of Dutch gas exports .
Note that the Dutch import gas from Russia and Norway for re-export .
It can be seen that Dutch gas exports have been declining irregularly since the late 1970s and that some day post 2020 , the Dutch may become an importer of natural gas .
Norway
Norwegian gas production has expanded rapidly in recent years , mainly the result of the Troll Field development .
This expansion is set to go on for another couple of years , but then I suspect the expansionary phase will come to a halt .
In 2006 Norway produced 87.6 BCM of gas .
Since then the Langeled pipeline that connects the Ormen Lange Field to Easington in England ( and also to continental Europe ) has been completed .
The capacity of Langeled is about 20 BCM per annum .
Furthermore , the development of the Snøhvit Field in North Norway with an LNG train provides Norway with an additional 5.7 BCM capacity .
The Norwegian export pipeline system is reported to have a capacity of 120 BCM per annum .
With domestic consumption running at 4.5 BCM and LNG production at 5.7 BCM , future Norwegian production is forecast to run at 130 BCM per annum .
With Europe becoming ever more thirsty for gas , there was a plan to expand production in the Troll Field by 20 BCM per annum .
Most significantly , this consent was refused by the Norwegian parliament .
Hence Norway is in a position of having ample reserves to sustain a short term production boost , but instead seems to be choosing the path of restrained production which will favour an extended plateau at lower than maximum possible production levels .
The map of the Norwegian gas pipeline export system shows where Norwegian gas enters the UK and Continental Europe .
The UK imported gas from Norway during the 1970s and 1980s where gas from the Frigg Field was piped to Scotland via the Vesterled pipeline .
Since then the UK has had no need for Norwegian gas - until recently where a massive expansion of import capacity has been built .
The Vesterled pipeline is now connected to the Norwegian gas transmission network and has been one route into the UK for Norwegian gas in recent years .
There are , however , two new pipeline systems .
The already mentioned Langeled pipeline that connects the UK to Ormen Lange via the Sleipner hub .
And the Tampen Link that connects Statfjord and other mature fields in the Tampen Spur area to the UK operated FLAGS pipeline system .
FLAGS transports associated gas from the northern UK fields to St Fergus in Scotland and since that UK gas production is now in decline , the Tampen Link will fill that surplus capacity - for a while at least .
Five other pipelines make landfall in continental Europe at 4 import terminals .
Three pipelines feed two terminals in North Germany .
And one pipeline lands at Zeebrugge in Belgium and one at Dunkirk in France .
These entry points are connected to a broader European gas transmission system which pipes Norwegian gas as far as Spain , Austria , the Czech Republic and Poland .
Figure 10 Export destinations for Norwegian gas .
Up until 2006 , all Norwegian exports were via pipelines to Europe .
In 2007 , Norway opened its first LNG train and it will be interesting to see where these LNG exports end up .
It can be seen that Germany is by far the largest importer of Norwegian gas , followed by France , Belgium , the UK and Italy .
One curiosity in this data is that the Netherlands are shown as a net importer of Norwegian gas .
I can but speculate that The Netherlands are importing Norwegian gas to meet export contracts whilst conserving their own gas reserves .
Demand and import patterns
Natural gas consumption within OECD Europe has grown on average at 2.6 % per annum since 1980 .
Back in 1965 , Europe consumed less than 25 BCM per annum and this grew to over 470 BCM per annum by 2005 , fuelled by North Sea gas .
Higher prices and shortage of Russian supply saw consumption fall in 2006 .
Figure 11 Forty years of gas binge in OECD Europe .
Where next for European Natural gas demand ?
Will the past trend continue , or will high price curtail demand ?
This is impossible to answer , but there are a number political , demographic and resource factors consistent with demand continuing to grow unchecked .
Growing prosperity in former Eastern European states leading to growth in energy consumption .
Migration from East to West placing greater strain on infrastructure and energy use in the West .
Migration from Northern to Southern Europe leading to greater prosperity in the latter and ever increasing energy needs - see for example gas consumption data for Spain .
Climate policies which as a quick fix continues to drive gas power generation forward as a more efficient and CO2 friendly means of generating electricity .
Pending shortages in oil supplies may lead to substitution by natural gas in automobiles .
If demand for natural gas continues to grow then source of supply and the security of that source is highly relevant .
The following section shows the main sources of supply for Europe 's main consumers ( excluding the UK ) .
One thing all gas import strategies have in common is diversity of supply .
Germany
Germany has some significant and stable indigenous gas production , but is heavily dependent upon The Netherlands , Norway and Russia for pipeline imports .
With Dutch gas production in decline , Germany will presumably be looking to increase supplies from elsewhere .
The cornerstone of the German strategy is the Baltic pipeline that will assure supplies of Russian gas direct to Germany that will by - pass former Soviet republics and East European states .
Without LNG , the German strategy seems constrained , since falling UK and Dutch production will place greater demand on Norwegian and Russian gas from several other states .
Figure 12
The import sources of gas to Germany .
France
France is unique among major European gas consumers with no indigenous gas production .
France produces no oil and only a little coal - hence their reliance upon nuclear energy for power generation .
Like Germany , France relies heavily upon Dutch , Norwegian and Russian gas pipeline imports .
France also has a mature LNG import trade with significant imports from north and west Africa .
Figures 13 & 14
The import sources of gas to France .
Italy
Italy has significant but falling indigenous gas production .
It also has a highly diversified gas importation infrastructure born in part from its geographic location .
Italy imports gas from Norway , The Netherlands and Russia but is also linked to Algeria and more recently Libya by pipeline .
Italy also imports small amounts of LNG , mainly from Algeria .
Note how there were significant imports from Nigeria in 2004 - but then nothing .
It seems these cargoes may have switched to France in 2005 / 06 .
Figures 15 & 16
The import sources of gas to Italy .
Current and future sources of supply
The chart shows that Russia and Algeria are by far the most important sources of imported gas to OECD Europe .
This raises the questions of whether or not these countries will be able to maintain or increase future supplies and if not , where will Europe 's growing thirst for gas be met in the future ?
Figure 17 Sources of gas in OECD Europe in 2006 .
Russia
Russian gas production had an interim peak in 1991 , and with the fall of the Soviet Union went into decline for a number of years .
Since 1997 , production has begun to rise again and a new high was reached in 2006 of over 600 BCM per annum .
The $ 60 K question is where next for Russian gas production ?
This question is just as important as the future direction of Saudi oil production .
Figure 18 Russian gas production , consumption and exports .
Figure 19 Destinations of Russian gas exports
Russia exports less than one third of its gas production .
The majority of exports are to OECD Europe , though a significant amount still goes to former republics .
But the amount going to Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova is not documented in the BP statistics , and is presumably included with Russian consumption data .
The structure of Russian gas production makes exports vulnerable to any down turn in production and / or increase in domestic consumption .
Russian gas exports have been essentially static since 1990 , and with the largest fields in decline ( see below ) it seems unlikely that Russia could at this stage raise production to meet the rising import requirements of OECD Europe .
Figure 20 Map showing the west Siberian gas fields of Russia .
The three giant fields of Yamburg , Urengoy and Medvezhye have historically provided the bulk of Russia 's gas .
All three are now in decline ( see below ) .
Much of Russia 's remaining potential lies in this area , particularly on the Yamal peninsula , to the left of the circle .
The map is borrowed from a presentation by Kjell Aleklett .
Figure 21 Russian gas production forecast by Jean Laherrere showing how second tier fields may compensate for decline in the three giants - Yamburg , Urengoy and Medvezhye .
Historically , more than 50 % of Russian gas production has come from 3 giant fields - Urengoy , Yamburg and Medvezhye .
This excellent chart ( unpublished ) from Laherrere shows that all three of these core producers are in decline .
Since Russia has relied upon these three supergiants for core production they now have an inventory of second tier giant fields to develop that may compensate for the decline from The Big 3 , as shown on Laherrere 's chart .
The challenges for Gazprom are immense .
Bovanenko lies on the Yamal peninsula below permafrost .
It is at the end of proposed piplelines shown as dashed red lines on the map above .
Shtockman lies out of helicopter range in the Barents Sea .
Recent reports suggest that the Russians want to use a floating nuclear reactor to power the production platform .
Figure 22 Russian gas production scenarios by Jean Laherrere .
WEO forecasts show rising consumption matching rising production with flat exports of around 200 BCM per annum .
This new chart from Laherrere 2007 shows a peak in Russian gas production about 8 years from now with unconstrained production which is unlikely to happen .
Instead , constrained production as indicated by the slowly rising WEO 2006 forecast matched by rising consumption will give rise to relatively flat gas exports forward to 2020 .
So it seems likely that Russia will be able to maintain gas exports but will unlikely be able to increase exports to compensate for falling OECD Europe production .
A critical geo-political question , however , is how these exports are distributed in future ?
The Sakahlin projects will see East Siberian gas entering the Asian markets for the first time .
Furthermore , the Baltic Gas Pipeline will witness a new prioritisation of gas energy security in Germany and western Europe .
The Baltic Gas Pipeline , which is under construction under a joint venture between Gazprom and German companies BASF and E.ON , will deliver 27.5 BCM per annum direct to Germany in the first instance with the option to rise to 55 BCM .
All of OECD Europe 's gas from Russia currently has to cross The Ukraine and then either Slovakia or Poland in order to reach the main destinations of Germany , Italy and France .
As we saw in the winter of 2005 / 6 , Russia struggled to meet all commitments given extreme cold weather at home and cut gas supplies to some unfavoured former Soviet enclaves .
The spat with Ukraine at that time highlighted how dependent OECD Europe was on the goodwill of the Ukrainians and the Baltic Pipeline circumvents that problem , providing gas security to Germany at least .
Figure 23 Map of pipelines in Ukraine that carry Russian gas to western Europe via Poland and Slovakia .
From Ukraine vs Russia : Tales of pipelines and dependence by Jerome a Paris
The Baltic pipeline will be fed primarly by gas from a new field .
The Yuzhno - Russkoye field , which recently started production , is located in the same area as Urengoy , is included in Laherrere 's chart and is one of the new fields that will offset decline from The Big 3 .
This new export capacity , therefore , does not necessarily represent new productive capacity but merely a more secure route for Russian gas into the OECD .
OECD Europe currently receives 115 BCM per annum from Russia , so the Baltic pipeline may eventually secure almost half of those deliveries .
However , should OECD Europe face gas shortages , it is those countries at the end of the pipeline that will still be most vulnerable .
Some interesting negotiations may lie ahead .
In summary , it is exceedingly difficult to predict how reliable Russian gas exports to OECD Europe will be in future .
It seems most likely that Russia will maintain current production levels of 600 BCM per annum until 2020 .
However , increasing domestic consumption , and exports to East Asia may see gas exports to the west declining .
Germany will be in the strongest position to secure supplies .
If the remaining supplies are rationed by ability to pay then some of the poorer eastern European states may suffer .
Algeria
Figure 24 Map of oil and gas infrastructure in Algeria .
Europe is fortunate to have gas rich North Africa lying off its southern shores .
According to the BP Statistical Review , Algeria has 4.5 TCM remaining gas reserves placing it number 8 in the world .
Accordng to the analysis of Jean Laherrere , Algeria has 4TCM gas reserves remaining , which is in fair agreement with the BP figure .
It is fortunate for Europe that Algeria lies close to the southern border of the continent allowing Algerian gas to be piped into Italy and Spain .
There is also a significant trade in LNG between Algeria and Europe .
Figure 25 Discovery and production gas models for Algeria by Jean Laherrere .
Laherrere provides a more detailed picture of gas production than can be compiled from the BP data .
The main difference is production reported gross of re-injected gas .
An unconstrained production peak some 17 BCM per annum higher than today 's production is shown around 2015 .
Figure 26 Algeria gas production , consumption and exports .
Production and exports have not risen since 1999 .
Algerian production grew steadily until 1999 but has since stagnated .
There was a new discovery cycle during the 1990s and it is this that may provide impetus for some new production growth .
Algerian consumptin is growing slowly and this will consume a portion of new production .
New gas export capacity is estimated roughly to be 12 BCM per annum by 2012 .
Figure 27 Destinations for Algerian pipeline gas exports .
Algeria exports about 37 BCM per annum by pipeline but is also active in LNG production with LNG exports of 25BCM in 2006 .
Most of the LNG was exported to Europe ( and Turkey ) with only small quantities going further afield .
Europe is a short trip for an LNG tanker from North Africa , and in terms of tanker utilisation I suspect it will continue to be more profitable to deliver N African LNG to Europe than further afield .
Figure 28 Destinations for Algerian LNG gas exports .
The IEA 2005 energy outlook had this to say :
Algeria is the third - largest exporter of natural gas in the world .
Exports are expected to increase as pipeline and LNG projects are brought on line .
Gas exports were 64 bcm in 2003 and are expected to climb to 76 bcm in 2010 and reach 144 bcm by 2030 .
The IEA target for 2010 looks marginally optimistic and their target for 2030 is a reserves busting feat as indicated on Laherrere 's chart ( Figure 25 ) .
Libya and Egypt
Both Libya and Egypt have seen rapid expansion of their gas production and exports in recent years .
This is set to continue at a slower pace for a number of years according to these forecast models from Jean Laherrere .
Growing population and domestic gas consumption in Egypt looks set to outstrip production growth and Egypt may cease to be a gas exporter beyond 2025 .
Figure 29 Gas discovery and production models for Libya by Jean Laherrere .
Figure 30 Gas discovery and production models for Egypt by Jean Laherrere .
In the export model ( Figure 31 ) I have used the " slow " production model for Egypt .
Combining the three production models of Laherrere from Algeria , Egypt and Libya provides this picture of gas exports from N Africa peaking at around 120 BCM per annum in 2015 .
That represents a 33 BCM per annum growth from current export levels .

OECD Europe gas security
With OECD
Europe indigenous gas production set to decline and good reasons for believing that demand for natural gas will continue to expand in the future , OECD Europe faces the prospect of importing ever larger amounts of gas ( LNG ) from ever more remote parts of the world .
Current imports are running at 197 BCM per annum and the BAU scenario shown below shows imports burgeoning to 442 BCM by 2020 .
Where will this additional 245 BCM come from ?
Figure 32
Gas scenarios for OECD Europe summarising the indigenous supply forecasts and demand forecasts from the preceding sections .
With the BAU demand scenario , imports will need to grow from current 197 BCM per annum to projected 442 BCM per annum by 2020 - an increase of 245 BCM per annum .
It is doubtful that this quantity of gas may be sourced from African and Middle East markets .
It is therefore considered more likely that high price and supply shortages will curtail demand for gas .
It is conceivable that conservation , more efficient energy use and substitution with alternative sources of electricity may fill the gap left by declining gas supplies .
This is near impossible to answer with certainty .
My feeling is that Russia will strive to meet current commitments which will result in their gas exports neither increasing nor decreasing in the 2020 time frame .
N Africa will see strong growth in production that will be offset by strong growth in their domestic consumption .
Up to 33 BCM of new supply may come from N Africa and it seems reasonable to assume that the majority of that gas will come to Europe .
That leaves 212 BCM to source from else where and will inevitably entail a massive expansion of LNG export and import infrastructure beyond that which already exists .
In the period 2010 to 2020 Europe will face fierce competition for LNG supplies from the mature markets of Japan , South Korea and Taiwan and growing competition from new markets for LNG in the USA and most likely also in China .
In 2006 , the total global LNG trade was 211 BCM and so we are talking about doubling that by 2020 to satisfy OECD European needs alone .
The main sources of new supply will be West Africa ( Nigeria ) , Qatar and Iran .
Since Qatar has declared a moratorium on new LNG projects forward to 2011 it is a major challenge for these three countries alone to meet global demand growth .
Figures 33 & 34
The changing face of gas security in OECD Europe .
With a BAU demand scenario , OECD Europe will face importing ever growing quantities of LNG from remote sources around the globe .
The crux of this whole issue is how growing demand for gas is managed .
The UK , and other OECD governments seem intent on allowing market forces to determine the outcome .
I would be the first to admit that the dynamics of supply and demand in the European gas trade has so many dimensions that trying to regulate and plan this trade is not simple .
But on the other hand , allowing market forces , national economic strength , and price to determine who gets and who does n't get the available energy may have disasterous and unforeseen outcomes .
A scenario where the former Soviet Republics and then the east European states and perhaps Turkey are left in the cold whilst western Europe uses historic strengths to secure itself energy supplies may have unpleasant outcomes flowing from a newly destabilised former Soviet bloc .
Energy poverty throughout the poorer parts of Western Europe may also have undesirable consequences for the warm middle and upper classes .
The main message of this post , therefore , is to call upon the politicians of the OECD in Europe to show some rare leadership , and to recognise that massive energy conservation , and expansion of sensible alternative energy schemes , offer a better alternative to the polarisation that is likely to result from allowing market forces to determine the outcome of energy decline .
According to The Sun an unruly group of UK wedding guests spent this past weekend destroying five rented supercars valued at over $ 1.4 million .
The carnage includes a Bentley Continental GT , a Ferrari F430 and three Lamborghini Gallardo Spyders .
Although the details are still rather sketchy , here 's what we 've learned .

The group of hoon - igans reportedly rented the cars for just under $ 10,000 apiece from Pearl Rentals of Wembley .
The Sun claims the story is as follows :
" a sharp - suited group of Asian - looking men ... wrecked a Ferrari on Saturday after smashing into another of the cars .
The Lamborghini — one of three rented — was totaled when it hit a tree in Bridgnorth , Shrops , on Sunday . "

Amid all the mashed - up metal , supposedly an Audi R8 escaped unscathed .
New luxury triumphs again , apparently .
We 're also told UK cops are still trying to find the drivers and other accomplices .
So , if you 're in the UK and you spot a group of " Asian - looking men " wearing ruffled , yet still quite sharp , suits walking down the side of the road .

Even though the Aeroscraft dwarfs the largest commercial airliners , it requires less net space on the ground than any plane because it doe sn't need a runway
The airship takes off and lands like ahelicopter straight up and down
This is not a Blimp It 's a sort of flying Queen Mary 2 that could change the way you think about air travel .
It 's the Aeroscraft , and when it 's completed , it will ferry pampered p assengers across continents and oceans as they stroll leisurely about the one - acre cabin or relax in their staterooms .
Unlike its dirigible ancestors , the Aeroscraft is not lighter than air .
It 's 14 million cubic feet of helium hoist only two - thirds of the craft 's weight .
The rigid and surprisingly aerodynamic body , driven by huge rear - ward propellers , generates enough additional lift to keep the behemoth and its 400 - ton payload aloft while cruising During takeoff and landing , six turbo - fan jet engines push the ship up or ease its descent .
This two - football - fields - long airship is the brainchild of Igor Pasternak , whose privately - funded California firm , Worldwide Aeros Corporation , is in the early stages of developing a prototype and expects to have one completed by 2010 .
Pasternak says several cruise ship companies have expressed interest in the project , and for go od reason - the craft would have a range of several thousand miles , and , with an estimated top speed of 174 mph , could traverse the continental United States in about 18 hours .
During the flight , passengers would view national landmarks just 8,000 feet below , or , if they were n't captivated by the view , the cavernous interior would easily accommodate such amenities as luxury staterooms , restaurants - - even a casino .
To minimize noise , the aft - mounted propellers will be electric , powered by a renewable source such as hydrogen fuel cells .
A sophisticated buoyancy - management system will serve the same purpose as trim on an airplane , allowing for precise adjustments in flight d ynamics to compensate for outside conditions and passenger movement .
The automated system will draw outside air into compartments throughout the ship and compress it to manage onboard weight .
( On a pressurized plane , windows like these would explode outward The Aeroscraft would not fly high enough to need pressurization )
The company envisions a cargo - carrying version that could deliver a store 's worth of merchandise from a centralized distribution center straight to a Wal - Mart parking lot , or , because the helium - filled craft will float , a year 's worth of supplies to an offshore oil rig . "
You can land on the snow , you can land on the water , " Pasternak says . "
It 's a new vision of what can be done in the air .

About 150 shareholders are meeting executives at a San Jose hotel
Yahoo shareholders have voted to re-elect the firm 's board after it defended its handling of negotiations with Microsoft over a possible deal .
Chief executive Jerry Yang won the backing of 85 % of investors at Yahoo's annual meeting in California .
Some investors had criticised the firm 's failure to agree a deal with Microsoft , which had offered to buy the internet firm for $ 47.5 bn ( £ 24.1bn ) .
During the meeting , one called on chairman Roy Bostock to resign .
Shareholder Eric Jackson of Ironfire Capital - one of 150 investors at the meeting - said Mr Bostock " should do the honourable thing and step down from the board " .
He accused the Yahoo boss of overplaying his hand with Microsoft .
[ Roy Bostock ] should do the honourable thing and step down from the board
Eric Jackson
Yahoo board emerges unscathed
In response , Mr Bostock said there had been " a great deal of misunderstanding " regarding Yahoo's dealings with the software giant .
" The board controlled the process of dealing with Microsoft right from the beginning , " Mr Bostock told the meeting .
" We called the shots . "
Almost 80 % of shareholders voted in favour of his re-election .
One investor not at the meeting is billionaire Carl Icahn , who had threatened to attempt to replace the board at the AGM .
He changed his mind a fortnight ago after Yahoo offered him and two of his nominees seats on an enlarged Yahoo board .
Microsoft first offered to buy Yahoo in January and eventually walked away from negotiations in May after Yahoo rejected an improved offer .
Has the West changed enough for a Democratic presidential candidate to win there ?
Other than the coastal states of California , Oregon , and Washington , western states like Colorado , Arizona , Montana , used to be unfriendly ground for the Democrats .
But times have changed , in gubernatorial and senatorial races across the West , and the panelists at Thursday morning ’s ‘ Convention Conversation ’ at the DNC in Denver were evidence of that very phenomenon .
The panel , bookended by the bolo - tied U.S. Senator from Colorado Ken Salazar and Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer , along with Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano represent the new - look Democratic Party in the West .
>>
More on the US Election from Red Green and Blue
Two election cycles ago there was not a single Republican governor in the western states , today there are seven western states with Democratic governors , and if you include the plains - states of Kansas and Oklahoma , the total becomes nine Democratic governors west of the Mississippi .
At the Federal level , Congressman Mark Udall of ( D - CO ) also has an excellent shot at winning the vacant seat left by the exiting Republican Senator Wayne Allard .
The West is undergoing a demographic changes that are trending its politics toward the blue .
“ Montana is a little tougher trip up the river for the Democrats than it is for the other states ” said Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer .
“ Right now in Montana it is dead , dang , tied at 45 - 45 between Mccain and Obama . ”
Schweitzer , who has been a vocal supporter of McCain said that Obama has been to Montana five times to campaign already , and that was more visits that the state hosted over the last two presidential campaigns put together .
Energy : Old and New
The critical issues that get Democrats elected as governor in the West are not necessarily the same issues that play for Westerners in a presidential election .
One such issue ( though hardly a “ single - issue ” in the traditional sense ) , energy and natural resources always play big in the West .
And now with the added wrinkle of the promise of renewable energy , energy politics have taken on a whole new meaning .
Gov. Napolitano noted that because of federal abdication of leadership on renewables , the states have had to pick up the slack .
“ We ’ve been missing our partner in the White House , ” said the Arizona governor .
“ Senator McCain ’s record has been abismal .
I ’ve seen an ad with wind [ turbines ] and I said to myself , what is he talking about ? ” [ which , I should mention was the exact same reaction I had when I saw it ]
The trio hammered the theme I heard from Democrats all week in Denver , and that is McCain and has simply not shown up when he ’s had opportunities to pass meaningful legislation to support extensions of the renewable energy investment tax credit and production tax credits .
Do n’t forget about the water
When asked about McCain ’s Colorado River Compact misstep Salazar spoke most forcefully on the issue , reiterating that McCain would only be able to renegotiate the compact “ over my dead body . ”
Salazar , who is an expert on water law and policy said there is absolutely no reason to renegotiate the compact , especially considering the amount of work and cooperation that is already being done to make the system work .
Schweitzer , who made a big splash with his speech earlier in the week said , “ He just stepped in it , it is fresh , it is wet , and it still smells bad . ”
Napolitano said For McCain to take Arizona he ’s going to have to work harder than he has so far .
Is water a big enough issue to play nationally ?
Probably not .
How about renewable energy ?
Perhaps .
The electoral college mandate is such that it essentially has fifty individual electoral races nestled within a larger national race .
And Democrats and Republicans alike will be targeting , framing , and tailoring their message for each state , and I can guarantee you , this is not the last time we will hear western
Dems raise issues of water , natural resources , and renewable energy in the next several months .

Video : A cunning Asian elephant wins a simple counting game
Biologist Naoko Irie and one of her mathmatical elephants ( Photo courtesy of Naoko Irie )
Add elephants to the growing menagerie of animals that can count .
An Asian elephant named Ashya beat this reporter at a devilishly simple addition problem .
When a trainer dropped three apples into one bucket and one apple into a second , then four more apples in the first and five more in the second , the pachyderm recognised that three plus four is greater than one plus five , and snacked on the seven apples .
( In my defence , I watched the video in a noisy and crowded auditorium . )
“ I even get confused when I ’m dropping the bait , ” says Naoko Irie , a researcher at the University of Tokyo , Japan , who uncovered the elephant ’s inner genius .
She presented her findings last week at the International Society for Behavioral Ecology ‘s annual meeting in Ithaca , New York .

Moreover , Irie found that as well as summing small numbers with almost 90 % accuracy , elephants can discriminate between small numbers .
That ’s not so surprising , considering that animals from salamanders to pigeons to chimpanzees can discern numerical values .
But all animals , including humans when forced to make split - second decisions , are best at telling apart two quantities when the ratio between the large and small number is greatest .
Spot the difference
Not so for elephants , Irie says .
The four that she tested distinguished between five and six apples as well as they did between five and one .
They picked the bucket with the most fruit 74 % of the time , on average , far above 50 - 50 .
“ It really is tough to figure out why [ elephants ] would need to count , ” says Mya Thompson , an ecologist at Cornell University who studies elephants and attended Irie ’s talk .
Asian elephants live in close - knit groups of six to eight , and they may count one another to make sure the herd sticks to together .
“ You really do n’t want to lose your group members , ” she says .
Alternatively , the mathematical prowess of elephants may be a side effect of their bulging brains and an evolutionary kinship to other “ smart ” animals , Irie says .

Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul have ramped up plans for a local counterweight to the GOP 's national convention in September .
Not content with a planned rally at the University of Minnesota 's Williams Arena on Sept. 2 , the Paul forces now plan a three - day " Rally for the Republic " that will climax in a 10 - hour extravaganza at Target Center in Minneapolis .
" It 's getting exciting , " said Marianne Stebbins , a longtime GOP activist who ran the Texas congressman 's campaign in Minnesota .
" We realized [ Williams Arena ] was n't big enough for everything we wanted to do . "
Although Paul was a long - shot candidate who came nowhere close to seriously competing for the Republican nomination , he was a potent fundraiser and attracted a fervent core of followers attracted to his libertarian views .
Working state by state , his supporters have managed to land a small number of delegates to the Republican Convention , which will be held Sept. 1 - 4 at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul .
Paul will send at least six delegates from Minnesota to the convention .
Despite that representation , Paul 's supporters have given up on snagging a speaking slot for their candidate , Stebbins said .
" We pretty much wrote that off when we figured out it was n't going to be offered . "
Instead , they came up with the idea of an alternative convention at a time when thousands of journalists already will be in the Twin Cities .
In addition to the Target Center rally , the three - day event will include volunteer training , meetings and a book signing by Paul .
" We 're not just looking at this November , " Stebbins said .
" There 's 2010 , 2012 -- the Republican Party is not a barge that you can turn around in a single year . "
Several conservative activists and pundits will be featured at the rally .
Tickets , which go on sale Friday , will cost $ 17.76 .

Think about what the Palin pick really says about how McCain views this campaign and how he views his potential responsibilities in national security .
Think about what it says about the sincerity of McCain 's own central criticism of Obama these past two months in foreign affairs .
Think about how he picked a woman to be a heartbeat away from a war presidency who had n't even thought much , by her own admission , about the Iraq war as late as 2007 .
Think about how he made this decision barely knowing the woman .
Think about the fact that the most McCain could say about his potential war - time vice - president in foreign affairs and national security when selecting her is that she commanded Alaska 's National Guard as governor and has a son in the military .
Think about the men and women serving this country who have every right to trust that their potential commander - in - chief , whatever their party , would have some record of even interest in foreign policy before assuming office .
Think about how the key factor in this decision was not who could defend this country were something dreadful happen to McCain in office but how to tread as much on Obama 's convention bounce and use women 's equality as a wedge issue among Democrats because it might secure a few points here or there .
Oh , and everyone would be surprised .
And even Rove would be annoyed .
This is his sense of honor and judgment .
This is his sense of responsibility and service .
Here 's the real slogan the McCain campaign should now adopt :
Putting .
Country .
Last .

· Row over Italian PM 's plan to double size of villa · Council says cash fee will be used for town 's benefit
With its imposing tree - lined drive , extensive outbuildings , surrounding park and 10,000 - volume library , the neo-classical Villa San Martino appears to have everything the most demanding of tycoons requires of a home .
And that is without the mausoleum - complete with giant , pink marble sarcophagus - that its owner , Silvio Berlusconi , has created in the grounds .
But some people , it seems , are never satisfied .
Italy 's billionaire prime minister wants to double the size of the property .
And his plans are running into controversy in Arcore and beyond .
An opposition senator has tabled a question in parliament for Berlusconi 's environment minister on the go - ahead for a project that would enlarge the government leader 's mansion by more than half the size of a Serie A football pitch .
Opponents claim that the scheme was modified , extended , and then rushed through a council controlled by his followers .
It is not the first time Berlusconi has come under attack for allegedly playing fast and loose with planning laws .
Four years ago , he was accused of embarking on a grandiose embellishment of his seaside Sardinian estate without planning permission .
The project included the creation of an underground landing stage reminiscent of a Bond film .
When a prosecutor attempted to investigate the objections , he found all Berlusconi 's properties were covered by an official secrecy decree issued by Berlusconi 's own government .
Dating from the 18th century , the Villa San Martino was bought by Berlusconi in 1974 with shares he eventually reacquired for just £ 100,000 .
Some of the most important meetings of his turbulent political career have been held within its finely decorated walls , and it was at Villa San Martino in 1994 that he famously recorded a video announcing his entry into politics .
According to Fausto Perego , who was deputy mayor in the previous , centre - left council in Arcore , Berlusconi first applied for a relatively modest , 1,500 - square - metre extension .
This allowed for a gallery for his extensive collection of paintings , a museum for the Berlusconi - owned Mondadori publishing house and premises for a new foundation to be named after his father , Luigi .
The original scheme , Perego told the daily La Stampa , also included " the relinquishing of part of the property " so it could be used for the creation of a new square and a civic library to be designed by one of Milan 's leading architect .
But after the right took office in Arcore the project was changed .
Under the new arrangements , endorsed by the incoming council , the total size of the extensions was tripled .
In place of land , the local authority will now get a cash payment of € 600,000 ( £ 470,000 ) in addition to € 1.2 m in extra planning levies .
" It 's a tidy sum that we shall use for the good of all , " said the mayor , Marco Rocchini .
" I do n't understand the opposition .
There has been criticism of the speed with which we gave the OK .
But everything was in order .
What else were we meant to do ? "
La Stampa quoted council sources as saying Berlusconi was ready to increase his contribution by funding an old people 's home .
The 3,000 square metres in the revised plan are for an imposing four - sided building around a courtyard which , the newspaper speculated , could be used for short visits by the 71 - year - old billionaire 's children and growing numbers of grandchildren .
About 300 members of Women Of Zimbabwe Arise ( Woza ) marched through the country ’s second city Bulawayo yesterday afternoon .
Woza aimed to highlight bread and butter issues that Zimbabwe ’s politicians are overlooking – both the shortage of food and the lack of dignity offered to ordinary people .
The protest also sought to test the “ memorandum of understanding ” recently signed by Zimbabwe ’s politicians as negotiations began between the government and opposition .
The memorandum states that there should be freedom of political activity and that violence will be prevented .
The Woza demonstrators distributed a newsletter as they marched to the offices of the state - owned Chronicle newspaper .
The march finished without arrests .
This contrasts with Woza ’s International Women ’s Day march held on 8 March .
Then protesters marching to the same destination were beaten by the police , with more than 50 needing medical attention .
It was the first Woza protest since 28 May in Harare when 14 leading members were arrested and held for several weeks .
Woza has announced plans to organise more protests over the next few weeks to press for civic representatives to be involved in the talks and to continue to test the politicians ’ commitment to a non-violent solution .

That headline , “ CBS Admits to Editing McCain ’s Iraq Answers ” in the print edition of the Washington Post sure caught my eye this morning .
Pretty interesting admission , so I figured I ’d post it .
But , that ’s not the online title .
As you can see , in “ The Trail , ” that piece has as much more innocuous title , “ McCain ’s Interview on CBS . ”
Yes , it ’s McCain ’s interview on CBS , but it ’s a whole lot more than that :
In response to critics , led by MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann , CBS News Senior Vice President Paul Friedman noted the full transcript and video were available online .
He added in a statement : “ The report was edited under extreme time constraints and one piece of tape was put in the wrong order .
Fortunately , this did not in any way distort what Senator McCain was saying . ”
Democrats quickly seized on McCain ’s statement in the interview , saying that it contained a remarkable gaffe for a politician who ’s supposed to be an expert on the Iraqi conflict .
As Democrats eagerly pointed out , the awakening started months before the surge in troops was announced in January of 2007 .
Troops did not actually get deployed until March of 2007 , long after the awakening began .

These days it 's all about the money , baby !
Malware writers backed by organized crime are constantly working on schemes to steal personal information or raid your bank accounts online .
A recent Consumer Reports survey says that in the last two years users have lost nearly $ 8.5 billion to " viruses , spyware , and phishing schemes . "
And that does n't even count 2.1 million computers thrown out and replaced because the malware mess was unbearable .
When cyber - Nazis are massing for an attack at your borders , or when they 've already invaded , you need some hard - nosed defenders working for your protection .
Fortunately you do n't have to train up a gang of convicted murderers to do the job .
You can choose from the dozen malware marauders below .
Their skills vary some are better at wiping out snipers and sneaks , others specialize in defense .
Some are highly skilled , others may let the side down .
Choose wisely and you 'll gain a powerful defender , whatever your budget .
Ad -Aware is steadily improving .
Spyware removal in this version is excellent , in part due to the new antivirus scanner .
The product 's real - time protection , however , is years out of date .
The idea is great :
You plug the USB stick into a computer and clean up the malware problem with no installation required .
But it 's just not effective .
In fact , in my testing , Trojan horses infected the stick , turning it into a malware delivery device !
You'd be better off carrying a USB key with installers for the better free anti-malware products .
avast !'s virus protection is n't far behind that of the top antivirus products .
It removes spyware nearly as well as the top antispyware , and its resident protection against new infestation is excellent .
This is some seriously impressive protection , considering that it 's free for personal use .
AVG Anti-Virus Free 8.0's protection is nearly as good as that of the top for - pay antivirus and antispyware products .
Scanning of search links for dangerous pages is an added bonus .
And as long as it's for your personal home use , it 's free !
This version has improved its malware - removal accuracy from abysmal to dismal .
It still offers no real - time protection and attempts to remove valid programs and now you have to pay for malware removal .
Stay away .
NovaShield AntiMalware aims to block malware by detecting malicious behaviors .
In testing it was a near - total flop , missing most of the malware on my tests and identifying several valid utilities as " high risk " threats .
And it rendered two test systems unusable .
There 's no reason to buy this when you can get Threat Fire for free .
SpyEraser 2
While it does n't kill off innocent programs as its predecessor did , SpyEraser 2 just is n't effective at removing malicious software .
It 's even worse at keeping malware out of a clean system .
This program still has a long way to go .
Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus 6
The latest Spyware Doctor does n't look any different , but its ability to remove malware and keep clean systems clean is better than ever .
It takes a while to install , and scanning is slow on a badly infested system .
But it 's worth the wait .
This is powerful protection !
STOPzilla 5.0
STOPzilla has a cute name , but it costs more than the best standalone antispyware programs and does less .
Yes , it does offer some bonus features for Internet Explorer , but they 're things that IE already does ... and does better .
Threat Fire 3.5
Standard signature - based antivirus / antispyware programs can't recognize a threat that 's too new to have a signature .
Threat
Fire 3.5 relies strictly on advanced behavior analysis to identify and remove both known and unknown threats .
This free utility will be an excellent complement to your existing protection !
Vipre Antivirus + Antispyware 3.1
Vipre 's overall scores are almost as high as those of Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus 6 .
It detected every malware sample and removed most .
It did , however , leave a couple of rootkits running .
But it 's still more effective than almost all of its competition .
Webroot AntiVirus with AntiSpyware and Firewall
This impressive app's multiple layers of protection prevent installation of most malware , and it did a good job of cleaning up malware - infested systems .
Webroot has even thrown in a new firewall , as the name implies .
This addition is a bit of a mixed bag , but it does n't add to the price tag , and you can shut it off if you do n't like it .
BioData Mining [ 1 ] is an open - access , open peer - reviewed , online journal that publishes articles on the development of data mining techniques applied to biological data .
The journal stems from the gap between biology and computer science and covers a number of topics in the middle of these fields .
One of the main interests of BioData Mining is the advance in computational methods or theoretical informatics for the progress in the discovery of new knowledge in biomedical sciences .
Data mining [ 2 ] techniques have been traditionally used in many varied contexts .
Usually datasets contained many examples ( thousands ) and some attributes ( at most several tens ) .
Algorithms have been developed taking into account these characteristics , and have been validated by means of statistical tests with synthetic and real - world data .
Statistics has been the support for any analysis of biological data for many years .
However , the biological data has changed over time in size , but above all in structure , and many challenges arise from genetic , transcriptomic , genomic , proteomic and metabolomic data .
The enormous increase of biological data incorporates another element of difficulty because statistics , without losing its relevance , has moved to the background leaving in the foreground a space for complex heuristics .
In addition , the curse of dimensionality plays an important role in the design of new data mining algorithms .
However , the most important challenge comes from the intrinsic characteristics of new problems to be solved .
Due to the high volume of data , optimization and efficiency are key aspects in the design of new heuristics , which many times only provide approximate solutions .
In this sense , BioData Mining aims at publishing articles that not only adapt , evaluate or apply traditional data mining techniques , but also that develop , evaluate or apply novel methods from data mining or machine learning fields to the analysis of complex biological data .
Moreover , the situation has substantially changed during the last decade .
Nowadays , biological information is distributed and adopts different formats .
It is not trivial to consider different types of data , which are located in different databases and present various levels of structure or heterogeneity .
In some cases the effort is focused on facilitating the management of biological information , dealing with semantic aspects of the information through the Internet .
In order to promote the advance in science many research groups are making their software development projects publicly available , as open - source software , which encourages researchers to develop extensions of verified software applications , like interfaces , packages or specific services .
BioData Mining aims at publishing articles that design , develop and integrate databases , software and web services for the storage , management and retrieval of complex biological data , with emphasis on open - source software for the application of data mining to the analysis such type of information .
The role of biologists , geneticists , physicians , etc. is critical in the correct interpretation of results obtained by data mining algorithms .
In many cases , data needs to be pre-processed for extracting useful knowledge and , in some cases , algorithms produce models that must be post - processed to get an insight of the knowledge that information hides .
At the end , experimental validation is crucial to show the research community the quality of the approaches .
In this field , statistics offers robust tools that can be applied directly , although new developments are also needed to deal with biological data .
BioData Mining aims at publishing articles that present new methods for pre-processing , post - processing and validation of data mining algorithms for the analysis of genetic , transcriptomic , genomic , proteomic , and metabolomic data .
In the expectation of filling the gap between biology and computer science , we believe that BioData Mining will contribute to the development of theoretical and practical aspects of new methodologies driven by biological data .
Not particularly academic so hope this is n't too off - topic , but thought this article in the non-geek media ( salon.com ) might interest some here :
Why Johnny can't code
' BASIC used to be on every computer a child touched -- but today there 's no easy way for kids to get hooked on programming .'
I have to say that , much as I love more modern higher - level languages ( why else would I be here ) , BASIC was what I grew up on , and really was ideal for picking up a first understanding of what programming is all about .
With its global variables , GOTOs and all .
It gets the computer obeying your command and following your logic with the absolute minimum learning curve .
You do n't have to learn any more abstractions than are absolutely necessary in order to feel that power ( wow , it actually does what I tell it to , step by step ! ) and get yourself hooked .
Mark
Twain once said , “ It ai n’t what you do n’t know that gets you into trouble .
It ’s what you know for sure that just ai n’t so . ”
Here are 60 pieces of false knowledge many people misquote as absolute facts .
Shaving causes hair to grow back thicker .
–
Shaving does not cause hair to grow back thicker .
This false knowledge carried by many people is due to the fact that hair wears down and appears thinner over time .
Thus , new hair looks thinner than old hair and feels coarser due to unworn edges .
We only use 10 % of our brain .
–
We may only be using 10 % of our total brain at any one given time , but this 10 % is nearly 100 % of the brain capacity designed to calculate the data sets we are currently working on .
For example , the creative side of the brain is n’t going to help you remember a statistics formula .
It was n’t designed to do so and it will remain unused during this process .
Rice is pure and healthy .
–
Actually , it ’s often contaminated with small traces of arsenic .
Milk is absolutely essential to your health .
–
It ’s just one of numerous sources for calcium and Vitamin D. People should eat mostly carbohydrates .
–
After all , that ’s what the food pyramid says , right ?
False !
Look around at the average American ’s midsection .
An excessive intake of carbohydrates is fattening .
Wholegrain foods containing fiber should be the primary source .
Tar and nicotine in cigarettes cause cancer .
– Nope , excessive smoke in your lungs causes cancer .
In fact , the Radon and Polonium in the smoke is enough to account for most cases of cigarette related lung cancer .
Being overworked can cause a nervous breakdown .
– Actually , nervous breakdowns do not even appear as an official mental health disorder in DSM - IV .
Depression is purely biochemical .
– Depression is more closely related to a specific cognitive state of mind .
Male masturbation is unhealthy .
– I ’m sure most teenage guys will love this .
Research has shown that masturbating early and often may reduce Prostate Cancer later in life .
Females are biologically inferior in math and spatial skills .
– Statistically , males and females have very similar grade averages in math courses from grade school through doctorate level classes .
Male enrollment , however , drastically out - numbers female enrollment .
Based on global warming Earth will be hotter in 2000 years .
– Nothing is certain .
In this kind of complex nonlinear system , we could have an ice age .
Corn based fuel ( biodiesel ) is better than gasoline .
–
It ’s more expensive , increases the cost of food and still pollutes the environment .
Religious faith alone heals .
–
This is only true on a physiological basis to a minuscule degree .
Religious faith cannot replace medical intervention .
Herbal medicine is healthier than modern medicine .
–
In numerous cases herbal medicine has been found to have either zero value or undesirable side effects .
Chills do n’t make you ill .
– Wrong !
Getting a chill in your body shocks your immune system , which prevents it from effectively keeping viruses at bay .
Highly social people are psychologically healthier .
–
Not healthier , but usually a bit happier .
Nutritional supplements make you live longer .
– Quite often the opposite is true .
Many people misuse supplements and end up doing more harm than good to their bodies .
Hair and fingernails continue to grow after death .
–
Hair and fingernails do not grow at all after a person dies .
This illusion is based on the fact that skin dries up and shrivels away from the foundation of hair roots and nails , making the hair and nails look longer than before death .
String Theory –
There has been zero proof that String Theory relates to the physical universe .
The Big Bang was an explosion .
–
It was an expansion of space , not an explosion .
Windows is easier to use than Linux .
– Linux , harder ?
Only if you are completely against the notion of learning something new .
A true free market exists .
–
Take a hard look at the price of oil and tell me that the recent 100 % price spike is completely based around supply and demand and not partial price manipulation .
Ozone is healthy .
–
Ozone is only healthy when used in controlled medical environments .
Outside of that , it is harmful to the lungs if inhaled .
Stretching before exercise is a sure thing .
–
Only if you stretch properly .
Many people injure themselves due to improper stretching practices .
Weight belts prevent injuries .
–
If used properly when lifting extreme amounts of weight , they do help .
The problem is that most amateur weight lifters swing their bodies and hyper - extend their backs while lifting weight with their upper body .
When they wear weight belts for upper body exercises they still swing their bodies and hyper - extend their backs , only this time they use more weight and the injuries are more severe .
Soap kills germs .
– Plain ( non-antibacterial ) hand soap does not kill germs .
Instead , it lifts the germs off the surface of your skin , forcing them to be washed down the drain .
Alcohol is a great antiseptic for open wounds .
– Alcohol is a great disinfectant for intact skin and inanimate , non-living things .
Alcohol is not effective or healthy when applied into open wounds .
When used on open , exposed tissue , alcohol actually kills some of the human tissue along with the germs .
This can drastically delay the healing of larger wounds .
Coffee is unhealthy .
–
It ’s all about moderation and timing .
If you take excessive doses of coffee late in the day , you ’ll be up all night , and that ’s not healthy .
However , coffee is also a great source of healthy antioxidants .
Coffee consumption has been medically linked to the reduction of certain cancers and chronic diseases .
There have even been controlled studies which have concluded that moderate doses of coffee can be a healthy energy booster for a person partaking is intense physical exercise .
Fructose is healthier than Sucrose .
– Sucrose ( table sugar ) is made from sugarcane .
Fructose is usually made from corn ( also found in fruits ) and is a cheaper alternative to Sucrose .
Once thought to be healthier , fructose actually has many negative downsides .
Some of these downsides include cholesterol increases and digestion difficulty , in addition to the fact that it converts to fat more easily than other types of sugar .
Exercise alone increases lifespan .
–
It increases the quality of your life and the ability of your body , but exercise alone has not been proven to increase lifespan .
A regular habit of eating healthy food , however , will .
Time heals all wounds .
–
Time does heal most psychological wounds , but if the wound is severe ( e.g. someone killed your spouse ) it may never fully heal .
Eye exercises can improve vision .
–
Eye exercises for improving vision have never been scientifically proven to work .
Results contain significant variance .
Cheese is healthy .
– Regular cheese contains an extremely high content of fat .
As with anything , moderation is the key .
In smaller doses it can be a decent source of calcium and protein .
Tan people look good , so tanning in the sun is okay .
– Extremely tan people have burnt skin .
Check back with them at age 60 when they have skin cancer .
Swimming in chlorine pools is healthy .
–
While the chlorine levels found in most swimming pools wo n’t noticeably hurt a swimmer , continuous exposure is unhealthy for the skin and the eyes .
True saltwater pools are a much healthier alternative .
Jogging along a traveled roadway is healthy .
– Jogging along a traveled roadway forces the jogger to inhale large quantities of air polluted with car exhaust .
Like secondhand smoke , this can be extremely bad for the health of a person ’s lungs .
Heading a soccer ball does n’t hurt the player .
– Soccer players do n’t just head the ball ; frequently their heads collide with another player ’s head while trying to head the ball .
In both cases there remains a potential for mild amounts of brain damage , especially when the heading is repeated over a long period of time .
Free - diving does n’t cause brain damage .
–
Do you really think it ’s healthy for the human body to remain in deep water with no oxygen for extended periods of time ?
Based on the complications of pressure equalization and a lack of oxygen , free - diving will cause small amounts of neurological damage no matter how you breathe out while ascending .
Brain scan imaging tells us lots about the mind .
–
Understanding the brain by looking at brain scan images is sort of like trying to evaluate a software - based computer problem by looking inside the computer case .
You may locate the hard - drive , but you ’ll never know exactly what ’s on it .
Brain scans are efficient at detecting gross physical abnormalities , which do save lives .
However , much of the claims about reading a persons thoughts and future is complete nonsense .
Brain scanning cannot even reliably detect early stage Alzheimer ’s disease as of yet .
Rorschach inkblot tests are reliable .
– Various studies have depicted the conclusions found by inkblot test administrators as being akin to fortune teller cold readings .
The controversy stems from several factors including the potential variance of interpretation , general verifiability and reliability , the inability to completely baseline testing norms and the limited number of psychological conditions the test is supposedly capable of determining .
Positive thinking ( and the placebo effect ) helps heal cancer .
– Medical treatment is the only way to eliminate cancer cells .
Positive thinking does nothing more than help cancer patients mentally prepare for medical treatment .
Eggs are unhealthy .
–
Eggs are a food you should eat regularly , but in moderation .
They are a great source of essential nutrients and high in protein .
Unfortunately , they also contain a high level of cholesterol , which means limiting intake to 1 or 2 eggs a day .
Regular dentist visits create healthy teeth .
– Dentists repair problems and make suggestions .
Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing will create healthy teeth .
Poor people are lazy .
–
Money is not always the best measure of personal effort and drive .
Remember , some millionaires are very poor and some people with small incomes are very rich … in happiness .
Asians are smarter than Caucasians .
– Asian grade schools are typically more disciplined and demanding than public school systems elsewhere ( especially the USA ) .
So while Asians do not dominate over Caucasians in intelligence , many of them come out of grade school with a much better education .
You can drink as much water as you want .
–
It may sound weird , but people do die from fatal water overdoses .
An overdose occurs when an overabundance of water in the body causes regular salt levels in the blood to become drastically diluted .
This dilution can cause swelling in the brain and organs which may result in coma or death .
Ivy League students get the best education .
– Education is about self - discipline , curiosity and personal drive .
Some of the most educated and successful people on this planet are self - educated .
Strictly from a formal education standpoint , think about the fact that MIT ( a top technical school ) and Duke ( a top medical school ) are not Ivy League .
Human growth hormone ( HGH ) increases life span .
–
In many cases the opposite is actually true .
HGH does tend to improve the quality of life in a person ’s elder years by reducing fat production in the body while increasing muscle mass .
However , no critical factors for extending a person ’s life span are affected , such as bone density improvements , cholesterol level reduction , lipid measurements , maximal oxygen consumption , or any other factor that would increase a body ’s durability .
Regular consumption of HGH has also been linked to various negative side effects such as joint swelling , joint pain , carpal tunnel syndrome and an amplified risk of diabetes .
Shouting into a phone helps the other person hear you .
–
In most cases it will rattle your phone ’s microphone and distort the sound of your voice , thus making it harder for the other person to comprehend your words .
Tabasco sauce causes stomach cancer . –
This is an urban legend .
In reality , researchers have discovered that spicy pepper sauces may actually help fight the growth of cancer cells .
The University Of Pittsburgh School Of Medicine found that capsaicin ( the hot ingredient in pepper sauce ) induces apoptosis in the cancer cells .
Karate works better than dirty street fighting .
– Sad , but true …
The dirty street fighter with a concealed weapon will probably win the fight outside of a formal fighting ring .
Expensive CD players produce better sound quality .
–
If you want better sound quality spend your money on a decent amplifier , equalizer and a high quality set of speakers .
An expensive input device like a CD player is worthless if the other components are not in place .
Monster Cables ( expensive audio / video cables ) are worth it .
–
In most cases you will hear and see no difference in the quality between a Monster Cable and a standard cable .
The only exceptions occur in extremely high end systems where slight cable attenuation creates a noticeable difference in clarity .
Lie detector ( polygraph ) tests are accurate .
– The American Civil Liberties Union released a report in 1996 stating that “ … there is no machine that can detect lies .
The ‘ lie detector ‘ does not measure truth - telling ; it measures changes in blood pressure , breath rate and perspiration rate , but those physiological changes can be triggered by a wide range of emotions . ”
Raw veggies are always healthier for you .
– Cooking certain kinds of vegetables such as onions and garlic can actually increase the variety and potency of nutrients that get released inside a person ’s digestive track .
In addition , cooking vegetables also eliminates the potential for bacterial contamination such as salmonella .
SUV ’s are safer than regular cars .
–
When it comes to vehicles , bigger does not mean safer .
Many SUV models are top heavy and have poor handling .
Several recent accident - related death statistics have shown that fatality rates in SUV’s are no lower than those in standard size vehicles .
Soft water is healthier than hard water .
– Reverse it .
Hard water is healthier than soft water .
Hard water contains natural minerals and is sodium free .
Soft water has sodium and is stripped of all natural minerals .
So why do people soften water ?
Soft water has cleaning benefits .
When soft water is used , soap lathers better and cleans objects more efficiently , kitchenware and shower glass will sparkle and remain scum - free and hair and skin will also feel smoother .
Astrology has value .
– Astrology is one of the world ’s oldest con games .
It ’s complete rubbish .
People want to believe that the future can be predicted , which is exactly why the traditions of Astrology still exist in modern cultures .
Chiropractic therapy can cure various diseases .
– Chiropractic therapy has been medically proven to help with some joint and bone related injuries , comparable to various forms of physical therapy .
However , there is no medical proof to backup the popular assertions from chiropractors claiming that chiropractic therapy is an effective remedy for other diseases or conditions ( such as chronic stress headaches ) .
IQ is a perfect measure of intelligence .
– IQ tests are only one of many imperfect techniques for measuring human intelligence .
IQ tests do n’t measure creativity , social skills , general wisdom , learned aptitude or an entire gamut of other traits most people would consider as a measurement of intelligence .
IQ tests can be used as a measure of basic intellectual potential , but do not reflect accurate measurements in all circumstances .

Who Moved My Brain ?
Revaluing Time & Attention ( slideshare.net )
Thanks to my pals , Dara and Shawn , I 've been preparing for a return visit with the folks at GoDaddy to deliver a couple talks on Inbox Zero and Time and Attention .
As I 've been going over my slides for the Time & Attention talk , I realized I had n't shared how the material has evolved since it premiered at Macworld in January .
Which is to say , " Kind of a lot . "
So , I 've posted the updated deck .
Of course , the irony of making cool , unbulleted slides is that the decks you create wo n't make a lick of sense without the accompanying audio and -- you know -- human presence .
So , I 've made a special version of this for you to view online , adding slide notes at the bottom that can help give you the flavor for what 's happening as I wave my hands around on - stage like a huge dork .
I 'm proud of this work , and I really hope you find it useful .
The 5th to the last slide makes me teary .
Partly because I really do believe this stuff is important .
It 's about more than email and " productivity . "
It comes down to how you decide to spend your life and , on some level , what kind of human being you want to be .
Many thanks to Mike Monteiro , Joel on Software , iStockPhoto , and Futura ( the unofficial type family of Mssrs. Anderson and Kubrick . )
And , yes , here 's the minor pimp ( I mean , it is what I do for a living ) .
You can hire me to deliver this talk to the time - and attention - addled people you work with .
Drop a note if you have an upcoming event where you think this might be a good fit .
And , yeah , unless I know you really well or your company is giant , awesome , and MUNI - accessible : it costs money .
Yep .
So .
You know .
Serious inquiries only , and what have you .
See you soon , GoDaddy !
I crave your hell - like climate right now .
The MOST effective way to get a woman into bed is by running yourself down , say scientists
His wry , self - deprecating humour is as important as his floppy hair and English charm at ensuring he always wins the heart of his leading lady .
Now scientists have discovered the technique used by Hugh Grant 's film characters can bring the same romantic success offscreen .
Taking the mickey out of yourself works far better than clever jokes , which might be seen as boastful and put women off .
The findings were outlined by anthropologist Gil Greengross , who conducted a two - year study into the role of humour in seduction .
Chemistry : Grant understatedly charms Roberts in Notting Hill
He discovered that the type of humour used by Hugh Grant in the film Notting Hill - in which he attempts to charm Julia Roberts with the poor contents of his fridge - works the best .
' Many studies show that a sense of humour is sexually attractive , especially to women , ' he said .
' But we 've found that self - deprecating humour is the most attractive of all .
' It is a risky form of humour because it can draw attention to one 's real faults , thereby diminishing the self - deprecator 's status in the eyes of others .
' But based on the idea that verbal humour evolved to function as a fitness indicator , self - deprecating humour can be an especially reliable indicator , not only of general intelligence and verbal creativity , but also moral virtues such as humility . '
Grant 's bumbling character charms MacDowell in Four Weddings and a Funeral
In Four Weddings and a Funeral , Hugh Grant 's bumbling British bachelor character charms a sexy young American played by Andie MacDowell .
In a best man 's speech , he says : ' This is only the second time I 've been a best man .
I hope I did OK that time .
The couple in question are at least still talking to me .
Unfortunately , they 're not actually talking to each other .
The divorce came through a couple of months ago .
But l'm assured it had absolutely nothing to do with me .
Paula knew Piers had slept with her sister before I mentioned it in the speech .
' The fact that he'd slept with her mother came as a surprise but I think was incidental to the nightmare of recrimination and violence that became their two - day marriage . '
While Americans are said to adore the British tendency towards self - deprecating humour , experts warned that problems could arise when it was used to seduce a member of the opposite sex from a different culture who might not understand it .
The report , ' Dissing Oneself : The Sexual Attractiveness of Self - Dep - Humour ' , which will be published next month in the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology , also warns that the technique should not be attempted by those who are already unpopular .
It could make ' low - status individuals ' appear ' more pathetic ' than they did before .
Twitter is arguably the most heavily used Ruby on Rails application in the world .
Almost since its inception , Twitter has fostered a wildly passionate cult following .
Also from the beginning , Twitter has suffered from chronic outages under that load .
In the past month , record downtime has prompted fresh outcry within its ever - growing user base .
This , along with increased attention from mainstream media has forced Twitter to publicly acknowledge these issues , and to reveal a few details about the source of these problems .
Though there has been much speculation about the source of Twitter ’s performance issues , the closest we have had to a real peek under the hood has been this Twitter Developer Blog post :
Twitter is , fundamentally , a messaging system .
Twitter was not architected as a messaging system , however .
For expediency ’s sake , Twitter was built with technologies and practices that are more appropriate to a content management system .
But wait , what exactly do they mean by “ technologies and practices ” ?
Could they mean Ruby on Rails ?
Twitter and the Curse of the Framework
Ruby on Rails is a Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) framework .
To build an application in Rails , you start by defining a collection of objects that model the things your application will do , then you write controllers that juggle your model in response to user requests , and finally you write the views that present your application to its users .
As separate as these three elements are , the performance of an app can depend largely on how they work together .
If your model is n’t optimized for the way your controllers will use it , you could find yourself facing some surprising performance issues .
This is the kind of problem that I expect Twitter is faced with .
Let ’s look at a simplified example of what Twitter ’s problem might look like on the inside .
Twitter is a site where users post short messages called Tweets , and follow the Tweets of other users .
When the original developers behind the site first sat down to define their model , the simplest thing to do would have been to have a database table for all the Tweets , another table for all the users , and a third table to keep track of who is following whom .
This approach closely resembles the model you might build for a content management system ( CMS ) like a blog : each post has an author , so you can easily get a list of all the posts ( i.e. Twitter ’s public timeline ) , or just the posts in a given category ( e.g. my tweets ) .
What this fails to take into account is the most common type of request that Twitter receives : show me the most recent tweets from just the users that I ’m following .
With a CMS - style model , this common request will generate a lot of work for the application , as it has to filter the timeline of Tweets for each individual user .
If the original developers of Twitter had realised just how many requests of this type it would be fielding , Twitter ’s model would probably have been designed very differently .
As mentioned in the blog post quoted above , Twitter really is a messaging system , and its model should reflect that .
Here ’s how the model of a messaging system might look : whenever a user posts a Tweet , the model looks up which users are following the author and places a copy of the Tweet into those users ’ private timelines .
Tweets are queued up for their recipients when they ’re posted , shifting the processing burden away from the more common “ show me my tweets ! ” request .
Now , let me be clear : both models could be built with Ruby on Rails .
The CMS - style model is just the direction that the framework will lead you in if you do n’t stop and think about the characteristics of your application .
Any good framework will handle for you the things that most web applications have in common , so you can focus on the unique aspects of your app .
The curse of the framework is that it can be very tempting to let the framework take the lead in handling those unique aspects too .
The fact is , Twitter ’s developers were in a hurry , and took every opportunity to let the framework do the thinking for them .
Just about every general - purpose web framework out there would have led them down the same road .
“ The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . ”
The message here is not that Rails is a bad framework — just that no framework can do the important thinking about how an app should work .
That ’s what developers are for .
Like any framework , Rails has strengths and weaknesses .
Those who love Rails believe that its strengths — the virtual elimination of the scutwork of building web apps using a fresh , expressive programming language — far outweigh weaknesses like scaling being a non-trivial undertaking .
Truth is , if you ’re building a service intended for mass adoption and you do n’t design it to support that , no framework in the world is going to keep your app from collapsing in on itself .
SitePoint ’s new book , Simply Rails 2 is now available .
Get it , and build your own Twitter killer . :-)
MooTools is a collection of JavaScript utilities designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer .
It allows you to write powerful and flexible code with its elegant , well documented , and coherent APIs .
MooTools code is extensively documented and easy to read , enabling you to extend the functionality to match your requirements .
HONG KONG , Aug 28 ( Reuters ) - China has signed an initial agreement with Hong Kong to guarantee a steady supply of energy to the city for a further 20 years under a broad plan to cut the use of polluting coal and raise that of cleaner energy sources .
Under the pact , a liquefied natural gas terminal will be jointly built on the mainland to supply gas to Hong Kong , potentially supplanting a similar project by CLP 0002.HK , Hong Kong 's largest electricity producer .
“ The main purpose of the MOU is that in the future there will be a long - term , stable supply of energy to Hong Kong , ” Secretary for the Environment Edward Yau told reporters on Thursday .
“ What is important is we do not need anymore to build LNG terminals in Hong Kong .
So there will be no more pressure for hiking tariffs as a result of investment .

A variety of current and former high - level officials have recently warned that the Bush administration is attempting to instill a dictatorship in America , and will itself carry out a fake terrorist attack in order to obtain one .
Background
FBI agents , Time Magazine , Keith Olbermann and The Washington Post and Rolling Stone have all stated that the administration has issued terror alerts based on scant intelligence in order to rally people around the flag when the administration was suffering in the polls .
This implies — as an initial matter only — that the administration will play fast and loose with the facts in order to instill fear for political purposes
More to the point , a former prominent republican congressman stated that the U.S. is close to becoming a totalitarian society and that the Bush administration is using fear to try to ensure that this happens .
General Tommy
Franks stated that if another terrorist attack occurs in the United States " the Constitution will likely be discarded in favor of a military form of government " .
Current U.S. Congressman Ron Paul stated , the government " is determined to have martial law " , and that the government is hoping to get the people " fearful enough that they will accept the man on the white horse "
And Daniel Ellsberg , the famous Pentagon Papers whistleblower , said " if there is another terror attack , " I believe the president will get what he wants " , which will include a dictatorship .
Terror on U.S. Citizens by American Government ?
But would the government actually kills its own people to instill sufficient fear so that it can get what it wants ?
Read what the following very smart people are saying , and then judge for yourself :
A retired 27 - year CIA analyst who prepared and presented Presidential Daily Briefs and served as a high - level analyst for several presidents , stated that if there was another major attack in the U.S. , it would lead to martial law .
He went on to say :
" We have to be careful , if somebody does this kind of provocation , big violent explosions of some kind , we have to not take the word of the masters there in Washington that this was some terrorist event because it could well be a provocation allowing them , or seemingly to allow them to get what they want . "
The former CIA analyst would not put it past the government to " play fast and loose " with terror alerts and warnings and even events themselves in order to rally people behind the flag
The former assistant secretary of treasury in the Reagan administration , called the " Father of Reaganomics " , who is a former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal , Business Week , and Scripps Howard News Service , and , said :
" Ask yourself : Would a government that has lied us into two wars and is working to lie us into an attack on Iran shrink from staging " terrorist " attacks in order to remove opposition to its agenda ? "
He goes on to say :
If the Bush administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle East and to entrench the " unitary executive " at home , it will have to conduct some false flag operations that will both frighten and anger the American people and make them accept Bush 's declaration of " national emergency " and the return of the draft .
Alternatively , the administration could simply allow any real terrorist plot to proceed without hindrance .
A series of staged or permitted attacks would be spun by the captive media as a vindication of the neoconsevatives '
Islamophobic policy , the intention of which is to destroy all Middle Eastern governments that are not American puppet states .
Success would give the US control over oil , but the main purpose is to eliminate any resistance to Israel 's complete absorption of Palestine into Greater Israel .
Think about it .
If another 9/11 - type " security failure " were not in the works , why would Homeland Security czar Chertoff go to the trouble of convincing the Chicago Tribune that Americans have become complacent about terrorist threats and that he has " a gut feeling " that America will soon be hit hard ?
A member of the British Parliament stated that " there is a very real danger " that the American government will stage a false flag terror attack in order to justify war against Iran and to gain complete control domestically
A former National Security Adviser told the Senate that a terrorist act might be carried out in the U.S. and falsely blamed on Iran to justify war against that nation .
President Carter recently impliedly acknowledged the risk of staged provocation in order to start a war against Iran .
The former UN Weapons Inspector , an American , who stated before the Iraq war started that there were no weapons of mass destruction is now saying that he would not rule out staged government terror by the U.S. government .
And an allegedly - leaked GOP memo touts a new terror attack as a way to reverse the party 's decline .
No way , That 's Nuts
Sounds nuts , right ?
Sorry to have to tell you , but " false flag terror " -- that is , state - sponsored terrorism , blamed on the " bad guys " of choice -- is an age - old trick which has been used by governments around the world for thousands of years to consolidate power and create support from their people .
See this article on the Reichstag fire , and this article on the perennial ploy of those grabbing power .
But even recent events provide a glimpse into the world of false flag terror :
On October 12 , 2005 , Australia 's largest newspaper quoted the well - respected former Indonesian president as saying that the government had a role in the Bali bombings
And Americans dressed as Arabs have apparently been setting off car bombs in Iraq ( apparently , when it was discovered that some of the cars used in Iraqi bombings recently came from the U.S. , the cover story became American cars were involved in car bombings only because they had recently been stolen from the U.S. and then shipped to Iraq -- but does it make sense that Iraqi insurgents would steal cars in the U.S. and ship them all the way to Iraq ? )
Similarly , Britain 's false flag attacks in Iraq made the news .
And the press has acknowledged that the death of the lead investigator into the Basra incident was mysterious .
And the former director of the National Security Agency said " By any measure the US has long used terrorism .
In ‘ 78 - 79 the Senate was trying to pass a law against international terrorism - in every version they produced , the lawyers said the US would be in violation " ( the audio is here )
History proves that the officials ' warnings of a terror attack by our own government are well - founded .
WEEKS after being billed as fit for growing asparagus , it now seems the red soil of Mars may not be quite so friendly after all .
After days of growing speculation about an important discovery , NASA finally revealed a secret yesterday .
Its Phoenix lander , which touched down in May , has found not the chemistry of life , but perchlorate - a toxic , highly corrosive compound used in household cleaners , explosives and rocket fuel that can destroy organic matter .
When Linux crashes , users do n't get a Blue Screen like they do on Windows .
Instead , Linux generates an " oops " -- a crash signature that can help developers to figure out what went wrong .
The feature may have a silly name , but it 's increasingly serious business .
Keeping track of the " oopses " is the duty of the Kerneloops.org project , and according to supporters , its efforts have improved kernel quality and fixed a large number of bugs -- a thrust that 's critical for Linux as it angles for even greater adoption in the enterprise and elsewhere .
" Linux calls it ' oops , ' but it 's basically equivalent to a Windows ' Blue Screen , ' " Arjan van de Ven , of Intel 's Open Source Technology Center , told InternetNews.com
" It 's kind of the same thing in terms of what causes it and what it does , except we do n't make it blue -- we just print the message . "
Van de Ven runs the Kerneloops.org project site himself , although the collection mechanisms of oops detection and reporting are mostly automated .
Kerneloops chiefly collects oops records from a client installation that is available to Fedora , OpenSUSE and Debian users .
Such features are growing every more useful as the market for Linux grows and the OS continues finding its way into the hands of non-technical business and consumer users .
Red Hat 's Fedora Linux includes the oops client by default , for instance .
" A lot of people do n't know how to detect a problem , what to send , or where to send it too , " Van de Ven explained .
" If you can just click a button , it 's so much easier and people are more inclined to do it . "
Fedora Project leader Paul Frields told InternetNews.com that the Kerneloops package automatically delivers the messages the kernel dumps into a repository the kernel maintainers can use to prioritize , diagnose and fix problems .
" Fedora is involved because we track the kernel very aggressively , " Frields said .
" The Kerneloops capability also supports our dedication to a healthy cooperation with upstream software providers like the kernel developer community .
It leverages the widespread use of Fedora for the direct benefit of that community , who can see measurable results of their work and shift resources as needed to target frequent or important issues . "
Kerneloops also collects records from the Linux Kernel Mailing List ( LKML ) -- the key technical discussion list for kernel bugs and design .
The project also sends out a list of the top problems to the LKML on a periodic basis .
Van de Ven noted that if there is enough data about a specific problem , kernel developers often tend to go after it to fix it .
" In general , kernel developers are open to Kerneloops , since the more reports I have , the more data they have , " Van de Ven said .
" If you have one report , it could just be a fluke , but if you 've got 500 reports of the same pattern , you know it 's a real bug . "
As a result , Van de Ven sees Linux developers fixing bugs thanks to those reports -- thereby making an impact on overall kernel quality .
The exact numbers are difficult to quantify , however , as the number of reports that Kerneloops.org gets on any given kernel release varies , as does the occurrence of repeating oops reports .
" We are fixing the bugs that have a lot of people hitting them , " Van de Ven said .
" If you look at the number of unique bugs , the numbers can be confusing .
For the 2.6.25 kernel , there were 1,300 bugs , only half of which only happened once .
We do fix a lot of bugs , but if you look at what we fix , it 's the ones that actually matter . "
On the current 2.6.27 Linux kernel release candidate , Van de Ven is already seeing some early trends on the top oopses .
The big one right now involves a problem when a USB drive is removed while still in use , he said -- a condition currently responsible for up to five of the top 20 oopses .
" At this point , it 's the hottest bug , " he said .
" In a few months from now it , might be something different . "
The effort to improve overall Linux kernel quality has increasingly found itself in the limelight .
Recent efforts by the Linux Foundation aimed to simplify the task of contributing to the kernel in the hopes of improving the quality of driver code from vendors , among other things .
[ cob : Special_Report ] Still , not everyone is in agreement on how best to avoid buggy code -- whether effort is best spent on ensuring quality code during development or in fixing bugs afterward .
" What Kerneloops is doing is wonderful in helping the upstream kernel developers track what is going wrong and what needs to be fixed , " Greg Kroah - Hartman , a Novell fellow in the company 's Open Platform Solutions told InternetNews.com .
" Of course , more users testing the nightly kernel releases of the main kernel.org tree is very helpful in finding problems that happen during the development cycle .
But that being said , the Linux kernel has a very good record of quality and stability over time . "
Van de Ven , meanwhile , said he'd prefer to see more people working on fixing bugs .
At the same time , the Linux Foundation takes a wider view -- looking at why the bugs occur in the first place .
" It 's important to track bugs and get visibility into what is causing them , " Amanda McPherson , vice president of marketing and developer programs at the Linux Foundation , told InternetNews.com .
" But it 's also just one arrow in our quality - improvement quiver . "
McPherson argued that preventing buggy code from finding its way into Linux must also be a key initiative for kernel development .
She noted that a lot of focus on quality , particularly efforts by kernel maintainers Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds , has been around preventing bugs from entering in the first place .
She also said the Foundation is looking at other ways of encouraging better - quality code .
" Our technical advisory board and Andrew Morton recently starting tracking the " Reported - by " tag in Git , " she said , referring to the kernel 's version control system .
" We plan on publishing a paper in the future that ranks the greatest bug finders and fixers by name . "
" So just like we recently wrote a ' who writes the Linux kernel ' paper that tracked contributions , we 'll also have a paper that calls out great achievements in quality improvements . "

Europe should consider sharing vast amounts of intelligence and information on its citizens with the US to establish a " Euro - Atlantic area of cooperation " to combat terrorism , according to a high - level confidential report on future security .
The 27 members of the EU should also pool intelligence on terrorism , develop joint video - surveillance and unmanned drone aircraft , start networks of anti-terrorism centres , and boost the role and powers of an intelligence - coordinating body in Brussels , said senior officials .
The 53 - page report drafted by the Future Group of interior and justice ministers from six EU member states - Germany , France , Sweden , Portugal , Slovenia , and the Czech Republic - argues Europe will need to integrate much of its policing , intelligence - gathering , and policy - making if it is to tackle terrorism , organised crime , and legal and illegal immigration .
The report , seen by the Guardian , was submitted to EU governments last month following 18 months of work .
The group , which also includes senior officials from the European Commission , was established by Germany last year and charged with drafting a blueprint for security and justice policy over the next five years .
Baroness Scotland , the UK attorney general , had observer status with the group to assess the implications for Britain , whose legal system , unlike continental Europe , is based on the common law .
The group 's controversial proposals are certain to trigger major disputes , not least its calls for Europe to create an expeditionary corps of armed gendarmerie for paramilitary intervention overseas .
The report said the EU would fail to beat terrorism unless it developed a full partnership with Washington , a process currently pushing ahead in fits and starts .
" The EU should make up its mind with regard to the political objective of achieving a Euro - Atlantic area of cooperation with the United States in the field of freedom , security and justice , " it said .
Such a pact , which should be finalised by 2014 at the latest , would entail the transfer of vast volumes of information on European citizens and travellers to the US authorities .
Negotiations have long been under way to agree such a pact , but have been bedevilled by divergences in privacy law and data protection regimes .
The US is already demanding that EU countries sign up for a battery of security measures on transatlantic flights and the supply of personal information on passengers if they are to enjoy visa - free travel to the US .
Under one such accord struck in March between Washington and Berlin , the Germans are to make DNA and biometric information on travellers available .
The European Commission and the US homeland security department are also trying to iron out discrepancies in privacy laws to allow the wholesale exchange of data .
The aim is to reach a binding international agreement this year or next .
Last month the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to MEPs pressing Brussels to reject US pressure because the US is " a country that , in privacy terms , is all but lawless ... US privacy laws are weak .
They offer little protection to citizens and virtually none to non-citizens . "
While urging a comprehensive transatlantic electronic pact , the Future Group focuses mainly on boosting police cooperation and integration between EU states , policies which would reinforce the powers of European agencies and institutions bearing acronyms such as Europol , Eurojust , Frontex , and Sitcen and perhaps see new agencies established to deal with security and intelligence operations .
Several member states , not least Britain , will have deep qualms about the proposals , with the British likely to balk at automatic pooling of national intelligence .
Anti-terrorist campaigns can only be effective if " maximum information flow between [ EU ] member states is guaranteed , " the report said .
" Relevant security - related information should be available to all security authorities in the member states . "
It said " networks of anti-terrorist centres " was a possible solution .
While cooperation between national police forces in the EU was advancing , the report conceded that the sharing of espionage and intelligence material was a " considerable challenge " as it clashed with the " principle of confidentiality " that is the basis for successful exchanges .
The report calls for a bigger role for " Sitcen " in coordinating intelligence sharing .
Sitcen , or the Joint Situation Centre , is a shadowy intelligence body based in Brussels which started as a foreign policy tool supplying analysis on international crises to Javier Solana , the EU foreign policy chief , but which now focuses on counter - terrorism and internal security policy .
Key points
· National police forces to cooperate and integrate
· Improve European - level crisis management
· Need to harness the talents of " different actors " in fighting terrorism
· National security services and intelligence agencies need to collaborate much more closely
· New EU internet - based propaganda campaign to defeat radicalisation and terrorist recruitment
· Create " European Gendarmerie Force " for deployment and intervention abroad .
Pooling of EU funds for such missions
· Common EU immigration policies .
By 2014 , EU leaders should make the political decision on whether to enter a " Euro - Atlantic area of freedom , security , and justice " with the Americans

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - About 1,000 Marines deployed to train Afghan security forces will have their tours of duty extended by 30 days , a U.S. defense official said on Monday .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the Pentagon has also decided to send fewer than 200 support troops to enhance the ability of Marine trainers to engage in combat with insurgents while on exercises with Afghan forces .
The extension , which has not been officially announced , follows an identical move last month for another group of Marines battling insurgents in southern Afghanistan .
Extended Marine tours come amid U.S. concern about rising violence in Afghanistan from the Taliban and other groups , including militants that U.S. military officials say are being trained and equipped at safe havens in neighboring Pakistan .
U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and toppled the Taliban government after the September 11 attacks .
The latest Marines to have their tours extended belong to the 27th Marine Expeditionary Unit , which deployed in April for a seven - month tour that was due to end in November .
The extension will keep them in Afghanistan into December .
Last month , the Pentagon issued a one - month extension for some 2,200 Marines who deployed for combat duty in March from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit .
That extended their stay from October to November .

Group files complaint against McCain campaign Associated Press
Published : Monday June 9 , 2008

This A group that supports public financing of campaigns filed a federal complaint against John McCain 's presidential campaign Monday , calling for an investigation into two financial transactions involving two top McCain aides .
The Federal Election Commission complaint by Campaign Money Watch , a group that has received financing from Democratic leaning donors , questions payments from former finance chair Tom Loeffler to campaign finance director Susan Nelson .
It also questions the reduction of a debt to a Web services firm co-owned by McCain campaign manager Rick Davis .
" A campaign manager renegotiating a debt with a company he partly owns raises serious conflict of interest questions , " said David Donnelly , the director of Campaign Money Watch .
Donnelly also questioned whether Loeffler 's payments to Nelson amounted to an illegal subsidy to a campaign staffer .
Loeffler is a lobbyist and former congressman and Nelson is a former associate of Loeffler 's lobbying firm .
The campaign has said the payments , first reported by Newsweek , were for legitimate work and were legal .
Campaign spokesman Brian Rogers called the complaint " baseless . "
" All campaign actions were carefully reviewed by legal counsel and were fully in accord with FEC rules and election law , " he said .
" These are fact - specific issues , and Campaign Money Watch , a pro-Democratic , anti-McCain group , does not know any of the relevant facts .
The FEC will undoubtedly throw these complaints out as soon as they review them . "
The campaign did not address the specific issues raised in the complaint .
Under FEC guidelines , the McCain campaign has 15 days to respond to explain why the FEC should take no action .
The FEC can then continue with the investigation or end its inquiry .
Campaign Money
Watch also began airing an ad on Washington , D.C. , cable and broadcast channels questioning McCain 's role in an Air Force contract with Northrop Grumman and European plane maker Airbus for a refueling tanker .
Donnelly would not divulge how much the group spent on the commercial or how frequently the ad will appear .
Campaign Money
Watch is a nonprofit organization known as a 527 group , named after the section of the IRS code that governs such groups .
Among its recent donors has been the Campaign to Defend America , a Democratic - leaning group that has been running anti-McCain ads .
The group gave Campaign Money Watch $ 50,000 earlier this year , according to Internal Revenue Service records .
Barack Obama , the presumed Democratic presidential nominee , has called on such groups not to assist his campaign with ads directed at his opponent .
" We 're not connected in any way , shape or form to the Democratic Party 's committees or candidates , " Donnelly said .
" We 've received contributions from thousands of people who support our mission .
That mission has been quite clear for years  to advocate for public financing of elections and to hold candidates accountable who oppose it .
Sen. McCain has retreated from his positions . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Consumers have some not - so - nice things to say about credit - card companies and federal regulators have given them the chance to air their gripes .
In public comments on proposed credit - card rules , consumers complained about " loan sharks , " " crooks , " " leeches " and " usury . "
Many said rates seemed to be raised arbitrarily and punitively , adding that they should have a fair amount of time to pay bills .
As the economic slowdown squeezes families across the nation , wheels are turning in Washington to curb perceived credit - card abuses that can keep borrowers mired in debt .
The public comment period recently closed for credit - card rules proposed by U.S. agencies , and with tens of thousands of responses from consumers the issue 's importance is clear .
Less clear , however , is which strategies regulators should take to curb abuses while maintaining consumers ' access to credit .
Consumers who did n't have opinions about precise actions that should be taken were still sure that something needs to be done .
Barbara Conley , of Akron , Ohio , commented : " Help protect the unsuspecting credit - card user .
Too many people have gotten themselves deeply in debt from credit - card company practices .
Please help the uninformed from getting themselves in trouble and unable to recover from their debts . "
Lindsey Baccus , from Clarksville , Tenn. , said : " Now is the time to reign in these ' white collar , criminal like ' practices of the credit - card companies !
Banks and card companies blatantly display a ... predatory personality when it comes to their ability to think of new ways to financially rape the public .
In fact , they should be required to repay or pay penalties for their ' dark side ' practices .
Sincere thanks for making them toe the line ! "
Individuals also acknowledged consumer responsibility :
" I agree that 30 days late is late -- one day is not late !
I support the 21 day period that you are proposing for issuers to mail deliver the bill to me .
It gives me a chance to avoid expensive late fees and maybe even a penalty interest rate , " wrote Mary Kleiss , Port Charlotte , Fla .
Tightening controls
Regulators are looking to complete final credit - card rules this year .
Proposals from the Federal Reserve , Office of Thrift Supervision , and National Credit Union Administration would take steps such as :
Prohibiting a rate increase on an outstanding balance , except under limited circumstances , such as when a minimum payment has not been received within 30 days after the due date
Prohibiting institutions from applying payments over the minimum in ways that maximize interest charges
Requiring a reasonable amount of time for consumers to make payments
Prohibiting interest charges using the " two - cycle " method that computes interest on balances on days in billing cycles before the most recent billing cycle
For deposit accounts , requiring institutions to provide consumers with notice and the opportunity to opt out of automatic overdraft payments , before any overdraft fees or charges may be imposed
Problems in the housing market , as well as general economic weakness , have been contributing to delinquency rates for credit cards , according to the American Bankers Association .
Delinquencies in the first quarter for credit cards provided by banks rose more than one - tenth of a percentage point to 4.51 % , compared with the five - year average delinquency rate of 4.4 % , ABA reported last month .
Advocacy group Consumers Union told the agencies that the proposals are a " strong beginning , " and supported steps such as restricting rate increases on existing balances for consumers who have n't been more than 30 days late .
" Penalty interest rates are unfair when applied retroactively , " according to Consumers Union .
" The restriction on penalty rates as applied to existing balances is the heart of the proposed rule .
This protection will do more than any other to return some balance and fairness to the credit - card marketplace . "
The group added that agencies should go further than the current proposals , with moves such as :
Ending all retroactive interest - rate increases , including for consumers who have had a 30 - day late payment
Limiting how high credit - card issuers can set " penalty " interest rates , and how long issuers can keep consumers at these rates
Prohibiting fees to pay a credit card by phone or Internet
Card issuers balk
Credit - card firms say restricting their ability to raise interest rates on existing balances would prevent them from adjusting the rate to reflect the higher risk of a consumer defaulting .
According to public notes of a May meeting with Fed officials and representatives from the ABA , Capital One , Bank of America and Citibank , the industry believes allowing issuers to raise rates only on new transactions is insufficient because the " greatest risk is on funds already extended . "
Further , industry groups said the proposal would lead issuers to raise rates and reduce the availability of credit for all consumers , rather than only for those who present the greatest default risk .
" Rather than prohibiting rate increases on existing balances , the final rule should permit such increases if consumers also have the ability to opt out of the increase by closing the account , " according to the public notes .
" If a rate increase accurately reflects the available market rates for that consumer , it is rational for a consumer to accept the increase and not opt out because , if they close that account , the consumer may not be able to get a lower rate with another card issuer . "
There are also proposals on credit cards in Congress , including a Credit Cardholders ' Bill of Rights from Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , that has been approved in committee .
That legislation aims to protect consumers against arbitrary interest - rate increases .
Echoing concerns about the agencies ' proposals , industry participants have said Maloney 's bill could be overly restrictive and force rate increases across the board by limiting the ability of lenders to adjust interest for customers who become riskier .
While proposals from agencies are helpful , some consumer advocates say it 's more important for Congress to enact legislation , which would be tougher to alter once the nation 's attention turns away from credit - card issues .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Consumer prices jumped at the sharpest rate in more than a quarter century during June , and consumers coping with soaring costs received their smallest income gain in a year , the government said on Monday .
The Commerce Department said personal incomes edged up 0.1 percent after rising 1.8 percent in May .
June ’s rise was the smallest since April 2007 , when income was flat .
On a year - over - year basis , prices rose 4.1 percent in June , up from 3.5 percent in May , for the biggest annual gain since May 1991 .
An inflation gauge tied to consumer spending jumped 0.8 percent in June , its steepest gain since a 1 percent rise more than 27 years ago , in February 1981 .
“ Household consumption surged in June but much of that went to purchase higher - priced food and energy , ” said Joel Naroff , chief economist for Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pa .
Separately , Commerce said June factory orders rose a bigger - than - forecast 1.7 percent after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent gain in May .
It was the strongest monthly gain in orders since last December and beat Wall Street economists ’ forecasts of a 0.7 percent rise .
But investors took their cue from the inflation data and concluded consumers were under growing pressure .
Stock prices fell modestly despite a drop in oil prices to $ 121.41 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The Dow Jones industrial average , which had turned positive briefly in the afternoon , ended down 42.17 points at 11,284.15 , while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.10 to 2,285.56 .
U.S. Treasury debt prices were lower on concern that inflation might erode the value of longer - term securities .
Benchmark 10 - year Treasury note prices , which move inversely to their yield , traded down 6/32 for a yield of 3.97 percent , versus 3.94 percent late Friday .
The tiny rise in June incomes came as government stimulus payments eased to $ 27.9 billion from $ 48.1 billion in May .
The department said that except for the stimulus payments , disposable incomes would have shrunk in June .
Incomes are under stress as job markets wither .
A report on Monday from employment consulting firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc. underlined the fact that employment prospects are likely to get worse .
It said planned layoffs at U.S. companies jumped 26 percent in July from June .
Planned layoffs totaled 103,312 in July , compared with June ’s 81,755 , the survey found .
Another report from the Conference Board , a private business group in New York , showed its Employment Trends Index edged down to 112.1 in July from a revised 113.1 in June .
That was consistent with last Friday ’s Labor Department report showing employers cut payrolls for a seventh consecutive month in July .

The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.6 percent in June after gaining 0.8 percent in May .
But after accounting for inflation , consumer spending , which fuels two - thirds of national economic output , fell 0.2 percent .
The core PCE index , which excludes food and energy items , was up 2.3 percent in June , the highest since a matching rate last December , after rising 2.2 percent in May .
That will worry Fed policy - makers , who are expected to keep the federal funds lending rate at 2 percent but to sharpen a warning about the potential risk from rising prices .
Such a warning would help signal that the next rate move likely will be upward , but the timing of it is uncertain as the Fed balances the necessity of controlling inflation with the need to avoid further hurting a limping economy .
“ Troubles with the financial sector , the economy , the U.S. consumer -- there ’s no quick fix , ” said Gail Dudack , chief investment strategist with Dudack Research Group in New York .
Doug Roberts , chief investment strategist with Channel Capital research in Shrewsbury , New Jersey , said the price data puts the U.S. central bank in a tough spot .
“ It means there is some inflation leaking into the system , and it puts the Fed in a difficult position , ” Roberts said .
“ But given the weakness of the economy , it means they ’re going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like . ”

The Web Developer and His Wife ( A Fairy Tale )
There was once a mom and pop kind of web shop selling auction products , making money through the affiliate commissions .
She ( the wife ) would do the design and customer contacts , and he ( the husband ) would do the programming of the site .
Mind you , they had no products of their own .
The only thing they could do to sell more was thus not to improve the products , but simply improve their site to bring in more people and do more sales .
Their sales , while affording them a small income to live by , were anything from impressive .
A couple of dozen people came by each day , only some of them buying .
Compared with other web shops they heard of they were a small fish in the sea .
The web developer knew about programming , alright , but did n’t feel his code did anything to attract more customers , and that ’s what counted , as his wife used to remind him .
One day , the web developer went to a web lunch meeting with a couple of people from the industry .
One man he met introduced himself to him as Leslie , a search engine optimization consultant .
The web developer had read an article or two about this business , but was n’t quite aware of the latest tricks of the trade , so the two chatted a bit and it was all interesting .
When the web developer returned home , he told his wife about the event , and the people he met .
Upon hearing of the search engine optimization consultant , the wife said , “ What , you did not ask for anything ?
Our site ’s not doing too well at all , go tell him we need his help . ”
It was good the web developer had exchanged cards with the consultant , because the next morning , he called him up to ask for help .
“ We talked it over and my wife convinced me we need your help ! ”
After Leslie received the credentials to connect and change the web shop , he immediately started the first adjustment , and called back an hour later .
“ Alright .
I made sure your page titles are all unique and meaningful to search engines .
Give it a while for the engines to rank you anew , then check your traffic , ” Leslie said , “ You ’ll find you ’ll have a couple of hundred people come by each day now . ”
After a while , the mom and pop shop was indeed buzzing with several hundred visitors each day , just like the consultant promised .
The web developer was quite happy , though his wife started complaining .
“ We have so much more potential .
Go check with the consultant again .
There should be more he can do for us . ”
Somewhat reluctantly , the web developer called the consultant again next morning .
“ Leslie , my wife says we need more optimization .
Anything you can do to help ? ”
The consultant thought for a bit , and then told the web developer to wait for his call .
Another hour or two later , Leslie called .
“ Alright , I optimized the navigation structure of your website ... some parts of your site were unreachable without script and plug - in support .
In some weeks , go check your traffic .
You ’ll find you ’ll have a couple of thousand people come by each day . ”
A few weeks later , the consultant ’s prediction had come true indeed .
With great joy the couple looked at their statistics and sales , which were n’t anything they ’d ever seen before .
After a while , the wife started contemplating again , though .
She came up with the idea that more had to be done still .
“ Go call your consultant again ... there must be more to this . ”
The web developer was n’t too convinced , arguing they had good sales already by now , but the wife kept pushing .
“ Alright , I ’ll call him , ” he said .
The next morning , the web developer gave Leslie a call .
“ Is there anything more you can do , Leslie ? ” he said .
Leslie was quiet for a bit .
“ We tried a lot already .
I ’m not sure there ’s anything else I can do . ”
The web developer said , “ Please help us , my wife thinks we still got potential . ”
Leslie asked for some time to consider , and called back later that day .
“ Hey , ” he said , “ There ’s something else I just did .
The product images of your site now have alternative texts , and users can tag the products now , too .
Go check back in some weeks , ” Leslie said , “ You ’ll find your traffic should be in the region of a couple of ten - thousand visitors a day . ”
To the amazement of the web developer and his wife , a couple of weeks later , their traffic got another enormous boost , and was in the region promised by the consultant .
The couple felt its time to open a bottle of wine for the occasion .
After sipping some glasses , the wife said , “ This is amazing .
Our sales are up through the roof .
Go give your consultant another call and ask him to optimize the site once more ... the sky ’s the limit ! ”
The web developer did not have a good feeling about it , but he would lose the argument in any way ... the two were a couple for too long for him to believe otherwise .
The next morning , with a bit of a headache from the second bottle of wine they had opened the evening before , the web developer dialed Leslie ’s number .
“ Yes ? ”
The web developer told Leslie , “ You are doing great work , and we want to thank you for that .
My wife asked you to keep going with your optimization .
Is there something you can do ? ” Leslie , in a dry voice , replied , “ Congratulations on your current traffic ... but I did everything I could already . ”
The web developer kept pushing Leslie .
“ We know there ’s more to this .
Could you give another optimization a try ? ”
Leslie told the web developer he would call back in some hours .
“ Hi again .
I made some adjustments .
I started repeating the keywords in the title , I bought some links for you on other websites , and I scraped descriptions for the products from the web and hid them below the page footer to have more keywords .
Go check your rankings in a couple of weeks , ” Leslie said , “ You ’ll find your traffic in the region of a couple of dozen daily visits again . ”
And that ’s the traffic the web developer and his wife get to this very day .

In what goes to prove that the British really do have a sense of humour , it has been recommended that a government committee be set up to protect Internet users from nasty people online such as abusive bloggers .
Hey you ….. f** king read this OK ?
I ’m putting a lot of damn work into this post !! :-)
The House of Commons Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee has just brought out their report on harmful content on the Internet and video games ( start reading it and I guarantee you ’ll fall asleep ) .
One of the recommendations being put forward is that a government watchdog be set up to monitor and “ police ” the net against all the baddies roaming about cyberspace .
This “ watchdog ” would operate an online ‘ code of practice ’ and – here ’s Joke Of The Month – order bloggers and social networking sites to take down offensive messages or photographs .
As Shane Richmond says here , “ good luck with that ! ” .
You might get a responsible site such as Facebook complying with such an order , but try giving such an order to a blogger .
He ’ll laugh , flip the cyber - finger and put the written order on Reddit or Digg .
The House of Commons seems to think the Internet is out of control .
It was only a few days ago that I wrote about the man who won 22,000 pounds at the High Court from a man who made a fake Facebook profile about him .
Plus you have all the usual problems such as illegal downloading .
So yes , in some ways we have problems on the net .
But do we need politicians trying to solve those problems by controlling our lives online 24/ 7 ?
I do n’t think so .
That just adds to the problems .
It does n’t solve them .
Do YOU think the Internet is getting out of control ?
The WSJ continues :
" AK 's chief executive is Aydan Kodaloglu , who , like Mr. Perle , has been involved with the American Turkish Council , an advocacy group in Washington . "
In fact , according to her bio on the AK Group website , Kodaloglu " serves as a Board Member of the American Turkish Council . "
The ATC , established by Perle et al as a " sister organization " to AIPAC , was often caught on wiretaps heard by former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds .
She described the ATC as a " front for criminal activity . "
The ATC has been under surveillance by both the FBI and the CIA since at least 1996 , inpart because of suspected involvement in drug trafficking , public corruption and involvement in a nuclear black market procurement ring , but more importantly because of involvement in the ' great game ' of the vast energy fields in Central Asia including Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan .
Investigative journalist John Stanton has written extensively about the connections between Central Asia and many of the ' associations ' in the US , including the ATC , and others such as the American Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce ( AACC ) and the US Kazakhstan Business Association ( UKBA ) .
Stanton argues that :
" While the ATC is an Association in name and in charter , the reality is that it and other affiliated Associations are the US government . " ( emphasis in original )
Perle 's partner in this enterprise , the AK Group is an " international consulting " group whose two other directors are Murat Akay who works " Turkish companies interested in establishing joint ventures with U.S. and Israeli enterprises " and Fehmi Sait Hurol who is " involved in various cultural activities and exchange programs between Turkey and the U.S. "
Interestingly , Sibel Edmonds has previously referred to " organization (s ) supposed to be promoting the cultural affairs of a certain country within another country " as front groups for organized crime networks .
Given the connections here , it would not be surprising if Mr Hurol and the AK Group are one such front group .
In my recent article " The Central Asia Islamization Cocktail : Mosques , Madrassas , Heroin & Terrorism " I quoted former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds describing the use of Turkish operatives and front groups to gain " control of Central Asia , particularly the oil and gas wealth , as well as the strategic value of the region . "
Sibel said :
" This started more than a decade - long illegal , covert operation in Central Asia by a small group in the US intent on furthering the oil industry and the Military Industrial Complex , using Turkish operatives , Saudi partners and Pakistani allies , furthering this objective in the name of Islam .
This is why I have been saying repeatedly that these illegal covert operations by the Turks and certain US persons dates back to 1996 , and involves terrorist activities , narcotics , weapons smuggling and money laundering , converging around the same operations and involving the same actors .
And I want to emphasize that this is " illegal " because most , if not all , of the funding for these operations is not congressionally approved funding , but it comes from illegal activities .
And one last thing , take a look at the people in the State Secrets Privilege Gallery on my website and you will see how these individuals can be traced to the following ;
Turkey , Central Asia , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia - and the activities involving these countries . "
Richard Perle is listed in Sibel 's State Secrets Privilege Gallery , and now we see him attempting to profit from his ATC connections by entering into an oil deal in Kazakhstan and Iraq , two decades after the WSJ first reported on the early phases of this criminal enterprise .
Meanwhile , the US media is mostly silent on the key issues again .
Despite even the most mainstream WSJ reporting on Perle 's recent dealings , including the importance of Turkey and the American Turkish Council , the rest of the media is asleep at the wheel , completely ignoring , or whitewashing , these important elements of the story .
Perhaps investigative reporter Joe Lauria said it best last week .
" Centrism is the philosophy of the American media - and that essentially backs the status quo , when you 're a centrist , and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that you 're allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then you 're transmitting these assumptions , and reinforcing every day that the US is really a functioning democracy , not even a representative democracy .
And as we know of course there are oligarchic interests that buy off Congress , that puts the person in the Whitehouse that they need ... "

Because face recognition is effortlessly achieved by people from all different cultures it was considered to be a basic mechanism universal among humans .
However , by using analyses inspired by novel brain imaging technology , researchers at the University of Glasgow have discovered that cultural differences cause us to look at faces differently .
Lead researcher Dr Roberto Caldara said : " In a series of eye - movement studies , we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces .
Specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in Westerners and East Asian observers .
We found that Westerners tend to look at specific features on an individual 's face such as the eyes and mouth whereas East Asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features .
One possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in East Asian cultures . "
Fixation biases for Western Caucasian ( WC - red ) and East Asian ( EA - blue ) observers are highlighted by subtracting WC and the EA Z - scored fixation distribution maps during WC and EA face learning , recognition and categorization by race .
Areas showing a significant fixation bias are delimited by white borders ( Zcrit > | 4.25 | ; p<.05 ) ; values near 0 indicate similar magnitude in fixation between observers from different cultures .
The results of the study , funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Medical Research Council , provide novel insights into why non verbal communication between people from different cultures is sometimes problematic , in an age where globalisation has dramatically increased interdependence , integration and interaction among people and corporations from all over the world .
Western societies are generally more individualistic , whereas East Asian societies are collectivistic ; Westerners appear to think and perceive focally and Easterners globally .
Dr Caldara continued : " By disproving the long - held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment , including the society in which we develop , is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population .

Several girls from Morton Ranch High School in Katy are the latest group of Texas cheerleaders gone wild .
Apparently , the girls got a little
with their hazing .
" When a girl ( censored ) in her pants and puts her pants on another girl 's head , that 's just disgusting , " a sister of one of the cheerleaders told Channel 13 .
Gross , cheerleaders .
Gross .
But those feisty Katy gals are hardly alone when it comes to bringing shame down on those who wave pom-pons in the Lone Star state .
Here 's a look at our Top 5 Disgraces to Texas Cheerleading :
5. Meltdown in Allen : First , a number of Allen High School cheerleaders were kicked off the team for drinking .
The incident sparked " a whirlwind of allegations that have threatened to shut down the team 's booster club , " according to a Dallas Morning News story ( ) .
Then an article was published that detailed the depression of a former Allen cheerleader who had used steroids in high school .
4. The Booty Bill : State Representative Al Edwards sponsored a bill in 2005 that would outlaw sexually suggestive cheerleading routines at school events .
Edwards told the Associated Press that such exhibitions lead to " pregnancies , high school dropouts , [ and the ] contraction of AIDS and herpes . "
The Texas House approved the bill , but it eventually died in the Senate .
As a result , there are still teen pregnancies in Texas .
3 . The Aggie Apology : During a pep rally for a football game against Penn State , a Texas A&M cheerleader made some disturbing comments about the opponent 's aging coach .
" Joe Paterno ’s on his deathbed and someone needs to find him a casket , " the yell leader said to the crowd .
The male cheerleader then said Penn State fans were ugly .
University officials later apologized for the comments .
2 . The Fab Five : Cheerleaders from a McKinney high school posted questionable photos on MySpace ( genius ) , and the girls were later described in a national magazine as a group of booze - crazed bullies – an " elite social clique that flagrantly flouted school rules but faced few sanctions . "
The made - for - television movie premiered Saturday on the Lifetime network .
1. The Channelview - Cheerleader - Murdering - Mom :
In 1991 , Wanda Holloway tried to hire a hitman to kill her neighbor .
Holloway apparently thought the murder would give her 13 - year - old daughter a competitive edge over her neighbor 's daughter in junior - high cheerleading try - outs .
Holloway was convicted and sentenced to 10 years , but she was released after six months .
Holloway 's story was turned into a couple movies , including HBO's The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader - Murdering Mom .
In all fairness , you can't really blame the cheerleaders for this one .

If Evelyn Waugh might be described as a social alpinist , clambering up one aristocratic pinnacle after another , George Orwell , his exact contemporary  both were born in 1903  was a spelunker , burrowing ever deeper into the seamiest depths .
Waugh loved the high life and made it his domain .
Orwell may not have loved the low life , but he valiantly tried to live it .
While Waugh was chatting up dukes and duchesses , Orwell was rubbing shoulders with coal miners and tramps .
Like a gourmet who sniffs out the most pungent cheeses , he had a nose for the sleazy side of life .
Wormwood was to him what Champagne was to Waugh .
Both men were , in their way , imposters , but they were imposters with a twist :
The deliberate ambiguities of their lives sharpened their appetite for the truth .
Click Image to Enlarge YALE COLLECTION OF AMERICAN LITERATURE , BEINECKE RARE BOOK AND MANUSCRIPT LIBRARY Evelyn Waugh
As David Lebedoff demonstrates in " The Same Man : George Orwell & Evelyn Waugh in Love and War " ( Random House , 279 pages , $ 26 ) , these two great writers , though seemingly incompatible , were more alike than either realized .
Orwell was tall and alarmingly gaunt , Waugh short and stocky ; Orwell was an atheist , Waugh a devout Catholic .
But both considered " modern life a terrible enemy , " as Mr. Lebedoff nicely puts it .
" Animal Farm " and " Brideshead Revisited , " published in the same year of 1945 , might seem worlds apart , and yet both are biting parables of disenchantment .
In their prose , too , each was a rare master .
" Good prose is like a window pane , " Orwell wrote ; Waugh was more lyrical , as well as funnier , than Orwell ( who pretty much lacked a sense of humor ) , but he too knew the virtues of transparency .
In the end , this was less a question of " style " than of integrity .
" The Same Man " uncovers few new facts , but that is n't really Mr. Lebedoff 's purpose .
By presenting Waugh 's and Orwell 's lives in parallel , he casts them in a new and sometimes surprising light .
Their differences come to seem strangely complementary , as though they divided the world between them with an equally savage eye .
Orwell was haunted by what he called " the golden country , " the world of his childhood in the years before 1910 .
He left that country when he entered St. Cyprian's , the ghastly school he described so unforgettably in his posthumously published essay " Such , such were the joys . "
It was at St. Cyprian 's that Orwell first experienced the grim attractions of sheer physical discomfort  the lumpy bed , the short rations , the taunting and the whippings  which he would seek so assiduously to reproduce in his later forays into the harsh world of the dispossessed .
But the school gave him , too , a keen sense of injustice and that , as he said , inspired everything he later wrote .
The world Waugh hankered after , the world of the " Bright Young Things " of the 1920s , turned to dust even as he grasped it .
He pursued and won the aristocratic Evelyn Gardner , a ditzy flapper who seems to have stepped straight out of a P.G.
Wodehouse novel , though Waugh must have cringed when she referred cuttingly to his father as " a complete Pinkle - Wonk . "
( The marriage fell apart over her infidelity . )
And even when Waugh tried to drown himself , he had to abandon the attempt because the sea was full of jellyfish .
In 1930 , the same year when Orwell began to publish , Waugh was received into the Catholic Church .
For him , baptism was truly a " second birth , " which reduced the cruel social niceties of " birth and station " to insignificance .
There were no dukes in the Kingdom of Heaven .
Waugh and Orwell were both desperate to escape their middle - class origins , though each in his own way  and own direction .
Waugh 's father , a publisher , was " in trade . "
In the glittering world Waugh aspired to , that represented an indelible stigma .
Richard Blair , Orwell 's father , had been a civil servant in India but played the gentleman in his long retirement , and Orwell went to fantastic lengths to shed the burden of that stifling respectability .
( Even the name " George Orwell " was a form of disguise : He had been born Eric Blair . )
Waugh was a notorious snob ; he felt that he belonged among the titled and that only a perverse accident of birth had deprived him of his place .
Orwell was also a snob , but a subtler one ; though he described himself as coming from the " lower - upper - middle class , " he did everything he could to baffle such distinctions .
In this he failed .
When he consorted with hoboes , he was immediately recognized by his Eton accent and addressed as " Sir , " much to his annoyance .
In the end , Waugh got it all : wealth and fame , marriage into the aristocracy , membership in the best clubs , a country estate where he played the squire .
But Orwell , too , and despite his best efforts , got it all .
In the last four years of his life , first " Animal Farm " and then " 1984 " showered him with royalties and brought worldwide acclaim .
The two met only once , in late August of 1949 .
Waugh , who had written Orwell an admiring note , visited him as Orwell lay dying .
It was an act of disinterested kindness on the part of a man known more for his rudeness than for his charity .
No record remains of their conversation that day .
But certainly , as Mr. Lebedoff shows , they were secret sharers , and they recognized it at the last .
Seen through the honest window pane of good prose , their worlds were neither high nor low but one and the same .
The deepest caves are linked by secret passageways to the peaks .

Gospel Legend Dottie Rambo Dies in Tour Bus Crash 1934 -2008
, a southern gospel singer and song writer , died on May 11 , 2008 as a result of injuries sustained in a fatal bus accident outside of Springfield , Missouri .
Rambo was traveling to a show when the tour bus they were traveling in struck a guard rail and hit an embankment .
Rambo was pronounced dead on the scene .
The accident was reportedly weather related .
Seven other people on the bus were injured in the wreck about two miles east of Mount Vernon on Interstate 44 , the Missouri Highway Patrol said .
They were hospitalized in Springfield with moderate to severe injuries , according to the patrol .
The 74 year old singer lived in Nashville , Tennessee and was on her way to a Mother 's Day performance in Texas at the time of the accident .
Her music is renowned internationally for its simple melodies and articulate qualities , covering themes such as heaven , Christian sacrifice and the born again Christian experience .
Rambo fell into hard times but made a big career comeback in 2002 .
She was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in 2006 .
Check out more photos below .
After publishing this story we received a well written and thoughtful comment by one of our readers that we want to share , as it enhances the story of Dottie Rambo .
Dutch academic Dr. Johan Pouwelse knows BitTorrent well , having spent a year of his life examining its inner workings .
Now , as the scientific director of the EU - funded P2P - Next team , Pouwelse and his researchers have been entrusted with € 19 million from the EU and various partners , and what they want in return is nothing less than a " 4th - generation " peer - to - peer system that will one day be tasked with replacing over - the - air television broadcasts .
P2P - Next is the largest publicly - funded team in the world working on such technology ( though plenty of researchers at Microsoft , IBM , and countless tiny startups are also racing to deliver a better P2P experience ) , and today the team launched a trial program designed to test its progress to date .
What sets the project apart from the traditional BitTorrent architecture is its focus not on downloadable video , but on live streaming .
Current BitTorrent implementations , focused as they are on offering easy access to downloadable content , are n't well suited to delivering live streaming TV across the Internet , but Pouwelse is convinced that this is the future .
There 's " no doubt that TV will come through the Internet in a few years , " he told Ars earlier this week .
Obviously , deployment of such a system depends on consumer electronics firms and broadcasters , but Pouwelse 's job is to make sure that the technology is ready when they are .
Currently , streaming solutions like YouTube and Hulu are generally based on a server model ; this does n't scale well without inflicting massive bandwidth costs on the broadcaster .
Downloadable video , already being experimented with by the BBC and NBC , can use P2P for distribution , but is only suited to after - the - fact viewing .
P2P - Next has 20 researchers working in Delft , plus more scattered across its various partners around the EU .
The team uses the BitTorrent core and is building its solution on Tribler , an open source Windows / Mac / Linux P2P client developed at the Delft University of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam .
The resulting " SwarmPlayer " software supports regular BitTorrent downloads , but it also adds support for video on demand and live video streaming to the BitTorrent protocol .
Pouwelse says that the team now needs a few thousand volunteers to hammer on the software in order to produce enough test data for the team to use as it continues to refine the code .
The trial setup streams some BBC test footage along with a live feed from an Amsterdam camera ( both worked fine in our testing ) .
For such a system to replace over - the - air TV on a continent - wide scale , significant bandwidth is clearly needed , especially when it comes to uploads .
But as symmetrical connections are tough to come by , Pouwelse says that his team is trying to live by the motto , " Do n't expect the world to change because of you . "
That means making the SwarmPlayer system work well even on existing ( and grossly asymmetrical connections ) .
Dr. Pouwelse
Broadcasters around the world are excited about the prospects for moving content online ; just check out Hulu and the BBC 's iPlayer for good examples of what these firms would like to do .
But ISPs are n't quite as thrilled about the prospect , largely because of 1 ) the size of online video files and 2 ) the economics of flat fees .
With so many ISPs around the world charging a flat monthly fee for service , encouraging massive bandwidth usage works against the their economic interest .
Pouwelse calls this a " clear economic problem , " but it 's one his team can do little about at the moment .
The project has funding through 2012 and has a host of problems to solve that should keep the researchers busy for as long as the money lasts .
Pouwelse acknowledges that " we 're making things that can be abused for piracy , " but points out that P2P - Next is really designed for the future of ( legal ) television .
One of the project goals is the creation of a fully server - less P2P architecture ; if that is achieved ( still a big " if " ) , Pouwelse hopes that the technology can be extended to projects like Wikipedia .
He notes that Wikimedia , which pays for the Wikipedia servers , simply can't afford to handle the peer production of high - def video , for instance .
But if a Wikipedia P2P plug - in means that the encyclopedia lives , server - less , in the cloud , then such new features become reality .
These are big dreams for a project that has yet received little press .
Pouwelse likes it that way , though ; you " only go out of stealth mode or do media hype once you really know your stuff , " he says .
Now that P2P - Next has a working trial of its BitTorrent streaming tech up and running , it 's time to spread the word .
State schools ' should teach pupils right to strike '
All State schools will be forced to offer lessons on the ‘ importance ’ of trade unions in a controversial plan to be put forward at next week ’s TUC conference .
Union leaders are urging Gordon Brown to put ‘ trade unionism ’ on the National Curriculum alongside compulsory subjects such as English and maths .
The 250,000 - strong Communication Workers ’ Union - formerly led by Health Secretary and potential Labour leadership challenger Alan Johnson - also wants State funding for union officials to visit schools and teach about the right to strike .
Striking tanker drivers outside Stanlow Oil Refinery in Cheshire - union leaders suggest strikes should be added to the curriculum
The demands , in a motion to next week ’s annual union congress at Brighton , will reinforce fears that union barons bankrolling the Labour Party are determined force the Prime Minister to lurch to the Left .
The union has donated £ 4.6 million to Labour since 2001 .
Its motion for the congress - which will be attended by Mr Brown - calls on the Government ‘ to increase opportunities to learn about trade unionism within the National Curriculum , including specific reference to our contribution to the development of a civilised society ’ .
Last night , the CWU - which represents workers at the Post Office as well as BT and the cable - television sector - did not deny that union chiefs hope the plan will be a recruiting sergeant .
But it added : ‘ We are not trying to brainwash children . ’
Pupils in France strike in support of a teacher who lost his job
The Tories seized on the proposal as proof of a new drive to get a beleaguered Mr Brown to agree to a raft of Left - wing policies - including demands at next week ’s congress from giant union Unite to scrap ‘ anti - trade union ’ laws and bring back secondary picketing .
Conservative chairman Caroline Spelman said : ‘ It risks taking the country back to the 1970s . ’
The latest Electoral Commission figures on party donations last week revealed that trade unions donated two thirds of Labour funding in the three months to June .
The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority said existing subjects already give ‘ scope for schools to cover the development of the union movement ’ .

Total borrowings from the Federal Reserve are presented in table 1a of the release .
Over much of 2008 , in order to maintain a level of total reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee 's objective for the federal funds rate , increases in borrowed reserves were offset through a nearly commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves , which was accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve 's holdings of securities and other assets .
The negative level of nonborrowed reserves was an arithmetic result of the fact that borrowings from the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities were larger than total reserves .

Would it tell us anything useful ?
Does it tell us anything useful about the current state of journal RSS feeds , or suggest areas for improvement ?
Let ’s find out .
It ’s as simple as locating the feed URL from your journal subscriptions , pasting it into Wordle and eyeballing the results .
Here ’s what came back for the 25 journals in my current subscription list .
Biochemistry
Not especially successful .
Items in the Biochemistry feed consist largely of dates / times , DOIs and author names , with no information regarding article content .
Bioinformatics
Rather better .
It ’s obvious at a glance that protein kinases and phosphorylated substrates are topical in this issue .
BMC Bioinformatics
Also very good .
We would guess straight away that analysis of proteomic data is a hot topic in this issue .
BMC Genomics
Another win for a BMC journal .
It ’s clear that gene expression is big in this issue .
Briefings in Bioinformatics
This graphic gives us a flavour of what the journal is all about : more methods and algorithms than insights into biology .
Nothing wrong with that , just saying .
Cell
Networks stands out , but then we see a lot of words with similar frequency ( most likely , one instance ) .
Not especially informative in this case .
Genome Biology
I ’d guess that this is a special issue on genes controlling circadian rhythm in Drosophila .
An excellent summary graphic .
Genome Research
Not too surprisingly genes , genomes and genomics feature strongly in this summary .
We also see an emphasis on mammals and an intriguing Mexican connection .
Genome Research in advance

This means you wo n't need to do the walk .
Just have a look at my photos below and you 'll know everything you need to know about this ( ad ) venture .
Please appreciate that on average I walked about 4000 steps for every photo . # 8D ) I 've written a piece about how to do long walks in general here , and here is some practical information regarding this particular trail .

The company plans to start clinical trials of its resveratrol mimic soon .
Sirtris ’s value to GlaxoSmithKline is presumably that its sirtuin - activating drugs could be used to treat a spectrum of degenerative diseases , like cancer and Alzheimer ’s , if the underlying theory is correct .
Separately from Sirtris ’s investigations , a research team led by Tomas A. Prolla and Richard Weindruch , of the University of Wisconsin , reports in the journal PLoS One on Wednesday that resveratrol may be effective in mice and people in much lower doses than previously thought necessary .
In earlier studies , like Dr. Auwerx ’s of mice on treadmills , the animals were fed such large amounts of resveratrol that to gain equivalent dosages people would have to drink more than 100 bottles of red wine a day .
The Wisconsin scientists used a dose on mice equivalent to just 35 bottles a day .
But red wine contains many other resveratrol - like compounds that may also be beneficial .
Taking these into account , as well as mice ’s higher metabolic rate , a mere four , five - ounce glasses of wine “ starts getting close ” to the amount of resveratrol they found effective , Dr. Weindruch said .
Resveratrol can also be obtained in the form of capsules marketed by several companies .
Those made by one company , Longevinex , include extracts of red wine and of a Chinese plant called giant knotweed .
The Wisconsin researchers conclude that resveratrol can mimic many of the effects of a caloric - restricted diet “ at doses that can readily be achieved in humans . ”
The effectiveness of the low doses was not tested directly , however , but with a DNA chip that measures changes in the activity of genes .
The Wisconsin team first defined the pattern of gene activity established in mice on caloric restriction , and then showed that very low doses of resveratrol produced just the same pattern .
Dr. Auwerx , who used doses almost 100 times greater in his treadmill experiments , expressed reservations about the new result .
“ I would be really cautious , as we never saw significant effects with such low amounts , ” he said Tuesday in an e-mail message .
Another researcher in the sirtuin field , Dr. Matthew Kaeberlein of the University of Washington in Seattle , said , “ There ’s no way of knowing from this data , or from the prior work , if something similar would happen in humans at either low or high doses . ”

WHY ARE WE ADDICTED TO OIL ?
“ Selfish behaviors are reward driven and innate , wired deeply into the survival mechanisms of the primitive brain , and when consistently reinforced , they will run away to greed , with its associated craving for money , food , or power .
On the other hand , the self restraint and the empathy for others that are so important in fostering physical and mental health are learned behaviors – largely functions of the new human cortex and thus culturally dependent .
These social behaviors are fragile and learned by imitations much as we learn language " .

INTRODUCTION
The majority of Peak Oil writing and discussion centers around the upcoming date of an all liquids peak and how steep the subsequent decline rate might be .
There 's also active debate on how to best replace the coming shortfall in fossil energy with renewable flows .
Fewer discussions are about relocalizing a global economy dependent on cheap transportation fuels , and how best to structure a world with lower density energy .
Yet fewer still delve into who we are , how we got here , and what and why we use energy , and seemingly want more of it every year .
Essentially , most of our energy conversations , at conferences , schools , institutions , and the blogosphere , focus on the means , and not the ends .
The ends have generally remained unquestioned .
There seems to be an implicit assumption that worldwide energy demand will continue to grow something akin to a natural law , and that solutions should focus on ways to increase supply and / or efficiency of energy .
But in an economic system based on self - interest on a finite planet , the true drivers of demand will need to be better understood beyond the microeconomic mantra " price will change behavior " .
This post examines our own history on the planet , outlines how the ancient - derived reward pathways of our brain are easily hijacked by modern stimuli , and concludes that in very real ways , we have become addicted to the ' consumptive behaviors ' linked to oil .
" Traditional " drug abuse happens because natural selection has shaped behavior regulation mechanisms that function via chemical transmitters .
Just as an addict becomes habituated to cocaine , heroin or alcohol , the ' normal person ' possesses neural architecture to become habituated via a positive feedback loop to the ' chemical sensations ' we receive from shopping , keeping up with the joneses ( conspicuous consumption ) , pursuing more stock options and profits , and myriad other stimulating activities that a large social energy surplus provides .
In order to overcome addictions , it is usually not enough to argue about which year the drug supply is going to begin its decline .
It 's a better path to understand the addiction , admit it before one hits rock bottom , and either begin the cold turkey process or become addicted to something else .
HUMAN HISTORY AND EVOLUTION
Timeline of human evolution - Source : Dr. William Stanton ( Click to enlarge )
To understand how and why our demand for oil and energy services has continually increased , and what behavioral constraints we might encounter if an energy decline occurs , it will be necessary to review ' some ' evolutionary history .
For those familiar with biology it will be a quick refresher - for those not , it should n't be too painful , ( but maybe a little ) .
All life on earth originated from the same single celled organisms .
We are used to thinking in terms of months , years , decades , etc. so it 's difficult to grasp millenia let alone millions or billions of years .
As can be seen in the above graphic , human history takes up a very small % of the time of life on earth and an even smaller % of the time since Earth was first formed .
We share a great deal of our genes with simpler organisms such as mice or wheat , and considerably more with dogs or other primates like chimpanzees .
Of the genes actually used , or ‘ conserved ’ , we share more – over 60 % with fruit flies and over 96 % with chimpanzees .
We are all kin , somehow traceable back several billion years to the origin of life on earth .
I am not only related to my colleague Euan Mearns , but to a lesser extent his dogs , and still lesser extent , the plants in his yard .
Charles Darwin ’s maxim of evolution : " Multiply , vary , let the strongest live and the weakest die " has gradually , but definitively shaped who we have become as humans today .
This theme has been expanded by modern biological research to focus less on ' the strongest ' in the physical sense , and more on the concept of ' relative fitness ' ( or inclusive fitness ) , that those adaptations that are successful in propelling genes , or suites of genes , into the next generation will have outcompeted those that were deleterious or did not keep up with environmental change .
Evolution does not have ' purpose ' , it just combines time ( a great deal of it ) with the substrate of life and hones and culls as eons pass .
A male spider is sometimes consumed by the female after they have sex .
This obviously is a bummer for the male spider , but can be explained by evolution if the nutrition provided for his offspring ( carrying his genes ) outweighs the sum of his future mating opportunities .
Thus the spider , when presented with a ' hot female spider ' is not ' calculating ' the odds of being eaten vs. how many nutrients are in his body , but performing a behavior that was successful for his ancestors , and therefore chemically ' felt right ' .
( spiders share many of the same neurotransmitters as humans , e.g. serotonin and dopamine ) .
All of life has arrived in 2008 by some path like this , including and especially human beings .

Man split off from the rest of the apes about 5 - 6 million years ago ( my ) .
It is estimated that our earliest hominid ancestors , the australopithecenes were the first to walk upright .
Can you imagine the excitement and attraction to the first few pairs of these creatures that started walking on two legs instead of four ?
Must have been like having the shiniest muscle car on the block !
Tens of thousands of generations of various stages of human ancestry passed in Africa , the big cats and environmental hazards keeping hominids close to or under local carrying capacities , with no real need to migrate .
Genetic analysis shows that the intelligence that distinguishes us as homo sapiens is of comparatively recent origin- emerging perhaps a mere 200,000 years ago , compared to the millions of years that the hominid line has been in evolution .
Wildly oscillating climate and the introduction of language were likely strong influences on the increase in hominid brain size during the past 1 million years .

Modern humans ultimately emerged around 125,000 years ago and remained in small hunter gatherer tribes until the invention of agriculture around 12,000 years ago .
It was not until we started ' spending ' our ' ancient sunlight ' bank account in the late 1700s that our population began its moonshot trajectory .
The average American today uses around 60 barrel of oil equivalents of primary energy each year - depending on the assumptions this represents hundreds of annual energy ' slaves ' , for each one of us .
The Triune Brain ( Mclean ) viewed through the lens of natural selection ( Click to enlarge )
NATURAL SELECTION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE MODERN BRAIN AND BEHAVIOUR
I have ( briefly ) gone through evolution of the triune brain several times on TOD before .
The various layers and mechanisms of our brain were built on top of eachother , via millions and millions of iterations , keeping intact what ' worked ' and adding on what changes and mutations helped the pre-human , pre-mammal organism incrementally advance .
Brain structures that functioned poorly in those ancient environments are no longer around .
Gradually , organisms became more complex and the human neocortex developed on top of , and in complex synergy with , the older brain structures of the limbic system and the primitive reptilian core .
We are , all of us , descended from the best of the best at surviving and procreating , which in the environment of privation and danger where we endured the most ' iterations ' of our evolution , meant acquiring necessary resources , achieving status , and possessing brains finely tuned to natural dangers and opportunities .
In our modern environment , it is the combination of pursuit of social status and the plethora of fun , exciting / novel activities that underlies our large appetite for oil .
STATUS
Status has historically been a signaling mechanism that minimized the costs of competition , whether for reproductive opportunities , or for material resources .
If you place 10 chickens in an enclosure there will ensue a series of fights until a pecking order is established .
Each bird quicly learns who it can and cannot beat and a status hierarchy is created , thus making future fights ( and wastes of energy ) less common .
Physical competition is costly behavior which requires energy and entails risk of injury .
Status is a way to determine who one can profitably challenge and who one cannot .
In our ancestral environment , those men ( and women ) that successfully moved up the social hierarchy ladder , ' improved ' their mating and resource prospects .
The ones at the bottom of the status rung did not mate at all .
In modern humans , status is defined by what culture dictates – popularity , physical looks , wealth , fast cars , political connections , etc.
Biologists have shown that historically , the primary way to reliably demonstrate one 's ' quality ' during courtship is to display a high - cost signal - e.g. a heavy and colorful peacock 's tail , an energy expending bird - song concert , or a $ 100,000 sports car .
Only these costly " handicap " signals are evolutionarily stable indicators of their producer 's quality , because cheap signals are too easy for low - quality imitators to fake ( Zahavi and Zahavi , 1997 ) .
In this sense ' waste ' has been evolutionarily selected for !
It follows that the larger a cultures energy subsidy , the more opportunity there is for ‘ status badges ’ to separate from traits actually correlated with basic needs ( e.g. strength , intelligence , adaptability , stamina , etc . )
In many societies , achieving cultural success appears to lead to biological ( genetic ) success .
Though ‘ what ’ defines status may be culturally derived , status hierarchies themselves are part of our evolved nature .
Our ancestors at the bottom of the mating pecking order , ceteris paribus , are not our ancestors .
This is all outlined in the evolutionary theory of sexual selection .
NOVELTY
The brain utilizes about 40 % of all available genes and consumes over 20 % of our caloric intake .
When it comes to self preservation , nature is especially parsimonious in shaping the brains survival systems to become incredibly efficient .
Incremental biases in how our brains recognize , process , and react to the world around us either contributed to our survival and thus were carried forward , or died out .
Of major importance in the millions of years of hominid adaptation was the concept of ' salience ' , which is related to curiosity , novelty and reward seeking .
Salience is noticing what is important , or different ; what contrasts from the usual .
All of the various precursor hominid species to modern man evolved under conditions of privation and scarcity , at least until 20 - 30,000 years ago , ( which is too short of time to meaningfully impact millions of years of neural sculpture ) .
Salience recognition is part of the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway .
This system of neurons is integral to survival efficiency , helping us to instantly decide what in the environment should command our attention .
Historically , immediate feedback on what is ' new ' was critical in avoiding danger as well as procuring food .
Because most of what happens around us each day is predictable , processing every detail of a familiar habitat wastes brain energy .
It also would slow down our mental computer so as to become a deadly distraction .
Thus our ancestors living on the African savanna paid little attention to the stable mountains on the horizon but were alert to any change or movement in the bush , on the plains , or at the riverbank .
Those more able to detect and quickly process ' novel cues ' were more likely to survive and pass on their genes .
Indeed , modern experimental removal of dopamine receptor genes in animals causes them to reduce exploratory behavior , a key variable related to inclusive fitness in animal biology .
Novelty also played a role in mating selection itself as well .
Perceptual biases ( e.g. greater responsiveness to large , bright , high - contrast , loud , rhythmic , or novel stimuli ) can influence the direction of sexual selection and the details of courtship displays ( e.g. Endler , 1992 ; Ryan & Keddy - Hector , 1992 ) .
Small differences between species in these perceptual biases could lead to large differences in the courtship displays they evolved .
We are instinctually geared for individual survival - being both reward driven , and curious .
It was these two core traits which the father of economics himself , Adam Smith , predicted would be the drivers of world economic growth in " Wealth of Nations " .
According to Smith , uniting the twin economic engines of self - interest ( which he termed self - love ) and curiosity was ambition – " the competitive human drive for social betterment " .
Charles Darwin , about 70 years later after reading Adam Smiths “ Theory of Moral Sentiments ” recognized the parallel between the pursuit of wealth creation and the competition for resources that occurred among species .
More recently , books by Peter Whybrow " ( American Mania ) " and Michael Shermer ( The Mind of the Market : Compassionate Apes , Competitive Humans , and other Tales from Evolutionary Economics ) have suggested that our market system of allocating resources and ' status ' has been the natural social culmination for an intelligent species finding an abundance of resources .
But , as we shall soon see , the revered Scottish philosopher could not have envisioned heli- skiing , Starbucks , corporate jets , 500 foot yachts , and many other stimulating and pleasurable objects that his modern descendants compete for and so easily become acclimated to .
( I doubt he ever conceived of Peak Oil either ) .

THE MODERN MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINERGIC REWARD SYSTEM
" Americans find prosperity almost everywhere , but not happiness .
For them desire for wellbeing has become a restless burning passion which increases with satisfaction .
To start with emigration was a necessity for them : now it is a sort of gamble , and they enjoy the sensations as much as the profit . ”
Alexis DeTocqueville , Democracy in America 1831
An explosion of neuroscience and brain imaging research tells us that drugs of abuse activate the brain ’s mesolimbic dopamine reward system , the neural network that regulates our ability to feel pleasure and be motivated for “ more ” .
When we have a great experience – a glance from a pretty girl , a lovemaking romp in the woods , a plate of fresh sushi , hitting 777 on a $ 5 machine , catching a lunker pike , watching a sunset , hearing a great guitar riff etc. – our brain experiences a surge in the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine .
We feel positively charged , warm , ‘ in the zone ’ and happy .
After a while , the dopamine gets flushed out of our system and returns to it 's baseline level .
We go about our lives , looking forward to the next pleasurable experience .
But the experience has been logged onto our brains limbic system , which in addition to being the center of pleasure and emotion , holds our memory and motivation circuitry .
We now begin to look forward to repeat performances .
This desire has it 's beginnings outside of conscious awareness .
Recent brain imaging research shows that drug and sexual cues as brief as 33 milliseconds can activate the dopamine circuitry , even if a person is not conscious of the cues .
Maybe that ’s why they hide artistically shaped sexual images in advertisements for whiskey and such .
Historically , this entire system evolved from the biological imperative of survival .
Food meant survival , sex meant survival ( of genes or suites of genes ) , and additional stockpiles of both provided success relative to others , both within and between species .
There was a discrete payoff from waiting hours for some movement in the brush that signaled ‘ food ’ , or the sound of a particular bird that circled a tree with a beehive full of honey , etc .
Our pattern recognition system on the Pleistocene would have been a grab - bag of various environmental stimuli that ‘ excited ’ our brains towards action that correlated with resources ( typically food ) .
In sum , the brain ’s reward pathway records both the actual experience of pleasure as well as ensures that the behaviors that led to it are remembered and repeated .
Irrespective of whether they are ‘ good ’ for the organism in the current context– they ‘ feel ' good , which is the mechanism our brain has left us as a heritage of natural selection .
THE ( VERY IMPORTANT ) MECHANISM OF HABITUATION
HELLO
CLICK HERE FOR AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE !
YOU MIGHT EVEN BE A WINNER !!!
Habituation ( and subsequent substance abuse and addiction ) originates in the mechansims of how we learn .
Dopamine responses comply with basic assumptions of formal learning theory .
Learning depends crucially on the discrepancy between the prediction and occurrence of a reward .
The importance of such prediction errors is derived from Kamin ’s blocking effect ( 1969 ) which postulates that a reward that is fully predicted does not contribute to the learning of a stimulus or action , even when it has been repeatedly paired with the stimulus or action .
This is conceptualized in the Rescorla - Wagner learning rules , according to which learning advances only to the extent to which a reinforcer is unpredicted and slows progressively as the reinforcer becomes more predicted .
Dopamine activation has been linked with addictive , impulsive activity in numerous species .
Dopamine is released within the brain not only to stimuli an organism finds rewarding but also to those events which predict rewards .
It has long been known that two groups of neurons , in the ventral tegmental and the substantia nigra pars compacta areas , and the dopamine they release , are critical for reinforcing certain kinds of behavior ( Dayan and Montague , 1997 ; Glimcher , Dorris and Bayer , 2005 ; Schultz , 2002 ) .
Wolfram Schultz measured the activity of these dopamine neurons while thirsty monkeys waited for a tone which was followed by a squirt of fruit juice into their mouths .
After a regimen of fixed , steady amounts of juice , the volume of juice was doubled without warning .
The rate of neuron firing went from about 3 per second to 80 per second .
But after several trials , as this new magnitude of reward was ' habituated to ' , the firing rate returned to the baseline rate of 3 firings per second .
The monkeys had habituated to what was coming .
The opposite happened when the reward was reduced without warning .
The firing rate dropped dramatically , but then returned to the baseline rate of 3 firings per second .
( Gowdy 2007 )
The first time we experience a drug or alcohol high , the amount of chemical we ingest often exceeds by an order of magnitude the levels of naturally occurring neurotransmitters in our bodies .
No matter how brief , that experience is stored in our neural homes for motivation and memory - the amygdyla and hippocampus .
Getting drunk with your friends , getting high on a ski-lift , removing the undergarments of a member of the opposite sex for the first time –all initially flood the brain with dopamine alongside a picture memory of the event linked to the bodys pleasurable response to it .
As such we look forward to doing it again , because we want to repeat that ' feeling ' .
But in a modern stimuli - laden culture , this process is easily hijacked .
After each upward spike , dopamine levels again recede , eventually to below the baseline .
The following spike does n’t go quite as high as the one before it .
Over time , the rush becomes smaller , and the crash that follows becomes steeper .
The brain has been fooled into ‘ thinking ’ that achieving that high is equivalent to survival ( even more so than with food or sex which actually do contribute to survival ) and the ‘ consume ’ light remains on all the time .
Eventually , the brain is forced to turn on a self defense mechanism , reducing the production of dopamine altogether – thus weakening the pleasure circuits ' intended function .
At this point , an ' addicted ' person is compelled to use the substance not to get high , but just to feel normal – since ones own body is producing little or no enodgenous dopamine response .
Such a person has reached a state of anhedonia , or inability to feel pleasure via normal experiences .
Furthermore , being addicted raises the risk of having depression ; being depressed increases the risk of self - medicating , which then leads to addiction , etc. via positive feedback loops .
Habituation and eventual addiction to a substance ( the graph indicates endorphins , which relate to opiates , but similar patterns exist for dopamine ) ( Click to enlarge )
Essentially , when exposed to novel stimuli , high levels of curiosity ( dopamine ) are generated , but it is the unexpected reward that causes their activation .
If I order a fantastic array of sushi and the waiter brings me my check along with a breath mint , I am going to have a plunge in dopamine levels which will create an immediate craving for food .
It is this interplay between expected reward and reality that underlies much of our behavioral reactions .
Ultimately , repeated use of a dopamine generating ‘ activity ’ causes tolerance .
Withdrawal results in lower levels of dopamine and continuous use is required to keep dopamine at normal levels , and even higher doses to get the ‘ high ’ levels of initial use . ( 1 )
Taking this further , the Rescorla - Wagner learning function ' shape ' seems to be common in life - kind of like the 80/20 rule .
Here we see it with happiness and GDP .
There is something important here ....
ON GENES AND CULTURE
“ Most of these people in the nations of the United States are extremely eager in the pursuit of immediate material pleasures and are always discontented with the position they occupy .
They think about nothing but ways of changing their lot and bettering it ...
An American will build a house in which to pass his old age and sell it before the roof is on .
He will plant a garden and rent it just as the trees are coming into bear .
He will take up a profession and leave it , settle in one place and soon go of elsewhere with his changing desire .
Yet at the end of the year crammed with work he has little spare leisure .
His restless curiosity goes with him traveling up and down the vast territories of the United States . ”
Alexis DeTocqueville , Democracy in America1831 !
All humans share the same general neurocircuitry that can be hijacked by access to intense and pleasurable stimuli .
But some are more at risk than others , both genetically , and as is increasingly apparent in the fast paced OECD world , by culture .
Just having a genetic predisposition to a certain condition does n’t assure that the condition will happen .
In order to ‘ switch on ’ , certain genes must interact with or be triggered by environmental factors .
If that does n’t happen , the addiction will not occur .
Temperament and character are the 2 key components that comprise individual personality .
Their distinction is inherent when we separate instinct and inborn habits from free will and what we learn .
' Character ’ emerges over time through self - awareness - it is learned behavior shaped largely by the family and the culture we grow up in .
" Temperament ' on the other hand , is an inborn pattern of emotional style that starts to unfold in childhood and persists into adult life .
Temperament is strongly heritable , accounting for approximately 40 % of behavioral variance in twin studies .
Professor Robert Cloninger has developed a system of evaluating human temperament and character and their variations .
Utilizing a large database from over two decades of research , Cloninger has integrated objective psychological testing of individuals with the growing knowledge of the brains anatomy and chemical messenger systems .
His research confirms that patterns of temperament are heritable , but further suggests that different personality patterns reflect variation in the genetic programming of neurochemical communication .
The common behavioral patterns of temperament appear to reflect the balance of activity among the dopamine , norepenephrine and serotonin systems ( the 3 information superhighways linking the ancient brain stem to the neocortex ) .
His research has identified behavioral clusters that describe 4 major temperament styles - the poles of which are ' harm avoidance ' ( shy ) and ' novelty seeking ' ( bold ) .
Cloninger 's analysis integrates common patterns in which we interact with others and how we respond to social challenges .
Briefly , individuals with harm avoidance temperament are generally shy and anxious in the face of social competition .
( Research in humans and other primates suggest this pattern is associated with a dominance of serotonin in the brain messenger systems ) .
On the other hand the temperament clusters of reward dependence , persistence , and novelty seeking – the 3 behaviors that overlap with curiosity – are linked to the activity of the brains reward system as well as to the dopamine and norepenephrine superhighways .
When we are ' curious ' and try some new snack , play a new video game , write a good rebuttal to a Stuart Staniford post , or meet somebody we really like , it is our dopamine reward pathways that are activated , reminding us to repeat the experience .
This pleasurable reinforcement begins a positive feedback loop – a reward and an individuals response to and dependence on that reward is a large part of what defines ones type of temperament .
Individuals who are fascinated by novelty and risk are less anxious and fearful when confronted with uncertainty or danger .
On the flip side , they are also easily bored , ( for example by reading long oildrum posts with low ' graphic / text ' ratios ) .
The association of exploratory behavior across species ( genetic ‘ conservation ’ ) with the D4 dopamine receptor complex suggests that this circuitry has played an important role in mammalian adaptation to changing environments throughout evolution .
It is this novelty seeking temperament that is important in understanding exploratory ( migratory ? ) behavior .
This temperament style appears to reflect genetic differences in the dopamine reward system of the brain .
Those scoring high on this scale are bold and curious individuals , who enjoy exploration and challenge and are risk takers with thick skins in social situations .
CURIOUS GEORGE DISCOVERS AMERICA
“ In Europe , we habitually regard a restless spirit , a moderate desire for wealth and an extreme love of independence as great social dangers , but precisely these things assure a long and peaceful future in the American republics ” - Alexis DeTocqueville " Democracy in America " 1831 ( this guy was a freakin ' prophet ! )
“ America was set apart in a special way .
It was put here between the oceans to be found by a certain kind of people .
A beacon of hope to the rest of the world ” Ronald Reagan – A Time for Choosing 1984
An invasive species will be defined as “ an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health ” - Executive Order 13112 signed by Bill Clinton in February 1999
The fact that patterns of temperament are strongly heritable has obvious implications for understanding the restless curiousity and risk taking that is so characteristic in American culture .
98 % of all humans who have ever lived on the planet never moved from their birthplace .
( 9 ) Beginning in Africa , as few as 500 humans migrated northward into Europe and Asia , which began the population seeding of the rest of the world around 120,000 years ago .
Fast forward to the 17th - 19th centuries , a relatively empty America was rumoured to be a land of opportunity and full of resources .
Typical migrants to our shores were self - selected and for a variety of individual reasons , chose to come here ( with the exception of slaves ) .
Whether it was to escape oppression , to better ones - self and family with the promise of riches , or to quest for new lands and experiences , America has become a melting pot of immigrants in the past few centuries .
If only 2 % of the worlds population is migrant , then it logically follows that Americans , in their risk to start life anew are a self selected subgroup of that émigré population .
At the time of its first Census in 1790 , the United States was home to a population of just over 4 million people .
Today , 98 % + of our 300 million residents were either born elsewhere and migrated here or born into families that migrated to the United States in the last three centuries .
( The other 2 % being Native Americans ) .
This phenomenon is not confined to first generation migrants – over 20 % of Americans change their residence every year and this trend has been in place since the 1950s .
(1)
There has been considerable genetic testing on a suite of alleles accompanying the D dopamine receptor , which in some tests showed a high correlation with novelty / impulsivity , especially at the DRD4 polymorphism .
Lack of funding ( and perhaps lack of political correctness ) has precluded the obvious hypothesis tests to see if Americans really are more ' genetically ' wired for novelty / impulsivity .
Though the brain sciences have made major advances in the past decade , they are still in their infancy in what they might accomplish .
Parsing behaviors down to one particular allele , though possible , does n't seem too likely .
However , the premise that Americans are genetically / culturally more prone to risk taking , impulsivity , novelty - seeking , and therefore addiction , is the main theme of the excellent book " American Mania " ( a book which I 've heavily borrowed from in this post ) by Dr. Peter Whybrow , who heads up the Semel Neuroscience Institute at the UCLA Medical School .
I find this thesis , especially given my personal history on Wall Street and interaction with people around the world , a compelling one .
AMERICA AND ADDICTION
Americas Addictions - Time Magazine July 2007 ( Click to enlarge )
It would be pretty hard to be addicted directly to oil .
Its toxic , slimy and tastes really bad .
But it can be quite possible to become addicted to the energy services that oil provides .
Within a frenetic culture of ' more ' , it is no wonder we have so many addicts .
By instinct we are geared for individual survival - curious , reward - driven and self - absorbed – modern technology has now become a vector for these cravings .
Material wealth and the abundant choices available in contemporary US society are unique in human ( or animal ) experience – never before in the history of our species have so many enjoyed ( used ? ) so much .
High density energy and human ingenuity have removed the natural constraints on our behavior of distance , time , oceans and mountains .
For now , these phenomenon are largely constrained to developed nations - people living in a hut in Botswana or a yurt in Mongolia cannot easily be exposed to the ' hijacking stimuli ' of an average westerner , especially one living in a big city in the United States , like New York , or Los Angeles .
Many activities in an energy rich society unintentionally prey on the difference between expected and unexpected reward .
Take fishing for example .
If my brother and I are out on a lake fishing and we get a bite - it sends a surge of excitement through our bodies - what kind of fish is it ?
how big is it ?
etc .
We land an 8 inch perch !
Cool .
A minute later we catch another 8 inch perch - wow there must be a school !
After 45 minutes of catching nothing but 8 inch perch , our brain comes to expect this outcome , and we need something bigger ( or at least different ) to generate the same level of excitement - so we will likely move to a different part of the lake in search of ' bigger ' or ' different ' fish .
( though my brother claims he would never tire of catching fish no matter the size or species I think he 's exaggerating ) .
But given the above mechanics of the habituation process to ' real ' drugs , one can understand how some initially benign activities can morph into things more destructive .
Weekly church bingo escalates to $ 50 blackjack tables ; Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition , several years down the road results in monthly delivery ( in unmarked brown packaging ) of " Jugs " magazine or cybercams locked in on some bedroom in Budapest ; youthful rides on a rollercoaster evolves into annual heli - skiing trips , etc .
Video game sales just reached $ 18 billion annually ( and are getting more violent by the year - Lord of Rings type stuff is too mild .. )
Globalization and cheap travel has enabled an explosion of internet matchmaking , where 10s of millions of singles ostensibly seek a mate , but all too often get habituated to the actual ' seeking ' process itself ( unexpected reward writ large ) .
Many sites now cater to short term encounters ( adultfriendfinder has 21 million members ) .
So what started off with a small yearning for flowers and companionship often ends up with exposure to more and more extreme stimuli .
Sometimes ignorance really is bliss .
The world wide web is especially capable of hijacking our neural reward pathways .
The 24/7 ubiquity and nearly unlimited options for distraction on the internet almost seem to be perfectly designed to hone in on our brains g- spot .
Shopping , pornography , gambling , social networking , information searches , etc. easily outcompete the non-virtual , more mundane activities of yesteryear .
Though becoming addicted to more ' information ' does n't use a great deal of energy relatively speaking , it , repetitive use can be highly addictive , though psychiatrists in different countries are debating whether it is a ' true ' addiction .
For better or worse , the first things I do in the morning is a ) check what time it is , b) start the coffee machine then c ) check my email , to see what ' novelty ' might be in my inbox .
Bills to pay , and emails from people who are not important or interesting , wait until later in the day , or are forgotten altogether .
Then I walk the dog .
At least I do n't own a television .
Novelty .
Novelty .
Novelty .
Always something new in the inbox ... ( well , an email from Vladimir Putin would certainly qualify ) .
Do n't you just WANT to click on some of these ?

As you read this the World Series of Poker is going on in Las Vegas , with upwards of $ 200,000,000 in total prize money .
There has been an explosion of young people playing poker , many of them dropping out of college to do so .
Many young players have made millions and gone broke numerous times before their 21st birthday .
With numerous 19 - 22 year olds making millions per year , this is one modern cultural aspiration that seems to be trumping ' solar installer ' or ' micro - hydro engineer ' .
Once exposed to playing 4 - 6 high stakes online poker games simultaneously ( and winning ) , planting potatoes or backpacking in Yosemite become the neural equivalent of a baked potato ( with nary salt nor butter ) .
Regarding sex , there are few healthy men on the planet today that in social settings do not respond , outwardly or otherwise , to the attention of a high status , attractive 20 - 30 something woman .
This is salient stimuli , irrespective of the mans marital status .
But here is one example of where nature and nurture mesh .
Despite the fact that 99 + % of our history is polygynous , modern culture precludes men from running around pell mell chasing women - we have rules , laws , and institutions such as marriage .
Though habituation to various ' things ' may at least partially explain the 60 % + divorce rate in modern society .
The grass is greener and such ...
Seriously , the entire brain and behavior story is far more complex than just one neurotransmitter and its reward pathway .
But the pursuit of this particular ' substance ' is clearly correlated with anxiety , obesity , and general increasing of conspicuous consumption in our society .
( 1 ) That dopamine is directly involved is pretty clear .
Parkinsons Disease is a condition where dopamine is lacking in an area of the brain necessary for motor coordination .
Here is a fMRI photo of dopamine levels of a Parkinsons patient vs. a control .
The Parkinsons drug , Mirapex , increases dopamine levels in that area of the brain , but since pills are not lasers , it also increases dopamine in other areas of the body , including ( surprise ) the reward pathways .
There are numerous lawsuits currently pending by Parkinsons patients who after taking the drug , developed sex , gambling , shopping and overeating compulsions ( Journal of Neurology Sep 2005 ) .
Food is also an area that can trick the brain .
We evolved in situations where salt and sugar where rare and lacking .
When we taste Doritos or Ben and Jerry 's Chocolate Fudge Brownie , our reward pathways say 'yes yes - this is good for you !!' , at the same time our ' rational ' brain reminds us of the science showing obesity comes from eating too much of the wrong type of foods .
For most ( myself included ) my rational brain is batting about .250 or less .
Americans lead the world in obesity ( Percentage of population with Body Mass Index > 30 SOURCE - OECD FACTBOOK 2005 – ISBN 92-64-01869-7 – © OECD 2005 ) .
Since we are exporting our culture ( via the market system ) to developing countries , it is no surprise that China is following in our footsteps .
From 1991 to 2004 the percentage of adults who are overweight or obese in China increased from 12.9 % to 27.3 % .
(8 ) Furthermore , we can become habituated to repeated presentation of the same food type - we quickly get tired of it and crave something different .
We like variety .
In food and in other things .
( Side note : recently I 've been cooking for myself - I cook too much and share the leftovers with my dog .
He now shuns his regular food ( unless he 's starving ) .
Apparently dogs can experience food habituation as well ( which is bad for me - he is now a perpetual beggar ) .
IMPULSIVITY , DISCOUNT RATES , AND PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE
As has been previously written about on theoildrum.com here , the economic term for impulsivity is steep discount rates , which means we weight the present predominantly more than the future when making decisions ( consciously or otherwise ) .
( I am beginning to think this phenomenon is really the ecological maxim , The Maximum Power Principle , integrated with culture )
The discounting model of impulsiveness ( Ainslie , 1975 ) implies that discount rates are positively correlated with impulsivity .
On average , heroin addicts ' discount rates are over double those of controls .
Furthermore , in tests measuring discount rates and preferences among opium addicts , opioid dependent participants discounted delayed monetary rewards significantly more than did non -drug using controls .
Also , the opioid - dependent participants discounted delayed opium significantly more than delayed money , more evidence that brain chemicals are central to an organisms behavior and money and other abstractions are secondary .
Subsequent research has also shown that deprivation of various addictive substances even further steepens a subject ’s preference for immediate consumption over delayed gratification .
This grid summarizes some of the latest research statistics on addiction to various substances that cause us to choose small short term rewards over larger long term rewards .
( source - Intertemporal Choice - Chablis et al. - The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics , 2007 ) .
Even if we are not snorting cocaine or binge drinking on a Tuesday night , in a world with so much choice and so many stimulating options vying for our attention , perhaps more and more of us are addicted to ... time .
THE FALLACY OF REVERSIBILITY A.K.A " THE RATCHET EFFECT "
Source - " The Overspent American " - Professor Juliet Schor ( Click to enlarge )
Though we might claim otherwise , we always want more .
Many desires have negative feedbacks however .
I can only eat about 3 cheeseburgers before my stomach sends a signal to my brain that I am full - if I ate 4 or 5 my stomach and esophogus would eventually fill up so that I could n't physically eat another one .
This is not so with virtual wealth , or many of the " wanting " stimuli promoted in our culture .
In ongoing research Professor Juliet Schor of Boston University demonstrates that no matter how much we ( the study was on Americans ) make , we always say we'd like to make a little more the following year .
Similar research , by UCLA economist Richard Easterlin followed a cohort of people over an 16 year period .
( he is the eponymous coiner of the " Easterlin Paradox " which points out that average happiness has remained constant over time despite sharp rises in GDP per Capita . )
The participants were asked at the onset to list 10 items that they desired .
( e.g. sports car , snowmobile , house , private jet , etc. )
Over the 16 year study , all age groups tested did acquire some / many of the things they originally desired .
But in each case , their desires increased more than their acquisitions .
This phenomenon is termed the " Hedonic Treadmill " .
Clearly mansions and sports cars do n't inherently elicit lifelong cravings on their own .
Culture plays the integral role in linking our neural scaffolding to consumptive pursuits .
Modern brain research indicates that we get a higher buzz by pursuing the type of ' status ' symbols ( in this study , cars ) that society attaches value to .
In my opinion , this behavior is at the heart of the Peak Oil problem , and gives me less confidence that we are just going to ' tighten our belts ' when the energy situation gets a little tougher and more expensive .
That is unless , we change what we want MORE of .
In evolution , ( and other fields ) , this is known as the Ratchet Effect , where once a certain level is reached there is no going backward , at least not all the way .
An example of this is obesity - as we get fatter the body creates more adipocytes ( adipose tissue ) .
But this system does n't work in reverse - even though we can lose some of the weight gain , the body can't eliminate these new cells - they are here to stay - thus the ratchet effect .
In biology , animals will expend more energy to defend freshly gained territory .
In humans , related concepts in economics are the endowment effect and loss aversion - the pain from losing ( money ) is greater than the pleasure of gaining it .
ARE LEGAL DRUGS " BETTER " OR " WORSE " ?
Our gradual acclimation to substances and activities that hijack our reward system is increasingly forcing us ( collectively ) to live in the moment .
Unwinding this cultural behavior may prove to be difficult .
The sensations we seek in the modern world are not only available and cheap , but most are legal , and the vast majority are actually promoted by our culture .
If the rush is tied to something that society rewards we call it ambition , if its attached to something a little scary , then we label the individual a ‘ risktaker ’ and if its tied to something illegal – then they are an ‘ addict ’ or substance abuser .
So it seems culture has voted on which drugs are ' good ' to pursue .
This is ( obviously ) a hypothetical chart , so I will follow it with a hypothetical question .
What would society look like if Starbucks dispensed marijuana and Home Depots were giant opium dens ?
Would we be better off , collectively ?
( Caffeine is akin to horizontal drilling of oil - it maximizes current production at the cost of higher future depletion ) .
Drug addiction is defined as " the compulsive seeking and taking of a drug despite adverse consequences " .
If we substitute the word ‘ resource ’ for ‘ drug ’ , have we meaningfully violated or changed this definition ?
That should depend on the definition of ‘ drug ’ – " a substance that a person chemically comes to rely upon " is standard .
Proximally , a drug is a physical substance , but ultimately , it is any activity or substance that generates brain chemicals in a pattern we habituate to .
Thus , it is not crude oils intrinsic qualities we crave but the biochemical sensations we have become accustomed to arising from creatively using its embodied energy .
Take stock trading for example .
Neuroscience scans show that stock trading lights up the same brain areas as picking nuts and berries do in other primates , suggestive of what our ancestors must have ' felt ' as they tried to increase resources .
In my opinion , there are three ( at least ) ' objectives ' one gets from investing / trading in the market , in varying degrees in different people .
Neoclassical economics suggests it is the efficient allocation of capital to the company that rewards the investor for risk .
I think people trade for a ) money / profit ( to compete / move up the mating ladder ) , b) to be ‘ right ’ , and c ) for the excitement / dopamine of the unexpected nature of market movements .
While they are not mutually exclusive , it is not clear to me which objective dominates , especially among people who have already attained infinite wealth ( technically their annual expenses divided by the t- bill rate ) .
This I witnessed first hand for many years as my billionaire clients on average were less ' happy ' than the $ 30 k a year clerks processing their trades .
More exciting lives perhaps , but not happier .
The rich wanted ' more ' because they were habituated to getting more - it's how they kept score .
Unless you inherit it , you do n't get to be a billionaire if you are easily satisfied .
Old brain - new choices .
Regarding compulsive shopping , if this were a rational process , and our choices were influenced only by need , then brand name t- shirts would sell no better than less expensive shirts of equal quality .
The truth is that many shopping decisions are biased by corporate advertising campaigns or distorted by a desire to satisfy some competitive urge or emotional need .
Payless Shoe Stores has just set up a website campaign for women who love shoes , etc .
If the statistic in www.storyofstuff.com stating that 99 % of what we buy ends up as trash within 6 months is correct , then we really have created an entropic machine ( I do n't know how to check that source - but the video is worth watching ) .
The peak ' brain cocktail ' is the moment we decide to buy that new ' item ' .
After a brief euphoria and a short respite , the clock starts ticking on the next craving .
Not shown on the chart would be many activities falling in the lower left part , both legal and low energy : gardening , reading books , playing games with the family , going for hikes , thinking , sleeping , playing sports , etc .
Also not shown might be the hugest dopamine rush of them all - attaining high political office .
Unlike heroin and opium which work on opiate receptors and ' satiate ' the user , dopamine is a ' wanting ' drug .
One more orgasm , one more pair of shoes , one more million in the bank , one more social approval , one more check of my email , one more political notch , etc .
I wonder what a brain scan of Hillary Clinton during a debate would look like compared to someone on cocaine .
I 'm guessing pretty similar .
( fMRI machines , in order to function , have enormous magnets , and thus only work in lab settings - they can not be made to be mobile in the forseeable future , but that would be fun )
Also missing on the graphic is violence .
Recent research shows that the dopamine we ( males ) receive from aggression rivals that of food or sex .
This is not encouraging .
DOPAMINE ON A FULL PLANET
The Global Carrot for 6.6 billion and growing is What and Whom ? ( Click to enlarge )
So what are the drivers of economic growth and resource depletion ?
The " aspiration gap " is economic - speak for the relative fitness / status drive towards who / what is at the top of the status hierarchy .
Envy is a strong motivator .
A friend recounted that when he last visited Madagascar , the 5th poorest nation on earth , the villagers huddled around the one TV in the village watching the nations most popular TV show ' Melrose Place ' , giving them a window of desire into Hollywood glitz and glamour , and a beacon to dream about and strive for ...
More recently , a prince in the royal family of U.A.E. paid $ 14 million for a vanity license plate " 1 " .
" I bought it because I want to be the best in the world . " said Khouri , whose family made its fortune in real estate .
What message do the kids watching TV in U.A.E receive ?
The above graphic is a hypothetical normal distribution of world population .
Modern developed nations are competing for profits , yet we are doing so smack in the face of declining energy surplus .
When a new child is born , he has all the genetic material he will ever have - from that moment his genes interact with the environment indicating what to compete for .
What will a child born in the 21st century ' learn ' to compete for ?
Historically , we have always pursued social status , though status been measured in dramatically different ways throughout history .
Currently , most people pursue money , though some compete in other ways - politics , knowledge , etc. Modern fMRIs show artificial cultural objects associated with wealth and social dominance elicit activation in reward - related brain areas ( Erk 2002 ) .
Thus , the large looming problem is that the Chinese ( and other rapidly developing nations ) do n't just aspire the wealth of average Americans - they want whole hog to be millionaires .
The only way this can happen is that after basic needs are met , the definition of ' millionaires ' changes ( or I suppose , central banks could dramatically increase the money supply )

PEAK OIL AND LEAVING LAS VEGAS
I recently returned from a weekend trip to Las Vegas .
On the plane home , full of disconsolate , exhausted zombies , it struck me that Vegas is a microcosm of modern society in several important ways .
1 ) On the plane ride to Vegas , everyone was giddy , sociable , even manic , anticipating all kinds of unexpected reward in the Babylon of 21st century .
Once you get off the plane , its like you are on one extended 72 hour search for unexpected reward .
Ca n't find it here ?
Let 's go there .
Craps , horses , poker , women , golf , swimming , booze , craps , massage , sleep , craps , women , sushi over and over .
It 's society compressed into a weekend .
2 ) I probably know more about the issues surrounding Peak Oil than 99 % of people on the planet .
Yet among the bright lights , freely flowing drinks , friendly company , and non -stop excitement , not only did I forget about our pending date with a global oil peak , but for about a 12 hour period , under influence from friends , Peak Oil actually seemed impossible .
There is no way all this glitz and glamour could end - the vitality in the casinos was viral .
The availability heuristic , and other psychological phenomenon were very powerful indeed to thus anesthetize a peak oil curmudgeon like myself .
( 2 hours back at the cabin reading the Drumbeat straightened me right out ) .
My point is that few will believe until events force them too .
I 've known this for a while , but this little personal vignette sealed the concept .
3 ) There is a shared mythology in America ( and spreading ) that we can each enjoy fame and opulence at the top of the social pyramid .
Even though everyone ( I think ) knows the odds are stacked against them - they have hope they will be the big winner .
78 % of Americans still believe that anybody in America can become rich and live the good life ( 15 ) .
The reality is that the longer one gambles in Vegas , the higher the odds are stacked against you .
In our economic system , not everyone can be Donald Trump by definition - there are not enough resources - it's the carrot of potential reward that keeps people working 50 hours a week until they retire at 65 .
All can not be first .
All can not be wealthy , which makes capitalism , on a finite resource planet not dissimilar from a Ponzi scheme .
4 ) Vegas may be a canary in our societal coalmine , as the just - in - time delivery model has to run just right in a desert community importing food , water and energy .
Already , there are studies showing there may not be enough water for flat consumption by 2020 , let alone enough for planned expansions and a new airport .
The Mirage may one day be aptly named .
Given what I 've outlined in this post , perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a ' new gambler ' ( or child ) is to hit 777 or win big on his / her first experience - its sets up a mental feedback system via the amygdyla and reward pathways that raises expectations in the future , thus making the allure of one armed bandits , etc. difficult to just walk past .
A similar setpoint may occur with skiing , buying a new car , making ones first million , or any number of socially sanctioned activities using energy ....
CONCLUSIONS
This essay has explored some of the underlying drivers of resource depletion and human consumption : more humans competing for more stuff that has more novelty .
The self - ambition and curiosity that Adam Smith hailed as twin engines of economic growth have been quite effective over the past 200 years .
But Adam Smith did caution in " Moral Sentiments " that human envy and a tendency toward compulsions , if left unchecked , could undermine the empathic social relationships that would be essential to his economic model and the successful long term operation of free markets .
Smith lived before the creation of the megacorporation , before 24 hour global commerce and before stock options and NASCAR .
Amidst so much choice and wealth , we are discovering some uncomfortable facts backed up by modern neurobiology that confirm Adam Smiths fears .
In an era of material affluence , when wants have not yet been fully constrained by limited resources , the evidence from our modern American experiment suggests that humans have trouble setting limits on their instinctual cravings .
And our rational brains have an equally hard time acknowledging this glaring fact .
This essay has likened the chemical sensations we receive from many socially available stimuli in our fast paced world to the same neural patterns that occur with illicit drugs .
" Addiction " can mean many things to many people .
I am quite certain a psychiatrist would refuse to diagnose any of us with ' an oil addiction ' .
But perhaps not an ecologist .
The literature from economics as well as psychology and neuroscience suggest that when an addict ( broadly defined ) is exposed to higher prices , conventional economic theory will not hold .
Since the rational actor model has now been thoroughly disproven so as to almost be an economic footnote , this should not come as a surprise .
In conclusion , dear reader , I have thrown a great deal of information your way .
I hope it is clear ( er ) that we have both biological and cultural constraints on our behavior and that finding the next billion barrels may or may not prove to be a good thing .
If you have read this far , I doubt you have serious addiction issues .
An addict would likely not have had the patience to read 8,000 + words ..;-)
SOME FINAL PHILOSOPHICAL MUSINGS
1 . If we do manage to increase societies aggregate energy gain , this surplus will be split amongst the entrepreneurs and consumers and ripple through the economic system like a deposit in a fractional banking system .
More stuff to become habituated to .
Thus , What Price Progress ?
2 . I have come to the conclusion that we cannot change our penchant to want more .
We can only change how we define the ' more ' .
Put aside Peak Oil and Climate Change for the moment .
We have it in us to ‘ nudge ’ how our brains get ‘ hijacked ’ .
We can choose to go for a jog / hike instead of sending 10 emails and websurfing , we can choose to have a salad instead of a cheeseburger , we can choose to play a game or read a story with our children instead of making 5 business phone calls , etc .
But most of these choices , in my opinion , require prior planning .
Because ‘ at the moment ’ , our brains will fall into the neural grooves that modern culture has worn into them .
It takes conscious plans to change these behaviors , and for some this will be harder than for others ( for me very hard ) .
But in choosing thusly , we are likely making ourselves as individuals healthier and happier , with the positive externalities of using less energy and slowing and eventually reversing the societal stimulation feedback loop .
3 . It sounds corny , but the ratio Dopamine / Energy may be a better choice to maximize than many economic formulas .
The brain is clearly not as simple as just a single one of over 100 neurotransmitters - but in our culture , dopamine looms large .
However , in addition to maximizing Dopamine / Energy , we know that we will want MORE in the future .
So we have to build that in to the equation , and only aspire to maximize Dopamine / Energy , e.g. keep the first derivative positive but second derivative negative ( or zero ) .
Perhaps maximizing == >( Unexpected Reward - Expected reward ) / Entropy might be a more complex but loftier goal .
Food for thought .
4 . In the 1970s resource concerns spawned analyses on net energy ( Odum ) , limits to growth ( Meadows et al ) and criticism of the neoclassical economics model ( Georgescu - Roegen , Daly ) , but the planet was still comparatively empty , and cheap resources still abounded .
However , things are really starting to change quickly - the global rich are at least beginning to realize the implications of peak oil , even if they do n’t believe it is imminent .
They will gradually understand that a GINI coefficient rising towards 1.0 and accelerating ecosystem destruction will not leave them or their children much of a place to enjoy their money .
This means there is a real possibility of educating local , regional and national leaders ( likely via the rich and powerful ) towards a different system .
It 's now in their interests .
5 . In my opinion , the United States has a monumental ( though long odds ) opportunity to shift the worlds carrot away from conspicuous consumption .
As ostensible leaders of the free world , we need to set an example that others will follow .
The only thing standing in the way is the overwhelming pursuit of profits as our end goal , despite the rationale for the economic system being continually debunked .
At a minimum there needs to be government regulation of some areas of the market .
Costs that have long been externalized need to be accounted for .
Perhaps a system where the market allocates and votes on ' luxury items ' while government manages the commons and basic goods ?
I do admit that Europe is a good deal further than we are on many of these fronts .
My fear is that Americans ' ingenuity ' will focus entirely on replacing our energy supply with lower EROI renewables , and thus not only miss the larger prize , but win the booby prize .
( An upcoming post will be on The Tragedy of the Energy Investing Commons )
6 . The planet is finite : there is only so much land , oil , water , dolphins and gold .
No matter how efficiently we use our resources , if there are more users competing for more stuff , we will eventually run out of goods .
However , information is limitless .
We can explore , research , study , and learn as much as we wish .
With the caveat that 8 hours of reading be balanced by hearty physical exercise , information is one thing we can compete for that uses few resources .
Look at theoildrum.com as one example .
Vernadskii dreamt of a system he called “ noosphere ” – a biosphere driven by human intellect , spirituality , knowledge , and understanding .
This has a shot .....( but then , what would we DO with the information ...?
7 . There is anecdotal evidence that the typical american diet high in processed starches and sugar robs us of our baseline serotonin - the zen master of brain neurotransmitters .
Lack of serotonin makes us more susceptible to cravings / behavioural changes and throws the reward machinery out of whack .
Food we buy / eat is available at stores and restaurants because a ) it is profitable b) it is convenient and c ) it tastes good .
I suspect that future changes in diet towards more vegetables and less processed food might improve our collective addictions / impulsivity .
However , this is speculation as the data is sparse .
8 . If we can be neurally hijacked , what does it suggest about television , advertising , media , etc ?
The majority of the neuro - economic sources I used in writing this post were a byproduct of studies funded by neuromarketing research !
How does ' rational utility ' function in a society where we are being expertly marketed to pull our evolutionary triggers to funnel the money upwards ??
9 . In retrospect , this has not been a post about Peak Oil .
From the perspective of perpetual wants in an existing system , Peak Oil may only appear to be a crisis , but it might also be the needed catalyst for change .
We , collectively , are in charge , but need to look at the real big picture , with science , hope and community .
10 Addiction is analog , not digital .
Each of us has something akin to an addictive ' rating ' on a scale of 1 - 10 ( 1 being totally non-addictive and 10 being full - on addict - valuing only the next few minutes in their lives over any future rewards / punishments . )
The higher the cultural composite sum of these ratings the harder it will be to access long term positive decisions .
Reducing our addictive behaviours ( collectively ) will make it easier to face the situations likely during an energy descent .

Introduction
We , at Cyber frame have served in industry for more than 21 years .
From the time of its inception in the year 1995 , till now and to the days to come , we strive and work on a motto “ to level up the bar of our targets , break the old records , and present a brand new exclusive concept ” .
This way we challenge our self and work harder each day for getting the desired results .
Lord Smith said coastal erosion was his agency 's most difficult issue Some parts of the British coastline are so badly eroded they are not worth protecting from the sea , the new head of the Environment Agency has said .
Lord Smith of Finsbury said work was already under way to identify areas of the east and south coast most at risk .
He told the Independent that the UK faced hard choices over which coasts to defend and which to leave to the sea .
Lord Smith said parts of north - east Norfolk and Suffolk were in the most immediate danger of collapse .
' Huge issue '
The former culture secretary said it would not be possible to save all coastal homes from sea erosion , but that the agency would do its " level best " to protect places where there were significant numbers of properties .
" This is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency , " he said .
We are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast
Lord Smith
Environment Agency chairman
" We know the sea is eating away at the coast in quite a number of places , primarily - but not totally exclusively - on the east and south coasts .
" It 's a particularly huge issue in East Anglia , but in quite a number of other areas as well . "
Lord Smith called on the government to assist families whose home will be lost , as ministers would not always be able to rely on insurance companies to cover them .
' Particular threats '
He added : " We are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast .
It would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms .
" We will publish next year details of the work that 's been done , where we think the particular threats are , where we think there is current defence in place .
" We will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option . "
Lord Smith also said the government was not taking the environment seriously in several major proposals .
These included a third runway at Heathrow , a new generation of coal - fired power stations , and the Severn barrage tidal energy project .

When a Novelist Holds an IPO
When rogue author Tao Lin set out to write his second novel , he realized he would need to raise some capital to sustain himself .
So he has decided to sell shares in 60 percent of the U.S. royalties for his forthcoming , as - yet - untitled book .
Not only will the scheme defray his financial risk if the book does poorly , but Lin hopes that shareholders will promote his book out of self - interest .
Dubner has wondered if public libraries could be created from scratch today .
If the novel were invented today , would they all use Lin ’s startup model ?

Man Was Outside When His Partner Killed Store Clerk
The state of Texas is scheduled to execute Jeffery Lee Wood by lethal injection tonight , even though he did not actually kill anyone .
Wood was sitting in a truck outside a convenience store when an accomplice shot and killed a cashier in a botched robbery 12 years ago .
If the execution moves forward , Wood , 35 , will become only the eighth person to be put to death as an accomplice since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976 , according to the Washington - based Death Penalty Information Center .
More than 1,100 people have been executed during this period .
The executed accomplices do not include those who were put to death for hiring someone to commit murder .
“ It is very , very rare , ” said David Fathi , U.S. program director for Human Rights Watch .
“ This is a case that illustrates everything that is wrong with the death penalty in Texas . ”
The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles recently voted 7 to 0 against clemency .
Gov. Rick Perry ( R ) can issue a reprieve , but experts said that is unlikely in the face of such a strong decision by the board .
Wood has lost challenges to his conviction in state and federal courts , and his lawyers recently filed a motion for a stay of execution to pursue an “ incompetency to be executed ” claim .
A spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general said the office would not comment on the Wood case .
Since the case began , lawyers and family members have argued that Wood was mentally unfit for trial .
They say he has a severe learning disability , is easily coaxed into doing what he is told and is delusional .
Wood signed a statement confessing to the crime .
At first , a judge agreed with the lawyers , sending Wood to a hospital for evaluation .
A jury later determined that he could stand trial .
Wood ’s crime fell under the Texas “ law of parties ” statute that allows an accomplice to be charged with a capital crime if his actions contributed to a murder .
On Jan. 2 , 1996 , he and a roommate , Daniel Reneau , drove to a gas station and convenience store in Kerrville , Tex .
Court records show that Wood and Reneau had talked with Kriss Keeran , a cashier , and another employee about staging a fake robbery .
As Wood waited outside , Reneau entered the store and the plan unraveled .
Reneau shot Keeran in the forehead with a . 22 - caliber handgun .
Wood and Reneau fled with a safe .
The prosecutor in the case called the crime a cold and premeditated homicide in the trial that convicted both men .
Reneau was executed in 2003 .
“ It certainly does n’t look good , ” said Richard Dieter , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center .
“ The governor ca n’t grant clemency without a recommendation for it .
We ’ve seen cases get stayed literally at the eleventh hour , so it ’s not over . ”
Death penalty opponents argue , however , that Texas has applied its law - of - parties statute too loosely .
A 1982 decision by the Supreme Court appears to support such a view .
The court decided 5 to 4 in Enmund v. Florida that imposing the death penalty on a defendant when a murder was committed by others was a violation of the Eighth Amendment if the defendant “ does not himself kill , attempt to kill , or intend that a killing take place , or lethal force will be employed . ”
But a second 5 to 4 decision by the court appears to support Texas .
In Tison v. Arizona , a case in which family members broke their father out of prison and then killed a family of four that they flagged down to help repair their getaway car , the court said that the death penalty could apply if it could be shown that the defendant was a “ major participant ” in the felony and acted with “ reckless indifference to human life . ”
“ That ’s why I think this issue may come back to the Supreme Court , ” Dieter said .
“ This is an area that needs some clarification . ”
Texas , which has put more people to death since 1976 than any other state , executed three men as accomplices between 1985 and 1993 .
Steven Hatch of Oklahoma was the last person executed as an accomplice for his role in the torture and shooting of a family and the slaying of the parents .
Hatch died in 1996 , but his accomplice , Glen Ake , who shot the family members , is serving a life sentence after cooperating with police and prosecutors .
In July , Dale Leo Bishop was put to death in Mississippi for the 1998 kidnapping and beating of Marcus Gentry .
Bishop held the 22 - year - old victim while another man , Jessie Johnson , bludgeoned him with a carpenter ’s hammer .
Dieter said the Bishop case was not included on his organization ’s list of accomplice executions “ because we made a decision that this was n’t the same kind of thing . ”
“ He held the man while another man killed him , ” Dieter said .

So the Footsie has tumbled again .
Forgive me for asking , but where are the economists ?
As the nation approaches recession , an entire profession seems to have vanished over the horizon , like conmen stuffed with cash , and thousands left destitute behind .
They said recessions were over .
They told politicians to leave things to them and all would be fine .
Yet they failed to spot the sub - prime housing crash , and now look at the mess .
When I studied economics we were told we would be masters of the universe .
Ours was not a dismal but a noble science .
It had harnessed the verities of maths to those of human behaviour and would go on to conquer politics .
Rampant recession would go the way of hyperinflation .
Like leprosy and cholera , they were epidemics that modern medicine had rid from our shores .
It did not matter if the economists were welfare Keynesians such as Myrdal , Robinson and Galbraith or free - marketeers such as Marshall , Friedman and the Institute of Economic Affairs .
All were " social scientists " .
They claimed to have cracked the DNA of economic exchange , to have turned the base metal of money into political gold .
We believed them .
We believed the Keynesians until we slumped into stagflation .
We believed light - regulation capitalists such as Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown , that they could convert boom - bust into an upward sloping plane of glory .
We believed the Bank of England when it said that , in its hands , inflation was dead and prosperity eternal .
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive - and an economist .
If Britain were now in the grip of bubonic plague , there would be all hell to pay from some profession or other .
An " influential " Commons committee would be summoning the chief medical officer and subjecting him to the third degree .
Why no national rat strategy ?
Why no crash inoculation ?
Why so many planning delays on plague pits ?
The espionage pundits were likewise castigated for wrongly leading the nation to war against Iraq , for giving dud professional assessments on fallacious intelligence .
The architectural profession has taken the rap ( very occasionally ) for the grotesque failures of public housing in the 1970s .
Climate scientists may yet be damned for the costly lunacy of new energy sources , such as wind turbines and biofuels .
Yet economics is a Teflon profession .
A quarter of a century ago 364 practitioners wrote a letter denouncing the policies of the then Thatcher government as having " no basis in economic theory " .
They were wrong in fact and wrong in judgment .
Thatcher 's policies laid the groundwork for a strategic shift in the underpinning of British prosperity .
There was no inquiry , no hearing , no peep of retraction or remorse .
Since then economists have flooded into government ; there were roughly a thousand at the last count .
What do they all do ?
Despite reports of demoralisation in the Treasury , that department remains the home base for public sector management through financial aggregates .
During the Blair / Brown era it has held government in thrall .
Economic managers have always claimed credit for the success of Brown 's Treasury regime .
They have espoused quantifiable outputs , targets and delivery indicators .
They invented the celebrity consultant and the maxim that only what measures matters .
Above all , the economics profession ( and its house journal , the Economist ) was ecstatic when Brown delegated monetary control to the Bank of England .
This was supposed to isolate the economy from political pressure , subcontracting the regulation of interest rates and markets .
Today we are older and wiser .
Controlling the agencies of credit has proved beyond the finest professional minds in the game .
Where now are the effortless pundits of the Treasury and the Bank ?
Where now the gilded ones of Moody 's and Standard & Poor 's , credit raters to the mightiest in the land ?
They should have stuck to goose entrails .
Alan Greenspan , former chief of the US Federal Reserve Board and a Brown adviser , is unrepentant .
He recently declared that " anticipating the next financial malfunction ... has not proved feasible " .
There is nothing so unseeing as a wronged economist .
The Bank of England 's apologias over Northern Rock have been protests that regulation is a mess and government indecisive .
When muck hits fan , economists always blame politicians .
They would have some justice if they did not take credit when things go right .
I was always uncomfortable at the overselling of economics as a science , when it is rather a branch of psychology , a study of the peculiarities of human nature .
Its spurious objectivity , manifest in its ridiculous love affair with maths , induced a " Jupiter complex " , a conviction that scientific certainty , applied with enough rigour to any problem , triumphs over all .
Economic management is and always will be about politics , about the clash of needs and demands resolved through the constitutional process .
The delegation of interest rates to the Bank of England worked when it ran in parallel with politics , but not any more .
Now that reflation seems urgent for recovery , the system is biased against common sense , yet no politician dare tell the Bank to cut rates and risk inflation .
The newest craze is " nudge " economics , from the Americans , Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein .
They put the subject firmly among the behavioural sciences - if not the arts .
Human actions are too mysterious and unpredictable to be liable to quantification and modelling .
They are responsive to what the academic Paul Ormerod called " butterfly economics " .
Nudge steers , but does not order or plan .
This requires knowledge of the working of markets , incentives , expectations and panics .
But converting micro-economics into macro has always been a dangerous game .
Much has been made of the success of Spain 's dirigiste banking regulators in putting security before runaway profit .
But this was a triumph of politics over economics .
Greenspan may laconically remark that " we can never have a perfect model of risk " , but we can have alertness to risk and we can have caution .
Economics has long traded on being a science when it is not .
In this it is like war .
For a third of a century since the 1976 IMF crisis it has enjoyed great influence over British policy .
Now it has met its Waterloo and a little humility would be in order .
Once again economics must be rescued by that true master of all things , politics .

We libertarian opponents of IP sometimes perplex IP advocates and leftists .
There ’s an analogy here to the way libertarians , and especially anarcho - libertarians , are treated by mainstreamers .
The press does not know what to do with libertarians , for example .
They typically use “ libertarian ” to denote civil - libertarian ACLU types ; while libertarian thinkers and institutions are often described as “ conservative . ”
And “ anarchy ” is usually associated with chaos , bomb - throwing , or leftist anarchists–rather than with anarcho - libertarianism , which is the only genuine form of anarchism .
( See my What It Means To Be an Anarcho - Capitalist . )
There is a common assumption in society that “ intellectual property ” is a legitimate type of private property right .
Thus socialists and leftists oppose IP because of their hostility to private property rights , capitalism , corporatism , and industrialism .
Thus , many IP opponents are leftist , anti-capitalist types ( for example , Richard Stallman and Eben Moglen are , IIRC , at least somewhat leftist [ if I am mistaken in this , I stand corrected ; in any event I would welcome email providing backup / correction , or examples of other leftist anti-IP arguments ] ) .
Likewise , many libertarians accept the fallacious notion that IP is a type of property , and thus support IP because they support property ( and because many well - known libertarians , such as Ayn Rand , were strong advocates of IP ) .
Conversely , those who innately or independently oppose IP , are often classified as leftists , or even believe themselves to be leftists ( I believe a similar phenomenon explains why the press tend to be left ; they naturally tend to be pro-freedom of speech and freedom of press , but accept the mainstream dichotomy that if you are for personal liberties , you are against economic liberties , and vice - versa ; they do not understand that economic and personal liberties are essential and complement each other ) .
The truth is that the only principled case against IP is the libertarian one , as I ’ve argued in my Against Intellectual Property .
The problem with IP is that it undermines and infringes on private property rights : it lets some person gain rights of control over the property already owned and acquired by others ( for example , a patent or copyright gives the holder a veto right over certain uses others might put their own property ( their bodies , paper , raw materials ) to ) .
To oppose IP is to uphold private property rights–libertarian rights .
To oppose IP while also supporting socialism is a confusion .
And more than this .
IP is not possible without legislation ; legislation is not possible without the state .
And conversely : with a state , you always get legislation ; and legislation always leads to a proliferation of bad laws ( see my Legislation and the Discovery of Law in a Free Society ) .
What this means is that not only is your case against IP weakened if you do not adopt libertarian principles and reasoning to undergird it .
But if you support the state at all–if you are not an anarcho - libertarian–then you do not really oppose IP .
If the state exists , it will legislate , and it will probably enact IP laws , along with plenty of other bad laws .
So , if you support the state , you really ca n’t complain about IP laws .
As Ludwig von Mises pointed out , “ No socialist author ever gave a thought to the possibility that the abstract entity which he wants to vest with unlimited power — whether it is called humanity , society , nation , state , or government — could act in a way of which he himself disapproves . ”
IP opponents must not oppose only the “ worst excesses ” of IP .
They must oppose all IP , root and branch , on principled , pro-private property , grounds ; and more than this : they must oppose the state itself , and legislation as a means of making law .
So shape up , non-libertarian IP opponents .
If you want to make a real case against IP , you must ground it in sound political principles .

City of Austin backs ' single - payer ' health plan

AUSTIN , Texas -
Affirming that “ every person deserves access to affordable , quality health care ” and noting that area residents are not getting it , the Austin City Council called today for the enactment of a nonprofit , single - payer national health insurance program .
At its regular Thursday meeting , the Council voted to endorse the U.S. National Health Insurance Act , H.R. 676 , sponsored by Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich . , and 91 other members of Congress .
The vote was six in favor and one abstention .
In taking the action , Austin joined at least 24 other municipalities , including Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Detroit , San Francisco and Louisville , Ky. , that have called for the bill ’s passage .
Also known as the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act , Conyers ’ bill would guarantee everyone access to all medically necessary care , including prescription drugs , with no co-pays or deductibles .
It would contain costs by eliminating the administrative waste and bureaucracy associated with the private insurance industry , and it would assure patients their personal choice of doctor and hospital .
Speaking to a local reporter shortly before the vote , Council Member Lee Leffingwell , a co-sponsor of the resolution , said , “ This is not socialized medicine .
It is basically the same system we have now in the form of Medicare , just more broadly applied . ”
Leffingwell told KLBJ - AM radio he was reluctant to get involved in national issues , “ but … about 20 percent of our residents do n’t have health insurance , and that puts a heavy burden on our area hospitals and our network of social service providers . ”
Council Members Mike Martinez and Randi Shade joined him in co-sponsoring the measure .
The Council ’s action follows on the heels of a similar endorsement by the U.S. Conference of Mayors at its June meeting in Miami .
Several religious denominations , most recently the Presbyterians and Unitarian Universalists , have also endorsed the single - payer approach , as have over 400 labor organizations , according to the resolution ’s backers .
Bill Holloway , an activist with Health Care for All Texas who helped promote the Austin resolution , said : “ This vote is a major victory for those who want to see a more just , rational and compassionate health care system in our state and nation .
The resolution makes it clear that managed care and other private insurance company schemes have been miserable failures when it comes to providing care or containing costs . ”
“ We need to convince our lawmakers in Washington that a more equitable and sustainable system of publicly financed care is possible not tomorrow - but today , ” he said .
“ The people of Austin have spoken : we want single - payer health care . ”
Dr. Ana Malinow , a Houston - based pediatrician who serves as chairperson of HCFAT and president of Physicians for a National Health Program , said : “ As a physician , I see the toll our broken health care system takes on people ’s lives every day - too often leading to their financial ruin , unnecessary suffering , early disability or death .
The Austin City Council , by its vote today , has pointed the way forward to a cure - single - payer national health insurance . ”

After the death of 153 people in Spain 's worst aviation disaster for 25 years , Chris Yates , aviation analyst for Jane 's Information Group , says it could be some time before definitive answers can be found .
Helicopters were called in to dump water on the plane , which was ablaze Air accident investigators determining the cause of Wednesday 's crash of a Spanair jet at Madrid 's Barajas airport are faced with a conundrum that could take a significant time to unravel .
Their role is that of assembling the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle as they attempt to determine beyond doubt what caused the accident .
While some initial findings may be forthcoming in a matter of days , it is almost always the case that a definitive determination of cause will take many months .
From official and anecdotal reports it appears clear that a fire in the left - side engine of the McDonnell Douglas MD 82 took hold as the aircraft made its take - off roll .
Such engine fires are extremely rare , but when they do occur they are , invariably , the result of some form of mechanical failure .
The precursor to such a mechanical failure is what accident investigators must now attempt to discover .
Air accidents generate headlines and much speculation follows as we seek context to the horror that unfolds before our eyes .
Questions are asked as to the safety record of the aircraft type in question , if there have been accidents in the past and if there is a possible link .
Inevitably , questions are also posed of the airline , its safety history and its ability to maintain aircraft within the fleet .
Exemplary record
The MD 82 plane type has a very low rate of accidents and incidents Spanair began operations in 1988 .
It is a subsidiary of Scandinavian Airline Systems and a member of the Star Alliance group of airlines .
Operating short , medium and , in the past , long haul flights , it has a current fleet of 61 aircraft and reportedly carried 11 million passengers in 2007 .
Spanair has had what many in the aviation industry would consider an exemplary safety record throughout its history .
Seven of the MD 82 type now remain in the fleet , primarily utilised for short and medium flights within the European region .
The MD 82 itself is a derivative of the McDonnell Douglas DC9 and capable of carrying between 130 and 170 passengers , depending on seating configuration .
Prior to the Madrid Barajas airport crash , only five other incidents and accidents had been recorded for the type , representing a very low attrition rate .
Earlier this year the US Federal Aviation Administration took the drastic step of grounding MD 80 type aircraft operated by American Airlines .
Other US air carriers operating the types in question followed suit pending safety checks .
It is important to remember that FAA action was prompted by the discovery of anomalies in the maintenance schedule of American Airlines MD 80s and related to an issue more than likely removed from that which occurred onboard Spanair flight JK5022 .
Of course , nothing can be ruled out as the air accident investigators get to work to discover the sequence of events that lead to this horrific accident .
Only detailed and painstaking analysis over the passage of time will yield the answers .

What are these ?
This , my friends , is absolutely shocking .
That guy who made himself the laughing stock of the entire internet by getting himself tattooed up with not one , not two , but three Zune logos , has decided to cover up the tattoos .
It 's not out of shame , however .
We 've known for a while now that this Adonis has no shame .
The reason is much , much better .

I am done .
I have had the Zune since day 1 and have noticed little improvement .
I have tried my best to support them every step of the way but the recent Xbox Live announcement at E3 made me lose it .
To not include Zune Marketplace or the ability to load videos from Xbox Live to your Zune made me finally give up .
I am in the works of figuring the best way to get a new tattoo to cover the logo on my arm .
Thanks for all the harsh comments and you will see very little of me anymore .

That 's right folks , the biggest Zune fan in the world is giving up on his beloved because Microsoft did n't offer Xbox integration .
I really wonder if this guy understood that tattoos were permanent when he got these .
I mean , he got them on day one , during the first , unimpressive generation of the Zune 's life .
It was never a very exciting player out the gate , never offering anything that could n't be found elsewhere except squirting and the pass , but he saw something there that he was convinced he would be passionate about for the rest of his life .
Now , not too far in the future , he 's throwing in the towel because he can't load videos on his Zune from his Xbox ?
Come on dude , you were so into the Zune , but you 're giving up over something as silly as that ?
I thought you were stronger .
More stubborn .
More stupid .
You 've really let me down .

SMYRNA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A week before the start of the new school year , principal Denise Magee roamed the hallways of Campbell Middle School in Smyrna , Georgia , preparing for battle .
Middle - school principal Denise Magee says a best - case scenario would be a school year without bullying .
The adversary ?
Preteen and teenage bullies .
Toting anti-bullying posters and masking tape , Magee was determined to let students see from Day One that she had a zero - tolerance policy when it came to that kind of harassment .
" Middle - school kids are just cruel to each other , " Magee said .
" They speak their minds , so you see bullying in the form of teasing , taunting , social isolation and name calling . "
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 30 percent of all children in grades six through 10 have been bullied or have bullied other children during a school year .
Clinical psychologist Mark Crawford of Roswell , Georgia , called the statistics unacceptable .
" Bullying is not a rite of passage , " he said .
" It always has a bad outcome . "
Health Minute Watch for Judy Fortin's Health Minute on Headline News
10 a.m. - 6 p.m. ET weekdays see full schedule »
Crawford said several times a month he hears complaints from young patients who are victims of bullies .
And he worried about the consequences .
" Kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms , physical complaints , emotional problems and academic underachievement . "
Parenting expert Stacey DeBroff , author of " The Mom Book , " cautioned that bullying often occurs in places that are n't monitored by adults , such as a walking route to and from school , a corner of a playground and the Internet .
She warned mothers and fathers to be on the lookout for signs a child is being bullied .
" When you see signs of being anxious , sad and withdrawn , of having a kid move off their typical personality , it alerts you that something is going on . "
Crawford noted that some of those symptoms can be attributed to typical adolescent behavior , but he added , " When you see a real change in a child 's personality or their normal routine , it 's a bad sign . "
Health Minute : Watch more on defeating bullies »
He also conceded that some children wo n't open up to their parents about bullying .
" One of the reasons kids do n't tell their parents they are being bullied is the fear that their parents will run in and do something about it and they think that will make it worse . "
Anti-Bullying Tips " Stop Bullying Now " suggests these tips to help your child :
1. Encourage your child to reach out to friendly students in his class and in other environments .
2 . Help your child gain more confidence by developing musical , athletic or artistic talents .
3 . Teach your child safety strategies ; assure him that reporting a bully is n't " tattling . "
4 . Let your child know that home will always be a safe place .
DeBroff agreed that it is tempting for some parents to rush in to solve the problem by calling the bully 's parents .
" You often know them , your kids have been in school together , you feel like calling them up ... so they 're on the defensive and really it 's never a point of resolution . "
Crawford said that it 's important to do your homework before attempting to resolve the situation .
He encouraged parents to talk with their child first and get them to open up about what 's happening .
" You need to find out when it is happening , where it is happening and exactly what is going on , " he said .
When elementary age children are involved , Crawford recommended parents intervene more quickly .
" Younger kids have a limited arsenal from which to draw , " he said .
" They do n't necessarily know how to be more assertive . "
Middle - school students may want to have some control over the situation , according to Crawford .
In that case , he said it might be a good idea to go over possible scenarios and options that will help them put a stop to the bullying .
Do n't Miss Health Minute archive
DeBroff said it is important to ask for help from a teacher or school administrator .
" They want to know about it because it ripples into the classrooms and places that are n't visible to them . "
Magee , the middle - school principal , agreed .
" I do not want parents to leave us out of the scenario , " she said .
" I want them to immediately contact us . "
But be judicious , she urged .
Some parents can inflame the situation .
" You will encounter situations where parents will tell their kids , ' If you are hit , I want you to hit back . ' "
Experts point out it is important for parents to keep emotions in check and to not encourage a child to hit back or retaliate .
Instead , DeBroff suggested parents become strategic advisers to their child and help them avoid bullying situations .
In a couple of weeks , after her students get settled , Magee plans to hold grade - level meetings about her school 's anti-bullying policy .
In the meantime , she remained optimistic and hoped this school year will be different .
" The best - case scenario as local school principal ?
We are bullyproof , fully free of any bully incidents , that we are truly here with academic focus , no fighting , no teasing , no name calling , none of that .
We 're here to learn . "
The school board decided that teachers with concealed guns were a better form of security than armed peace officers , since an attacker would not know whom to shoot first , Mr. Thweatt said .
Teachers have received training from a private security consultant and will use special ammunition designed to prevent ricocheting , he added .
Harrold , about 180 miles northwest of Dallas , is a far cry from the giant districts in major Texas cities , where gang violence is the main concern and most schools have their own police forces .
Barely 100 students of all ages attend classes here in two brick buildings built more than 60 years ago .
There are two dozen teachers , a handful of buses and a football field bordered by crops .
Yet the town is not isolated in rustic peace , supporters of the plan point out .
A four - lane highway runs through town , bringing with it a river of humanity , including criminals , they say .
The police recently shut down a drug - producing laboratory in a ramshackle house near school property .
Drifters sometimes sleep under the overpass .
“ I ’m not exactly paranoid , ” Mr. Thweatt said .
“ I like to consider myself prepared . ”
Some residents and parents , however , think Mr. Thweatt may be overstating the threat .
Many say they rarely lock their doors , much less worry about random drifters with pistols running amok at the school .
Longtime residents were hard - pressed to recall a single violent incident there .
Others worry that introducing guns into the classroom might create more problems than it solved .
A teacher tussling with a student could lose control of a weapon , or a gun might go off by accident , they said .
“ I do n’t think there is a place in the school whatsoever for a gun unless you have a police officer in there , ” said Bobby G. Brown , a farmer and former school board chairman whose two sons were educated at the school .
“ I do n’t care how much training they have . ”
Image Harrold School Superintendent David Thweatt pushed for the policy to arm teachers with concealed guns .
" Country people are take - care - of - yourself people . "

His wife , Diane Brown , added : “ There are too many things that could happen .
They are not trained to make life - and - death - situation judgments . ”

The opinion of an MD and oncologist

" Treating " cancer is one of the most lucrative business on earth .
For years , cancer has been called a " mystery . "
After spending billions of dollars over many decades , the medical establishment claims not to know the cause of cancer , not to understand its nature , and can only offer expensive and invasive treatments like radiation and highly toxic drugs to treat it .
The strikes me as willful stupidity that conveniently happens to generate many billions of dollars each year that is spread out annually among many tens of thousands of employees of the cancer industry .
Is it a surprise that the operative word is " treatment " and never " cure " and that when doctors come forward with simple , safe and inexpensive cures they find little interest in the work from the " professionals " ?

" Mr. Obamas speech  a historic one given his status as the first African American nominee of a major political party  reached significantly more viewers than the comparable addresses in 2004 , " The New York Times reports .
" Coverage of John Kerrys acceptance speech in 2004 had 24.4 million viewers ; coverage of George W. Bushs convention speech that same year drew 27.5 million . "
As over 84,000 filled Mile High Stadium to hear Obama in person , according to Nielsen Media Research , the televised broadcasts attracted more viewers than the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing , the final ' American Idol ' or the Academy Awards this year .
The Times also notes that " the four - night Democratic convention ranks as the most - watched convention of either party , Democratic or Republican , since Nielsen began measuring conventions in 1960 . "
" Obama 's audience might be higher , since Nielsen did n't have an estimate for how many people watched Obama on PBS or C - SPAN Thursday night , " the Associated Press adds .
Obama shifts , says he may back offshore drilling Associated Press

PETERSBURG , Fla . - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said Friday he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling if that 's what it takes to enact a comprehensive policy to foster fuel - efficient autos and develop alternate energy sources .
Shifting from his previous opposition to expanded offshore drilling , the Illinois senator told a Florida newspaper he could get behind a compromise with Republicans and oil companies to prevent gridlock over energy .
Republican rival John McCain , who earlier dropped his opposition to offshore drilling , has been criticizing Obama on the stump and in broadcast ads for clinging to his opposition as gasoline prices topped $ 4 a gallon .
Polls indicate these attacks have helped McCain gain ground on Obama .
" My interest is in making sure we 've got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices , " Obama said in an interview with The Palm Beach Post .
" If , in order to get that passed , we have to compromise in terms of a careful , well thought - out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage â  I do n't want to be so rigid that we can't get something done . "
In Congress , both parties have fought bitterly over energy policy for weeks , with Republicans pressing for more domestic oil drilling and Democrats railing about oil company profits .
Despite hundreds of hours of House and Senate floor debate , lawmakers will leave Washington for their five - week summer hiatus this week with an empty tank .
" The Republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling , " Obama said in the Post interview .
" And so we do n't want gridlock .
We want to get something done . "

Some folks like to pretend we live in an era of debauchery , and that everything that happened over 20 years ago was in the " good old days . "
You could leave your doors unlocked , movies cost a nickel and hobos had n't even been invented yet .
They 're full of shit , of course .
As long as humans have had genitals , they 've looked for ways to keep them entertained .
Here 's a quick history lesson on ...

Some evidence suggests that dildos may have been in use as early as the Upper Paleolithic era , which was from 40,000 to 10,000 years ago .
This indicates our caveman ancestors may have been hunting woolly mammoth while the women - folk were at home going to town on themselves with wang - shaped pieces of rock or bone .
There has n't been a huge amount of research into this , probably due to scientists ' fears of making a career - defining breakthrough and getting called " Doctor Dildo " for the rest of their life .
By the 5th century BCE , the Greeks began producing something called an olisbos that was sold in the port of Miletus .
Because if there 's one thing you needed in the era when the movie 300 took place it was a leather and wood penis to ensure that every aspect of your life was intense and splinter - inducing .

In an age when the Greek and Persian empires were at war and Greek philosophers were dabbling with little boys , the local women were apparently no longer ashamed to name an inanimate penis Carl and sleep with it at night .
The fact that they chose leather and wood , and probably lubricated with olive oil indicates that the sexually liberated Greek lady of that era had a steel - like vagina that would most likely chafe today 's man something fierce , and probably devour any small pets he did n't watch closely .

Giving more support to the idea that those Upper Paleolithic stone willies were actually sex toys is the discovery that cave paintings from around 40,000 years ago depict what is believed to be some of the first purely sexual art works .
While a number of stuffy , scholarly types will go on about fertility symbols , the paintings found in caves in Spain and elsewhere in Europe show sex not so much as a biological function but a kick ass way to spend an afternoon .
Rudimentary drawings of a lumpy man having sex with a lumpy woman and then going out to hunt buffalo may not be Larry Flynt 's definition of a good time , but the cave drawings also portrayed acts that could only result in procreation by a miracle of the human mouth .
Scholars can keep calling it whatever they want .
We 're more than happy to claim the video files we 've been collecting on our hard drive constitute a comprehensive tribute to the fertility Godess .

Of course , most of the art work depicts women as child bearers and men as wang bearers ( yes , drawing wangs has been with us since we evolved thumbs ) , but a few kinky gems occasionally pop up .
Such as , a 13,000 year - old etching of a couple having sex while a 3rd person watches .
We like to picture the artist timidly showing this to his wife with a cocked eyebrow , saying , " So , this is the picture I 've been working on .
This is me and this is the slave girl here .
This is you .
So ... what do you think ? "

Hard to believe that the entire Democratic National Convention could go by without even one speaker paying lip service to the devastating folly that is America ’s war on ( some ) drugs , but as NORML podcaster Russ Belville reports in his latest blog post here , the subject of marijuana law reform has been all but “ invisible ” in Denver .
Fortunately , thousands of Digg.com users posed the following question to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi live on CNN : “ As a taxable resource , what stops marijuana from being legalized , for medical or recreational purposes , throughout the country ? ”
( The question comes four and a half minutes into the video . )
Pelosi ’s response is candid yet disappointing .
While acknowledging that scientific research clearly supports the medical use of cannabis , Pelosi acknowledges that most of Congress — including many otherwise ‘ progressive ’ members of the influential Congressional Black Caucus — “ just is n’t there yet . …
There just is n’t enough support for it . ”
Of course , anyone who has followed this issue knows that the Speaker ’s Congressional assessment is painfully accurate .
That said , I find myself a bit incredulous when Pelosi says : “ We have important work to do outside the Congress in order for us to have success inside the Congress for [ the ] use of medical marijuana . …
[ W ]e need peoples ’ help to be in touch with their members of Congress to say why this should be the case . ”
While I agree that it ’s both important and necessary for constituents to contact their elected officials , I ’m disappointed that Ms. Pelosi still believes that the ‘ heavy - lifting ’ needed to successfully move this issue forward federally must be engaged in outside , not inside Congress .
Pardon me , but here in the real world ( outside of the Washington Beltway ) public voteafter public vote illustrates that the overwhelming majority of registered voters back the legalization of medical pot , and national poll after national poll consistently shows that upwards of 70 percent of the electorate support a patient ’s right to use cannabis legally .
Here in the real world , numerous health and medical organizations such as the American Public Health Association and the American College of Physicians have passed resolutions urging Congress reschedule marijuana so that a physician may prescribe it , and scientific papers indicating that cannabis can inhibit diseases ranging from multiple sclerosis to cancer to MRSA are being published virtually every week .
Given this reality , I humbly submit that those of us who work ‘ outside ’ the so - called ‘ hallowed halls ’ of Congress have done our part .
It ’s now time for our federally elected officials , in particular Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Presidential Nominee Obama , to pledge to do theirs .

Until now , domestic law did not regulate mortgage loans very precisely .
Although the ‘ mortgages ’ were listed in the Consumer Credit Act , they are only affected by a few regulations from the legal act ( e.g. related to mandatory elements of the contract ) .
Since 2007 , the Good Finance Association has been primarily involved in the regulation of the mortgage market .
However , it should be remembered that the subsequent “ Good Finance ” issued by the GFIC did not have the status of an act or other legal act .
Banks complied with these recommendations only because of possible sanctions for financial supervision .
The legal status of mortgage loans will soon change as the government is preparing a special law .
This legal act confirms the principles previously set by the GFIC and also introduces several new solutions that will be of particular interest to consumers .
Only new borrowers will benefit from the proposed regulations …
As a preliminary remark , it is worth mentioning that the introduction of the law relating only to mortgage loans was enforced by EU legislation .
Poland as an EU member state must implement to its right the solutions provided for in Directive 2014 / 17 / EU of February 4 , 2014 , on consumer credit agreement related to residential real estate .
The introduction of the mortgage law is also associated with the fact that important rules regarding “ mortgages ” are currently dispersed in several different legal acts .
The bill being prepared aims , among others , at improving the position of a consumer taking out a mortgage .
It is worth noting that all new regulations will apply only to consumers , i.e. people who take out a mortgage for purposes directly unrelated to business or professional activity .
The Mortgage Act will not cover , for example , entrepreneurs lending funds needed to buy business premises .
The benefits of the new regulations will not be able to count the number of people who are consumers but have entered into a loan agreement before entering
The new act will limit , among others charging a commission for early repayment
The act prepared by the government provides for many detailed changes which concern not only the principles of offering and granting mortgage loans but also financial intermediation .
Several aspects can be identified , particularly of interest to future borrowers .
The proposed regulations provide for the following solutions :
No commission for early repayment of a loan with a variable interest rate after 36 months from the conclusion of the contract .
Limitation of the commission for earlier repayment to the number of costs incurred by the bank in connection with the earlier repayment ( the limitation shall apply irrespective of the type of rate loan interest rate ) .
Introduction of a special mathematical formula according to which the maximum amount of commission for early repayment is to be calculated ( both loans with variable and fixed loans will be used ) interest rate ) .
Confirmation of the principle according to which a loan in a foreign currency can be taken only by a Pole who does not bear exchange rate risk ( income currency = liability currency ) .
Introduction of the possibility of withdrawing from the mortgage contract ( without giving reasons ) during the first 14 days of its conclusion .
The only cost associated with the withdrawal will be interesting for the period of the contract .
The borrower has to submit a declaration of withdrawal on the form provided to him after the conclusion of the contract .
Introduction of the obligation to obtain the GFI permit for persons dealing in mortgage brokerage .
This requirement is expected to increase the quality of services provided to consumers .
The draft law on mortgage loans also provides for detailed requirements for intermediaries ( e.g. regarding criminal record and education ) .
Launch of the register of credit intermediaries , which will be publicly available and kept by the Good Finance Investment Corporation .
Exclusion of the possibility of selling other banking products together with a mortgage ( the exception applies to the free account for servicing the loan ) .
The ban on tying ( cross- selling ) of other financial products together with mortgage loans , mentioned in the last point , can certainly be worrying for banks .
It ’s no secret that ‘ mortgages ’ bring banks relatively low interest , fees , and commissions , and the profitability of granting them depends to a large extent on the attached policies .
Thus , the introduction of a ban on cross-selling may result in limiting the availability of mortgage loans ( especially for the least affluent consumers ) .
After the changes , the borrower will still be liable with all his assets
Contrary to the hopes of many people , the Mortgage Act does not introduce radical changes in the method of financing real estate .
In the context of “ mortgages ” , it is often proposed to limit enforcement to only the loaned property .
Such an American model is beneficial for debtors who do not have to be afraid that the bailiff , apart from the house or flat , will also take up other assets and property .
regularly withdraws part of his salary .
Burn loan installments by up to 30 % .
It is worth realizing that the prospect of limiting the scope of enforcement of mortgages , apart from the advantages , would also have serious disadvantages .
Due to the financial stability of banks , such a change could only be applied to new contracts .
After a possible limitation of enforcement to the borrower ’s apartment or house , banks would reduce the limits on financing real estate ( e.g. up to 60 % of the purchase price ) .
Such a change would result in an increase in the required contribution and a decrease in the availability of new loans .
On August 27 , 2001 , almost exactly 7 years ago , Microsoft unleashed Internet Explore 6 upon the world .
Despite version 7 having been out now for almost two years , and version 8 already in public beta , usage of the 2001 release remains strong .
W3 Counter reports that it is still the most popular browser in the world at 34.6 % of all visits , while TheCounter.com has it second to IE7 , but only barely and still commanding a whopping 36 % market share .
Because so many people still use the older version of Internet Explorer , many web sites have made the choice to continue supporting it ( including SitePoint — where about 12 % of our visitors still come to us using IE6 ) .
But is it perhaps time to ditch IE6 support and start forcing people to upgrade ?
Web application developer 37signals made the decision to drop IE6 support in July ( actual support for Microsoft ’s last generation browser ceased on August 15 ) .
“ IE 6 ca n’t provide the same web experience that modern browsers can , ” wrote 37signals of the decision .
“ Continued support of IE 6 means that we can’t optimize our interfaces or provide an enhanced customer experience in our apps .
Supporting IE 6 means slower progress , less progress , and , in some places , no progress . ”
According to 37signals , supporting IE6 was holding them back .
And 37 signals is n’t alone in their dislike of IE6 .
In 2006 , a few months before Microsoft released their last major browser , PC World magazine ranked Internet Explorer 6 as the 8th worst tech product of all time , citing its terrible track record when it comes to security .
Security is such a big issue for IE6 , that one blogger recently reported that 95 % of all bots accessing his site use Internet Explorer 6 as their user - agent .
“ Most blog spam comes from bots that either fake or , as a trojan , use Internet Explorer 6 of infected systems , ” he wrote , ultimately deciding to block IE6 completely to alleviate the blog spam problem .
Of course , security is n’t the only reason web developers are sour on IE6 .
Internet Explorer 6 is also dismal when it comes to standards compliance .
So why do people continue to use it ?
As Nick La wrote a year ago , the reason people still use IE6 is that developers go out of their way to make web sites work in it .
So most people do n’t realize that IE6 is n’t a good browser .
“ We all know that IE6 is outdated and has horrible CSS rendering engine .
However , most average Internet users have n’t realized that yet .
Why ?
Because we put our hard work on it and patch the bugs by various IE hacks , ” La wrote , urging people to drop support for IE6 .
A third of the Internet is a lot of people to just leave behind , though .
So support for IE6 continues at most web sites , especially large ones .
What we need to move us forward , however , is a bold move , not too much unlike the one Apple made in 2001 when it decided to forgo backwards compatibility when it released OS X .
In order to save the Internet from IE6 , perhaps we need to stop supporting it .
What do you think ?
Should web developers stop supporting Internet Explorer 6 ?

What happens when Congress holds an oversight hearing and the overseen refuses to show up ?
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee found out on Wednesday , when they convened to examine allegations of selective prosecution by the US Department of Justice .
The second in a series of hearings into the politicization of the DOJ focused on allegations that the department had either failed to prosecute or delayed prosecution of people involved in GOP voter - suppression efforts during the 2002 and 2004 elections .
On hand to testify : a New Hampshire congressman , a felonious former GOP political operative , a New Hampshire lawyer , and an NYU professor .
Conspicuously absent was anyone from the Justice Department , which not only declined to send an official to testify , but also ignored repeated requests from the committee to hand over internal documents relevant to the hearing .
The dis was hardly unusual .
Over the past year , the Judiciary Committee has held numerous oversight hearings and requested a host of documents from the DOJ on everything from the operation of its civil rights division to deferred prosecution agreements .
For the most part , the agency has simply ignored the committee , setting the stage for yet another showdown between the administration and Congress .
Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers sent Attorney General Michael Mukasey a letter on May 9 lamenting that while he has sent numerous letters and document requests to the Justice Department over the past year , the agency has failed to provide the requested documents and “ in some cases , even to answer ” its requests .
He went on to warn that if Mukasey and his staff fail to come up with a specific schedule for the document production by Friday , May 16 , “ we will have little choice but to consider compulsory process . ”
Conyers repeated his subpoena threat at Wednesday ’s hearing , after noting that the committee ’s attempts at oversight had been met with “ almost total stonewalling . ”
He warned , “ You ’d better get some documents answered fast , Mr. Attorney General , or you ’re going to hear from me . ”
But without anyone on hand from the DOJ to respond to the saber rattling , Conyers had to content himself with grilling the witnesses in front of him , who had scant new information to offer on the department ’s performance or lack thereof .
The bulk of the panel was devoted to the events that transpired in New Hampshire during the 2002 midterm election .
That ’s when state GOP operatives , working in cahoots with the regional director of the Bush / Cheney campaign , hatched a scheme to tie up the phone lines of Democratic get - out - the - vote efforts .
Ultimately , four people were indicted or pleaded guilty for their involvement in the effort .
One of them was the hearing ’s star witness , Allen Raymond , who spent three months in a federal prison for his role in the phone - jamming scheme .
If Conyers was hoping that Raymond would drop some newsworthy bombs , however , he was clearly disappointed .
Raymond has already dropped all his bombs in a tell - all book , How to Rig an Election , about his rise and fall in GOP politics , which Billy Ray , the writer - director of Shattered Glass , and Breach , recently optioned for a movie .
The only remaining mystery about the phone - jamming affair — and the primary reason the committee is so interested in it — is whether or not the White House was involved , a question that the DOJ prosecutors did n’t answer .
The evidence is surely tantalizing : On Election Day 2002 , James Tobin , the RNC ’s regional director and a Bush / Cheney campaign official , made 22 phone calls to an office in the White House , run at the time by political director Ken Mehlman .
With White House approval , the RNC also paid Tobin ’s legal bills , a sign , Democrats suggest , that it wanted him to keep quiet about who knew what and when .
Conyers was clearly hoping that Raymond , who ’d arranged for the actual jamming of the phones , would implicate the White House .
But he burst that bubble right out of the gate , saying , “ I cannot link the New Hampshire phone - jamming scheme in any way to President George Bush ’s White House . ”
Conyers would have been better off getting Tobin himself to testify with promises of immunity .
Republicans , meanwhile , made their feelings about the hearing clear from the outset .
In his opening statement , Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - Utah ) declared the hearing an utter waste of time .
“ These cases are old news , ” he fumed .
His colleague , the former Texas judge Louie Gohmert , echoed those sentiments .
“ Why are we here today ? ” he demanded , noting that the committee had to cut short a markup of seven important crime bills to convene the hearing that he claimed was born out of “ desperation . ”
Gohmert ticked off a list of items he found more relevant for the committee ’s attention , including a random and inexplicable reference to former ambassador Joseph Wilson , who Gohmert thought ought to be investigated for perjury based on his numerous appearances before the committee regarding the outing of his CIA wife , Valerie Plame .
Then , the Republican congressman stormed out of the hearing room , never to return .
Early on , the hearing quickly dissolved into a series of spats between Cannon and Linda Sanchez , chairwoman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law , who presided over the hearing ; between Cannon and Conyers ; and between Cannon and all the witnesses .
( “ I do n’t mean to heckle the witness , ” Cannon said before going on to heckle his colleague , Rep. Paul Hodes , a Democrat from New Hampshire , who was the first witness . )
While the final three witnesses were there largely for their knowledge of the New Hampshire phone - jamming case , Cannon grilled them about the Obama / Clinton primary in Nevada , allegations of Democratic voter fraud , and even allegations of fraud during the 1996 election between Sanchez ’s sister Loretta and Republican Bob Dornan , a move that did n’t win him much good will from the chair .
Since none of the witnesses had even the slightest bit of insight into these matters , Sanchez finally managed to draw the hearing to a close three hours after it started , and stomped off into the hallway , perhaps agreeing with the gentlemen from across the aisle that the hearing was , indeed , a waste of time .

Runaway oil prices have set off a furious new blame game in which political leaders and key economic players are scrambling to deflect responsibility for the deepening crisis .
With outraged consumers protesting in the streets of many countries , oil producers are blaming speculators , speculators are blaming consumers and politicians are blaming one another .
Consequences could entail not just a tarnished image but real damage to economic interests and political fortunes .
“ Everybody ’s got their preferred culprits , ” said Frank A. Verrastro , a longtime U.S. energy official who is now director of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
“ Nobody wants to look in the mirror . ”
The process of assigning blame underscores the complexity of a crisis with multiple causes and explosive implications .

Nearly 30 years ago , skyrocketing energy prices and a sagging economy may have played a larger role in the defeat of President Carter than the Iranian hostage standoff , experts said .
“ Oil prices were a straight - up pocketbook issue , and that , along with inflation , really turned the election , ” said Paul Light , a professor of public service at New York University who surveyed voter attitudes on energy this year .
“ The penetration of gas prices as an issue is pretty deep . ”
In Washington , President Bush on Wednesday blamed Democrats in Congress and called for an end to the nation ’s offshore drilling ban .
Democrats have blamed Bush and Saudi Arabia , among others .
The Saudis have blamed global financiers .
Environmentalists and oil companies have come in for a helping of blame as well .
Overseas , growing demand for oil in China and India have been fingered , along with U.S. foreign and military policy , as countries worry about the international ramifications of rising prices .

Among the most frequent new targets are speculators .
Oil retailers , oil producers , many Democrats and even some Republicans say that people who buy oil as an investment are causing much of the price increase .
“ These Wall Street traders have pushed the economy to the brink of disaster , ” said Dan Gilligan , president of the Petroleum Marketers Assn. of America , a business trade group for gasoline retailers .
Exxon Mobil officials have told lawmakers that more than half the price of a barrel of oil can be attributed to speculation .
But the financial industry is battling back , warning that more price increases could follow if Congress adopts any number of pending proposals , such as increasing the amount of money investors must put up to buy oil contracts or limiting the number of contracts investors can hold .

Such moves could hurt the ability of big industrial users , such as airlines , to hedge their price risk and could send prices higher by causing hoarding or panic buying , critics argue .
“ We have to consider the cost of regulatory actions , ” Mark Stainton , head of the Citadel Investment Group hedge fund , told a regulatory committee this month .
The U.S. government has come in for blame for launching wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
By raising doubts about future oil flow , U.S. military action has added a “ security premium ” to the price of oil , critics have said .
The Bush administration has also been blamed for the weakness of the dollar , which has contributed substantially to price increases .
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi , whose country is Africa ’s No. 2 oil producer , complained this month that although U.S. officials complain about the high price of oil , “ they are the guilty ones . ”

Saudi Arabia , the word ’s largest producer , has long contended that oil speculation is the primary cause of rising prices , and it has resisted pressure from the administration and others to further increase production .
But the Saudis , alarmed at continuing price increases , are convening a world summit this weekend in Riyadh , the Saudi capital , to discuss the problem and have hinted that they might boost output .
Those signals seem to suggest that they now acknowledge that supply shortages are at least partly to blame for the climbing prices .
But the price of oil has budged little since the Saudis ’ intentions were disclosed last week , suggesting that many in the markets need to be convinced that the Saudi moves are more than a public - relations gesture .
Pressure on the kingdom has been intensifying .
Some congressional Democrats have been pushing -- so far unsuccessfully -- to hold up arms sales to Riyadh unless it pumps more oil .

The Saudis also are feeling the heat from other Muslim nations confronting strikes and demonstrations over oil prices .
Pakistan , under severe economic pressure , has asked the Saudis if it can defer paying for $ 2 billion worth of oil imports .
With gasoline prices shaping up as a top issue in the fall elections , the U.S. political parties are maneuvering to fix blame on their rivals and discredit each other ’s remedies .
Senate Republican leaders have been sending e-mail bulletins every time the average price of gasoline rises a penny , maintaining that the Democratic congressional leadership that took over in January 2007 has fallen down on the job .
" $ 4.06 , ” a recent dispatch from the Senate Republican Communications Center said in bold type .
“ What are the Democrats doing about these prices ? ”

Republicans assert that the Democrats are at fault for failing to permit more oil drilling in the United States , including in areas environmentalists consider sensitive .
The issue gained new momentum this week as Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive GOP presidential nominee , called for lifting the federal ban on drilling in coastal areas .
Democrats , including presumptive presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , say the administration has failed to develop a plan to move the country to alternatives to imported oil .
As the cycle of blame plays out , Republicans , by controlling the White House , may have a difficult time dodging the ire of voters , surveys have begun to show .

A poll by the Pew Research Center found that , by a margin of 15 % , respondents believed Democrats would give greater priority to the energy issue .
A weekend poll by the Washington Post and ABC News gave Obama a 20 - point advantage over McCain on the issue .
Light , the New York University professor , said that no matter how persuasive the arguments were for assigning blame , it would be difficult to convince many American voters that responsibility lies with Chinese motorists , Saudis , oil companies or Democrats .
“ You can go through a detailed chain of logic and eventually line up at a Saudi palace or the Democrats ’ doorstep , ” he said , recounting the lesson of Carter .
“ But voters do n’t think that way .
. . .
They say , ‘ I ’m paying $ 4 a gallon ; who do I hold accountable ? ’
It ’s Bush and the Republicans . ”

Rare ' Corpse Flower ' blooms at EIU
There 's been a big stink on the campus of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston , but people were lining up to take a look and grab a whiff .
The weekend smell was coming from something called a Titan Arum flower at EIU 's Thut Greenhouse .
It 's one of the largest blossoms in the world and it's better known as the Corpse Flower because of the foul , rotting - meat odor it emits to attract insects .
More Coverage Links EIU Dept. of Biological Sciences
Greenhouse manager Steven Malehorn says the Corpse Flower began blooming Saturday and peaked Sunday .
The greenhouse remained open both days so people could view the oddity .
Malehorn says the plant takes from five to seven years to come into bloom and its fetid flower usually lasts about 30 hours .
CHESTER , Virginia ( Reuters ) - Presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Thursday he would assemble a foreign policy team of the “ best and the brightest ” and mentioned some people who may be considered for jobs if he wins the White House .

Former Georgia senator Sam Nunn and former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke were among the Democrats Obama said he would turn to for advice .
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said he would also seek the counsel of Republicans such as Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel .
Republican John McCain , Obama ’s rival in the November 4 election , has emphasized his background as a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war as well as years of involvement as a senator in foreign policy to argue that he is more qualified to serve as U.S. commander - in - chief .
McCain accuses Obama , a first - term Illinois senator , of lacking seasoning and judgment on foreign policy matters .
At a town hall meeting in Chester , Virginia , Obama said his early opposition to the Iraq war showed he had better judgment than McCain , who supported it .
But he added , “ That does n’t mean that I know everything .
I ’ve got to have good , smart advisers around me ...
It ’s not like I just kind of show up , you know , one day in the White House and say , ‘ Alright , what ’s today ? ’ ”
Listing those he already consults on foreign affairs , Obama mentioned Nunn , Holbrooke and former Secretary of Defense William Perry .
“ We will have the best and brightest -- and by the way , they do n’t have to be Democrats , ” he said .
“ There are Republicans like Richard Lugar , the chairman of the ( Senate ) Foreign Relations committee , who is one of my dearest friends and advisers in the Senate . ”
Obama also recalled his trip in July to Iraq and Afghanistan with Hagel .
“ He ’s a staunch Republican , but Chuck and I agree almost on every item of foreign policy , ” he said .

When first avowing his religious credentials for president , Barack Obama said – and then repeated many times since – that “ secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering the public square . ”
The party that will soon nominate Obama is to be praised for its acceptance of and respect for its religious members .
However , it is the nonbelievers who are now being ignored .
Hearing of the plans for the prayer / unity / values event leading off the convention on August 24 , Ron Millar , Associate Director of the Secular Coalition for America , wrote a letter on July 2 to Leah Daughtry , CEO of the Democratic National Committee and planner of the “ big tent ” event .
He asked Daughtry if nontheistic Americans were welcome and , if so , how this would be manifested .
While not replying directly to the Coalition , Daughtry did discuss the request with the Associated Press .
“ Atheists speaking at an interfaith service … does that work ? ” a “ befuddled ” Daughtry was quoted as asking in a July 19 story by the AP ’s Eric Gorski .
“ I do n’t quite know .
But they ’re part of the party , you treat them with respect . ”
The first sign that treating them with respect was not a priority for Daughtry was her lumping all notheists who include not only agnostics but also humanists , skeptics , and believers in spirit but not a personal god into atheists .
And the second came with the announcement of the lineup for what had once been thought of as a “ values ” and a “ unity ” event : no one represents the millions of secularists .
Daughtry : “ Democrats have been , are and will continue to be people of faith – and this interfaith gathering is proof of that . ”
But what about those Democrats who are not “ people of faith ? ”
Are they not invited ?
Or invited just to watch others pray ?
Should their own outlook not even be acknowledged ?
If the Democrats are trying to strike unifying chords among their entire kaleidoscopic range of liberals , moderates , and progressives , it should be obvious that secularists cannot dare be left out of the “ big tent ” event , and that it should be about beliefs and values , not solely about religion .
Secularists remember all too painfully one of the most dramatic presidential addresses in American history .
At the National Cathedral three days after September 11 , 2001 , the president ’s speech so filled with religious language that it was virtually a sermon .
As he delivered it , Bush stood flanked by Jewish , Muslim , and Christian representatives , with no one invited to stand alongside them whose presence might acknowledge the existence of the tens of millions of secular Americans .
At this most important collective moment in the recent history of the United States , it was as if their president was telling them that they did not exist .
The United States had become a nation of believers .
Yet one of the most remarkable implications of the data presented in the new Pew U.S. Religious Landscape Survey is that atheists , agnostics , secular humanists , and believers in an impersonal God or universal spirit — people who do not believe in God at all or who do not believe in a traditional God — will be a huge share , perhaps as much as 40 percent of Democratic voters in November .
Another Pew discovery :
Two out of every three Americans say that their moral values do not come primarily from religion .
In other words , whatever their faith , these are people who live largely or wholly secular lives .
It turns out that deciding to welcome faith into the public square was the easy part .
Now the rest of the Democrats – the many with underlying beliefs that ca n’t be neatly categorized as “ religious ” – must be invited to join the political conversation as well .
Thomas Jefferson glimpsed such problems when he called for a “ wall of separation ” between church and state , treating the first as private and the second as public .
In any case , excluding some so that others feel included is no way to create common ground .

A global fertiliser crisis caused by high oil prices and the US rush to biofuel crops is reducing the harvests of the world 's poorest farmers and could lead to millions more people going hungry , according to the UN and global food analysts .
Optimism that soaring food commodity prices could lift millions of developing country farmers out of poverty and lead to more food being grown have been dashed , says the UN .
This is because small farmers either consume their own crop or have no access to global markets to take advantage of the higher food prices .
There is little prospect of relief .
A world fertiliser forecast report , due to be published by the UN this week but seen by the Guardian , states that prices will remain high for at least three years and possibly longer .
Fertiliser prices have mostly doubled and in some cases risen by 500 % in 15 months as US farmers have rushed to plant more biofuel crops and countries such as India and China have bought fertiliser stocks in large quantities to guarantee their food stocks .
But while the unprecedented price explosion has barely affected large commercial farmers , it is leading directly to civil unrest among small farmers in developing countries .
There have been fertiliser riots or demonstrations in Vietnam , India , Kenya , Nepal , Nigeria , Egypt , Pakistan and Taiwan in the last few months .
Last week one man was killed in a stampede at a government handout of fertiliser in Hyderabad , India .
Senior UN Food and Agriculture organisation analyst Dr Jan Poulisse warned the poor were being hurt the most by the crisis .
" High commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices .
But rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers , particularly in Africa , " Poulisse told the Guardian .
" People just cannot afford [ fertiliser ] .
They were in dire straits before , but now the situation is worse . "
Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have been hardest hit because they have the least chance to benefit from soaring food prices on the world market , but desperately need fertilisers to replenish nutrient - depleted soils .
World fertiliser prices have risen more than oil or any other commodities in the last 18 months .
Of the three main types , diammonium phosphate ( Dap ) sold for US $ 250 per tonne in January 2007 but has risen to $ 1,230 per tonne .
Potash - based fertilisers have risen from $ 172 to over $ 500 a tonne , and nitrogen based fertilisers have risen from $ 277 to over $ 450 per tonne .
Much of the price rise is attributed to first world farmers who have applied high levels of fertilisers to maximise harvests of grain to take advantage of record grain prices , said Dr Balu Bumb , policy leader at the International centre for Soil Fertility and Agricultural Development ( IFDC ) in the US .
The UN fertiliser forecast blames capacity constraints for the price rises .
" Strong global demand for fertilisers is stretching current production capacity to its technical limits .
This situation will persist until new capacity comes on line " , it states .
" It can take 5 - 7 years to open a phosphate mine , 10 years for a potash mine and three years for a major nitrogen plant " , said Dr Poulisse , one of the report 's authors .
At least 50 new plants to make nitrogen fertiliser are believed to be under construction , and phosphorous and potassium mines are being expanded .
Fertiliser prices have in the past been largely controlled by governments because they are so politically sensitive .
But keeping prices down in the current crisis is now impacting heavily on other areas , such as education and health .
India is expecting to have to spend $ 24bn supporting fertiliser prices this year compared to only $ 4bn three years ago and countries such as Malawi have had to borrow millions to introduce a fertiliser subsidy programme .
However , the president of Malawi admitted last week that the subsidy programme was failing the poor .
" Sadly , it is the rich who are benefiting a great deal .
They are selling maize to the poor at exorbitant prices , " he said .
Agriculture and development experts say the world has few alternatives to its growing dependence on fertiliser .
As population increases and a rising global middle class demands more food , fertiliser has become the preferred route to higher yields .
" Rises in basic commodity prices should be good for small growers but we are seeing that agri-business is reaping all the benefits .
It needs a fundamental reform of the way agriculture is managed as well as more sustainable farming " , said Amy Barry , an Oxfam spokeswoman .
Transplantation of insulin- producing cell islets , so - called islets of langerhans is an appealing strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes .
But it turns out that these are short - lived , and the procedure needs to be repeated .
Now researchers at Linköping University and Uppsala University in Sweden can show that accumulation of protein aggregatess , amyloid , in the transplanted cells may be causing their death .
Until now it was not known why this insulin production ceases .
The discovery now being published in The New England Journal of Medicine may change the course of diabetes research .
Transplant attempts have been carried out for more than 30 years .
Hundreds of patients have had healthy insulin- producing islets of Langerhans recovered from the pancreas of donors .
These transplants , which usually involve the injection of cell islets into the liver , normally go well , and the patients initially do n’t have to take insulin .
But within a year or two years the insulin production will cease from the transplanted cells .
“ We have studied this in mice , but it has naturally been difficult to do so in humans .
Now we have had an opportunity to examine such transplants in an individual with type 1 diabetes , ” says Gunilla T. Westermark , assistant professor of cell biology at Linköping University .
In close to half of the cell islets examined , 43 percent , the researchers found lumps of amyloid .
“ We previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes .
Perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant , when cells are exposed to great stress , ” says Gunilla T. Westermark .
Interestingly , there were quite a few unaffected cell islets remaining in the liver .
If we can prevent the production of amyloid at an early stage , these cells would be able to continue to produce insulin .
One possible strategy is to create a drug ; another would be to refine the methods used in transplants in order to reduce stress .
The report “ Widespread amyloid deposition in transplanted human pancreatic islets ” by Gunilla T. Westermark , Per Westermark , Christian Berne , and Olle Korsgren will appear in The New England Journal of Medicine on August 28 .
The popular web radio service Pandora is shutting down according to reports .
The reason for Pandora closing is due to an increase in royalty fees that affect web streaming services .
Pandora has become popular in the Apple world since the release of their iPhone music application called Pandora Radio .
The free application allows users to tune into personalized streaming radio stations based on their favorite artists , songs , or classical composers .
Pandora currently is the 7th most popular application on Apple ’s iTunes App Store .
According to the Washington Post , last year a federal panel ordered a doubling of per-song performance royalties that Web radio stations had to pay to performers and record companies .
Pandora is a venture capital funded business which currently makes money through web - based advertising .
In the near future , however , Pandora plans to introduce subtle in - stream ads to combat rising costs :
The company will soon start running subtler ads similar to those on National Public Radio .
NASA is not properly emphasizing safety in its design of a new spaceship , and the return - to - the - moon program faces money , morale and leadership problems , an agency safety panel found Monday .
The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel cited " surprising anxiety among NASA employees " about the Constellation moon program and said the project " lacks clear direction . "
Its 143 - page annual report specifically faulted the agency 's design of the Orion crew capsule for not putting safety features first .
Officials in charge of the program , defending the design safety at a news conference , would n't say whether astronauts are among the worried employees .
Astronauts would have to fly in the Orion crew capsule , with a first launch planned by 2015 .
Past NASA spaceships were built with enough backup safety systems " to ensure safety and reliability , " from the start , the report said .
But it said that because of weight problems with the Orion design , NASA has used a different approach , one " without all safeguards included " from the beginning .
In the Orion project , any added safety feature would have to " earn its way in " to the design by justifying that the increased safety was worth the extra cost and weight .
That 's not right , said the safety advisory panel , which includes two former space shuttle astronauts and was created after the deadly 1967 Apollo 1 fire .
The panel said it is " concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation . "
' We 're not done yet , ' NASA manager says
NASA 's Constellation program officials defended the safety of the evolving spaceship design , but acknowledged that some NASA employees are unhappy with it .
Because it is so difficult and expensive to send a rocket to the moon and back , designers start with the minimum necessary and then make improvements that give the greatest return for the money and added weight , said Constellation program manager Jeff Hanley .
" That has made some folks uncomfortable , but guess what ?
We 're not done yet , " Hanley said Monday .
" We are not just blindly cutting out " backup safety systems .
" We 're not going to please everybody , " he said .
" If we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground . "
Hanley said he had not seen the safety panel 's report , which also praised some aspects of the program and looked at the agency in general .
As the safety panel report came out , Constellation program officials announced in a telephone press conference that their own ambitious internal schedule for the first launch of the Orion capsule with astronauts aboard is being pushed back one year for lack of money .
NASA has long promised its first launch of Orion by March 2015 , but aimed internally for September 2013 as a launch date .
Now it 's aiming internally for September 2014 .
" The funding over the next two years became too tight for us , so I had to adjust the schedule for that , " Hanley said .
NASA plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2020 .
Gee , I wonder why , if you have a black man running for high public office  say , Barack Obama or Harold Ford  the opposition feels compelled to run low - life political ads featuring tacky , sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates .
Spare me any more drivel about the high - mindedness of John McCain .
You knew something was up back in March when , in his first ad of the general campaign , Mr. McCain had himself touted as “ the American president Americans have been waiting for . ”
There was nothing subtle about that attempt to position Senator Obama as the Other , a candidate who might technically be American but who remained in some sense foreign , not sufficiently patriotic and certainly not one of us  the “ us ” being the genuine red - white - and - blue Americans who the ad was aimed at .
Since then , Senator McCain has only upped the ante , smearing Mr. Obama every which way from sundown .
On Wednesday , The Washington Post ran an extraordinary front - page article that began :
“ For four days , Senator John McCain and his allies have accused Senator Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him , despite no evidence that the charge is true . ”
What if I told you that a prominent global political figure in recent months has proposed : abrogating key features of his government 's contracts with energy companies ; unilaterally renegotiating his country 's international economic treaties ; dramatically raising marginal tax rates on the " rich " to levels not seen in his country in three decades ( which would make them among the highest in the world ) ; and changing his country 's social insurance system into explicit welfare by severing the link between taxes and benefits ?
The first name that came to mind would probably not be Barack Obama , possibly our nation 's next president .
Yet despite his obvious general intelligence , and uplifting and motivational eloquence , Sen .
Obama reveals this startling economic illiteracy in his policy proposals and economic pronouncements .
From the property rights and rule of ( contract ) law foundations of a successful market economy to the specifics of tax , spending , energy , regulatory and trade policy , if the proposals espoused by candidate Obama ever became law , the American economy would suffer a serious setback .
To be sure , Mr. Obama has been clouding these positions as he heads into the general election and , once elected , presidents sometimes see the world differently than when they are running .
Some cite Bill Clinton 's move to the economic policy center following his Hillary health - care and 1994 Congressional election debacles as a possible Obama model .
But candidate Obama starts much further left on spending , taxes , trade and regulation than candidate Clinton .
A move as large as Mr. Clinton 's toward the center would still leave Mr. Obama on the economic left .
Also , by 1995 the country had a Republican Congress to limit President Clinton 's big government agenda , whereas most political pundits predict strengthened Democratic majorities in both Houses in 2009 .
Because newly elected presidents usually try to implement the policies they campaigned on , Mr. Obama 's proposals are worth exploring in some depth .
I 'll discuss taxes and trade , although the story on his other proposals is similar .
First , taxes .
The table nearby demonstrates what could happen to marginal tax rates in an Obama administration .
Mr. Obama would raise the top marginal rates on earnings , dividends and capital gains passed in 2001 and 2003 , and phase out itemized deductions for high income taxpayers .
He would uncap Social Security taxes , which currently are levied on the first $ 102,000 of earnings .
The result is a remarkable reduction in work incentives for our most economically productive citizens .
I bet you dollar to donuts that Bryn Mickle of The Flint Journal had a lot of fun writing that headline and lede ;)

Apparently sagging jeans is the new menace - last year , authorities in Mansfield , Louisiana , also .. er , cracked down , on the fashion phenomenon .
Anyone here understand why people wear jeans down their butt ?
It sure looks silly to me , but what do I know , I 'm a fuddy - duddy .
In the last few days I ’ve been trying to raise awareness in the Atheosphere , to the fact that the Bloggers Choice Awards are in progress and more specifically , that we do not have any Atheist or irreligious presence .
Indeed , last year , all the top positions of the “ Best Religion Blog ” category where taken over by Christians and this year seems to be turning out very much the same .
Thus I took it upon myself to attempt and remedy that .
Initially I nominated some of my favorite Atheism blogs but even though I tried to notify the people running them in order to place some banner or inform their readers , I was largely ignored .
I even tried emailing Pharyngula , who apparently loves crashing polls , to let his readers know .
But there was no response …
Nevertheless , I then had a better idea :
This year , not only should we attempt to get an Atheist Blog to the top of the Best Religion Blog category , but we should do it in the most extravagant way possible .
To this end , I nominated The Antichristian Phenomenon as I do n’t think there ’s a better way to be more “ in your face ” than this 😉
The ACP is , of course , not the only blog I ’ve nominated and ever since I ’ve started writing about this , many others have joined me and nominated their own choices .
This does not hurt as at all since you are allowed to vote as many times as you wish .
Below you will find a list of all the relevant blogs that are currently nominated along with possibly other links of interest .
If you do n’t want to visit all of these one by one , just head over to my profile and you ’ll see them listed in an easy - to - vote format .
Currently the ACP is the one leading in the Religion category and it ’s my personal choice for the top , just because of the LULZ that will ensue .
However I do not mind if some of the more heavyweight ones surpass it .
I ’ve voted all of them up in any case .
Unfortunately we still have too few votes .
To achieve the top we need at least 250 votes and we have only managed to gather 20 by now .
If you like this idea and want to help further than that , then there is another way : Spread the word .
Currently I ’m pretty much the only one pushing for this and I just do n’t see any excitement .
I am aware of the “ Herding Cats ” problem plaguing the “ Atheist movement ” but seriously , this is ridiculous .
We ca n’t even waste 5 minutes doing a symbolic action ?
Anyway , the best way to spread the word would be , of course , blogging 🙂 Currently only the Psychodiva has made a small mention of this but I ’m certain that if people larger than me talk about it , it will trigger the necessary reaction .
Another way would be to mention it in your own groups .
I ’v already posted this in The ACP Forum and the newly fledged Atheist Nexus .
If you ’re at any other place with Atheist presence , consider making a post similar to these and if you have more rights , sending a simple PM to all members to let them know .
Lastly , if you are a nominee , consider placing the Brag code widgets in your sidebars to let your visitors know to lend you a leg up .
Let the Religion Awards Coup begin !

Putting One Over on Europe How EU Leaders Are Trying to Rescue the Lisbon Treaty
Last week 's summit in Brussels failed to resolve the EU crisis caused by the Irish " no " to the Lisbon Treaty .
But Europe 's politicians are determined to avoid asking the people their opinion .
And they are right to do so .
Incentives
- $ 1,000 per month to enlist before graduation
- Help pay for college
- $ 40,000 enlistment bonus
- Waiver for recruits who have an arrest record
Tenth - graders swarmed around recruiter Dwayne DeVane as he handed out American flags , water bottles , bumper stickers , key chains and the most sought - after treasures -- decks of cards bearing the U.S. Army logo .
It was career day at Corcoran High School in Syracuse .
While students paid scant attention to representatives of some big local employers , such as National Grid and Iroquois Nursing Home , the fatigue - wearing DeVane drew a steady crowd for two hours .
" When you go into the Army , do they really pay for your school ? " asked 16 - year - old Phylicia Coley .
" Your schooling will be covered , " DeVane assured her .
The Army 's pitch is resonating with young men and women in Upstate New York , even as the war in Iraq drags into its sixth year and becomes increasingly unpopular .
The Army 's Syracuse Recruiting Battalion persuaded more people to " Go Army " in each of the last two years -- about 2,300 in 2006 and 2,200 in 2007 -- than it did in 2003 , 2004 or 2005 .
" This part of the country has done very well for us , " said Maj .
Gen.
Thomas Bostick , the Army 's national recruiting commander , during a Feb. 29 visit to the region .
With regular Army troops and reservists routinely being deployed multiple times in combat zones in Iraq or Afghanistan , recruiters are under pressure to build the Army this year by 80,000 new regular troops and 26,500 reservists .
Recruiters pitch the Army as the place to find adventure , receive cash bonuses and pay for college .
But with more than 4,100 American military personnel killed in Iraq , it 's not always an easy sell .
" Parents always want to protect and guide their kids , " said Sgt. 1st Class Peter Palumb , a recruiter from Chittenango .
" Our recruiters have to overcome a lot of misconceptions about the risks .
Today , it 's still a good deal ; there 's just a little more risk involved . "
" To recruit an all - volunteer force in a time of war and maintain a decent quality individual coming in , it 's hard , " said Palumb , the top recruiter of Army reservists in Upstate New York .
Later this summer , the Army plans to tempt Syracuse - area residents with $ 40,000 bonuses to help them buy a house or start a business if they sign up for a five - year hitch with Uncle Sam .
High school seniors already are receiving $ 1,000 per month , up to $ 10,000 , if they enlist before they graduate .
The Army also is accepting more recruits with arrest records .
In the Syracuse Battalion , the number of recruits with records has tripled since 2003 .
Last year , one in 10 of the battalion 's recruits needed a " moral waiver " to join .
Recruits with moral waivers are not hardened criminals , said Col. George Lumpkins , commander of the Syracuse Battalion for the past two years .
He said he recently approved a waiver for a young man who , as a high school junior , had helped steal 18 pumpkins from a farmer 's field while joy - riding with friends .
" I generally call the applicant and ask , ' What were you thinking about ?
Why did you do that ? ' "
Lumpkins said .
" Then I say , ' Yeah , I think you should enter ' or ' No , you have more growing up to do . ' "
Lumpkins commands a force of about 200 recruiters who cover a 28,000 - square - mile territory stretching from Utica to Buffalo and Wilkes - Barre , Pa. , to Potsdam .
His battalion faces a stiff challenge : by the end of the fiscal year , on Sept. 30 , sign up more new soldiers than it has in any year since the United States invaded Iraq .
From Upstate , the Army wants 2,015 new regular enlistees and 652 reservists , for a total of 2,667 .
The battalion probably wo n't meet those targets , Lumpkins said .
The Army gave the Syracuse Battalion a tougher mission -- an unrealistic one , Lumpkins said -- because of the successes it has had in the last few years .
The battalion 's past results are due in part to this region 's strong ties to the military , he said .
" There was a military influence here , " he said .
" There was an Air Force base in Rome for a long time .
There are Lockheed Martin , Department of Defense contracting agencies .
And of course you have Fort Drum 70 miles up the road . "
Recruiters find most of their prospects using lists from school districts containing the names , phone numbers and addresses of high school juniors and seniors .
Districts were required by the 2002 No Child Left Behind law to provide that information to the military .
Parents and students can sign a form preventing school officials from releasing the information , but most do n't .
In the Syracuse City School District , 10 percent of the city 's 2,000 juniors and seniors told the district not to release their contact information to the armed forces .
Like a telemarketer , recruiters make dozens of cold calls to teenagers each day .
" Some people , we get them on the phone , and they are not friendly , " Lumpkins said .
" Some of these 17 - and 18 - year - olds can be pretty harsh . "
" When the young person says , ' No , I 'm not interested , ' we take their name off , " Lumpkins said .
" If they say , ' I 'm not interested now , maybe later , ' we code it for follow - up . "
DeVane said he also mines for potential recruits at community centers , Syracuse Crunch games and high school sports events , rock concerts and at Wal - Mart , K - Mart and convenience stores .
He said he usually talks to about 25 young men and women per day .
His target is two sign - ups per month .
If it 's the last day of the month , and he 's coming up short , DeVane heads to Carousel Center .
" You run into the most people at the mall , " DeVane said .
Cicero -North Syracuse High School has been one of the Army 's most fertile recruiting sites in Upstate New York , Lumpkins said .
In the C - NS class of about 727 seniors expected to graduate Friday , five students enlisted early in the Army .
David D'Eredita Jr. , 18 , who will report July 9 for basic training at Fort Benning , Ga. , said a recruiter first contacted him after he signed up to receive a free Army T - shirt on the Army 's Web site ,
www.goarmy.com
.
Recruiters for the armed forces and military academies are invited into C - NS every Monday so that students can talk to them during lunch .
Recruiters rely on high school guidance counselors to steer students to them .
At Corcoran , the Army can count on counselor Steve Snook , a Vietnam - era veteran .
The Army sent Snook and 24 other teachers and guidance counselors from Upstate New York on an all - expenses - paid , four - day trip in March to Fort Jackson in Columbia , S.C .
The event showcased the training and job skills the Army offers teenagers just out of high school .
" For disadvantaged inner-city kids , it 's great , " Snook said of the Army .
" For someone who needs money for college , it should be at the top of things you should consider .
They 're giving away crazy money now . "
The Montgomery GI Bill is one of the biggest selling points the Army has , Lumpkins said .
Nine out of 10 people the Syracuse Battalion recruited into the regular Army last year had no college degrees .
The Army markets itself to high schoolers as a way to pay for college .
That 's why Coley , the Corcoran 10th - grader with an A average , said she is considering the Army .
" That 's the most important consideration , " said Coley .
" I want to be a psychiatrist .
I want to go to a good school . "
The GI Bill provides soldiers who have served at least three years with an average of $ 6,600 per year in education benefits , said Kimberly Hunter , press secretary to Sen.
James Webb , D - Va. , who introduced the latest expansion of GI Bill benefits that passed Congress in the last month .
Soldiers can receive a maximum of $ 39,636 for four years of education benefits through the program , the Army says .
But tuition , room and board , and fees at the State University College at Oswego cost $ 15,605 per year .
In most cases , GI Bill benefits do n't come close to covering the costs of attending college full - time , said John View , director of financial aid at the State University College of Environmental Science and Forestry .
That 's not the message DeVane gave Corcoran students .
'' He said the Army pays for everything , " Coley said after talking to the recruiter .
DeVane , who is 27 , served in Iraq for a year and has been a recruiter in Syracuse for two years .
He 's been taking classes online through the University of Maryland .
He said he has not had to pay a dime for his college classes .
" You get enough money for school each year , " DeVane said .
A spokesman in the Army Recruiting Command 's public affairs office said recruiters should not imply the GI Bill would cover all the costs of college without knowing what school a potential soldier plans to attend and the price of attending that school .
In recent weeks , the Senate and House have approved increasing GI Bill tuition benefits from $ 1,101 per month to a level that covers four years of college up to the level of the most expensive in - state public school , projected to be a monthly average of $ 1,700 .
D'Eredita said he eventually hopes to take advantage of the GI Bill , go to college and become a history teacher .
But he said he signed up for an eight - year hitch as an airborne Ranger without paying much attention to what his Army salary would be , the amount of his bonus , or what education benefits he can earn .
" I always wanted to do it .
Since I was a kid , " D'Eredita said .
" It 's the most opportunity for excitement . "

Google has teamed up with Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane to run a number of short cartoons over its AdSense network .
With thousands of web sites picked for the distribution deal and serious advertising dollars lining up , the search giant hopes to break new ground in Internet video distribution .
Dubbed the " Google Content Network , " this service will run 50 short episodes of Seth MacFarlane ’s Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy across thousands of web sites known to be hangouts for his target audience , comprised mostly of young men .
Episodes wo n't last longer than two minutes , according to the New York Times , with one cited episode called " Mac Cow Disease " clocking in at 38 seconds .
Advertising may appear in the form of preroll spots or " lower third " banners during the episode .
Media Rights Capital , a production company that invests around $ 400 million each year in movies , TV , and Internet content , will be handling the advertising inventory .
Each time a viewer clicks on a " Cavalcade " video or ad , advertisers will pay a fee that gets split between MacFarlane , Google , Media Rights , and the site hosting the video .
Media Rights declined to offer details on pricing for ads in the " Cavalcade " series , saying only that their rates are " significantly higher " than if the same ad was placed in AdSense .
MacFarlane explained a few reasons by his decisions to work with Google on an Internet - only TV series , as well as why the episodes are so short .
If you are at all familiar with Family Guy 's history or even the recent seasons , MacFarlane 's distaste for the FCC 's tight policing of TV content is no secret .
" I just felt I could be a lot more honest on the Internet , " MacFarlane explained to the Times .
The first idea for the series was to write 20 - minute episodes , then chop them up into shorter segments .
" But that seemed a little odd and a little pointless , " MacFarlane said .
" Why would n't you just release the whole thing at once ? "
Seth McFarlane
After Google provided data on the ways Internet users watch video on the web and how long short their attention spans are , MacFarlane scrapped the original project and developed the Cavalcade bite - sized episodes which he describes as " animated versions of the one - frame cartoons you might see in The New Yorker , only edgier . "
While Google tested the waters with its Google Content Network in May with a deal to distribute real estate listings from the Washington Post , this Cavalcade venture is a significant step in original Internet distribution both for Google and the TV industry .
Some networks like Comedy Central have dipped their toes in the Internet - only distribution pool , but Cavalcade is the first high - dive attempt with major funding in both advertising and production , not to mention a well - known celebrity taking the plunge .
If successful , Google and MacFarlane could manage to shake up both the advertising and Internet - based content distribution industries .
Short , entertaining video clips that are distributed across thousands of web sites ( instead of stuck at a specific destination ) could very well attract the critical mass of eyeballs needed for advertisers .
Cavalcade could also have a lasting effect on how writers and producers approach video content in the future .
If Google and McFarlane 's experiment in bite - sized , highly distributable content pays off , it could lead to a change the way writers think about and structure the stories they tell .
The UK SAP user group today called on the German software giant 's customers to scrutinise plans to force them to cough up almost a third more for their contract .
The group wants companies affected to examine the changes in detail in the hope they 'll be unhappy enough about a real - terms 30 per cent costs increase to kick up a stink .
SAP announced plans to railroad customers onto higher - spec support packages earlier this month .
Costs are set to be ratcheted from 17 to 22 per cent of contract value , effective immediately for all new customers and to be phased in by 2012 for everyone else .
Alan Bowling , chairman of the UK SAP users group , said : " We understand that if SAP is to provide more comprehensive support then it has to charge more for it .
However , many of our members may not want or need this extra level of support and therefore are reacting negatively to having a new support product and the associated increase in costs forced upon them . "
In particular , the UK users group and its German counterpart reckon the new support will be more than many small and medium - sized businesses need .
Feedback on SAP 's attempt to force them to pay more has been " hugely negative " , Bowling said .
He called on SAP management to rethink strategy sharpish .
Analysts estimate the price hike could generate an extra € 1bn annually by the time all its customers have been squeezed , so some pretty loud complaining is likely to be required .
We 've put Bowling 's comments to SAP and will update this story if we get a response . ®
After Mark Bittman mentioned my post about minimalist food selections in his popular New York Times food blog , I was inundated with questions about minimalist cooking .
Thoughts about kitchen setups , basic equipment , and other such questions were shared and requested , and eventually I came to realize that it'd be useful to write a follow - up article outlining what goes in a basic kitchen setup for those getting into cooking at home .
While I've
addressed this in the past , I felt a more complete and detailed list was in order .
Cooking at home is the most effective way to minimize your food budget .
Almost every meal you cook at home will be less expensive ( and often quicker ) than a similar meal out on the town .
Doing it consistently will not only save you money consistently , but it 'll build up your skills in the kitchen .
The only problem ?
The setup cost is usually quite stiff .
You do need quite a number of items .
Fortunately , you do n't need quite as much as you think , and most of the stuff you do need is cheap .
Here 's the equipment I 'd get for a basic kitchen .
An oven and stove top and a refrigerator
These are the basic appliances you 'll need to even attempt cooking at home .
Without them , this article is moot .
If your apartment / home comes with them , just use the ones already there until they wear out .
If you must buy new , buy durable .
Do the research , check out Consumer Reports , and follow their recommendations .
Energy efficiency is also vital - use the Energy Guide stickers and look for the EnergyStar logo when comparing models .
I also strongly encourage you to avoid getting a flat - surface stove top if you 're unfamiliar with cooking , as you will have many boil - overs as you learn and the top can be nearly impossible to clean .
NO microwave " Blasphemy ! " many will shout .
I argue that a microwave stunts your ability to learn to cook at home by making it very easy to pop convenience foods in the microwave instead of actually preparing something .
It 's a crutch at first , though it can definitely become a tool later on .
Challenge yourself to no microwave for a year and see how much you learn .
Even better - do it right off the bat and you do n't have the initial cost of buying a microwave .
Tip # 1 : If you can see only a few situations for using it , do n't buy it
So many kitchen items have one use .
Take , for example , the cheese slicer .
It slices cheese .
Period .
Use a knife , or if you grate or slice a lot of things , get a four - in - one box grater .
Do n't waste your money on a cheese slicer unless you slice five pounds of cheese a week .
Any item that does not have uses with a wide variety of foods should be looked at with a very discerning eye .
Basic flatware and eating dishes
Do n't sweat this a bit .
Go to your local department store and go for the low - end stuff for now .
Later on , if you want to " upgrade " to something " classy " ( meaning spending far more for essentially the same functionality of an item ) , go for it .
Just do n't waste your money right out of the chute on hundreds of dollars of flatware .
A cutting board
Get the cheapest one possible - probably a rectangular chunk of plastic for a buck or two .
The entire purpose is to keep your knife from damaging your countertop .
A vegetable peeler
This is one of the very few kitchen " gadgets " that 's worth its salt .
Although you can peel potatoes , zucchini , squash , and so forth with a knife , a vegetable peeler is incredibly efficient at its task .
You can use a knife and / or a box grater in place of this item , but it 's very inexpensive ( any old one will do ) and the efficiency it adds to many food preparations ( especially in a vegetable - heavy diet ) is immense .
Tip # 2 : Be creative in finding workable substitutes
There are countless clever little items for the kitchen that seem like a good idea , but can usually be substituted for easily if you think outside the kitchen a bit .
A meat tenderizing hammer ?
If you prepare meat every day of the week , sure - otherwise , just use the rubber mallet out in the garage with your meat under paper or plastic .
A large pot , a small pot , and a skillet
You need three pots , that 's all .
The large pot 's for cooking stews , boiling beans and pasta , and so forth .
The smaller pot 's perfect for making sauces , boiling small amounts of vegetables , and so on .
A single large skillet will be your primary stove top cooking tool .
Do n't skimp and get teflon - coated pans or else you 'll just be tossing them in a couple of years when the teflon begins to chip off .
Instead , invest now and get some hard - anodized aluminum ones , especially the small pot and the skillet .
You 'll still be using good ones when you retire .
Two very simple baking pans Get a 9 " by 13 " cake - style pan and then a French oven or casserole - style pan .
90 % of the time , you can get by with just one of these ( I 'd get the latter one ) , but that other 10 % will leave you aching , when you need to have two items in the oven at once .
A box grater
You can get a metal box grater for a buck , and there are all sorts of little uses for it - slicing and grating cheese or vegetables , making breadcrumbs out of an old loaf of bread , and so on .
Amazing little utility item for just a few pennies .
Tip # 3 : Just starting out ?
This stuff makes perfect gift requests
Almost everything on this list makes for a perfect bridal shower , wedding , or graduation gift .
If you have a registry for any such purpose , put these items on it and get gifts that are actually useful instead of just tossing stuff on there without thought or pattern .
Two knives and a honing steel A paring knife and a chef 's knife will handle almost every cutting need you 'll have in your kitchen .
Go to your friendly local department store and grip each one .
Find the one that fits best in your hand , regardless of price , and buy it .
Different hands grip a bit differently , so it may be that the most expensive knife is the best fit for you or the cheapest knife is the best fit .
Just get the chef 's knife that fits your grip the best and the paring knife that fits your grip the best .
You should also snag a honing steel .
It 's easy to use and makes a world of difference in keeping your knives usable .
It does not sharpen your knife , but it does keep the edge on your knife from warping over time .
Just use the honing steel twice on each side before you use the knife .
A magnetic knife rack
This is basically just a long magnetic strip you can hang somewhere high .
Since it 's a big magnet , it 'll attract the blades of your knives and allow them to hang there , without the edge touching anything at all .
This reduces the slow wear on the blade of your knife .
It 's cheap and definitely the right way to go if you 're childless - if you have children , though , this may be an unsafe temptation for the little ones .
A baking sheet Something to toss things on when you bake them in the oven , from pizza and vegetables to cookies and bread .
Again , just get the cheap one - an air bake one is a nice $ 4 extravagance , but not vital .
A loaf pan
If you 're going to bake bread consistently or like to make meatloafs or other small casseroles , a loaf pan is perfect and costs only a buck or two .
Tip # 4 : Keep the food basics on hand , always
What about the food ?
I recommend keeping plenty of olive oil and a well - stocked spice rack on hand , no matter what .
Both are very cheap and both are used in almost anything you make .
A food processor
This is the least essential item on this list , but it 's incredibly useful , particularly as you move more towards cooking consistently complex meals at home .
A good one can retexturize almost anything , from chopping and grinding to juicing and pureeing .
I favor the KitchenAid KPF 750 , as does Consumer Reports .
This is a great housewarming gift for someone genuinely interested in cooking .
Plastic reusable leftover containers - and masking tape
For food storage in the fridge ( leftovers , stuff prepared in advance , etc. ) , just get a bunch of low - end reusable storage containers and a roll of masking tape .
You can use the tape to identify the contents and the date of preparation on the lid so you do n't have to wonder what forgotten mystery item X is in the fridge .
We still use the ones we got for a wedding gift more than five years ago .
Tip # 5 : When in doubt , always go cheap
If you 're standing there trying to choose between two similar items , always go for the cheap one .
For starters , you do n't know for certain how much you 'll use the item , so an expensive one may be a complete waste of money .
For second , unless you know the item cold , the quality difference is likely pretty unclear to you .
Third , if you do decide that you use the item a lot and can actually see a compelling reason for the higher quality version , you can always upgrade later .
So save your money now and go for the cheap one .
These items are all you 'll need to prepare , eat , and store almost anything that 's realistic in a home kitchen .
If you do come up with additional needs , do n't be afraid to think outside the box a little bit before you turn to the store - you 'll be surprised at how many nifty solutions you have around the house .
The real key is getting started - do n't just buy this stuff to have it on hand .
Use it .
Try starting with very simple things , like scrambled eggs and grilled cheese sandwiches , then progress on to things like rosemary chicken .
To keep it cheap , start with inexpensive basic foods and master their variations .
You 'll find that before long both your wallet and your palate are happy .

This vast regime of pain and terror , inflicted in the name of a war on terror , rests in large part on the untested belief of a few high - ranking leaders in Washington that torture is an effective tool for eliciting valuable information .
But there is , Mayer persuasively argues , little available evidence that this assumption is true , and a great deal of evidence from numerous sources ( including the United States military and the F.B.I. ) that torture is , in fact , one of the least effective methods of gathering information and a likely source of false confessions .
Among the many cases Mayer and other journalists have chronicled  including the case of the most notable Al Qaeda operative yet captured , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  the information gleaned from tortured detainees has produced unreliable and often entirely unusable information .
That many of the interrogations were conducted by American servicemen and - women with scant training made the likelihood of success even lower .
( Some of the interrogators had no qualms about what they were doing and welcomed being unconstrained by any laws or rules .
“ It was the Camelot of counterterrorism , ” one officer later told a journalist .
“ We did n’t have to mess with others and it was fun . ”
Others were traumatized by what they had done and seen , and suffered psychologically as a result . )

The architects of this network of secret prisons and secret torture were a small but powerful group within the Bush administration .
Dick Cheney stood at the center of the effort but delegated many of its operations to others .
The vice president ’s counsel ( and later chief of staff ) , David Addington , was a ruthless , bullying enforcer of the strategy , effectively derailing all challenges by claiming that everything had been mandated by the president and by dismissing all legal and moral challenges as naïve and weak .
John
Yoo , a law professor from the University of California , Berkeley , who worked in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , drafted an infamous memo giving legal cover to torture by simply redefining what torture was  virtually anything short of deliberate killing .
George Tenet , the eager - to - please C.I.A. director ; William Haynes , the militant general counsel to the Pentagon ; Alberto Gonzales , the weak and pliable White House counsel who later became attorney general : all played vital roles in the creation and protection of these covert strategies .
At the urging of Cheney  or his surrogate Addington  President Bush nullified the Geneva Conventions and , without publicly stating it , suspended habeas corpus for terror suspects , thus removing two important impediments to torture .
Others worked to undermine the 1984 international Convention Against Torture , which , under American leadership , had provided the first explicit definition of what torture was .
Mayer provides a particularly ghoulish description of James Mitchell , a former military psychologist , who introduced the C.I.A. to a secret military program that had been designed in the 1950s to teach high - risk personnel to withstand torture .
Known as SERE ( Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ) , it rested on the belief that inflicting a controlled level of pain and humiliation on those who might face it in combat would help them survive the real thing if they were captured .
For the C.I.A. after 2001 , SERE became not a tool for resisting torture , but a template for inflicting it  a template soon adopted by interrogators in the far - flung “ black sites ” where detainees were imprisoned .
Mitchell dismissed the arguments of F.B.I. agents that his tactics were ineffective and that he had no experience with the Middle East or Islamic terrorism .
“ Science is science , ” he said .
At one point , the F.B.I. agents collaborating with the C.I.A. on interrogation plans were so alarmed by what they were hearing that they urged their superiors to arrest Mitchell .
Soon after that , they withdrew from the program altogether .
“ We do n’t do that , ” one of the F.B.I. agents said .
“ It ’s what our enemies do ! ”
From the very beginning , there was strong resistance to the regime of torture .
Those who challenged it included journalists like The New York Times ’s James Risen and Scott Shane , The Washington Post ’s Dana Priest , Ron Suskind ( the author of “ The One Percent Doctrine ” ) , The New Yorker ’s Seymour Hersh and Mayer herself ( who scrupulously credits the work of her many colleagues ) .
Other opponents were officials in the State Department , the F.B.I. , the C.I.A. , members of Congress of both parties and many career military officers , including former chiefs of staff .
But as Mayer notes , few of them “ had the temerity to confront Cheney , who clearly was the true source of these policies . ”
Among the most courageous opponents of the use of torture was a small group of lawyers working within the Bush administration  conservative men , loyal Republicans , who in the face of enormous pressure to go along attempted to use the law to stop what they considered a series of policies that were both illegal and immoral : Alberto Mora , the Navy general counsel , who tried to work within the system to stop what he believed were renegade actions ; Jack Goldsmith , who became the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2003 and sought to revoke the Yoo memo of 2002 , convinced that it had violated the law in authorizing what he believed was clearly torture ; and Matthew Waxman , a Defense Department lawyer overseeing detainee issues , who sought ways to stop what he believed to be illegal and dangerous policies .
Waxman summoned a meeting of high - ranking military officers and Defense Department officials ( including the secretaries of the Army , Navy and Air Force ) , all of whom supported the restoration of Geneva Convention protections .
Waxman was quickly hauled up before Addington and told that his efforts constituted “ an abomination . ”
All of these lawyers , and others , soon left the government after being deceived , bullied , thwarted and marginalized by the Cheney loyalists .
" If you 're not outraged , you 're not paying attention . "
So lectures a popular bumper sticker in my university - dominated neighborhood .
And according to an emerging journalistic narrative of this campaign season , ordinary Americans are indeed outraged -- at the Iraq war , at gas prices , and by the fact that their houses are not rising in value .
As a July 4 Associated Press headline put it , " Americans ' unhappy birthday : ' Too much wrong . ' "

At the airport yesterday afternoon , after pulling our luggage off the arrival carousel , we decided we needed a bite to eat .
What the heck … let ’s get something at Burger King .
Divvying up our food items revealed the “ Veg City Airport ” themed artwork on the Burger King paper tray liner .
Burger King is using the airport security screening metaphor – blocking bad people from getting through the gates – as a way to convey that they ( Burger King ) similarly screen for only quality ingredients .
But what the hell is going on in this picture ?
First I saw a nervous looking onion .
Then I noticed it had its pants down .
Then I noticed the angry pickle … and then the examination glove ?!
[ click for larger image ]
It seems that the Onion depicted in this image is n’t a quality ingredient .
Yikes .
The Onion is standing in the middle of the airport with his pants around his ankles while an angry , brawny “ pickle ” slips on a examination glove in preparation for a body cavity search .
I ’ve got so many questions .
In addition to Botox and anti-aging cream ( to make itself look fresher than it actually is and try to sneak into Burger King ’s ingredients ) …
Look at the collection of articles airport Pickle security has dumped out of the Onion ’s bags … ( i.e. Burger King has allowed the artist to depict in the cartoon artwork ) .
( I ’ve zoomed in and flipped the images so they ’d be easier to read )
“ Wet Vegs ” magazine ?
( featuring a topless large - breasted pickle licking her lips )
“ Playveg ” magazine … featuring a half - naked well - endowed carrot pepper .
And a copy of “ Green and Horny ” featuring a big - breasted , topless pickle .
I feel bad for the Onion .
I get that it ’s a “ bad ” vegetable … not the kind Burger King wants to serve … but this treatment is just humiliating .
Joking aside … is this the brand Burger King wants to be ?
The kind that features images of body cavity searches performed on an onion by a “ Village People ” pickle ?
( notice resemblance to Village People character )
The artwork is part of a series called Veg City .
There ’s the Airport , Red Light District , Sniper , and two seasonal versions : New Year ’s Eve and Halloween .
These were created by the BBDO German agency called . start based in Munich , Germany .
( Thanks Ads of the World for the links ) .
Please do n’t misconstrue this post as supporting / creating “ buzz ” for a successful tactic by Burger King .
( Unless , Burger King is positioning itself as the “ Hooters ” of fast food burgers ) .
This Mad Magazine - style execution – while funny and clever – does n’t fit the Burger King I ’ve known .
What is Burger King thinking ?
Update
Via email , I ’ve met the artist who illustrated this project , Christoph Hoppenbrock .
He is quite talented .
You can take a look at his work at Bildbauer.de .
President Bush is coming to town Thursday night to debate John Kerry and try to earn your vote .
But the question emerging now is not whether he should be elected but if he should be impeached for war crimes .
Remember when the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal broke with all those detestable pictures and the administration repeated that it was the fault of a " few bad apples " ?
Well , they were right .
Thankfully , the bad apples have been identified : John Ashcroft , Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , and President Bush .
Bush decided to ignore the federal War Crimes Act , which is punishable by death .
But impeachment will do .
It takes a very high crime to justify removing the president , especially during time of war -- even an unpopular and disastrous war like the one in Iraq .
But Bush , unfortunately , has risen to that height .
I was apprised of the bones of the case by Ray McGovern , one of the brightest and most sensible fellows you 'll ever find .
McGovern is a retired , 27 - year CIA veteran who , during the Reagan administration , gave White House briefings to Bush I . I caught up with the former intelligence analyst last week while he was in town to speak at Florida International University .
" I believe the president is guilty of a crime , " says McGovern , who is a member of a 45 - member group called Former Intelligence Professionals for Sanity .
After researching the case on my own , I 'm convinced it 's not only sound but also compelling .
It begins with a stroke of the president 's pen and ends with the institutionalized torture , sexual humiliation , and , in some cases , murder of men and women in Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison .
It has disgraced our country , stirred hatred against us across the Arab world , and certainly helped spawn more mortal enemies to America .
More than 300 cases of abuse have been reported at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo Bay , and Afghanistan so far .
Dozens of soldiers have been implicated , and the investigations continue .
In May , after the appalling photos of Abu Ghraib came to light , the Bush administration released hundreds of pages of documents in an attempt to vindicate itself .
Instead , the release supplied a noose for the government 's highest officials .
The key memo , signed by Bush on February 7 , 2002 , showed that the president personally issued the order to exempt Taliban detainees from the long - standing and world - honored Geneva Conventions , which set moral and ethical rules for prisoners of war after World War II and are encoded into federal law under the 1996 War Crimes Act .
In the February 7 directive , Bush wrote that Taliban soldiers do n't qualify as prisoners of war .
Instead , he declared them " unlawful combatants , " a new and legally ambiguous designation that strips detainees of many of the Geneva protections .
In short , that move introduced the opportunity for torture .
Since Afghanistan is a party to Geneva , Bush needed a rationale .
White House records show it came from Cheney 's office , Ashcroft 's Justice Department , Rumsfeld 's Defense Department , and Bush 's own chief counsel , Alberto Gonzales .
In a January 22 , 2002 memo , Justice lawyer Jay S. Bybee wrote that the president could " determine that Afghanistan was not a functioning state and therefore the Taliban was not a government . "
Three days after the Bybee memo was sent , White House counsel Gonzales urged the president to exempt the Taliban from Geneva , telling Bush that parts of the conventions were " obsolete " and " quaint . "
Most interestingly , the justice lawyer informed the president that exempting the Taliban would provide U.S. officials protection from prosecution under the War Crimes Act .
" It is difficult to predict the motives of prosecutors and independent counsels who may in the future decide to pursue unwarranted charges based on [ the War Crimes Act ] , " he wrote .
" Your determination would create a reasonable basis in law that [ the act ] does not apply , which would supply a solid defense to any future prosecution . "
Here , Gonzales , in a dazzling display of arrogance , supposed that if Bush decided Geneva does n't apply , then the president and other officials could n't be tried for war crimes .
In reality , the counsel only implicated the White House in a premeditated plan to subvert federal law and commit those crimes .
The State Department , led by Colin Powell , objected to casting aside Geneva , saying it could lead to a backlash against American soldiers and cause outrage in the world .
In the end , Bush tried to have it both ways .
In his February 7 directive , the president stated that , while he has the power to suspend Geneva , the conventions would apply to the Taliban -- until he decided otherwise .
At the same time , he stripped Taliban detainees of their rights as prisoners of war and exempted them from Article 3 of Geneva , which specifies that prisoners must be treated humanely and protects them from torture and other " outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment . "
It 's a case of murky presidential doublespeak , but a key statement comes toward the end of the two - page memo .
" U.S. armed forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely , and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity [ italics added ] , in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva , " Bush wrote .
It logically follows , then , that if it is n't deemed appropriate or consistent with military necessity , then the principles of Geneva could be tossed , literally , to the dogs .
After Bush signed his historic order , Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay were subjected to treatment outside the Geneva Conventions .
That alone is an impeachable offense , argues McGovern , since the president authorized those soldiers to break Geneva and , therefore , the federal War Crimes Act .
" This is really , really important -- Americans are n't supposed to torture people , " he says .
" [ White House counsel ]
Gonzales says there is a reasonable basis in law where they can escape prosecution , but there is n't a decent lawyer that agrees with that . "
Indeed , more than 130 prominent attorneys -- including 12 former federal judges and eight former presidents of the American Bar Association -- sent the president a letter last month denouncing his decision and alleging that the memos show that the administration sought " to circumvent long established and universally acknowledged principles of law and common decency . "
It went on to say that the White House and Justice Department " ignored and misinterpreted the U.S. Constitution and laws , international treaties and rules of international law . "
" I think there very well may have been laws broken , " says Neal Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who 's involved in the ABA .
But it 's the tie to Abu Ghraib that I believe makes the president 's actions impeachable .
And that connection was made crystal clear last month by an independent panel formed by Rumsfeld , of all people .
The panel , led by former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger , determined that unlawful interrogation tactics " migrated " from Guantanamo Bay to Iraq .
Most chillingly for the president , the so - called Schlesinger Report revealed that Lt. Gen.
Ricardo Sanchez specifically used Bush 's February 7 directive to justify the use of dogs and other unlawful techniques at Abu Ghraib .
" Interrogators and lists of techniques circulated from Guantanamo and Afghanistan to Iraq , " Schlesinger wrote in the August 24 report .
There you have it .
Not only did Bush break federal law but his actions led to Abu Ghraib , creating a mess that will haunt this country long after Bush has vacated the Oval Office .
Yet the media , while sporadically reporting the facts , have failed to question whether the president 's actions were legal ( forget about any mention of the i word ) .
But that is n't surprising , especially considering the mainstream media 's failure to call Bush on the deception used in the buildup to war .
And the media have never been known to let a gravely serious scandal get in the way of an election .
Remember Watergate and Iran-Contra ?
Democrats are even more to blame than reporters for letting Bush get away with his arrogant and costly decision .
Impeachment , after all , is a legislative function .
" We have a one - party government right now , " McGovern complains .
" We have a Republican majority in both houses of Congress and a Republican president and a Republican judiciary .
Democrats do n't want to be seen as retarding something that is necessary in the war on terror .
But some gutsy Democrat should go for it . "
And that 's all it would take , one courageous congressman -- you listening , Robert Wexler ? -- to file a resolution for impeachment .
Even with all the damning facts on the table , the House would vote against it , just as surely as it voted to authorize the foolhardy debacle in Iraq .
But at least the people might hear the truth .
Tesla Motors has hired one of Detroit 's sharpest engineers to spearhead development of the four - door electric sedan it says will be rolling off an assembly line by the end of 2010 .
The Northern California - based automotive upstart has found in Mike Donoughe a seasoned hand who knows how to build cars , and by naming him VP of manufacturing and engineering , shows that it wants to dominate the emerging premium - EV market .
Donoughe , 49 , has spent the past 24 years at Chrysler , where among other things he led the top - secret " Project D " charged with creating a car that might save the troubled company .
Analysts said his depth of experience and contacts within the industry will be invaluable to Tesla as it develops the $ 70,000 sedan it 's calling " Model S . "
" He ’s got intimate knowledge of vehicle design , planning and manufacturing " Aaron Bragman , an industry analyst with Global Insight , told Wired.com .
" He has tremendous contacts among suppliers and others in the industry .
They 're likely to end up with a better product than they would have otherwise . "
Donoughe was among Chrysler 's most talented engineers .
His résumé includes working on its best - selling minivans and two years leading passenger - car development at Mercedes - Benz .
Chrysler tapped him earlier this year to head a top - secret program to replace the Sebring and Avenger models .
He quit in March in one of several high - profile departures that came after private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management took over last year .
" He could have gotten a job at any of the automakers , " Bragman says .
" For him to end up at Tesla is surprising . "
Donoughe will lead all aspects of Tesla 's vehicle engineering and manufacturing except the electric drivetrain and oversee more than 100 people .
He said in a statement that he took the job " because I am enthusiastic about Tesla 's objective to integrate their disruptive EV technology into mainstream automobiles . "
Tesla's CEO , Ze 'ev Drori , said Donoughe 's " immediate priorities are to ensure that production of the Tesla Roadster runs smoothly and efficiently and to drive the continued development of our next car . "
Tesla started building Roadsters in March .
Darryl Siry , the company 's VP of marketing , sales and service , tells Wired.com about two dozen have been built and almost half that many delivered to customers .
The company is still working on an improved transmission that will be retrofitted into earlier cars once it 's introduced later this year .
The goal is to have 40 Roadsters rolling off the assembly line each week by the beginning of next year .
Siry says the company plans to fill several more executive positions and could name a CFO within days .
As The Wall Street Journal notes , Donoughe 's move to Tesla is another example of a big - name auto executive jumping ship to join a start - up .
Murat Guenak , former head of design for Volkswagen AG , joined Mindset AG last year ; the company is working on a plug - in hybrid it hopes to launch next year .
Gordon Murray , the renowned Formula 1 designer behind the McLaren F1 and Caparo T1 supercars , has launched Gordon Murray Design Ltd. to create the T25 city car .

While preparing to lead a discussion of the merits of trade with first - year students last fall , I came across a depressing headline in the Wall Street Journal .
At the time , the Republicans were expressing skepticism about free trade .
As a signatory to a petition to protest Hoover - era trade policies ( like the Smoot - Hawley Tariff ) , I was dismayed .
The implications of a shift away from free trade are several , first for wealth creation and second for environmental conservation .
One of the " key elements " of economics is that trade creates wealth .
[ 1 ]
Wealth is whatever people value , but trade allows us to produce either more material goods with the same resources or the same material goods with fewer resources .
While it does not profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul , trade increases our ability to produce goods and services and therefore increases our range of opportunities .
One barrier to trade is the rent - seeking activity of various interest groups .
Specialization is taken to be " good " for firms in the comparatively advantaged industry , but bad for those outside that industry .
In his essay " Ricardo's Difficult Idea , " Paul Krugman explains the logic of comparative advantage by pointing out that wages are set in national labor markets .
Thus , factors of production will flow to the industry in which returns are highest — and this will be the industry in which the area has a comparative advantage .
Suppose , for example , that we further open trade with Canada and allow more Canadian maple syrup imports while exporting more oranges .
In the short run , it may well be the case that domestic syrup producers suffer some hardship , but over time , resources will flow toward production of the commodity in which Americans have a comparative advantage — in this case , oranges .
Incomes will be higher : both American and Canadian workers can consume more syrup and more oranges using the same resources .
Trade here is relevant to a political and cultural movement that has been gathering steam in the United States and abroad : the movement to eat locally grown foods on the grounds that doing so conserves resources .
I remember reading an article in the New York Times several years ago in which the author questioned the wisdom of shipping apricots from California when they could be grown in New York .
The key buzzword here is " sustainability . "
The idea is that certain kinds of agriculture , particularly locally grown organic , are " sustainable " while other forms of agriculture , such as large industrial farms , are not .
However , the net " carbon footprint " from an orange grown in California and shipped from Memphis is likely to be lower than the net carbon footprint from an orange grown in Memphis .
Indeed , this is almost certainly the case as oranges would likely grow in Memphis only under very specific greenhouse conditions .
Let 's suppose that people do decide to " buy local " with the goal of saving the world and reducing their carbon footprint .
This will increase the demand for locally grown foods , but it will also have an unintended and likely deleterious consequence ; it will increase the demand for farm implements and labor .
Since the decision to buy locally is essentially the decision to forsake comparative advantage , every unit of agricultural output will be more resource intensive than it would be under specialization , division of labor , and trade .
In other words , each additional unit of output will require more resources than it would under trade .
To take a concrete example , this means that the cultivation of spinach in Memphis will require more fertilizer , more rakes , more tillers , and more hoes than the cultivation of spinach in California .
Producing these implements will ( again ) require resources , which will require specialization and trade .
We could push the problem back a step and say that we should only use locally produced implements , but we can only regress so far before we run into an obvious problem of definition ( how " local " is " local " ? ) , resource constraints ( different regions have different natural endowments ) , and widespread destruction ( denuded forests and gouged lands as people assemble locally produced stone tools for cultivation ) .
" Buy local " is , at its logical limit , a prescription for poverty and starvation .
This illustrates another " key element " of economics .
According to Henry Hazlitt , the " art of economics " consists of tracing the effect of any policy to all groups rather than its effect on specialized interests .
Buying local may be good for some local farmers and it may soothe the conscience of the social progressive , but the longer - run , hidden consequences will be undesirable and injurious .
An obvious objection is this : " why do you have to eat spinach ? "
Fair enough — perhaps Memphians should forsake spinach .
But spinach is one of nature 's healthiest foods , as I understand it .
Getting the same nutrients from other sources — locally cultivated sources — would require more resources .
This produces exactly the same problem .
Indeed , research has shown that while higher prices of fatty foods reduce their consumption , they also result in exacerbated micronutrient deficiencies .
It appears that there is indeed no free lunch .
We may be tempted at this point to throw our hands up in frustration .
Calculating our individual " carbon footprint " is an intractably complex task with lots and lots of moving parts .
However , if private - property rights are well defined , all of these calculations are done by the price mechanism .
The long - run costs are factored into the price .
The short - run costs are factored into the price .
In the absence of externalities ( and we will get to this in a minute ) , all relevant costs and benefits are factored into market prices .
These prices , as well as potentially profitable opportunities , guide production and make all of the calculations for us .
Caveat : Externalities and the Price Mechanism
The key phrase in the preceding paragraph is " in the absence of externalities . "
The astute reader will note that in the presence of externalities , whereby one person 's actions lead to costs or benefits for others that are not reflected in the market price , the market will produce an " inefficient " allocation of resources .
Environmental externalities are the classic example , and they are at the heart of the " local foods " movement .
Suppose that we ship grapes from Chile on a gigantic , oil - burning ship .
Since oceans are not privately owned , ocean pollution will not be reflected in the price of grapes , nor will the release of carbon into the atmosphere , which will supposedly contribute to global warming .
Thus the market price will not fully reflect the costs and benefits of doing business .
Caveat to the Caveat : Transaction Costs and Political Economy
Nonetheless , the theoretical problem of externalities is not by itself sufficient to suggest that government intervention is warranted .
First , we have to consider transaction costs , which are the costs of measuring the valuable attributes of goods and services , as well as the costs of specifying and enforcing contracts .
Actually measuring the damage is costly in and of itself , perhaps even more expensive than the original damage .
Second , we have to consider the political - economic ramifications .
It is no secret that money buys influence in politics , and it is also no secret that environmental regulations are likely to work to the benefit of the organization with the most influence .
It has been common practice for firms — often operating under the guise of consumer protection — to use government regulation as a bludgeon to reduce competition .
In other words , the costs of political solutions may well exceed the environmental benefits .
Yet Another Caveat : Good Reasons to Buy Local
There is one great reason to buy local , however : quality .
My wife and I planted tomatoes last summer , and I believe our considerable efforts yielded approximately fifteen tomatoes .
Assuming that the only costs were the cost of the plants and the pots , we 're coming in at over $ 1 per tomato .
Add in the cost of our time and you end up with a figure that is considerably higher .
Those were some very , very good tomatoes — but they were n't cheap .
One of the principles of economics is that trade creates wealth .
However , the objection is often raised that wealth creation is not the most important thing in the world ; we must consider environmental impact and all sorts of other considerations .
Often overlooked , however , is the principle that trade also conserves valuable resources .
This is part and parcel of what it means for trade to create wealth : we economize on scarce resources , which can then be used in other lines of employment .
Economics is about how people face tradeoffs .
In the case of trade policy , however , it is possible to " have it all , " in that we can have higher economic growth , more people , and a cleaner environment .
Trade creates wealth — and trade also conserves scarce resources .
The unintended consequences of policies designed to obstruct trade exacerbate the problems they are intended to solve .
California voters remain closely divided on the concept of gay marriage , but a significant majority of likely voters oppose a measure to ban it , according to a poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California .
Proposition 8 , which would amend the state Constitution to allow marriage only between a man and a woman , is trailing 40 % to 54 % among likely voters , according to the poll .
In a separate question , pollsters asked respondents if they support or oppose allowing gay men and lesbians to marry .
On that question , Californians were evenly split , 47 % to 47 % .
Mark Baldassare , president of the policy institute , said the election probably will be close , in part because of the even split in the general attitude toward gay marriage , but also because those supporting Proposition 8 were more likely to describe the issue as important to them than were voters on the other side .
The polling , he said , “ shows a deeply divided electorate . ”

Wednesday ’s poll was in line with previous surveys .
Support for Proposition 8 has slipped slightly in the institute ’s poll since a survey last month that showed 51 % of voters against and 42 % in favor .
In other findings , the poll found :
* Barack Obama was leading John McCain by 48 % to 39 % among likely voters in the state -- a margin that was down six points since July , with most of the decline coming among self - described independents .
The survey was taken before the Democratic convention began .
* An overwhelming majority , 84 % , say the state ’s budget impasse is a serious problem , but likely voters were more closely divided on solutions .
The largest group , 44 % , favored a mix of spending cuts and tax increases , while 38 % would close the state deficit by cutting spending .
A solution that relied mostly on increasing taxes drew only 8 % support , while 4 % would support borrowing money and running a deficit .

* On abortion , likely voters were divided 47 % in favor , 44 % opposed on Proposition 4 , a measure that would require parents to be notified 48 hours before a minor has an abortion .
Voters rejected similar proposals in 2005 and 2006 .
* Another ballot measure , on legislative redistricting , is drawing support from about four in 10 likely voters .
Proposition 11 , which is backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , would give a commission of registered voters the authority to determine state legislative districts .
The survey showed 39 % in favor , 36 % against and 25 % undecided .
Campaign strategists frequently say ballot measures that begin the fall campaign with less than 50 % support face long odds because propositions usually lose support as the campaign proceeds .
The findings are based on a telephone survey of 1,047 likely voters between Aug. 12 and 19 .
The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .

On same - sex marriage , the poll did not reveal why the split on the ballot measure differed from attitudes on the general issue of gay marriage .
But Jennifer Kerns , a spokeswoman for the Proposition 8 campaign , cited the language voters will see on the ballot , which pollsters also read to respondents , that describes the proposition as a measure to “ eliminate the right of same - sex couples to marry . ”
That legal right has existed since May , when the California Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution guarantees same - sex couples the same access to marriage that heterosexual couples have .
That ruling overturned Proposition 22 , passed by voters in 2000 , which defined marriage as between a man and a woman .
The Protect Marriage coalition circulated petitions for Proposition 8 this spring in order to amend the Constitution and take the issue away from the courts .
At the time , the petitions said the measure would amend the state Constitution “ to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ”
Earlier this summer , state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown altered the ballot language , saying the change was necessary to accurately reflect the effect the measure would have in overturning the court ’s decision .
The Protect Marriage coalition filed a lawsuit to block that change , but lost .

Both sides predicted an intense campaign between now and election day .
Supporters of Proposition 8 had raised more than $ 10.1 million as of 4 p.m. Wednesday .
Opponents had raised more than $ 9.4 million .
Both sides were dependent on dollars from out of state , with opponents of the measure getting $ 4.9 million -- more than half of their money -- from outside of California .
Proponents collected $ 3.8 million from outside the state .

Scientists in California are setting out to create a new kind of agriculture : farming for carbon capture on degraded land in the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta .
The concept works like this : researchers will plant things like cattails and tules ( a type of rush that grows in freshwater marshes ) in parts of the delta that have been subsiding and giving off greenhouse gases thanks to unsustainable agricultural practices in the area .
Over time , the marsh plants will reproduce , die , decompose and rebuild the region ’s peat soils … all while also soaking up carbon dioxide and creating new , sustainable wetlands .
“ This project is an investment in California ’s future that could reap multiple benefits over several decades — for California , the nation and the world , ” said Roger Fujii , director of the project and chief of the Bay - Delta program for the U.S. Geological Survey ’s ( USGS ) California Water Science Center .
A pilot program that ran from 1997 to 2005 in the western part of the delta ended up rebuilding 10 inches of elevation on an island that had been sinking .
Those results have now inspired a three - year , $ 12.3 million project being funded by the California Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) .
The new project , set to start next spring , will aim to rebuild about 400 acres of wetlands on another island in the western delta .
The effort will be led by the USGS and the University of California , Davis ( UC Davis ) .
“ The developing carbon market holds great promise for regaining land elevation in the delta , ” said David Mraz , chief of DWR ’s Delta - Suisun Marsh Office .
“ It could provide sustainable farming opportunities for delta farmers and an economic incentive to sustain the existing delta levee system . ”
Besides creating a new potential market for carbon capture farming , the project could help reverse years of damage to the delta region .
Farming practices in the area have caused delta soils to oxidize and sink , in some areas by more than 20 feet .
The subsidence has required many areas to be protected by levees , which are now aging and feeling greater pressure .
The project could also help protect the region ’s supply of freshwater : farms protected by delta levees convey a large portion of California ’s water supplies , serving more than 25 million residents and millions of acres of agricultural land .
The goal , Fujii said , is to “ assess on a large scale the ability of re-established wetlands on delta peat islands to sequester carbon , reverse subsidence and provide an economically sustainable land - use practice . ”
Brightnets
The Owner - Free Filing system has often been described as the first9 10 brightnet ; A distributed system where no one breaks the law , so no one need hide in the dark .
OFF is a highly connected peer - to - peer distributed file system .
The unique feature of this system is that it stores all of its internal data as meaningless multi-use data blocks .
In other words there is not a one to one mapping between a stored block and its use in a accessed file .
Each stored block is simultaneously used to access many different files .
Individually however , each block is nothing but arbitrary digital white noise .
Owner - Free refers both to the fact that nobody owns the system as a whole and nobody can own any of the data blocks stored in the system .
The latter claim is explained below and supported in the appendix .
Multi-Use Data
It seems highly unlikely to most people that the same exact data can be used to represent several things at once .
But indeed , the same digital representation can be , “ both a floor wax and a dessert topping . ”
The reason is purely mathematical .
There are an infinite number of ways to digitally represent any given work .
Every digital representation can be used to perceive an infinite number of works .
The OFF System simply chooses one of the infinite ways that is non-copyrightable .
( There must be at least one , or else every possible digital representation would already be copyrighted . )
It just so happens that , in most cases , the same representation is already being used for other things .
The process is detailed in the next section .
Copyright
No creative works , copyrighted or not , are ever communicated between OFF peers .
Only meaningless blocks of arbitrary data .
No tangible copies of creative works are ever stored on OFF peers .
It is completely unnecessary .
All access to creative works is done exclusively on the user ’s local machine .
More importantly , no copies of a creative work ever need to be made .
All works can be accessed in - place and on - demand by locally resident software in the same way that traditional file servers are used .
Storage of creative works is also done exclusively on the users local machine .
Uniquely , only a single virtual copy of the creative work is made — directly into OFF ’s virtual file server .
That is all that is ever needed .
As with a traditional file server , that single copy is completely private .
It is accessible only through the URL possessed by the person who stored the work .
The OFF storage process is logically equivalent to making a single copy to your personal disk or other network attached storage .
Should the person who stored the work want to allow access to others , he simply gives them the URL .
The receiver need not make his own copy .
He can access the work in - place .
ITunes uses an identical process to enable friends to play each others music without copying — via streaming .
Hence our initial definition of Brightnet ; “ Nothing shady is going on . ”
Ownerless Data
Divorcing data from meaning is usually the hardest leap for people to make .
This section explains in common terms why it makes sense to do so with OFF .
A more extensive treatment is done in the paper , “ On copyrightable numbers with an application to the Gesetzklageproblem ” which is attached as in appendix .
Numbers
A computer file is simply a number .
Normally it is a really big number , but it is otherwise just like any other number .
It is one more then the previous number and one less than the next .
We often think about it as a sequence of small numbers ( bytes ) or sometimes a sequence bits ( ones and zeros ) .
However , when you line these up in a sequence they form one big number .
Imagine lining up decimal digits .
When you line up the sequence of decimal digits ;
Five followed by three followed by two , is interpreted to be 532 ( Five hundred thirty - two ) .
The same thing happens with binary numbers , but the numbers are usually much longer .
Small Numbers
Why is this important ?
Well for every number there are an infinite number of possible representations of that number .
Think of the number twelve ( 12 ) .
It can be represented as five plus seven ( 5+7 ) , or twenty - five minus thirteen ( 25 - 13 ) .
In this case the meaning is not in the numbers but in the relationship between the numbers .
Taken individually the numbers 5 , 7 , 13 and 25 are never 12 .
And they do n’t in anyway contain 12 .
If for some reason we were to allow 12 to be copyrighted by Britney , she would still have no claim on the numbers 5 , 7 , 13 and 25 .
I could still copy these numbers and pass them around as I saw fit .
As long as I did n’t copy the number 12 , I should have no problems with the law .
So what happens if I transmit the “ formula ” ( 5+7 ) ?
Am I allowed to do that ?
What about the formula ( 25 - 13 ) ?
What if I only transmit ( 5,7 ) or ( 25,13 ) ?
What is the “ meaning ” of these transmissions ?
In the abstract , there is no way to know the meaning of any of these transmissions .
The interpretation is purely up to the receiver .
( 5+7 ) might simply be arithmetic .
On the other hand , the ‘+’ sign may not mean plus at all .
It may only be a separator as in many web queries .
( 5,7 ) may mean a point in space , 57 or 5.7 or any number of possible other interpretations depending on who is looking at it .
There are many legitimate reasons to store or transmit the numbers 5 and 7 .
As such , the only possible one who can cause a law to be broken is the receiver .
If the receiver reconstructs 12 from any transmitted numbers then perhaps the receiver has broken the law .
But then again , perhaps not .
If no copy of 12 is made then no copyright law can have been broken .
To play a song is not to copy a song .
No more then to play a VHS tape is to copy a VHS tape .
Big Numbers
So now lets translate these principles to big numbers .
When we translate something into a computer file we create a sequence of digits that represents the original .
Lets take a song for example .
Let ’s say , “ Lawyers , Guns and Money ” is 3 MB long .
That means the song is three million bytes long or twenty - four million bits long .
This makes a very big number , but it is still a number .
As every binary number can be translated into a decimal number , I ’ll use them to simplify these examples .
Picture the song as this , but much longer .
24332984303829732498…398724
Now there are two other numbers that may be of interest , depending upon how you interpret them .
Consider the following big numbers :
11230243302314110327…264211
and
12102741001515622171…134513
Then consider adding them together .
Again , there is meaning between the numbers but not in any part of the numbers .
Are these numbers copyrighted ?
Could they be stored on two separate computers ?
Would that break the law ?
What if they were never added together ?
Would their existence still break the law ?
What if I give you two other numbers ?
Again , and again …
It turns out these are not philosophical nor legal questions , but purely mathematical ones .
There are two consistent ways to answer the above questions .
One leads to the conclusion that “ All numbers are already copyrighted . ”
The other leads to the conclusion that , “ There exists encodings of copyrighted numbers that are NOT copyrighted . ”
If the first conclusion is true , digital copyright is pointless .
If the second is true digital copyright is meaningless .
Multi-Use Numbers
This is the idea at the core of the OFF System .
The OFF System then takes it farther to show that each of these numbers can be used to access many different things simultaneously .
Let ’s name these numbers now , and add a couple more .
11230243302314110327…264211 = A 12102741001515622171…134513 = B 47379872610938161983…471179 = C 02810398720484003497…102380 = D
We showed above that ( A+B ) could represent , “ Lawyers , Guns and Money ” .
Interestingly , at the same time ( A+C ) could represent , “ Oops , I did it again ! ”
Who then owns ( A ) , Warren or Britney ?
Also ( B+D ) could represent , “ Piano Man ” .
So who owns ( B ) , Warren or Billy ?
Both ( A & B ) participate equally in multiple representations simultaneously .
Since no single person can lay claim to these numbers we call them “ ownerless . ”
An appropriate claim , we think , for numbers which are intrinsically meaningless as well .
Arbitrary Data
The above process is exactly what the OFF System does , but instead of adding it uses another logical operation called XOR that simplifies the programming .
Otherwise the logic is exactly the same .
Instead of working on whole files however , OFF works exclusively with fixed length “ blocks ” of data .
Each block is exactly 128 KB in size .
If a file being stored is longer , it is broken into multiple 128 KB blocks .
If it is shorter , the blocks are padded to 128KB with random data .
These initial source blocks are never stored in the OFF System .
Instead , OFF arbitrarily chooses relationships among new or existing blocks that happen to XOR back to the source block .
It stores any new blocks and reuses existing ones .
We call each combination of blocks a “ tuple . ”
There are always more possible tuples representations of a given source block , than there are possible OFF blocks .
This allows us to arbitrarily choose tuples , or to optimize their choice as necessary .
To speed access , OFF spreads each arbitrary block to different servers around the internet .
No fancy encryption is needed as each block has no intrinsic meaning .
No anonymity is needed as only the accessor knows how the block is being interpreted .

Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's work and life can best be described as those of a prophet .
The prophet died last Sunday at the age of 89 .
Solzhenitsyn was not only a critic of the Soviet Union , of communism and Socialism , he showed the West - and particularly the United States - more than a few of its own flaws .
Thirty years ago this summer , Solzhenitsyn gave an address at Harvard that was biting in its critique , exemplary in its wisdom and visionary in its predictions for what the future would hold should America and the West remain on their present path .
It was a monumental speech that many academics - at Harvard and elsewhere - who had cheered Solzhenitsyn while he resided in the gulag , hated , but I loved .
Solzhenitsyn warned the West not to be deluded by what he said was a false belief that all nations yearn to be like us .
This thinking is at the heart of President Bush 's doctrine for dealing with the Arab and Muslim world .
Solzhenitsyn called this " the blindness of superiority " and warned against thinking that only " wicked governments " temporarily prevent other nations from " adopting the Western way of life . "
The Russian novelist observed that a " decline in courage " has affected the West and especially , " the intellectual elite , causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society .
Should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end ? "
Solzhenitsyn said that in the West , the pursuit of happiness through self - gratification and materialism has replaced moral and character development :
" The constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many Western faces with worry and even depression .
The majority of people have been granted well - being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about . "
And yet , " Today , well - being in the life of Western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask . "
What about America 's emphasis on individual rights ?
Solzhenitsyn said the result has been to ignore the welfare of the many : " The defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals .
It is time , in the West , to defend not so much human rights as human obligations . "
There was more to disturb the self - satisfied intellectual elite .
Surely faculty members at Harvard must have gnashed their teeth in the face of this remonstrance : " Destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space .
Society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence , such as , for example , misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people , motion pictures full of pornography , crime and horror . "
According to Solzhenitsyn , life organized around laws and the individual has shown an inability to " defend itself against the corrosion of evil . "
Solzhenitsyn did not spare the media 's role in the decline of the West .
He said the media 's constant parroting of the maxim " everyone is entitled to know everything " is " a false slogan , characteristic of a false era : people also have the right not to know , and it is a much more valuable one .
The right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip , nonsense , vain talk .
A person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information . "
Again , this was 1978 , just two years after Ted Turner created WTBS , just six years after HBO was launched in Pennsylvania .
Today , cable programming is filled with the vain , the vulgar and the vacuous and Solzhenitsyn's critique rings even more true in 2008 .
Solzhenitsyn loved America , but said he could n't recommend it in its present state as a model for his country : " Through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the Western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive . "
There 's plenty more and every student and politician - indeed , every American - ought to read , or re-read the speech .
It was a sobering and prophetic address and contains far more substance than anything we 'll hear at the upcoming political conventions .

Studied for hundreds of years , the brain is still a mystery in many respects and one part of it is particularly mysterious : the Frontal Lobes .
One way to find out more about this large and important area of the brain is to examine what happens when it ’s damaged - either intentionally or by accident .
This column will look at a number of extraordinary stories related to this highly important brain area .
Phineas Gage ’s skull and life mask
( Credit : Warren Anatomical Museum ,
Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine )
Twenty five year old Phineas Gage was a normal man .
The year was 1848 , and Gage was the foreman of a railway construction project near the American town of Cavendish .
During the work laying the railway tracks , Gage ’s team ran into a stubborn rock that blocked their progress .
As was usual , the men drilled a deep hole in the rock and Gage was supposed to pour gunpowder into it , add the necessary fuse , seal the opening with sand and then tamp the charge with a long iron rod .
Gage did this , but made a huge mistake : he forgot to seal the hole with sand .
He inserted the rod into the rock and pressed hard on the fuse itself .
The result was a sudden explosion that fired the rod out the hole as if it was shot out of a canon ( which was not far from the truth ) .
Gage could n’t dodge the rod .
It rammed into his face below his left cheek bone , entered his brain and the broke the skull on its way out .
The rod , three feet long , went right through Gage ’s brain and then landed in the ground some sixty feet behind him .
In 99.9 % of these types of cases , this kind of injury is fatal due to the massive trauma to the main blood vessels in the brain .
But Phineas
Gage did not die .
He did not even lose consciousness .
He was a bit dazed and let his pals walk him - on his feet , mind you - to a cart which took him to town .
Brain lobes
A local doctor , Dr. Edward Williams , was rushed to the patient .
He found Gage sitting at the stairs of a local hotel with his head between his hands , spitting blood .
“ What happened ? ” asked the doctor .
Gage lifted his hat from his head , exposing the gaping hole in his skull .
“ Here is some work for you , doc ” he said .
Dr. Williams did the best he could , cleaned the wound and restored some bones to their original location .
A short time later another doctor joined him , Dr. John Harlow .
Harlow was the senior of the two medical men and took charge of the case .
After a few days it seemed as if Gage was truly on his way to a miraculous recovery .
But was it a complete recovery ?
The iron rod that pierced Gage went through an area in his brain called “ the frontal lobe . ”
The frontal lobe is located in the front of the skull just behind the eyes and forehead , and its main function is to determine which actions are harmful and which are beneficial , preventing detrimental and inappropriate behavior , as well as understanding the consequences of our actions .
The frontal lobe continues to grow and evolve well after our teen years , and it ’s highly likely that the usual teenage wild and impulsive attitude is due to the frontal lobe ’s “ under - development ” status .
Then again , that fact does not make life easier for parents : someone once said that only mothers to teenage kids can truly understand why some animals eat their young .
Dr. Walter Freeman
( Credit : NIH )
Gage ’s physician , Dr. Harlow , was the first to notice the changes in his behavior .
He wrote that Gage behaved in a very childish manner and was almost impossible to control .
When Gage recovered and returned home , his friends and relatives also noticed the impact of his injury .
Once a balanced , well behaved , and responsible man , Gage became restless , moody , and inconsiderate .
He could no longer plan ahead and stick with his plans .
He even began to swear and curse , which he previously rarely did .
His friend summed it all in one sad sentence : “ He is no longer Phineas Gage . ”
Not much in known about Gage ’s story after he recovered from his wounds .
The train company refused to accept him back due to his changed character , and he was forced to find alternative employment as a coach driver .
He worked in South America for some time and died about twelve years later , in 1861 .
Gage ’s story became one of the most famous medical cases in brain research history .
But still , Gage ’s miracle did not contribute profoundly to understanding the way the brain works .
No doctor examined his behavior before the accident ( since he was totally anonymous then ) so there was no real comparison with his character after it .
The neurobiologists continued to stumble in the dark in their attempts to decipher the workings on the frontal lobe .
They got their first real chance to investigate it properly only sixty years later , with the invention of the “ lobotomy ” , the medical procedure which became known as “ the most barbaric mistake ever perpetrated by mainstream medicine . ”
In 1890 a Swiss doctor working in a mental institution decided to try a revolutionary treatment .
He removed the frontal lobe from six of his patients .
One of them died immediately , one was found dead ten days later ( perhaps a result of suicide ) , but the other four had undergone a radical change in their behavior .
This crude experiment encouraged other researchers to investigate the possibilities of this kind of treatment on patients with severe mental disabilities : mentally handicapped with extreme violent behavior , sex perverts , and such .
It was hoped that the changes due to the damage in the frontal lobe would have a net positive effect , since it could n’t make things much worse .
Dr. Antonio Moniz created the operating procedure but the doctor whose name is forever bound to the lobotomy is the American Dr. Walter Freeman .
Freeman started doing lobotomies in the thirties , when the whole idea was relatively unknown .
He was not pleased with the current operating procedures of the time that required experienced surgeons and the expensive medical equipment that was only found in hospitals .
Dr. Freeman hoped to bring the lobotomy to where it was really needed : to the mental institutions .
There were patients there who could benefit immensely from this treatment , but there were no surgeons nor sophisticated equipment available at these institutions .
Dr. Freeman hoped to find a way to perform the lobotomy in “ field conditions ” , one might say .
His solution was amazingly simple .
All the other surgeons tried to reach the frontal lobe via the shortest route ; that is , through the forehead .
Freeman decided to reach his goal from a completely different direction ; from the eyes .
The following description might make some of the readers shift with unease , but from a surgical view point it was a bright idea .
He took a long , sharp needle and inserted it above the eye and through the thin bones behind it .
He entered the frontal lobe from below and when the needle was in the right place , he moved it from side to side , a - la wind shield wipers .
The impact of the lobotomy was extremely dramatic .
In some cases the changes were beneficial and the violent or harmful behaviors were instantly gone .
In other cases it had a devastating effect .
Many patients became mentally handicapped or Catatonic , staring widely through the air without any indication of thoughts ; empty shells .
Freeman was in love with his innovation .
He was more then a doctor , he was a showman .
He asked his assistants to time him and see how fast he could enter , cut and exit the brain .
He inserted two needles into both eyes at once or in two patients at the same time .
He did marathon surgeries , sometimes up to twenty five in one day .
There was no malice involved in thelobotomy .
In times when there was neither cure nor medicine to people who suffered from cruel mental disorders and the lobotomy was the only way to ease the suffering of the patient and his family .
In a situation where the only alternative was to lock the sick person in a padded cell , tied with a straight jacket for the rest of his life , there were doctors who saw the logic in this procedure .
Still , the controversy surrounding lobotomy never died , both in the US and abroad .
The second half of the twentieth century saw a steady decline in the number of lobotomy operations , as more effective drug treatments were discovered .
Doctors stopped recommending the operation in all but the most severe cases .
Finally , the lobotomy was outlawed in many countries around the world .
Dr. Freeman himself was forced to stop operating when a female patient died during an operation .
The frontal lobe has another important job in the brain beyond determining our personality .
In the back of the frontal lobe near the middle of the skull is an area known as the sensory and motor cortex .
It is the home of the Little Man , otherwise known as the Homunculus .
The Little Man is the name given to a thin band of brain cells which are connected to the various body organs .
They receive sensory input from them and control their movements .
Neurobiologists became interested in the sensory and motor cortex due to a strange and disturbing phenomenon which no one could explain properly : phantom limbs .
In the US civil war , many soldiers suffered wounds that required doctors to amputate damaged limbs .
Tens of thousands of soldiers returned home missing an arm or a leg but reported that they could still feel their amputated organs .
I wish to stress this point : they were not imagining or fantasizing ; they really felt the missing limb in the same manner that you and I can feel our arms and legs .
Phantoms in the Brain –
book cover
( Credit : Harper Perennial )
Their stories , and similar cases in later years , were so weird that they might have been considered fake , if it was n’t for the fact that so many people reported the same phenomena .
One woman said that when she approached a door , her phantom hand would try to grab the handle .
A former professional tennis player described how his phantom hand would try to throw the ball into the air in an opening serve , or block his falls .
Many patients felt real pains in their ghost limbs .
The first real insight about phantom limbs came only some fifteen years ago from research done by Dr. V.S. Ramachandran .
His story ( and many of the examples brought in this article ) appears in his wonderful book , “ Phantoms in the Brain ” ‘ which he co-wrote with Sandra Blakeslee .
Ramachandran discovered that in people who underwent an amputation , the area in the sensory cortex that was responsible for the now gone limb was invaded by the areas neighboring it .
The facial area in the sensory cortex , for example , spread into the area that was once in charge of the missing arm , and the area governing the sex organs spread into the areas that used to control the leg .
As a consequence , when the patient felt sexually aroused , for example , the brain mistook the sensory input as coming from the leg ; or , to be more exact , from the area in the sensory cortex that the brain used to interpret as the leg area .
When the patient moved his facial muscles , this movement was processed as an arm movement .
These ideas gave logical answers to cases in which phantom limbs appeared in other parts of the body , not only the limbs .
Women who have had their breasts removed tell of phantom breasts .
One patient insisted he could feel his appendix even after it was surgically removed .
There is even a phantom penis , with ghost erections .
One lucky patient described feeling his phantom leg coming to life only when having sex .
He felt a sexual stimulation in his missing leg that was as strong as in his sex organs , and as a result had much more powerful orgasms than he had before he was injured .
I ’m sure he was not interested in medical assistance .
He was just bragging .

The police state has not arrived quite yet but it may feel like it to the residents of some American cities , where a handful of embattled mayors and police chiefs are imposing strict and sometimes sweeping curfews as a last resort to quell new waves of gun violence this summer .
“ We must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people , especially children , to be victims , ” insists Eddie Perez , the Mayor of Hartford , the capital of Connecticut , where a night - time curfew was introduced last week and will remain in effect for a month for those under 18 years old .
Nor are there any apologies from the authorities in Helena - West Helena on the banks of the Mississippi in Arkansas , small pockets of which are under a 24 - hour curfew that all ages must respect .
Police are enforcing it , moreover , with night - vision goggles and M16 military rifles .

Touch Guitar
Musician / geek
Ben decided to dispose of his old laptop by putting it in an electric guitar .
Put simply , this is definitely one of the coolest mods we ’ve ever come across .
Though not primarily used as a computer , it still puts on quite a show to say the least .
Guitar PC
What could be better than giving a geeky musician the guitar they ’ve always wanted ?
Giving them their dream guitar , but with a fully - functional PC crammed inside .
On the inside , you ’ll find a slot - loading disc drive , 3.06GHz Intel processor , 2GB of DDR2 memory , 160 GB HDD , and 4 USB 2.0 ports .
Something went wrong .
That 's what politicos from Tucson to Flagstaff are saying , as an unprecedented number of citizen initiatives have been kicked off this fall 's ballot .
No one can remember the last time that any statewide initiative got booted after turning in its signatures .
This year , we 've already had three .
Info Petition Partners
And two more initiatives nearly suffered the same fate , only to squeak by on technicalities .
Sure , the voters lose out , but the loss to the initiatives ' backers is even greater .
They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars readying their pet projects , only to see them rejected before prime time .
" On a scale of one to 10 on the Richter scale of Arizona history , this is a 9.5 , " says local political consultant Jason Rose , who 's not directly involved in this year 's initiative process .
" There is going to be massive fallout . "
So what went wrong ?
People will tell you that Maricopa County is the hub of this year 's petition problems .
They say county officials have been pickier than usual in their verifications — and they plan to prove it in court .
But there 's another possibility .
All three failed initiatives hired the same Scottsdale company to gather signatures .
That company , in turn , hired subcontractors , many of them firms that travel state - to - state gathering signatures .
Some of those subs have faced allegations of serious impropriety in the past .
And I 've talked to three local workers who allege that the subs permitted , and sometimes even encouraged , fraud .
One whistleblower says he tried to complain to initiative backers and state regulators but says no one would listen .
Now , with initiatives failing at a shocking rate , he may well have their attention .
Arizona is one of 24 states that allow " citizen initiatives . "
Basically , anyone who collects enough signatures from registered voters can put a question on the statewide ballot .
It 's direct democracy , with surprising results .
Our state Legislature would surely never approve of medical marijuana , but the people did , twice .
Recently , Arizona voters refused to ban gay marriage , raised the minimum wage , and drastically curtailed the rights of illegal immigrants .
Politically , we 're all over the map , and that 's kind of cool .
The flip side is this :
What the state 's populist founders saw as a way to curb special interests has instead been a boon to them .
Just look at the initiatives proposed this fall .
Ward Connerly , who 's successfully led crusades against affirmative action from Michigan to California , has one on the ballot here .
The payday loan industry is pushing a plan to make the Legislature back off from , yep , the payday loan industry .
There 's a reason you seldom see John Q. Public pushing an initiative .
To get on the ballot in Arizona , initiatives need a whopping 153,365 valid signatures .
That means hiring a company to track down registered voters ; you simply can't expect volunteers to collect so many .
And though this work is ostensibly the grassroots of democracy , in reality , it can be sleazy .
We 've all heard the trope comparing lawmaking to sausages — the less you know about how they 're made , the more respect you have for them .
Trust me on this :
It 's 100 percent true when it comes to signature gathering .
" When you run a signature company , you 're basically a captain of the underworld , " says political consultant Rose , himself no stranger to those environs .
" It 's a nasty , gnarly business . "
Signature - gathering companies pay an army of barely regulated freelancers anywhere from $ 1 to $ 2 per signature .
If a random 5 percent sample of signatures checks out with county regulators — and if the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed — the initiative goes on the ballot .
This year , the signatures are n't checking out .
Failure rates in Maricopa County are at more than 40 percent .
Of the nine initiatives attempting to make the ballot , all but two hired the same Scottsdale firm , Petition Partners LLC , to gather signatures .
And those two , the Arizona Civil Rights Initiative and Majority Rules , ended up with virtually the same workforce because the initiatives all used the same subcontractors .
( The civil rights initiative now faces a lawsuit from opponents trying to get it kicked off the ballot , alleging fraud on the part of signature gatherers .
But do n't be deceived : Every one of the initiatives trying to make the ballot used virtually the same crew on the street level . )
Some of the subcontractors most active in Arizona this summer have been linked to improprieties in other states .
And three whistleblowers tell me that serious problems occurred here .
One was brave enough to put his name on the record ; the other two , given anonymity , corroborated some of his more serious allegations .
Jack Bickley gathered signatures in the Valley for 10 weeks this spring .
During that time , the 30 - something East Valley resident claims that he witnessed systemic fraud .
He alleges :
• Misrepresentation .
Bickley says his fellow circulators frequently lied to voters about what they were signing .
• Circulator falsifications .
Those circulating petitions must sign the back , verifying that they personally witnessed each signature .
Bickley says that some of his coworkers routinely signed the back of petitions they did not witness .
Managers , he says , encouraged the practice .
• Worst of all , Bickley alleges , piles of petitions and voter registration cards were collected but never turned in .
Thousands of Arizona residents may believe they 're registered to vote , Bickley says , even as their registrations gathered dust .
Once the subs who'd promised payment skipped town , no one knew what to do with them .
The fraud , Bickley says , was n't occasional or accidental .
" This was not once in a while , " he says .
" This was systematic . "
Derrick Lee , who owns the signature - gathering firm Lee Petition Management , first put me in touch with Bickley last week .
Lee had heard numerous claims of fraud in this election cycle — and was troubled enough to go public with his concerns .
( Once known as the " petition king of Arizona , " he 's admittedly lost much of his business to Petition Partners in recent years , and even ended up subcontracting with the company this year . )
So I met Bickley at a restaurant in Gilbert .
To back up his claims , Bickley showed me a sheaf of signed petitions and photocopies he 'd made of voter registration cards .
He says he 's been talking to his fellow gatherers , many of whom gave up on getting paid and destroyed petitions and registrations .
These are the ones , he says , that he managed to save from the dumpster .
" Tens of thousands of signatures have been thrown out , " Bickley says .
Bickley says he got involved with the petition process on a whim .
Until six months ago , he says , he lived in Hawaii .
But while visiting family in the Valley in February , he was approached by a man outside Wal - Mart asking him to sign a petition to lower the price of gas .
Sure , Bickley said .
Who does n't want cheaper gas ?
When he looked at the petition , Bickley was stunned to read that it was actually a petition to put Ralph Nader on the ballot .
" What does this have to do with the price of gas ? " he demanded .
" Hey , Ralph Nader 's for legalizing hemp , " the petition circulator told him .
" That 's an alternative fuel . "
The conversation was so unnerving , Bickley says , that he decided he had to learn more .
He ended up staying in the Valley and , by April , had signed up to circulate petitions .
In the next two months , he witnessed far worse than the original circulator 's fairy tale about Nader .
Bickley says that some of his colleagues are now submitting written statements about what they 've witnessed to a Scottsdale attorney .
( The attorney did not return calls for comment . )
Derrick
Lee says he 's heard from a half - dozen gatherers who said they are filing affidavits .
Based on what he 's heard , and the petitions he 's examined , Lee says that problems with this year 's citizen initiatives go far beyond normal error .
" In my opinion , this is organized crime , " Lee says .
" I will go on the record and say that , because that 's what it is . "
The company at the center of the firestorm , Petition Partners , is based out of a suite in Old Town Scottsdale .
The firm is owned and managed by Andrew Chavez , who started it eight years ago .
( Bob Grossfeld , a veteran political consultant closely allied with the Democrats , owns a one - third share of the company . )
Chavez did not return my call until a few minutes before deadline .
But his lawyer , Andrew Gordon , makes a strong case that the problem is with the county 's verification process , not his client .
" What 's weird this year is that — not just for Petition Partners , but the other petition - gathering companies — there 's an extremely high failure rate in Maricopa County , and pretty much only in Maricopa County , " Gordon says .
" And our quality - control checks were all showing 75 percent validity .
So why is Maricopa County coming in so much lower ?
That 's the real question . "
When Chavez finally called me Tuesday , he was harshly critical of Derrick Lee .
Lee is angry , he says , because Petition Partners rejected nearly 7,000 signatures he 'd collected .
" He got left holding the bag , " he says .
" He would n't be doing this otherwise . "
( Lee points out he started contacting New Times more than a month ago , long before the flap over signatures . )
And Chavez notes that it's not just his petitions — the two that hired other companies to gather signatures are suffering an error rate that 's just as bad .
" This is not a Petition Partners problem , " he says .
But I think it may be a problem involving lousy subcontractors .
Everybody in town seems to have used YPM LLC , a Florida - based company owned by Mark Jacoby .
And Jacoby 's group is at the center of Jack Bickley 's most damning allegations .
( Jacoby , who has left town , did not return calls for comment by press time . )
Bickley says that Jacoby encouraged , and even expected , behavior that could well be criminal under Arizona statutes .
Jacoby , he says , had a system where a trainer would be assigned as many as six new circulators .
Even though the trainer would be nowhere near the circulators while they collected signatures , he would still sign the back of their petitions , attesting that he 'd personally witnessed them .
" The person who signed the back was not present when the petitions were signed , " Bickley says .
" How could he be ?
He had five or six people working under him at different spots around town . "
Both Jacoby and Jenny Breslin , who owns JSM LLC , served as subcontractors on all the initiatives handled by Petition Partners .
( They also contracted on the Arizona Civil Rights Initiative . )
Both Jacoby and Breslin have generated controversy in other states .
In Massachusetts in 2005 , a college student told the Associated Press that Jacoby trained her in bait - and - switch techniques , including telling people they were signing for one petition while their signatures were actually captured for two .
" The fraud was looked upon as a game , " the student said .
A year earlier , the St. Petersburg Times linked Jacoby to a registration scam .
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement began investigating , the paper wrote , after receiving allegations that as many as 4,000 voters were registered as Republicans without their consent .
Jacoby was never charged .
As for Breslin , her signature - gathering company was subject to a criminal investigation in Ohio after allegations of fraudulent voter registrations , according to the Akron Beacon Journal .
( Apparently , the probe was dropped without charges being filed .
Breslin could not be reached for comment . )
She also came under fire for allegedly turning in forged signatures in Florida , the paper reported .
These are the guys to whom Petition Partners farmed out much of its day - to - day operations in Arizona .
Attorney Gordon , who represents Petition Partners , says that Chavez has used Jacoby in the past " and he says he 's been a very good subcontractor .
They run quality control on Mark as well as the other contractors , and he has a very good rate . "
For all the problems with this year 's initiative process , backers believe they may still get on the ballot .
Recently , Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Mark Aceto rejected the secretary of state 's determination that the medical choice initiative was off the ballot .
While the secretary of state was following the letter of the law , Judge Aceto ruled that " substantial compliance " was good enough , says Chuck Blanchard , the attorney who handled the case .
In the next week , Judge Aceto will hear similar arguments from the backers of both the governor 's transportation tax initiative and the state trust lands issue .
Both are represented by Blanchard .
With the same lawyer , and the same judge , it 's hard to imagine the " substantial compliance " wo n't be good enough .
The question is whether Petition Partners will be able to hold onto the lion 's share of the local signature business in the future .
Political consultant Jason
Rose says that , prior to this cycle , Petition Partners enjoyed a great reputation .
" The irony is that so many significant people put their eggs in one basket , " he says .
" That 's because of the stellar work they 'd done previously . "
But the repercussions for this year 's failures could be more serious than lost business .
Kevin
Tyne , a spokesman for the secretary of state , tells me that his office has forwarded allegations of impropriety to the state attorney general .
( He did not specify which companies , or individuals , are being targeted . )
Not surprisingly , Attorney General Terry Goddard would n't comment on specifics .
But the situation has piqued his interest .
" I am amazed at the high rejection rate and very concerned about the validity of signatures , " he says .
" I am going to take a serious look at whether fraud has been committed . "
That 's good news .
And after just one week poking around this , I have to say , I do n't think Goddard will have to look very hard .
You step in the stream ,
But the water has moved on .

Mr Dowling was not one of the men selected for the final breakout
One of the men who helped to inspire the film The Great Escape thought it " over the top " , his son has revealed .
Airman Eric " Digger " Dowling , from Bristol , was shot down in April 1942 and imprisoned by the Nazis in Stalag Luft III , near Zagan in Poland .
He helped carve out tunnels , forge documents and prepare maps for the real - life escape in March 1944 .
Speaking a month after his death aged 92 , Mr Dowling 's son Peter said his father " was n't a fan of Steve McQueen " .
He thought the famous motorbike scene featuring the US actor - which was not based on a real - life event - was " well over the top " , Peter Dowling , 60 , revealed .
" He was n't the greatest admirer of Americans and it did n't go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role .
' Quite upsetting ' " Parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue .
" For someone who was actually there , that was upsetting . "
The escape plan which inspired the 1963 film involved hollowing out three tunnels , codenamed Tom , Dick and Harry , with each entrance carefully selected to ensure it was not spotted by guards .
He felt angry , more than angry , that Hitler had 50 of the 76 escapees shot
Peter Dowling Tunnelling was dangerous and the roofs could cave in without warning .
Despite his contribution , Mr Dowling was not one of the men selected for the final breakout .
In January 1945 the camp was evacuated because of the Russian advance and the men were marched to a second camp where they were liberated later that year .
" He felt angry , more than angry , that Hitler had 50 of the 76 escapees shot , and my father was friends with seven of them , " Mr Dowling 's son said .
Three of the escapees made it home to the UK , while 23 were returned to prison camps .
Mr Dowling 's diaries reveal that among his executed friends were Thomas Kirby - Green , John Stower and Gordon Kidder .
Mr Dowling , who was born in Glastonbury , Somerset , went on to work on Concorde for British Aerospace at Filton near Bristol .
He died a day short of his 93rd birthday at a nursing home in Stoke Bishop in the city on 21 July .

What are these ?
I was attending graduation last weekend so did n’t have time to put a progress post together , which means that this week you get a double helping of GHC - plugins goodness !
For those new to the series , you might like to read the first two posts before continuing .
Type Safe Dynamic Loading
This project is all about dynamically loading plugin code into GHC so it can transform the program being compiled .
Until now , I blindly trusted that if the plugin exposed a value with the name “ plugin ” it was indeed a Plugin data structure , but now I ’ve pieced together some parts of the GHC typechecker to use the associated .hi files to check whether this is indeed the case .
It might be useful to expose this to users as an alternative to parts of hs - plugins , but as it would need a spot of generalization work to be done first this is not on the agenda at the moment .
Annotations System
What is an annotations system ?
It is entirely analagous to the annotations system of Java or the attributes of .NET languages in that it allows you to associate bits of user data with elements of the program .
In my current design , you can attach annotations to modules , types , data constructors and top level values , like so :
module Example where import AnnotationTypes ( MyAnnotationType ) {-# MODANN MyAnnotationType { friendliness = 10 , friend = " Jim " } #-} {-# TYPEANN Foo MyAnnotationType { friendliness = 20 , friend = " Bob " } #-} data Foo = Bar {-# ANN f MyAnnotationType { friendliness = 30 , friend = " Jane " } #-} f x = x
Actually , you can use arbitrary expressions in your annotations , as long as they eventually boil down to something with a Typeable instance .
So this rather esoteric expression would be perfectly fine :
{-# ANN f SillyAnnotation { foo = ( id 10 ) + $ ( [ | 20 | ] ) , bar = 'f } #-}
You probably want to avoid non-termination or even expensive computation in those annotations as they are potentially evaluated at compile time !
Plugins can see annotations during compilation and hence can use them to guide the transformations they perform on your code , but you can also access the annotations of any module via the GHC API .
I ’ve previously alluded to the difficulties with an annotations system : I ’ll take this opportunity to discuss them a bit further .
Consider this program :
module Example2 ( exported ) where exported = not_exported {-# ANN not_exported Just " Hello " #-} not_exported = 10
Because “ not_exported ” is only used once its definition will be inlined straight into “ exported ” ( regardless of it ’s size ) .
This means that the annotation on it is entirely useless , as odds are that the plugin will never see the not_exported identifier in the program !
We have the same sort of problem with identifiers in the rules system , and require manual addition of NOINLINE pragmas to the relevant identifiers to circumvent it , but it all feels rather clumsy and I ’m not sure what the best solution is .
Note that this is not a problem for other modules accessing the annotation , as by definition they do so on an exported identifier that does not suffer this treatment .
Another problem with annotations is that it ’s almost impossible to allow them on non top - level identifiers with the current GHC implementation , as those identifiers get created and destroyed with reckless abandon by compiler passes .
We work around this for things like SCCs by actually making SCCs a kind of expression in the intermediate language , but doing this for annotations does n’t sit well with the idea of being able to look up the annotations attached to a particular identifier from other modules using the GHC API .
So again , I ’m not quite sure what the solution is here .
Sample Plugins
To try and produce some sample code for the eventual release and get some experience about the API I need to provide to plugin authors I have implemented some simple compiler plugins .
I ’ve got two complete so far :
A plugin to make Haskell a strict rather than lazy language
A plugin that performs GHCs current common subexpression elimination pass , but outside of the main compiler
There are some more planned : watch this space .
Conclusion
It ’s been a month since I began the project , and I ’m fairly pleased with my progress up to this point .
There ’s still a lot left to do , but I ’m confident I should have something presentable by the end of the Summer Of Code period .
Next week will probably see some refinements to the annotation and phase control systems , the construction of a few more sample plugins , and perhaps even a start on documenting GHCs internals to some extent .
Vilayanur Ramachandran at TED : Capgras syndrome , synesthesia , phantom limbs
Dr. Vilayanur Ramachandran is a famous neuroscientist whom many may know for his authoritative talks on the phantom limb syndrome , where amputees feel the presence of their hands or legs even though the limbs are physically not there .
A fellow user brought up this video , which is another great lecture by Ramachandran at TED .
Here he covers three interesting neurological disorders : Capgras syndrome , where somebody would see a loved one but think they are fakes , phantom limb syndrome , and synesthesia , where pathways in the brain cross over with each other , such that one can experience things like " all 5s are red " and " 7 is a thunderclap . "

Group offering $ 100 K reward for right - wing 527 takedowns Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This
To combat right - wing 527 groups in the 2008 election , MoveOn lobbyist Tom Matzzie is employing a technique better recognized for its roots in the wild west than American politics .
Launching a new political organization called ' Accountable America ' this week , he hopes to stifle the traditionally lucrative donations to GOP - leaning 527 advocacy groups by Republican donors .
Matzzie , along with partner Judd Legum -- former research director to Sen. Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign -- is offering a high dollar reward .
In this case , $ 100,000 for information which leads to the takedown or federal punishment of any such group .
His opening volley starts with 10,000 ominous mailings , reports the New York Times .
The ' warnings ' will be sent to bigwig GOP donors , cautioning them against financing 527 groups .
The letters threaten potential legal or PR repercussions , should the money be moved toward any Swift Boat - style causes .
Key to Matzzie 's strategy is a $ 100,000 reward for anybody who can bring down a conservative 527 .
He described the tactic as " going for the jugular . "
His group plans to take details of the donors ' personal lives into the realm of high media , promising print , Web and even televised retribution for 527 financiers .
" If you want to support your candidates of choice , the most secure way remains a hard - dollar contribution , " cautions Matzzie 's letter to GOP supporters .
" The maximum donation is $ 2,300 per election . "
Excerpts from Times article : # Chris LaCivita , a Republican strategist who helped organize the Swift Boat effort , said Mr. Matzzies group was likely to have the opposite effect on potential donors , firing them up instead of discouraging them .
 They re not going to be intimidated by some pipsqueak on the kooky left ,  Mr. LaCivita said .

Is the worst over ?
Are we on the road to recovery ?
Will the next president take office against a backdrop of economic improvement , as Bill Clinton did in 1993 ?
Or has something deeper and more intractable gone wrong ?
Early this year , the optimists , including Citigroup chairman Bob Rubin and Treasury secretary Hank Paulson , argued that the slowdown was short - term and that a “ stimulus ” package should be “ targeted and temporary . ”
This with rare haste the Democratic Congress enacted .
As a result , most taxpayers got one - time $ 600 checks in May , prefigured by bubbly messages touting “ Good News ! ” if you filed your taxes electronically .
The rebate is n’t the only little Dutch boy thrown headlong at the dike this election year .
Government spending , especially for defense , will be up : Military spending as a share of gdp is expected to grow by $ 75 billion in fiscal 2008 , enough to neutralize a 0.3 percent decline in gdp .
Dick Cheney was secretary of defense for Bush 41 ; just before the 1992 election he engineered a big run-up in outlays , as the military restocked following the first Gulf War .
( It was exposed in the first Clinton “ Economic Report . ” )
Is the Pentagon up to that trick again ?
I ’d be astonished if it were not .
Under intense pressure from panicky bankers , Ben Bernanke cut interest rates relentlessly from August 2007 through the spring of 2008 .
I do n’t accuse Bernanke of playing politics .
But it ’s worth noting that this is what usually happens .
In presidential election years when Republicans are in office , the Fed regularly and predictably pursues a more expansionary policy than when Democrats rule — after controlling for differences in the rates of inflation and unemployment .
( I made these calculations myself ; see the chart . )
Maybe they just ca n’t help themselves .
But much of the ordinary effect of interest cuts on new lending — like a rebound in construction and automobile sales — did n’t happen this time .
That ’s because the fall in home prices ( and therefore the value of collateral ) overwhelmed the benefit of cheaper money to the banks .
And the banks barely cut mortgage rates , so consumers saw no benefits at all .
Lower interest rates did cut the value of the dollar , however , and that promotes exports and foreign investment .
( These days New York Times real estate listings come with a currency converter . )
It also boosts the stock market , since multinational firms can report their ( unchanged ) foreign income as higher dollar earnings .
Possibly all this stimulus will ward off the two - quarter decline that has historically defined a recession .
Do n’t be surprised : Republicans have n’t had an election - year slump since 1960 .
On the other hand , the National Bureau of Economic Research , which has the official call , may describe the early spring as a recession anyway .
Republicans will welcome that , too , so long as they can plausibly call the summer a “ recovery . ”
Even if they ca n’t stop a recession , they may be able to make it short and shallow enough , this year , to put John McCain in the White House .
But all this brings up an important question — what of next year ?
You get what you pay for How Fed ’s election - year rates varied from nonelection years when the incumbent was : 1984 - 2004 .
Source : Galbraith et al report , page 20 .
No matter how effective the stimulus , two enormous clouds remain for whoever becomes president : the housing slump and the banking crisis .
Both are far from being finished yet .
The problem with a housing slump is inventory .
Unlike factories and Internet startups , shuttered houses do n’t go away .
No one declares them obsolete .
They are n’t boxed up and sent to China .
They remain , a drag on the market , decaying and pulling down property values for years .
Here in Texas , housing values slumped with the S&L crisis and the oil bust of 1985 and did not recover until around 1993 .
That slump clobbered the oil patch but was barely felt anywhere else .
This slump is the reverse — it ’s driving down housing prices just about everywhere except Texas , where the scars of the last bubble helped keep the recent one under control .
Nationally , the subprime debacle is blowing away the homeownership gains of the last few years .
Those abusive mortgages were deliberately targeted at vulnerable , even desperate , people who could be steered into financial death traps .
Lenders did n’t care , because with the help of fraudulent appraisals , the loans could be off - loaded quickly in packages bought by greedy or gullible investors , including your pension fund .
Poor people got hit on the front end ; 1.5 million homes entered foreclosure last year .
Middle - class people got it on the return volley .
And middle - class homeowners are now getting hit a second way : in the declining value of their homes .
You do n’t have to be holding a subprime to find yourself underwater .
That means that home - equity loans will dry up .
( As of April , California homeowners in default were already a median of eight months behind on those loans . )
Many people will be tempted to walk on their houses and mail the keys to the bank .
Incidents of the foreclosed expressing themselves to their lenders by yanking the plumbing and the wires on the way out the door are on the rise , as is arson by desperate homeowners , according to the Los Angeles Times .
Will students , small businesses , and other borrowers still be able to get credit when this is over ?
God only knows .
The mechanisms of mortgage finance and home - equity drawdown have n’t simply been damaged .
That well has been poisoned .
Having largely outsourced mortgage originations to companies like Countrywide who did n’t care whether the borrowers had good credit , the banking system cannot easily go back to its old method of making loans to creditworthy people and contenting itself with the interest paid back over many years .
And who would trust them , anyway , if that ’s what they claimed they wanted to do ?
Then there ’s another problem :
The banks no longer trust each other .
Last August , as mortgage - backed securities unraveled , finances froze up worldwide .
Why ?
Because banks knew how much undisclosed junk they had on their own books .
Who could say what the next fellow had ?
Overnight lending between banks — the process that ensures that every bank has funds when it needs them — fell apart .
This is a very big deal .
If banks will not lend money to each other , why ( except for the blessings of federal insurance ) should anyone else leave their money to them ?
Economists like me wait entire careers to study events such as these — which should provide no comfort to anyone else .
Since August , America ’s big banks have been wards of the Fed , and those in Europe equally so of the Bank of England and the European Central Bank .
The system survives because central banks keep the lending windows open , and the result is that — except for one instance in Britain — the public has not pulled out of the banks .
Let ’s be clear .
The private financial markets did actually fail .
It ’s only the fact that the public trusts government that keeps the system from dissolving in panic .
But even if the Fed and its counterparts can hold the line , the problem of mistrust among the big bankers wo n’t go away soon .
And that means we ’re at the end of the age of credit expansions , for now .
As for next year , good luck .
No matter who becomes president , there probably wo n’t be another tax cut .
Instead , cries for “ fiscal responsibility ” will be heard .
States and localities , hit in 2008 on their property taxes , will cut their spending .
Consumers , hit hard on their home equity , will cut back on new borrowing ( which they probably could n’t get anyway ) and pinch pennies however they can .
Businesses wo n’t even think about new investments .
In this situation , more cuts to interest rates — the only applicable tool the Fed has — do n’t work well .
And they weaken the dollar , which raises inflation .
What is gained by cheaper money will be lost in higher gas and food prices .
But if the Fed reverses field and defends the dollar , exports will slump and the housing crisis will get worse .
There ’s no easy way out .
Thus far the dollar has fallen , but it has n’t collapsed .
Will it ?
There are two big threats .
The first is the financial crisis itself , which is a problem of trust not only in the ordinary borrower , and not only in the banks , but in the American dollar .
Why is the rest of the world nervous ?
Because the fundamental trust that they have always had — that the United States was a safe place to put your money — has come into question .
The second threat , not often mentioned , is our reckless foreign policy , including the invasion of Iraq , bellicosity toward Iran , and the ongoing subtext of hostility toward China .
Since the Middle East has the oil and China holds our debts , all this is spitting in the soup , big time .
It may not by itself wreck the financial system .
But it does n’t exactly build up the reserve of good will that we may need when the financial going gets tough .
For half a century much of the world believed that we provided security under which they too could prosper ; many no longer think so .
Today , our country , like our banks , has a problem of global trust .
Unlike the banks , we have no higher power to keep things going if we screw up .
If you have been associated with “ youth culture ” well into your late 30s you are probably used to getting calls from journalists writing features with names like “ Hipster : The Dead End of Western Civilization . ”
If you have been associated with “ youth culture ” well into your late 30s you are probably used to getting calls from journalists writing features with names like Hipster : The Dead End of Western Civilization .
You may have noticed these titles sound eerily similar to Arthur Herman ’s neutron bomb of a book The Idea of Decline in Western History where he proves that people have ALWAYS been bitching about how bad things are getting and WILL ALWAYS glorify their youth as the salad days of the scene .
That ’s why I hate when people hipster - bash .
It ’s not because I invented hipsters or because they ’ve been my bread and butter for 15 years .
It ’s because people sound like such bitter , old , unlaid , fat , ugly , lonely , grumpy losers when they say , “ I hate hipsters . ”
It ’s the same as saying , “ I hate fashionable people who are younger than me . ”
Why ?
Well , the first reason is , journalists doing pieces like this are usually getting closer to 30 and they see this new generation of kids as worthless young upstarts who do n’t care about stuff as much as they should .
This is a natural part of getting older .
Seniors will always hate sophomores .
That ’s why there ’s wedgies .
The problem arises when you try to categorically prove this generation sucks and you were the real deal .
Sorry , but your youth was not that special .
It ’s not that they made the best records when you were 18 , it ’s that you bought the most records when you were that age .
That ’s why janitors have rockabilly hairdos and big sideburns .
As far as they ’re concerned , it should be 1958 forever .
Journalists who interview me always bring up punk as the definitive example of how the kids today are sellouts .
There ’s not “ more commercial punk . ”
There ’s more EVERYTHING .
That means more political punk , more disco punk , more free punk , you name it .
There ’s more fucking Mexican punks !
Today we have emos rioting in the streets with chaos punks in Mexico City .
When I was a kid there were three punks in Mexico and they all knew each other .
It ’s not commercialization it ’s MOREilization and that ’s a good thing .
When I was your age I used to take the 132 bus from the suburbs to get to Shake Records downtown .
Then I ’d spend $ 14.99 on any import that looked remotely punk .
Then I ’d be broke .
Today I can pay $ 10 a month for satellite radio and have endless music anywhere I go , or listen to my own Pandora stations on my phone , or sit on Frostwire all day getting music for free .
Why do journalists always assume I ’m going to say punk is dead and it ’s a great example of why youth culture is dead ?
Do n’t get me wrong , there ’s still such a thing as Selling Out .
Basically , if you find yourself changing lyrics or jokes or beliefs because they are going to bite the hand that feeds you , you are selling out .
If big business affects content then you could bandy around the word commercialized .
But that ’s not always the case .
When Hüsker Dü and the Clash signed to majors the labels did n’t tell them to do shit .
Big business is OFTEN bad but not always .
I do n’t like the idea of WalMart crushing local hardware stores and I ’m still scared of globalism and all that but to assume a few capitalist down sides have ruined everything we hold dear is apocalyptic claptrap .
Yes there are a lot of Starbucks out there .
There ’s also way more mom & pop coffee places than there have ever been and that ’s thanks to Starbucks .
They invented the idea of people going somewhere special for a coffee on the way to work .
More big business does n’t necessarily mean less small business .
For example , whenever anyone talks about the Internet being doomed , they use radio stations in the 50s as an example .
They say radio used to be totally independent but soon the major broadcasters owned 97 % of the stations out there .
That ’s true but it does n’t mean there was less independent radio .
If there were say , 3 radio stations in your town and they were all owned privately then radio was 100 % private .
If big business came in and added 97 stations to the mix , radio is now 97 % corporate .
There ’s still the same amount of independent stations , 3 . Only now there ’s 97 others which most likely means there ’s going to be more independent stations , not less .
Today anyone near a computer can start their own radio station .
The mathematical explanation for this huge surge of memes is called an asymptote .
There is more information available to us this year than all of history combined .
And that number keeps climbing exponentially .
Journalists can complain about “ the death of the underground ” all they want but there ’s actually more underground .
There ’s more fucking everything !
You can romanticize clamoring for mix tapes all you want .
I was there .
It sucked .
Today you can check out a thousand people ’s mix tapes on LastFM and pick and choose at will .
None of this matters of course .
Hipsters are n’t paying attention to these debates .
The same way Canadians bitch about Americans while Americans do n’t even know where Canada is , hipsters are too busy fucking and going to parties to worry if out - of - touch people resent them for not being political .
Occasionally I get paid good money to sit on a panel and privately tell a corporation what is “ cool . ”
It is the gayest thing in the universe but it ’s fun if you get drunk and they pay you like , $ 500 an hour .
I did it for Rolling Stone once and the panel was a strange mishmash of record execs , magazine editors , and , of all people , Handsome Dick Manitoba .
During the discussion some British baby boomer that knew David Bowie went off about “ the kids today ” and said they do n’t believe in anything anymore .
He talked about the mods fighting the rockers on the beaches of Brighton when he was a kid and “ Why do n’t the kids today do shit like that anymore ? ”
As with all things Youth Culture , you always end up saying more about yourself than the millions of twentysomethings you ’re talking about .
What he meant was HE was not involved in any of this shit anymore and therefore it must not be happening .
The fact that anarcho punks had recently almost shut down the WTO did n’t make it on to his radar .
Here ’s the one quote from the AdBusters article that made it in :
“ Gavin McInnes , one of the founders of Vice , who recently left the magazine , is considered to be one of hipsterdom ’s primary architects .
But , in contrast to the majority of concerned media - types , McInnes , whose “ Dos and Don’ts ” commentary defined the rules of hipster fashion for over a decade , is more critical of those doing the criticizing .
‘ I ’ve always found that word [ “ hipster ” ] is used with such disdain .
It ’s always used by chubby bloggers who are n’t getting laid anymore and are bored , and they ’re just so mad at these young kids for going out and getting wasted and having fun and being fashionable , ’ he says .
‘ I ’m dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda . ’ ”
- From “ Hipster : The Dead End of Western Civilization ”
The agenda I ’m referring to is : “ The kids today do n’t got no respect . ”
This sounds like something Archie Bunker would say or , more specifically , that sad , old fuck from Nathan Barley .
Shitting on people younger than you is not rocket science .
It ’s an innate gene in all of us .
Just know that when you do it you sound like every other bitter , old person out there and it ’s so transparent it ’s making the rest of us old people cringe .
UPDATE : Momus , who has been calling bullshit on the anti-hipster backlash for years , wrote this great article about the piece that sums up exactly what I ’m trying to say .

THE END IS NEAR – PART 1
Beneath the anonymity of the sky - blue burqa , Saliha 's slender frame and voice betray her young age .
Asked why she was serving seven years in jail alongside hardened insurgents and criminals , the 15 - year - old giggled and buried her head in her friend 's shoulder .
" She is shy , " apologised fellow inmate Zirdana , explaining that the teenager had been married at a young age to an abusive husband and ran away with a boy from her neighbourhood .
Asked whether she had loved the boy , Saliha squirmed with childish embarrassment as her friend replied : " Yes . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ostracised from her family and village , Saliha was convicted of escaping from home and illegal sexual relations .
The first carries a maximum penalty of 10 years , the second 20 .
These are two of the most common accusations facing female prisoners in Afghanistan .
Two - thirds of the women in Lashkar Gah 's medieval - looking jail have been convicted of illegal sexual relations , but most are simply rape victims – mirroring the situation nationwide .
The system does not distinguish between those who have been attacked and those who have chosen to run off with a man .
Sitting among the plastic flowers around his desk , where an optimistic United Nations scales of justice poster competed for space with images of Afghanistan 's President , Hamid Karzai , Colonel Ghulam Ali , a high - ranking regional security officer , explained sternly that he supported the authorities ' right to convict victims of rape .
" In Afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the Islamic rules say that it is , " he claimed .
" I think it is good .
There are many diseases that can be created in today 's world , such as HIV , through illegal sexual relations . "
But there are signs of progress .
A female shura , or consultative council , was established in Helmand province last week to try to combat the injustice of treating an abused woman as a criminal , and not a victim .
British officers and Afghan government officials from the province 's reconstruction team are also overseeing a project to build humane accommodation for the 400 male and female prisoners .
Inside the fortified compound of the prison in Lashkar Gah , Helmand 's capital , the 330 male prisoners laze about in the shade of their straw huts .
The prison security was was recently upgraded with new razor wire and guard posts following the attack on Kandahar 's prison in which more than a 1,000 inmates escaped , including 400 Taliban .
Past the main gate , inmates – whether on remand and awaiting trial or convicts – are incarcerated alongside 50 insurgents .
In a separate area are the female " criminals " – the youngest is just 13 years old – along with their small children , who must stay with their mothers if no one else will claim them .
Their only luxury is a carpet , two blankets , basic cooking facilities and two daily deliveries of bread .
They have neither medical care nor , as Colonel Ali acknowledged , " basic human facilities " , such as washing areas , electricity and drinking water .
All this he hopes will be rectified when the new building his finished .
Pushing her five - year - old son's arm forward imploringly , Zirdana , 25 , pointed to the festering wound buzzing with flies .
The little boy was just two months old when his mother was convicted of murdering her husband , his father .
Zirdana had been handed over to him at the age of seven , as part payment in a financial dispute .
She gave birth to the first of her children when she was 11 and was pregnant with her fourth when her husband disappeared and she was accused of killing him .
Her three older children were taken from her by her brother - in - law .
" When I first came to jail I cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth .
My husband 's brother told me he would give my children back when I came out of jail but he has become a Talib .
Nobody comes to see us in jail .
There are a lot of diseases , " she said .

Next to her , Dorkhani , 55 , sobbed so much that the glint of her tears shone through the mesh of her burqa .
Married for four decades to a relatively wealthy man from Nowzad , the couple had fled to Lashkar Gah after a family dispute .
When he returned to Nowzad , to try and reclaim his money , he disappeared .
" The ones who killed my husband , they have money and they threw me in jail .
I am 100 per cent innocent .
I have no one , no brother to look after me , " she said , explaining that those with cash could buy their freedom .
Last week , in Helmand , the new Women and Children 's Justice Shura met and voted in its constitution with the help of advisers from the Afghan Human Rights Committee and support from the Women 's Affairs Department , as well as a government legal adviser .
The shura , made up of 20 influential women , mostly teachers , hopes to tackle the inequality of the system by first ensuring that women in the province become aware of their basic right : not to have to endure abuse .
Earlier this year a report by Womankind , Taking Stock : Afghan Women and Girls Seven Years
On , revealed that violent attacks against women , usually in a domestic setting , are at epidemic proportions – 87 per cent of women complain of such abuse , and half of it is sexual .
More than 60 per cent of marriages are forced and , despite laws banning the practice , 57 per cent of brides are under 16 .
Many of these girls are offered as restitution for a crime or as debt settlement .
Afghanistan is the only country in the world with a higher suicide rate among women than men .
In the UK , the MP Malcolm Bruce , chairman of the House of Commons International Development Committee , warned : " There is a dangerous tendency to accept in Afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere , because of ' cultural ' differences and local traditions . "
The shura is hoping to provide a place where women can report abuse and create a separate centre for women and girls incarcerated for running away .
It would be a compromise of custody without the stigma of being thrown in jail .
" They are very aware of the inequality in the system , " said Royal Navy Lieutenant Rebecca Parnell , a member of the Cimic , or civil - military co-operation , team .
" The most refreshing thing is that there are plans coming from the Department of Women 's Affairs .
It is not just us pushing our ideas on to them . "
The military aid team has programmes for monthly health checks and trauma counselling in the prison as well as vocational training in carpet weaving , tailoring , literacy and basic health education .
As she was led away to her jail cell yesterday , Dorkhani lifted her burqa to reveal a sun-battered face streaked with tears and pleading eyes : " Please , please take our words somewhere where people will be kind and help us . "
Mayor Cheye Calvo got home from work , saw a package addressed to his wife on the front porch and brought it inside .
Suddenly , police with guns drawn kicked in the door and stormed in , shooting to death the couple ’s two dogs and seizing the unopened package .
Inside was 32 pounds of marijuana that evidently did n’t belong to the couple .
Police now say the mayor and his wife appear to have been innocent victims of a scheme by two men to smuggle millions of dollars ’ worth of the drug by having it delivered to about half a dozen unsuspecting recipients .
The men , who are under arrest , include a FedEx deliveryman .
Investigators allege that he would drop a package off outside a home and that the other man would come by soon after to pick it up .

Now federal authorities say they ’re looking into what happened during the July 29 raid .
FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf said late Thursday that the bureau had opened a civil rights investigation .
A furious Calvo said earlier Thursday that he and his wife , Trinity Tomsic , were asking the Justice Department to investigate .
“ Trinity was an innocent victim and random victim , ” Calvo said outside his two - story red - brick house in this middle - class Washington suburb of about 3,000 .
“ We were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us . ”
Calvo said that the couple ’s two black Labradors were gentle and that police killed one of them as it was running away .

“ Our dogs were our children , ” said Calvo , 37 .
“ They were the reason we bought this house , because it had a big yard for them to run in . ”
The mayor said he was handcuffed for about two hours along with his mother - in - law .
No charges were brought against Calvo or his wife , who came home during the raid .
Prince George ’s County Police Chief Melvin High said Wednesday that Calvo and his family were “ most likely . . . innocent victims , ” but he would not rule out their involvement .
He and other officials did not apologize for killing the dogs , saying the officers felt threatened .
The neighborhood has rallied around the family .

Homes built today are generally twice as efficient as their 1980s counterparts .
Improved window technology , more efficient heating and cooling equipment , better control of air infiltration , and greater use of insulation are helping decrease energy use in today ’s homes .
But building science — the physics of optimizing building performance and understanding why buildings fail — also plays a pivotal role .
Building science encompasses the study of heat transfer , airflow , and moisture movement through building enclosures ; and how those factors affect the building ’s performance , durability , comfort , and air quality .
It predicts and measures the relationship people have to the controlled environment of buildings .
Building science encompasses home design , construction , diagnostics , repair , and operation — all pitching in to make better buildings .
Dealing with Heat Flow
Insulation controls the flow of heat through a building assembly by slowing the conductive heat transfer through the envelope .
Wherever floors , walls , ceilings , windows , and doors are exposed to differing inside and outside temperatures , heat conduction takes place .
The more insulation you pack into the envelope , the more heat transfer will be slowed .
Building techniques have a particularly important role in this .
In typical stick - frame construction , the large amount of framing material ( i.e. , studs , footers , and headers ) not only means less opportunity for insulation but more conductive heat loss and gain .
Framing members act as thermal bridging , reducing a wall ’s R- value by 10 % to 25 % in an average home .
To avoid thermal bridging , insulation should be installed in a continuous , unbroken manner from foundation to roof .
Conventional stud- framing does not allow this , but wrapping , taping , and sealing rigid insulating sheathing around the 40 exterior can offer one solution for a stick - frame house .
Whole - wall systems that combine insulation and structure in one unit , such as structural insulated panels ( SIPs ) and insulated concrete forms ( ICFs ) , are becoming a more common approach to providing a continuous layer of insulation , to reduce air leakage and thermal bridging .
In addition to reducing conduction , insulation also plays a role in keeping the wall assembly dry .
For example , another benefit to wrapping the exterior walls with rigid board insulation is that if ( or more likely , when ) a small amount of moisture enters a warmed stud cavity , it would not come into contact with any cold surfaces and condense .
Addressing Airflow
What insulation does not do is stop air leakage into and out of a building .
Although caulk , gaskets , and weather - stripping will reduce unwanted air leakage , understanding how air ( heated and / or moisture laden ) moves through wall assemblies will help you develop a more systemic approach to cut leakage .
Use a three - pronged approach to gain control over the movement of air in and out of your home :
Seal the leaks ( both the obvious and not so obvious ) .
During construction , no one typically is responsible for sealing penetrations made in the framing or structure .
Never assume that the electricians and plumbers are thinking about reducing the air leakage , so be diligent about sealing these leaks .
Notorious air leak areas occur around electrical outlets , recessed light fixtures , and anywhere dissimilar materials come together — a window frame and wall , for instance , or where concrete meets wood .

Provide a continuous air barrier that can resist air pressure differences .
This is usually done with impermeable “ house wrap , ” but can be done in conjunction with a continuous layer of insulation .
Batt and blown - in insulation do not act as air barriers , so one should always be added .
Spray foams and rigid insulation ( with sealed joints ) are the only insulation types that are also air barriers .
Gypsum board and exterior sheathing that are properly installed are also effective air barriers .

Control air pressure .
Sealing leaks and providing an effective air barrier can translate into an efficient house that saves both energy and money .
However , “ tight ” houses need to be ventilated to exchange stale , moist indoor air with fresh outdoor air .
Controlled or mechanical ventilation systems can be exhaust - only , supply - only , or balanced ( a combination of the two ) .
However , do n’t assume that just because you have one of these systems , you have control over your air pressure .
Any ductwork and air - handling equipment must be sealed against air leakage to prevent unequal pressure in of your space .
Your HVAC contractor may or may not have done this — it ’s your job to follow up !
Managing Moisture
Moisture accumulates in a building envelope when more enters than exits .
When moisture accumulation is greater than a material ’s ability to store the moisture , problems result .
There are three general strategies for avoiding moisture damage in a home :
Control moisture entry at the roof , walls , and foundation
Control moisture accumulation when a material gets wet by allowing it to dry
Remove moisture by source control and ventilation
These strategies are best used in combination .
However , making them work together effectively can be quite a balancing act .
The first step to controlling moisture is to shed bulk water away from the building .
Grading the site to channel water away from the structure and using appropriately sized roof overhangs , gutters , and roof flashing are the major methods .
However , for maximum efficiency , this principle should also be applied to dormers , windows , doors , skylights , balconies , decks , and railings .
Keep even more moisture at bay by designing simple roof structures instead of complex ones , locating the building , overhangs , and landscaping to protect against prevailing winds and rain , and making sure moisture - management architectural specifications are followed .
For moisture that does manage to work its way in , have a plan in place for draining bulk moisture out of the building .
Drainage planes , such as building paper installed in shingle fashion with properly installed flashing , can be effective drainage tools .
Controlling water vapor is more complicated , and every climate calls for a different strategy .
Many designers and builders do n’t understand the vapor profiles of the wall assemblies they specify .
Instead , they rely on the use of impermeable membranes , which , when breached , trap moisture in assemblies and often cause the exact problem that they were trying to avoid .
Vapor barriers and retarders , such as foil - faced insulating sheathing or extruded polystyrene ( thicker than 1 inch ) , are two technologies used in vapor control .
Vapor barriers stop the movement of water vapor or are impermeable to water vapor through the wall system they are applied to .
Vapor retarders are considered semipermeable to water vapor , allowing a small , measurable amount of water vapor to pass through them .
They are made from a variety of materials , including polyethylene , foil , rigid - foam insulation , and even vapor - retarding paint .
When to use vapor barriers / retarders depends on a variety of climate and site factors .
In general , vapor retarders are most commonly used and are most effective in the more extreme hot and cold climates , where the differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures are large and humidity is great .
In cold climates , installing vapor control to the inside allows moisture to dry to the outside .
In hot - humid climates , installing vapor control toward the outside of the wall assembly allows moisture to dry to the inside .
In climates where you get a bit of both seasonally or if you live in a “ mixed ” climate , design the wall to dry to both sides .
One common approach is called the “ flow - through ” method , which allows water vapor to diffuse through the wall assembly without accumulating .
( See Access . )
Moisture is often easily controlled by managing it at the source .
For example , perhaps the site ’s drainage is directing rainwater toward the home ’s foundation or residents are n’t being diligent about using bathroom or kitchen exhaust fans , causing excessive humidity to condense on windows and rot the sills .
Exhaust - only or spot ventilation systems are strategically placed exhaust fans that remove moist and polluted air .
The fresh air either comes from open doors or windows or random leaks unless you have a tight house , where vents that passively open with negative air pressure can provide the needed fresh air .
Supply systems use forced - air heating or air - conditioning systems to supply fresh outdoor air through existing ductwork .
These systems involve control mechanisms , and do not necessarily reduce energy consumption .
Diligent use of exhaust fans is still needed .
Balanced systems capture the heat from exhaust air to condition the supply air , capturing the majority of otherwise lost energy .
The American Society of Heating , Refrigeration , and Air Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) recommends that mechanical ventilation be no less than 50 cubic feet per minute ( cfm ) with 50 to 100 cfm requirements for kitchens and bathrooms .
In “ tight ” houses , a controlled ventilation strategy controls air pressure but also helps maintain consistent interior humidity levels and provides fresh air to the occupants .
The keys to a successful controlled ventilation strategy are to :
Know how many cfm of air you need to move ;
Avoid overventilating in the winter , which can increase heating needs and bills ; and underventilating in the summer , which can cause rooms to be stuffy and uncomfortable ;
Provide ventilation only when the building is occupied .
Occupants want their homes to be comfortable and healthy , and not enslave them to high heating and cooling costs .
Our household environment should not have to suffer for poor planning , dysfunctional designs , and a short - sighted approach to home building .
By understanding the basics of how our homes operate and why they fail , we can move beyond “ green building ” and make superior building performance standard practice .

Another on - air oddity from Dan Rather :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_RbtEkjqIU&feature=related#
Observations :
- Rather 's language suggests he has knowledge of a video clip in custody of CBS News in which Giuliani " holds up " what he claims is a " flight recorder box " from the WTC wreckage .
- Rather introduces this clip , but immediately a BBC - style " technical problem " prevents its being aired .
- Giuliani would not make such an announcement to the national media casually -- much less " hold up " the object in question -- without confirmation that what had been found was indeed a " flight recorder box " and not the remains of some other electronic appliance from the debris .
This episode supports claims by FDNY personnel and an NTSB " insider " that the WTC " black boxes " were in fact found , and suggests the actual moment the blackout curtain descends on this matter in the corporate media .
http://www.counterpunch.org/lindorff12202005.html
Like his brief echo of the George Washington Bridge " truck filled with explosives " , this appears to be another telling , quickly muted , never - corrected departure from the official narrative by Rather , giving further context to his ominous comments about the " flaming necklace " of " lack of patriotism " inflicted upon free - thinking journalists after 9/11 .
Does anyone , anywhere have video or a transcript of Giuliani making such an announcement ?
Is there any follow - up to Rather 's intro in the archives ?
The ballistic missile threat to Israel Defence Force ( IDF ) bases in the central region and south is not as grave as thought , a recent study conducted by the army 's Planning Division said .
According to the study , the bases would not need to be evacuated in the event of a war in the north , The Jerusalem Post reported on its website Friday .
The study was conducted by a team of officers and included an advanced analysis of the missiles in the arsenals of Israel 's neighbors , particularly Syria and Hezbollah .
It was initiated following the Second Lebanon War , when 4,000 Hezbollah rockets struck northern Israel .
The study shows that although Syria and Hezbollah have thousands of short - range rockets and long - range ballistic missiles , their accuracy is limited .
The study further concluded that due to the inaccuracy of the Syrian and Hezbollah missiles , Ramat David Air Force Base situated near Nazareth need n't evacuate and transfer the aircraft deployed there to alternative bases in the south as thought .

Cretan Traditional Music and Dance An introduction to the wild and unpredictable music of Crete
Cretan music is wild and unpredictable .
Quite a different thing to the disciplined bouzouki music of the Greek mainland .
Endless melodies , one after the other in complicated 7/8 or 9/8 time , sometimes monotonous and archaic , sometimes almost ecstatic .
The oriental influence can not be missed .
The main role is taken by the lyra , the traditional three - stringed instrument made of mulberry wood , supported on the knee .
It resembles a violin , but is played by grazing the strings with a fingernail and plays the main melody .
A theme is repeated with an infinite number of varitations and embellishments .
The laouto ( a type of lute , doublestrung , 4 or 6 double strings ) and the tambouras ( bouzouki ) serve as accompanying instruments .
There is often singing , too , with the singer and the lyra leading the melody alternately .
The verses mostly consist of Mantinades ( or Kondylies ) , which are 15 - syllable couplets with a lot of humour and spirit .
They are often created spontaneously and deal with love , nature or worldly affairs , sometimes spoofing members of the audience .
There are Mantinades for every occasion , and even children practise them .
The pieces of music can be drawn out for as long as desired , by repeating the second half of the stanza together with the first half of the second stanza ( A1+A2 - A2+B1-B1 + B2 ) .
The original form of making music is met at most Cretan festivals .
Even young peple are mostly interested in it , in spite of the existence of pop music , and there are even complete orchestras of lyras in the cities .
The lyra is an exacting instrument to play , and with hard work and talent it can bring a masterful virtuosity to it 's player .
Cretan traditional music is very complex due to the fact that many civilizations , at various periods of time , have intruded and inhabited the island : Venetians , Saracens , Turks ... Moreover , after 330 B.C. Greek civilization followed two trends , one following Alexander the Great ( in the East ) and another following the Roman trends ( in the West ) .
Crete was a colony of the Byzantine Empire and occasionally received many refugees .
All kinds of music that the various cultures have introduced to the island have stayed there and created a chaos of sounds .
The Cretans have combined and embellished all these kinds of music and created all these beautiful songs we can hear up untill today , like rizitika ( ' rebel ' feast music ) , amanes ( popular musical genre originated in Ionia and famous in Smyrna , which includes an instrumental introduction , two lines sung with long melismas on the word aman , and a faster instrumental refrain ) and Erotokriti ( folk songs based upon the celebrated love poem Erotokritos by the Cretan Poet Vincenzo Cornaros .
It contains upwards of 10.000 lines , equal to 5000 verses , composed in the 16th century ) .
History
Crete , due to its location in a tri-continent spot ( Europe , Asia & Africa ) , has always been since antiquity a center of European civilization .
According to lore , this is where the art of orchestration was first nurtured .
The earliest indications about the Greek ancient music culture are images on pottery .
It is known that about 1500 B.C. people already played instruments resembling the ' lyra ' , which took the name ' Phorminx ' .
This instrument formed the basis for the development of the classical ' lyra ' , called ' Kithara ' .
The Phorminx is believed to derive from outside Greece , probably Mesopatamia .
Some say it comes from Atlantis ...
The oldest known written musical piece is from 200 B.C.
It 's a part of the Orestes tragedy , written by Euripides 2 centuries before .
On the Papyrus is a text as well as part of a melody .
Letters from the Greek alphabet indicate the pitch of the song .
A different , probably older method is used to notate the instrumental parts .
It is unknown whether Euripides wrote the music as well and how it should have sounded .
Famous Cretan Musicians
Psarantónis ( Antónis Xyloúris )
Brother of Nikos Xylouris and one of the members of this great musical family from Anoghia , Crete , Psarantonis developed his own style of playing the lyra and other traditional instruments and of singing .
Depending on his great knowledge of Cretan musical tradition he breathes new life into the songs by adding new tunes and rhythms .
Nikos Xyloúris
The voice of Nikos Xylouris links the folk music tradition of the island of Crete and the ' entechnon ' music trend of the ' 70s , itself a ' back - to - the - roots ' aesthetic movement .
One of the most prominent singers of both traditions , Xylouris became a symbol of resistance against the military junta of 1967 - 74 .
Above all , he was a leading lyre - player and folk singer .
His unity of songs re-examine the relationship between tradition and the present .
Many songs were also about the tense political climate in former Greece .
He died in 1980 after a long illness .
Thanássis Skordalós
According to many Cretans the best lyra player ever .
But you seem to have to be a Cretan to appreciate what he played , because of the many nuances .
Unfortunately he died .
Leonídas Kládos
Loudovíkos ton Anogion
Haralambos ( Babis ) Garganourákis
Dimítris Vakákis
Dimitris had a terrible car accident in Spring 2000 , at which his mother died and he himself got seriously injured .
We all hope everything will be better soon , but are sad because of this tragedy .
Kóstas Moundákis
M. Alefantinos
He was born in Saint Mama of Mylopotamos , in Rethymno .
An area that according to an ancient tradition " gets " the most popular lyrists of Crete .
His father Manolis Alefantinos was an ancient lyrist and one of the most important instrument makers in the field of traditional music instruments and especially of Cretan lyre .
So it was absolutely normal for Michalis to work on music .
From an early age he was occupied with lyre in spite of his father 's reactions that wanted him to be " literate " .
Manolis Larentzakis
He was born in Piskopiano of Chersonniso .
Since he was very young he liked Cretan music .
He appeared for first time in 1969 to play lute .
He quickly became very famous and many lyrists wanted to be cooperated with him .
He played next to many remarkable lyrists such as : Giorgo Kalomiri , Niko Sopasi , Gianni Koufalitaki , Manoura , Kefalogianni , Stelio Vasilaki , Alecho Polychronaki , Manoli Karpoutzaki and many others .
Michalis Marakomichelakis
Born in Timbaki of Heraklion Crete in 1972 .
From the age of 10 years old he was occupied with music , now that he had his first incentives from his grandpas who were well known local artists .
Firstly he worked on lyre and afterwards on guitar .
He finished high and middle school in Timbaki and after his soldiering he moved out to Heraklion where he started lessons at the Greek Musical Academy and got the Musical Academy 's certificate that offered him the capability of teaching at the private or public education .
Mantinades
The Cretan mantinades belong to a common genre of popular folk poetry consisting of fifteen - syllable verses arranged in rhyming distichs or couplets , found throughout the continental and insular Greek world .
The mantinades are products of a long tradition going back to the Venetian Renaissance period of Crete 's past and beyond to Byzantium and antiquity , for Cretan society has been proverbially conservative since ancient times .
Today , the mantinades are still improvised and sung on festive occasions : celebrations , weddings , baptisms , village festivals and ' panegyria ' of all kinds .
Themes such as " Love , " " Pain of Love , " " Heart , " " Beauty , " " Eyes , " and " Kisses " are common .
Some samples of mantinades by the famous Cretan writer Kazantzakis :
Let me be ground to crumbs or pie-meat , My shattered bones would still have strength to run to you !
( Kazantzakis 1 , p. 161 ) When you 've made up your mind , no use lagging behind , go ahead and no relenting Let your youth have free reign , it wo n't come again , so be bold and no repenting .
( Kazantzakis 1 , p. 184 ) Tell me with a laugh , tell me with a cry , Tell me you do not love me , What care I ? ( Kazantzakis 1 , p. 196 )
Rizitika
The rizitika ( " rebel " ) songs represent the most important genre of vocal music in western Crete .
The area of the rizitika is in the northern part of the Lefka Ori ( White Mountains ) , within the province of Chaniá .
Here the rizitika are the principal musical repertoire for feasts in the villages , above all marriages and baptisms , but also for simple banquets .
Based on the type of performance occasion , rizitika songs can be divided into two repertoires : the tavla repertoire ( songs for the table ) and the strata repertoire ( songs for the road ) .
The tavla repertoire is reserved for convivial occasions , mainly wedding banquets .
The strata repertoire is strictly reserved for parts of the wedding rites other than the banquet , that is , for the transfer of the dowry to the bridegroom 's house , the ceremonial welcome by the bridegroom 's mother of the bride , the gathering of the gifts , etc .
These activities are accompanied by songs on the strata melody and called , as a whole , tou gamou tragoudi , wedding song .
Erotokriti
Erotokritos ( " Tried by Love " ) is a rhymed , adventurous love poem of 10.010 lines composed about four centuries ago , during Venetian rule and the pre-Ottoman burst that came to be known as " Cretan Renaissance " .
Erotokritos was apparently written by Vicentso Kornaros , a Hellenized nobleman of Venetian extraction .
Many Cretan singers like to sing some verses from this poem , some sing the whole Erotokritos during a concert .
Folk songs based upon this celebrated love poem are called ' Erotokriti ' .
Some lines from Erotokritos , translators are in (... ) :
Of all the gracious things upon this earth
It is fair words that have the greatest worth , And he who uses them with charm and guile Can cozen human eyes to weep or smile .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos I 887-90 ( Stephanides )
Begin your lesson now .
It is a rule
That he who starts in time soon leaves the school .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos II 1871 - 2 ( Stephanides )
There are full many , sweet , whose tongues are bland , Who hide a poison phial in the hand .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos III 141 - 2 ( Stephanides )
You straighten easily a fresh - cut stake , Yet when it dries it will but split and break .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos III 279-80 ( Stephanides )
True is that adage : " He who yields to rule by woodenheads , becomes himself a fool . " -- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos III 967 -8 ( Stephanides )
Well said by the prudent who discover :
The heaviest pain lighter ones cover .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos III 1287 - 8 ( Ragovin 1 , p. 14 )
Man shapes his plans as he intends and deems ,
And not because of visions and of dreams ;
The future is not yet , dreams cannot sway , Man 's destiny this , that , or any way ;
As each one makes his bed , so does he sleep ;
The foolish only trysts with shadows keep .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos IV 139 - 144 ( Stephanides )
Anyone who wants the great things of this life
Yet does not know he is only travelling the road ,
And prides himself on his nobility and boasts of his wealth - I dismiss him as a nobody , to be thought of as mad , For these things are flowers which come and go , They are changed by time , and time often takes them away .
-- V. Kornaros , Erotokritos IV 601-6 ( Bryans , p. 89 )
Amanes
' Amanes ' is an expression used in the Middle East and Greece to discuss an emotion that is beyond a verbal articulation , it 's a very extreme feeling .
Usually the ' amanes ' are a series of improvisations that take place before and during a song .
In a way ' amen / aman ' is very similar .
It 's just this finality of expression .
Amanes are for people very ritualistic and really trying to lose their minds because of living in a certain kind of oppressive situation .
It 's very similar to ( North African ) Rai music in that way .
Where to hear and find live Cretan music ?
Real Cretan ( not Greek ) music ( Lyra and Laouto , not Bouzouki ) and dances you can experience every evening in Rethimnon at Taverna Gounas ( Panou Koroneou 8 ) and in Chania at cafe " Kriti ( Lyrakia ) " ( Kalergon 22 ) near the fishermen 's harbour .
At both places you will meet Cretans and tourists together .
Look for posters on trees with a picture of a musician playing a Bouzuki or Lyra .
Ask at your hotel reception , they may know of any local events .
A recommended place to buy cassettes , records and CDs with traditional Cretan music is : STUDIO A , Apokoronou 16 - 20 , Chania , Tel. 86788 .
Cretan dances
Cretan people are deeply connected with music and rhythm .
Through their music they express their feelings , the joy , the sorrow , the love , the passion for live .
Another great passion is dancing on traditional music .
On Crete there are many kinds of traditional dances , like Maleviziotis , Pentozalis , Sousta , Syrtos and Syganos .
• MALEVIZIOTIS ( Sousta ) :
Fast and lively dance that allows for very impressive improvisations by the lead dancer .
It is the modern version of an ancient war dance that represents the adventure in battle .
The tempo is 2/ 4 and it is danced in 8 steps towards the center and 8 steps towards the outside .
Now it is the lovers ' dance .
It expresses the rich emotions of the Cretan people - life 's eternal song .
It is named after its small , noiseless and playful steps .
It is one of the most beautiful love dances of our country .
• SIGANOS :
They used to dance Siganos holding each other 's hand .
During the era of Turkish occupation it became a team dance , the dance of friendship , the chain of unity and freedom and thus , the spiritual expression of the Cretan people .
• PENTOZALIS :
Traditionally a man 's dance , fast and it is accompanied by " mantinades , " the traditional Cretan lyrics .
It took its name from the words " pente zala " which mean " five steps . "
The tempo is 2/ 4 and its is danced with 5 steps , which , expanded , become 9 .
Pentozali is originally from Rethimnon in Crete ; it is now pan-Cretan and also known on the mainland .
Although most outsiders would say that the dance has 8 or 10 steps , the Cretans use an unusual numbering method .
The dance may be done either in place or moving counterclockwise .
The basic steps of the fast Pentozali are among the trickiest to do in all of Greek dancing , and some variatons are even more difficult .
The fast Pentozali may be danced alone or preceded by the slow Pentozali ( Siganos ) .
The slow pentozali is done with a hand - to - hand hold and the fast with a hand to shoulder hold .
Traditionally , the dancers would sing traditional Cretan verse ( such as the Kondylies or Erotokritos ) while dancing the slow Pentozali .
It 's a traditional war dance representing revolution , heroism and hope .
The black handkerchief on the dancer 's head witnesses the sacrifices of the Cretan folk .
• SYRTOS ( TSIRIGHETIKOS ) :
This dance originated in the city of Chania in western Crete and is thus known on Crete as Haniotikos .
This dance is done with a leader holding two kercheifs or bandanas in the left hand .
There are two lines of people next to the leader , one behind the other , with the leader of each line holding one of the bandanas in the right hand .
In the lines , everybody is facing center , and the hands are in the W - position for the Part I and down for Part II .
This is an island syrtos .
The music is in even rhythm , but for dancing we break it up into SSQ ( Slow , Slow Quick ) units .
If we were counting , we would have three beats for each of the slow units and two beats for the quick .
Normal Syrtos is SQQ .
It is the expression of a secret decision for life and death , love and secret wishes , as the dancers express their sad or happy story through simple , creeping steps .
• KASTRINOS :
Kastrinos is the most masculine , the fastest and the most impressive dance of Crete .
It was named after the Great Castle ( Kastro ) , today 's Iraklio .
Its brisk rhythm and liveliness give the opportunity to the dancer to show off his agility , stamina and his ability to improvise and impress with his figures .
It is the most difficult , but also the most popular Cretan dance .

Products Editor James
Gray recently sat down for a virtual gab fest with Håkon Wium Lie Chief Technology Officer of Opera .
They discussed Opera 9.5 , Opera 's history , why Linux users should choose Opera and much more .
Linux Journal :
Thank you for speaking with us today , Håkon .
First question :
You recently released Version 9.5 of the Opera browser .
What features are you most excited about in this new release ?
Håkon Wium Lie : Opera 9.5 is a big step forward for us .
The most noticeable change is to the skin of the browser .
It 's a new and fresh design that also takes up less space on the screen so you have more room for the actual page you 're browsing .
Opera 9.5 brings a number of innovations .
Opera 9.5 is the first desktop release with Opera Link .
You can use Opera Link to synchronize your bookmarks , personal bar and Speed Dial with any other Opera desktop browser .
It also synchronizes with Opera Mini on your mobile phone , which is also free to download and works on more than 800 different phone models .
In Opera desktop you can also synchronize your notes with Opera Link and we look forward to adding that data type to Opera Mini in the near future .
We also introduced Quick Find , a feature that lets you search the text of any page you 've visited .
You do n't need to bookmark pages anymore , you can find a site just by remembering some of the text on the page .
Some changes are hidden but very noticeable .
We now use the latest core rendering engine which brings with it improved speed , performance and site compatibility .
We made dramatic speed enhancements to the e-mail client and handling of RSS feeds .
Lastly , we improved our Fraud Protection technology .
Originally designed to stop phishing sites , it now protects against malware .
Unlike other anti-malware solutions inside Web browsers , Opera 's Fraud Protection blocks both hacked sites that distribute malware unintentionally as well as sites that try to trick users into clicking links that load malicious software .
We really feel this is the best Opera browser yet released , although we have much more to come .
LJ : What can you tell us about your vision for post - 9.5 development ?
Lie : I can't reveal all the improvements and features we are working on , because we want them to be a surprise , but you should definitely expect Opera Link to be improved .
We 'll continue to evolve our standards - support and I suspect you will also see even more performance and speed improvements .
LJ : What do you feel sets Opera apart from other browsers technologically speaking ?
Lie :
There 's a craft to what we do .
Making a browser fast , while packing in features without adding bloat to the browser is a real testament to the art of what we do and the effort we put in .
We are also able to port our code so it can run on a variety of operating systems and devices .
You can get the exact same Opera rendering engine on your Linux machine as you can on a home automation wallpad in Korea or a picture frame in Japan .
These products are in the market today and it's a real testament to the engineering talent we 're fortunate to have .
LJ : The number of users of Opera does n't seem to match its quality level , at least among Linux Journal readers .
Why do you think this is the case ?
And what is your ' elevator speech ' on why one should choose Opera over other browsers ?
Lie :
We 'd like to have more users on Linux .
At Opera , we believe in open standards , security , speed , performance and features -- these are values that we share with the Linux community .
The one issue that sets us apart is the source code .
We 're very proud of our source code and we'd like to show it to others , but we have n't found a business model that allows us to do so while still charging for commercial use .
( Ideally , I 'd like to see an open source license similar to the Creative Commons non-commercial license .
The license would say " here 's the source code , feel free to use and reuse it , but we 'd like a cut if you make money from it " .
This model seems more fair than the current " here 's the source code , feel free to use and reuse it and deploy it in your mega- million [ dollar ] data centers if you like " . )
Anyway , on the Web I believe open standards are much more important than open source .
The content we create on the Web will last much longer than any browser you use .
Also , you can easily switch to another browser in the future but it 's much harder to re-code the content of the Web .
Therefore , I encourage Linux users to not only consider the license of the browser they use .
LJ : You supported Linux quite early on .
What prompted this decision ?
Lie :
There were several reasons .
Many of the employees Opera hired were Linux users , myself included .
And we wanted our favorite browser to be available on our platform of choice .
Unlike some other browser vendors , we are not attached to any particular operating system .
Furthermore , porting to Linux was quite easy to do for us .
Therefore , the decision was easy to make .
Today we have many customers on Linux in the embedded space , so it also makes commercial sense for us to be on Linux .
LJ : How did Opera get started ?
Lie : Opera started as a research project within Telenor , the Norwegian telephone company .
It was founded by Jon von Tetzchner and Geir Ivarsøy .
I was part of the group at Telenor , but I did n't think we could compete with Mosaic .
That was fairly dumb thinking on my part .
Instead of working on a new browser , I wanted to improve the technical foundation of the Web .
Therefore , I went to CERN in Switzerland to work with Tim Berners - Lee on Web specifications .
I proposed Cascading Style Sheets while in 1994 and took the specification with me to W3C a little later .
As a W3C staff member , I worked to have Netscape and Internet Explorer support CSS interoperably .
That was quite hard as none of them had a tradition for following standards written by others .
Not so at Opera .
Opera started working on CSS support in 1998 and after seeing Opera 's amazing progress for three months , I was convinced : these guys can compete with anyone !
At that point I decided to join the company .
The brain behind Opera 's CSS implementation was Geir Ivarsøy .
He 's the best programmer I have known , and working closely with him for several years was a privilege .
Geir also contributed the " Opera " name to the company during a period when he listened to lots of opera music .
Unfortunately , Geir died in 2006 after a long battle with cancer .
Opera 9 states " In memory of Geir Ivarsøy " on its " Opera : About " page .
LJ : You have your headquarters in Oslo , Norway , and nine other satellite offices .
What role do your satellite offices play ?
Lie : Each office plays its own role .
Overall , they bring us closer to our customers both big companies and individual consumers .
They help us reach people on their own terms and greatly expand our ability to make Opera more relevant in each local market .
Also , the offices are placed in strategic locations .
Linköping in Sweden , where most of Opera Mini is produced , has some of the best mobile development talent in the world .
Wroclaw in Poland has exceptionally skilled BREW and Linux engineers .
Silicon Valley is our next location we 're ramping up .
We have a smaller office that we are rapidly expanding .
LJ : What is your company 's revenue model now that Opera is ad - free ?
Lie :
We have two main sources of income .
First , we sell Opera licenses to device makers who would like a snappy little browser on their units .
Second , we have revenue - sharing agreements with search engines and others so that we also generate income from the free versions of Opera .
LJ : What exciting things is Opera doing outside of the standard Web browser ?
Lie :
We 're adding much functionality outside of the browser box .
I 'll give you three example of how I use Opera myself .
I use Opera as an image viewer on the local file system .
When you open a local directory , you can cycle through images by pressing the space bar .
Pressing F11 will take you into the full - screen mode where all pixels on the screen are controlled by Opera .
Second , I use Opera in full - screen mode when giving presentations -- we call this OperaShow .
http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/operashow/
Presentations are stored in HTML , and CSS is used to describe the appearance of the slides .
HTML and CSS is a good combination , and presentations are typically much more compact than when using OpenOffice or ( ugh ! ) PowerPoint .
Third , I use HTML and CSS when writing paper - bound letters , which sometimes is still necessary .
Using common
Web standards for paper - based correspondence makes a lot of sense : the formats are lightweight , and can easily be published on the Web or printed .
Here 's an example of a letter written in HTML :
http://www.princexml.com/2005/campaign/
Web standards are also suitable for writing applications , or widgets as we call them .
We 're working hard to make Opera 9.5 available on mobile devices .
This makes it possible to write widgets that can run on the desktop , mobile phones , the Internet Channel on Wii , the Archos line of personal media players and so forth .
The role of the browser is only growing in importance in our daily lives , so expect to hear more about Opera on TVs , digital picture frames , home automation wall pads , gaming consoles , etc .
It 's going to be a very interesting year .
To help debugging , Opera has recently launched Dragonfly , a fully featured JavaScript debugger .
It 's an interesting application in itself , part desktop application , part Web application .
It is stored in local persistent storage , yet instantly updates when a new version is released -- just like your favorite Web sites .
You never have to check for updates or install a new version .
LJ : What is the one interesting thing about Opera that our readers would be suprised to know ?
Lie :
One thing people may interested in knowing is that Opera supports the BitTorrent protocol natively .
It 's very useful when downloading new Linux distributions !
LJ : Are you a Linux fan personally , and if so , what is your favorite distribution ?
Lie : Yes , I'm a Linux fan and I install Linux on every machine I get my hands on .
Ubuntu has become my distribution of choice , it works very well with the ThinkPad computers I often surround myself with .
An old ThinkPad with Linux installed and a huge USB hard drive makes up a Web server in my kitchen .
Another Thinkpad is connected to a midi-enabled piano in the living room .
I also use Linux on the wonderful OLPC machines .
I recently received 100 of those and we created a temporary village at my place :
http://blog.abrenna.com/tag/olpc/
I think the period around 1990 will be remembered for three computer projects that have contributed immensely to human culture and communication : the Web , Unicode and Linux .
LJ : Thanks so much for speaking with us , Håkon !
Good luck to you and your colleagues at Opera .
Lie :
You 're welcome .

Size Counts
A lot of deeply religious people , content to live in a compact , Human - centered Universe , are able to do so largely in proportion to their inability to do math .
Of course they can add and subtract , maybe even still do some algebra , but they are woefully lacking in the tools necessary to understand the numbers that describe the cosmos .
As a result , they do n’t really understand how big the universe is and what that implies for the ancient god myths .
It is a sad manifestation of what John Allen Paulos wrote about in his highly enlightening book , INNUMERACY .
Innumeracy is the mathematical equivalent of illiteracy and , although many people joke about their own inability to do math , it actually has real , adverse effects on the ability to grasp the Universe in a rational manner .
It has less to do with ability to do long division than it has to do with the ability to understand scale and logical relationships .
A more practical effect is that those who are unable to judge , or even think about numerical relationships may find themselves more easily fooled by misinformation or deceived by scammers .
Like televangelists .
If one has no mental tools for the validation of claims , then one is likely to believe in some really stupid shit .
A lot of the ancient beliefs seem to imply a small , intimate Universe , one which extended only from some very toasty underground real estate to someplace above the clouds but below the canopy of stars .
Some even thought the stars could be reached with a tall enough tower .
Some thought that it was possible to fly too close to the sun .
Some thought it was turtles all the way down .
But everyone thought it was a Universe centered around us and more or less set up just for us .
I think that dispelling that myth requires only a gentle lesson about the size of the universe , requiring nothing more than a calculator and a sense of awe .
Millions and Billions .
First , a simple lesson in scale .
A billion is the smallest increment on the Cosmic Yardstick .
And a billion , to us , is really a lot !
To illustrate , first lets look at a Million of something .
Something easy to understand .
Like seconds .
1,000,000 ( one Million ) seconds = 11 days , 13 hours , 46 min , and 40 sec .
Lets call it 11.5 days for convenience .
1,000,000,000 ( one Billion ) seconds = 11 , 500 days or 31.5 years !!
One billion seconds ago , it was 1976 .
Awesome , eh? Anyway , on to …
The Size of the Universe !
Let 's look at our nearest star , the Sun , as a big yellow beach ball 3 feet in diameter .
We will start all our measurements from there .
If the Sun were a beach ball sitting on the goal line at Sun Devil Stadium , the Earth would be a tiny round piece of pea gravel 93 yards away .
( 93 M mi. )
Mars would be a little orange bead almost 400 feet away in the seats behind the goal post .
( 142 M mi . )
Jupiter would be a baseball just over 1 /4 mile away .
( 484 M mi . )
Saturn would be tennis ball about 1 /2 mile away .
( 888 M miles )
Pluto , smaller than our moon , would be a pinhead almost 2 ½ miles away ( 3.67B mi . )
BTW – to drive out to Pluto at 60 mph , would take you 6975 years .
After that , things start getting bigger in a hurry .
The NEAREST star – Alpha Centauri , 4.3 light years distant - would be a slightly smaller beach ball , in Sydney , Australia 12440 miles away .
Driving time - 47.6 Million years .
If 1 year were 1 second long , it would still take you a year and a half to drive there .
The nearest spiral Galaxy , the lovely Andromeda , is a mere 2 Million light years away .
Like our galaxy , the Milky Way , Andromeda is approximately 100,000 light years in diameter and contains over 200 Billion stars .
If the Milky Way were a hula hoop , Andromeda would be another hoop 80 feet away .
If you were driving at 1 million miles an hour , it would take you 6 million years to drive across our galaxy and 120 million years to get to the outskirts of Andromeda .
The Milky Way is one of about 20 galaxies in our local cluster which , in turn is part of the local super cluster which contains thousands of galaxies .
The farthest observed galaxy would be another hula hoop over 90 miles away .
Driving at the speed of light , 186,000 miles per second , or 11 million times the speed limit , it would take you about 12 or 13 billion years .
From where we sit ...
From where we sit , we can see well over 100 BILLION galaxies beyond our own .
On average , they each have over 100 BILLION stars and other stuff .
And that is just the stuff we can see from here .
And I do n’t see any reason to think that everything suddenly stops just past that galaxy .
So , as you can see , the Universe is , in Scientific terms , freakin’ huuuge !!
I think that a lot of the religious have an institutionally mandated and studiously maintained level of ignorance regarding not just the size of the Universe , but also our relative importance in it .
I personally do not find myself diminished by it – I find it the most fascinating thing imaginable .
If the sun were a grain of sand , the stars in our galaxy would fill an Olympic - sized swimming pool .
If our galaxy were a grain of sand , the galaxies would fill several olympic - sized swimming pools .
Perspective
I think that Isaac Asimov put things in perspective in the title of his classic Sci-Fi novel , “ The Stars Like Dust ” .
Even looking around in our local neighborhood , the stars are , in some places , so numerous they look like haze .
Bertrand Russell , in his book , “ Why I Am Not A Christian ” , says ( and I am paraphrasing ) that our inflated sense of self importance and placement in the Universe can best be cured with a little astronomy .
But I think P. W. Atkins , in a remarkable little book called , ironically , Creation Revisited , opened up a whole new perspective when he called the Universe “ a local outcropping of matter ” .
That is the kind of scale and perspective which show the ancient god-myths for what they truly are – local outcroppings of lunacy .
Top 5 Plants that Inspire New Technology
August 4th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
There ’s a lot of hype out there about new technologies that will “ change everything ” .
Sometimes it ’s nice to sit back and “ smell the roses ” .
In that spirit , here are five plants with surprising super powers – they have provided a boost to technological innovation or invention , often with a green lining .
Algae and Biofuel
If you keep track of the news , algae should already be on your radar .
Depending on your favorite species , algae can be eaten , burned for heat , or used to produce hydrogen , methane , biodiesel , or plain old fertilizer .
Algae is so prolific , and comes in so many varieties , that it ’s actually a chore to isolate your preferred species for cultivation out of a water sample from the wild .
The best part is that algae soaks up the sun and lots of CO2 to work it ’s magic .
That ’s two forms of renewable energy used to produce fuels or foods ( sushi anyone ? ) in high demand .
An algaculture biodiesel plant is already in operation today , happily churning out 4.4 million gallons of algal oil per year .
That may not sound like a lot , but as the first operational algae oil factory , you can bet they ’ll make enough money to build bigger .
Other companies are also in the game to make algae the biggest thing since oil .
As a renewable source of fuel , algae is becoming one of many solutions to our energy problems .
Not too shabby for pond scum .
Guayule and Latex
Gua - what ?
Guayule is a desert plant native to North America .
One company , Yulex Corp. , realized that this little plant has a lot to offer .
The first super - power is that Guayule can produce rubber .
Most natural rubber is produced from one breed of rubber tree , which leaves the crop at risk from disease .
Latex made from guayule performs better than traditional latex , and it ’s allergy - free .
Softer , stretchier , stronger , and an effective barrier – Yulex latex products are already on the market and in high demand from the medical , scientific and contraceptive sectors .
Keep your eyes peeled .
Latex gloves might not seem like a huge technological breakthrough , but consider how commonly they ’re used in labs , hospitals , factories , etc .
Building a better glove is like upgrading from a black - and - white television to color .
Guayule also produces resin , which is an ingredient in everything from paint and paper to particle board and soap .
They ’re also trying to make lumber products ( think plywood ) from it , and they hope to use what ’s left over to produce bio-energy and ethanol .
Because guayule is a hearty desert crop , it requires little water or fertilizer to grow .
The plant has a high energy content , which will also make it attractive for upcoming cellucosic ethanol and syngas technologies .
Farmers can use similar methods and machinery from cotton fields to grow and harvest guayule , so it ’s easy to make the switch .
The icing on the cake is that Yulex Corp. tries to be green – they take care to keep their crop and operations as environmentally friendly as possible .
Corn and Plastic
That ’s right , corn .
Believe it or not , you can make more than high fructose syrup from corn .
Starches are used in everything from paper to detergent , and dextrose gives us everything from antibiotics to booze .
You can even make tires out of corn .
My favorite use for corn is plastic : biodegradable corn plastic .
The problem with most plastic is that it never goes away ; it just breaks up into tiny pieces forever .
It kills animals , and in some parts of the ocean there ’s almost as many plastic granules as sand .
Biodegradable plastic provides the benefits without the ecological damage or petrochemical base .
Even though corn gets a bad rap these days ( for some good reasons ) , I ’d rather have a renewable plastic source that will break down eventually .
Remember that plastic provides us with everything from medical equipment to computer cases and beyond .
A lot of cutting edge technology depends on it , but that does n’t mean we want it around forever .
That ’s why this innovation made the list .
Cockleburs and Velcro
George de Mestral invented Velcro in 1941 after studying some of the seed pods stuck to his clothing and in his dog ’s fur .
Anyone growing up in the 1980s or 1990s might find Velcro old news , but its versatility and resilience really is impressive .
Anything that can serve astronauts and small children – opposite extremes of human existence – is worthy of note .
Did you know that each space shuttle is equipped with 10,000 inches of Velcro ?
That the army has top - secret silent Velcro ?
That two square inches of Velcro can support 175 lbs ?
What ’s really amazing is not what Velcro can do , but what it has enabled human beings to do .
Scientists in space greatly expanded the safety and convenience of life in zero- gravity with inventions like Velcro .
It continues to serve astronauts as they conduct important and exciting research in space .
Here on earth , the structure of Velcro is still inspiring other inventions and ideas .
Velcro is long - lasting and durable , and it can be made from recycled and recyclable materials .
So aside from taking hours to comb out of your pet ’s fur , it ’s good to know that your local variety of burr is working hard for the humankind .
Lotus Plant and Nanotechnology
The lotus plant grows in muddy waters , but its leaves emerge clean .
The leaves are not smooth , yet water rolls off of them and collects dirt along the way .
This is called the Lotus Effect .
Microscopic structures on the leaf trap air bubbles and repel water with a waxy coating .
The result is droplets of water dancing on tiny spikes instead of a flat surface .
Since there ’s nothing to cling to , the water is forced to roll away on the slightest decline .
This superhydrophobic coating is great against water droplets , but it does n’t work well against water vapor .
The applications for water repellent and self - cleaning coatings are almost unlimited .
Imagine tools and surfaces that bacteria , food and dirt cannot stick to .
Imagine clothes that rarely need to be washed .
These coatings already exist and some are on the market .
It can also be made with safer or fewer chemicals and increase the life cycle of many materials and resources .
The lotus plant has been a symbol of purity in Asia for thousands of years , in part thanks to its superhydrophobic leaves .
Understanding how and why are perhaps just an enlightening as observing the phenomenon , as they offer insight into the ingenuity of evolution and natural systems .

I took my son to see Wall E this weekend .
The latest from Pixar , a hit with critics and audiences , is set a eight or nine centuries in the future .
Wall E paints a picture of a planet destroyed by a thoughtless humanity in the thrall of a consumer culture that eventually overwhelms the earth with … junk .
Garbage , refuse , crapeverywhere .
Humans are forced to abandon the planet and blast off into space , where humanity survives on spaceships that look and function like cruise ships or , um , Disney resorts .
There ’s not much to do out there in space but sit on lounge chairs ( floating space lounge chairs ) , and eat , eat , eat .
Meanwhile on earth huge garbage ziggurats tower over abandoned skyscrapers , container ships full of crap sit on dried up ocean beds , and dust - and - garbage storms blow scour the surface of the earth .
Depressing all that garbage , all that thoughtless over - consumption , all that environmental devastation .
But look what we got on the way into the theater …
That ’s a watch .
A cheap plastic watch .
According to the instruction card that comes with it , my son ’s Wall E watch was made in China , it ’s not water resistant , and it ’s batteries are not replaceable .
So basically it ’s a disposable watch brought to us by a movie about the dire consequences of thoughtless over - consumption , a watch that is just one of manytens of thousands , hundreds of thousands that will be coming soon to landfills near you .
UPDATE : In Wall E the world appears to be governed by a huge corporation called Buy ‘N Large , which at first encourages over - consumption and then , when the environmental consequences become clear , tries to find ways for humanity to consume its way out of the environmental crisis that over - consumption caused in the first place .
Eventually the planet has to be abandonedvia Buy ‘ N Large space ships .
Slog tipper Pop Tart draws our attention to a Buy ‘N Large website , where you can … buy movie merchandise …
I do n't give a stuff what people believe in , but it wo n't stop me poking at it or prodding it .
Why should religion be any exemption ?
Telling me I 'm going to hell wo n't bother me because I have the Flying Spaghetti Monster , the Invisible Pink Unicorn and Bertrand Russell 's Teapot in my heart .
Google them if you are in the market for some red hot enlightenment .
Over the past couple of weeks Catholic - bashing has been elevated to the level of an extreme sport .
Put your hand down at the back there , I 'm allowed to .
I spent every Sunday for the first 18 years of my life sitting in a medieval torture chamber listening to a bloke bang on about his imaginary friend who did magic tricks .
Then the next 20 years massaging , editing and pruning the brainwashing into something that fit until suddenly I woke up one day and realised I was an atheist .
I was n't searching for anything .
I was n't dabbling or questioning .
I was n't having any kind of spiritual breakdown .
I just opened my eyes one day , looked around and realised that I had once been standing in a house and one by one the walls had collapsed and there was no longer a house there .
I was standing out in the open .
It was very liberating .
Funny though .
For a while I would go to pray and then remind myself that I did n't believe .
These days I send out wishes .
I know , just as crazy .
I question some of my progressive , believing mates about if they believe in Noah 's ark , the Immaculate Conception , Adam and Eve , the Resurrection , even heaven , and they squirm a little and try to change the subject .
They get vague , defensive and then start muttering something about faith and mystery and a power of love that unites us all .
Sure , it would be easy to torture them , but they 're adults and it 's their life .
I just ca n't see why it 's so difficult to have a rigorous discussion about it .
I feel no need to convert them .
I just want them to know that if you are brave enough to place your hand through the invisible electric fence there 's a bigger world beyond .
It 's been a revelation to me a year since my " epiphany " .
I feel as if I 'm walking through life with the blinkers off .
Suddenly all the religious mumbo- jumbo jumps out as so bonkers .
Wearing certain things , eating certain things , mumbling certain things at certain times so some imaginary friend will let you into a club in the sky when you die .
I want to do my living now , thanks .
I 'm not afraid of dying .
I 'm afraid of never having lived .
There is a school of thought that suggests atheists should not call themselves atheists but just say we apply rational thought to everything and religion is no exception .
As Sam Harris , author of The End Of Faith , puts it , " I think that ' atheist ' is a term that we do not need , in the same way that we do n't need a word for someone who rejects astrology .
" We simply do not call people ' non-astrologers ' .
All we need are words like ' reason ' and ' evidence ' and ' common sense ' and ' bullshit ' to put astrologers in their place , and so it could be with religion . "
I do n't care what people believe in , but I do care that religion impacts on political discourse , public policy and that it stunts the ability of people to think for themselves and question .
And that it kills people and causes suffering .
But most of all I care that the invisible electric fences that are wired in the minds of children brainwashed by religion are difficult to remove .
And impossible if you do n't even know they 're there .
A quote attributed to Stephen F. Robert sums it up for me : " We are both atheists , I just believe in one fewer god than you do .
When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods , you will understand why I dismiss yours . "
Peace be with you .
Even though this summer is expected to be a slow season for new stock offerings , market watchers are already daydreaming about the kinds of deals they would like to see in the wake of Energy Recovery Inc . 's successful debut last week .
The 16 % pop by the initial public offering of Energy Recovery , which makes energy - saving devices for water - desalination plants , ended a two - month streak of eight IPOs that did n't gain on their first days of trading .
While one strong IPO does n't a trend make , it does have analysts considering which stocks could weather uncertain market conditions like Energy Recovery did -- it rose on the same day the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit bear - market territory .
" Alternative energy plays will continue to attract the attention of investors , " says Ben Holmes , publisher of research site Morningnotes.com .
" Energy Recovery could be the torchrunner for this industry . "
There are just a few alternative - energy IPOs in the U.S. pipeline , according to data from Dealogic , but Mr. Holmes and others said that Energy Recovery could spur more " green " companies to go public .

San Buenaventura , Bolivia
Hours after flying on a rickety 19 - seater propeller plane and landing on a dirt strip , you get to the village of San Buenaventura in the heart of the Bolivian Amazon .
Antonio Garcia Baron spent time in the Mauthausen concentration camp
Here , in a simple one - storey brick house next to a row of wooden shacks , is the home of Antonio Garcia Baron .
He is the only survivor still alive of the anarchist Durruti column which held Francoist forces at bay in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936 - 1939 ) and the founder of an anarchist community in the heart of the jungle .
Mr Baron , 87 , was wearing a hat and heavy dark glasses .
He later explained that they were to protect his eyes , which were damaged when he drank a cup of coffee containing poison nine years ago .
It was , he said , the last of more than 100 attempts on his life , which began in Paris , where he moved in 1945 after five years in the Mauthausen Nazi concentration camp , and continued in Bolivia , his home since the early 1950s .
Stateless
He was keen to share his views on 20th Century Spanish history with a wider audience .
THE DURRUTI COLUMN Column of anarchist fighters during Spanish Civil War Led by Buenaventura Durruti until his death fighting Franco 's forces on outskirts of Madrid in November 1936 After defeat of Republican forces in 1939 , many surviving members fled to France .
Many interned in French prison camps .
After Nazis invaded , many imprisoned in concentration camps , others joined resistance " The Spanish press has covered up that the ( Catholic ) Church masterminded the death of two million Republicans during the civil war , not one million as they maintain , " Mr Baron said before launching into one of his many anecdotes .
" I told Himmler ( the head of the Nazi SS ) when he visited the Mauthausen quarry on 27 April , 1941 , what a great couple the ( Nazis ) made with the Church .
" He replied that it was true , but that after the war I would see all the cardinals with the Pope marching there , pointing at the chimney of the crematorium . "
On the walls of Mr Baron 's house is a picture of him taken in the camp .
Next to it is a blue triangle with the number 3422 and letter S inside , marking the prisoners considered stateless .
" Spain took away my nationality when I entered Mauthausen , they wanted the Nazis to exterminate us in silence .
The Spanish government has offered to return my nationality but why should I request something that was stolen from me and 150,000 others ? " he said angrily .
Mr Baron wanted to be as far from modern life as possible Mr Baron arrived in Bolivia on the advice of his friend , the French anarchist writer Gaston Leval .
" I asked him for a sparsely populated place , without services like water and electricity , where people lived like 100 years ago - because where you have civilisation you 'll find priests . "
Some 400 people , mostly Guarani Indians , lived there at the time , but in fact also a German priest .
" He was a tough nut to crack .
He learnt of my arrival and told everyone that I was a criminal .
They fled and made the sign of the cross whenever they saw me , but two months later I started speaking and they realised I was a good person , so it backfired on him . "
Convinced that the priest still spied on him , a few years later he decided to leave and create a mini-anarchist state in the middle of the jungle , 60 km ( 37 miles ) and three hours by boat from San Buenaventura along the Quiquibey River .
With him was his Bolivian wife Irma , now 71 .
They raised chicken , ducks and pigs and grew corn and rice which they took twice a year to the village in exchange for other products , always rejecting money .
Dunkirk Life was tough and a few years ago Mr Baron lost his right hand while hunting a jaguar .
For the first five years , until they began having children , they were alone .
Later a group of some 30 nomadic Indians arrived and decided to stay , hunting and fishing for a living , also never using money .
" We enjoyed freedom in all of its senses , no - one asked us for anything or told us not to do this or that , " he recounted as his wife smiled , sitting in a chair at the back of the room .
Recently they moved back to the village for health reasons and to be closer to their children .
They live with a daughter , 47 , while their other three children , Violeta , 52 , Iris , 31 , and 27 - year - old Marco Antonio work in Spain .
Paintings of scenes from the camp are a visual reminder of his past
They also share the few simple rooms arranged around an internal patio with three Cuban doctors who are part of a contingent sent to help provide medical care in Bolivia .
The hours passed and it was time to take the small plane back to La Paz before the torrential rain isolated the area again .
Only then , as time was running out , did Mr Baron begin speaking in detail about Mauthausen and the war - as if wishing to fulfil a promise to fallen comrades .
How the Nazis threw prisoners from a cliff , how some of them clung to the mesh wire to avoid their inevitable death , how the Jews were targeted for harsh treatment and did not survive long .
His memory also took him to Dunkirk where he had arrived in 1940 , before he was caught and imprisoned in Mauthausen .
" I arrived in the morning but the British fleet was some 6 km from the coast .
I asked a young English soldier if it would return .
" I saw that he was eating with a spoon in one hand and firing an anti-aircraft gun with the other , " he laughed .
" ' Eat if you wish ' , I told him .
' Do you know how to use it ? ' he asked since I did n't have military uniform and was very young .
" ' Do n't worry , ' I said .
I grabbed the gun and shot down two planes .
He was dumbstruck .
" I 'll never forget the determination of the British fighting stranded on the beach . "

According to testimony from Pendarvis Harshaw , an NPR Youth Radio correspondent , when a couple decides to ditch condoms , get tested for STIs and make the transition to other forms of birth control like the pill , the patch or the shot , they 're not only taking a symbolic step forward in terms of sexual health , but also a leap of faith in the scheme of their relationship .
As Harshaw states , sex without condoms is the modern substitute for an engagement ring .
In a 3 - minute spot on NPR , Harshaw defends this new " Engagement 2.0 " as a realistic replacement for an overpriced ring that , given today 's divorce rates , does n't mean much .
Caring about your partner 's sexual health , Harshaw believes , is the ultimate act of respect and intimacy , because " it shows trust , commitment and the prospect of a shared future . "
And eschewing latex is in no way a symbol of the urge to take on larger responsibilities or engage in risky behavior : " The majority [ of young adults ] want to steer clear of children and disease while enjoying the pleasures of healthy sex , " he says .
NPR 's main demographic may not be the 18 - to - 24 - year - old set , but the generational gap that screams through the comments is indicative of the seemingly impossible reconciliation between the young and the old .
Most younger commenters qualified Harshaw 's point of view , offering missives of support and solidarity .
" People need to get over their hang - ups on young people talking about sex and on the idea that a lot of us have an unfavorable view of marriage , " one wrote .
And another nearly dismissed Harshaw 's account as old news : " My generation knows all too well the long walk down to the health clinic as a somewhat romantic feat , filled with a lot of the meaningfulness of a long walk down the aisle .
In fact , my partner and I just made that journey last week .
We considered it a great date . "
Exclusive Google has shutdown the AdSense account of another anti-Scientology site .
Three months after cutting off all ads served to Enturbulation , a site dedicated to promoting activism against the Church of Scientology and all its related organizations , Google has done the same with a similar site known as Epic Anonymous .
Earlier this week , administrators at Epic Anonymous received the same email that turned up at Enturbulation back in May .
" While going through our records recently , we found that your AdSense account has posed a significant risk to our AdWords advertisers , " the email said .
" Since keeping your account in our publisher network may financially damage our advertisers in the future , we 've decided to disable your account . "
Google has not responded to our requests for comment .
But it would appear that the company has shutdown the account because it suspects click fraud - i.e. its automated system caught too many people repeatedly clicking on the site 's ads .
Alexander Vanino , who owns Epic Anonymous , insists that he and others running the site have not attempted to rig the AdSense system .
But he says that much like Enturbulation , Epic Anonymous was littered with ads paid for by the Church of Scientology .
That 's right , Google was serving countless pro-Scientology ads to an anti-Scientology site .
" I 've been doing my best to filter these out through Google 's [ AdSense ] interface , " Vanino tells us .
" But there were so many of them , from so many different domains , it was really hard to keep up with blocking them .
It felt like I was going in every other day and blocking more and more sites . "
Though it made no attempt to block them , Enturbulation was also served a regular stream of pro-Scientology ads and a site administrator has admitted its users were repeatedly clicking on the ads .
" Google said that it was n't a complaint from Scientology ( or any other organization ) that got Enturbulation.org 's AdSense account shut down , " the admin told us .
" It was an unfortunate case of click fraud .
" Some members of the forum wrongly believed that by clicking the ads repeatedly that Scientology would be forced to fund the Enturbulation website when all it did was alert the automated system of possible fraud . "
This may be what happened with Epic Anonymous .
Or it may have been someone else clicking on the ads .
But it begs the question :
Why are so many Scientology ads turning up on these sites run by the now famous Anonymous movement , which launched an epic online Scientology protest back in January .
Either Google 's ad serving algorithms are dreadful or Scientologists are intentionally buying keywords that put their ads onto Anonymous sites .
Or both .
In any event , pro-Scientology ads have repeatedly turned up on two anti-Scientology sites .
And in both cases , Google has shutdown the sites '
AdSense accounts , claiming they " may financially damage " advertisers .
Vanino and Matthew Danziger , another Epic Anonymous admin , believe that Scientology is somehow manipulating Google 's system .
" Google is n't doing a good job of looking out for its [ AdSense ] customers .
They are n't saying ' We should n't be showing these sorts of ads on these sorts of sites , " Vanino told us .
" And then , from where I 'm sitting , Scientology is taking advantage of this , telling Google that by serving ads onto our site , it 's causing financial damage .
" So Google goes and shuts us down .
In my opinion , they 're putting a Band - Aid on a much bigger problem . "
It 's worth noting that Google 's new AdSense policies say that partner sites may not include " advocacy against any individual , group , or organization . "
But it 's unclear how often Google actually enforces this .
It 's also worth noting that Google 's official rules do not permit advertising " for the promotion of religious content . " ®

A John McCain - Barack Obama matchup will pit a pair of self - styled reformers in the race for president this fall , which explains why they are spending so much of the early rounds trying to outmuscle each other to prove who is tougher on this political season 's whipping boy , the Washington lobbyist .
But lobbyists and many independent analysts view the candidates ' antilobbyist rhetoric as grandstanding to score political points at the expense of the vast , multibillion - dollar advocacy industry that is sometimes called the fourth branch of the United States government .
" It 's overly simplistic and more demagogic than analytic to say that the solution to all the problems in Washington is to get rid of the lobbyists , " said Nicholas W. Allard , a partner , lobbyist , and cochairman of the public policy department at Patton Boggs , a Washington law firm and lobbying powerhouse .
" Lobbyists are not the source of congressional gridlock , the source of bitter partisanship , or the reason candidates have to spend so much time raising money . "
There are 41,386 lobbyists registered in the nation 's capital , according to the Senate Office of Public Records .
Most toil in obscurity , but the best known to the general public is also the most notorious , Jack Abramoff , who was sentenced to prison two years ago as the ringleader of a lobbying scandal that ensnared a dozen others .
Allard said lobbyists provide valuable information to government policy makers , but that even with stricter rules enacted last year to curb abuses , " there is no safeguard against someone who will intentionally violate the law or break a rule . "
McCain 's work as a Senate committee chairman exposed many of Abramoff 's misdeeds , but lately the Republican from Arizona has been deflecting news stories about dozens of lobbyists working for his campaign , including his campaign manager and chief adviser , both of whom no longer represent clients .
Several others , including one of his chief fund - raisers were forced to cut ties because they had conflicts or represented controversial clients .
Two weeks ago , the campaign instituted a new ethics and disclosure policy , which McCain called " the most comprehensive and most transparent policy concerning lobbyist activities . "
He challenged Obama , his likely Democratic opponent , to follow suit .
Obama , who has declined contributions from lobbyists and appears to have far fewer ties to them , has been sniping at McCain 's lobbyist connections .
The Republican National Committee has been pushing back on McCain 's behalf , pointing out that several former lobbyists hold key posts on Obama 's campaign staff and more than a dozen active lobbyists are volunteers or advisers .
Independent Washington analysts scoff at what they see as exploiting an easy target .
" This is playing to the Hollywood image of lobbyists , guys in $ 1,000 alligator shoes and $ 2,000 suits who hang out in the hallway of the Ways and Means Committee and get tax concessions for fat cats , " said Ross K. Baker , a political science professor at Rutgers University who does scholarly research by " embedding " himself in congressional offices .
" It 's a cheap shot .
. . .
For every Jack Abramoff there are a lot of people lobbying for causes that are quite respectable and noble . "
Aug. 28 , 2008  --
Full remarks as prepared for delivery and provided by the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama as accepts the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination on Aug. 28 , 2008 , at Invesco Field in Denver , Colorado
To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin ; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation ;
With profound gratitude and great humility , I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States .
.
Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey , and especially the one who traveled the farthest – a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton .
To President Clinton , who last night made the case for change as only he can make it ; to Ted Kennedy , who embodies the spirit of service ; and to the next Vice President of the United States , Joe Biden , I thank you .
I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time , a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night .
To the love of my life , our next First Lady , Michelle Obama , and to Sasha and Malia – I love you so much , and I 'm so proud of all of you .
Four years ago , I stood before you and told you my story – of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who were n't well - off or well - known , but shared a belief that in America , their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to .
It is that promise that has always set this country apart – that through hard work and sacrifice , each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family , to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well .
That 's why I stand here tonight .
Because for two hundred and thirty two years , at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy , ordinary men and women – students and soldiers , farmers and teachers , nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive .
We meet at one of those defining moments – a moment when our nation is at war , our economy is in turmoil , and the American promise has been threatened once more .
Tonight , more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less .
More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet .
More of you have cars you can't afford to drive , credit card bills you can't afford to pay , and tuition that 's beyond your reach .
These challenges are not all of government 's making .
But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush .
America , we are better than these last eight years .
We are a better country than this .
This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio , on the brink of retirement , finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work .
This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he 's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China , and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news .
We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty ; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes .
Tonight , I say to the American people , to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land – enough !
This moment – this election – is our chance to keep , in the 21st century , the American promise alive .
Because next week , in Minnesota , the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third .
And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight .
On November 4th , we must stand up and say : " Eight is enough . "
Now let there be no doubt .
The Republican nominee , John McCain , has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction , and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect .
And next week , we 'll also hear about those occasions when he 's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need .
But the record 's clear : John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time .
Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment , but really , what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time ?
I do n't know about you , but I 'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change .
The truth is , on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives – on health care and education and the economy – Senator McCain has been anything but independent .
He said that our economy has made " great progress " under this President .
He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
And when one of his chief advisors – the man who wrote his economic plan – was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling , he said that we were just suffering from a " mental recession , " and that we 've become , and I quote , " a nation of whiners . "
A nation of whiners ?
Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who , after they found out it was closing , kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever , because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made .
Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty .
These are not whiners .
They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint .
These are the Americans that I know .
Now , I do n't believe that Senator McCain does n't care what 's going on in the lives of Americans .
I just think he does n't know .
Why else would he define middle - class as someone making under five million dollars a year ?
How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans ?
How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people 's benefits , or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college , or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement ?
It 's not because John McCain does n't care .
It 's because John McCain does n't get it .
For over two decades , he 's subscribed to that old , discredited Republican philosophy – give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
In Washington , they call this the Ownership Society , but what it really means is – you 're on your own .
Out of work ?
Tough luck .
No health care ?
The market will fix it .
Born into poverty ?
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps – even if you do n't have boots .
You 're on your own .
Well it 's time for them to own their failure .
It 's time for us to change America .
You see , we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country .
We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage ; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma .
We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President – when the average American family saw its income go up $ 7,500 instead of down $ 2,000 like it has under George Bush .
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500 , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business , or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job – an economy that honors the dignity of work .
The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great – a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight .
Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan , I see my grandfather , who signed up after Pearl Harbor , marched in Patton 's Army , and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill .
In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift , I think about my mom , who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree ; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships .
When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down , I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed .
And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business , I think about my grandmother , who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle - management , despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman .
She 's the one who taught me about hard work .
She 's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life .
She poured everything she had into me .
And although she can no longer travel , I know that she 's watching tonight , and that tonight is her night as well .
I do n't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead , but this has been mine .
These are my heroes .
Theirs are the stories that shaped me .
And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States .
What is that promise ?
It 's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will , but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect .
It 's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth , but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs , look out for American workers , and play by the rules of the road .
Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems , but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves – protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education ; keep our water clean and our toys safe ; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology .
Our government should work for us , not against us .
It should help us , not hurt us .
It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence , but for every American who 's willing to work .
That 's the promise of America – the idea that we are responsible for ourselves , but that we also rise or fall as one nation ; the fundamental belief that I am my brother 's keeper ; I am my sister 's keeper .
That 's the promise we need to keep .
That 's the change we need right now .
So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President .
.
Change means a tax code that does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it .
Unlike John McCain , I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas , and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America .
I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start - ups that will create the high - wage , high - tech jobs of tomorrow .
I will cut taxes – cut taxes – for 95 % of all working families .
Because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle - class .
And for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , I will set a clear goal as President : in ten years , we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East .
Washington 's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years , and John McCain has been there for twenty - six of them .
In that time , he 's said no to higher fuel - efficiency standards for cars , no to investments in renewable energy , no to renewable fuels .
And today , we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office .
Now is the time to end this addiction , and to understand that drilling is a stop - gap measure , not a long - term solution .
Not even close .
As President , I will tap our natural gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
I 'll help our auto companies re-tool , so that the fuel - efficient cars of the future are built right here in America .
I 'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars .
And I 'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy – wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced .
America , now is not the time for small plans .
Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world - class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education .
And I will not settle for an America where some kids do n't have that chance .
I 'll invest in early childhood education .
I 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
And in exchange , I 'll ask for higher standards and more accountability .
And we will keep our promise to every young American – if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable , accessible health care for every single American .
If you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
If you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves .
And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer , I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most .
Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave , because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent .
Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws , so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses ; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations .
And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day 's work , because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons .
Now , many of these plans will cost money , which is why I 've laid out how I 'll pay for every dime – by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that do n't help America grow .
But I will also go through the federal budget , line by line , eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less – because we cannot meet twenty - first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy .
And Democrats , we must also admit that fulfilling America 's promise will require more than just money .
It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our " intellectual and moral strength . "
Yes , government must lead on energy independence , but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient .
Yes , we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair .
But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents ; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework ; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need .
Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility – that 's the essence of America 's promise .
And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home , so must we keep America 's promise abroad .
If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament , and judgment , to serve as the next Commander - in - Chief , that 's a debate I 'm ready to have .
For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11 , I stood up and opposed this war , knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face .
When John McCain said we could just " muddle through " in Afghanistan , I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11 , and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights .
John McCain likes to say that he 'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell – but he wo n't even go to the cave where he lives .
And today , as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration , even after we learned that Iraq has a $ 79 billion surplus while we 're wallowing in deficits , John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war .
That 's not the judgment we need .
That wo n't keep America safe .
We need a President who can face the threats of the future , not keep grasping at the ideas of the past .
You do n't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq .
You do n't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington .
You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you 've strained our oldest alliances .
If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy , that is his choice – but it is not the change we need .
We are the party of Roosevelt .
We are the party of Kennedy .
So do n't tell me that Democrats wo n't defend this country .
Do n't tell me that Democrats wo n't keep us safe .
The Bush - McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans – have built , and we are here to restore that legacy .
As Commander - in - Chief , I will never hesitate to defend this nation , but I will only send our troops into harm 's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home .
I will end this war in Iraq responsibly , and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts .
But I will also renew the tough , direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression .
I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century : terrorism and nuclear proliferation ; poverty and genocide ; climate change and disease .
And I will restore our moral standing , so that America is once again that last , best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom , who long for lives of peace , and who yearn for a better future .
These are the policies I will pursue .
And in the weeks ahead , I look forward to debating them with John McCain .
But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes .
Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other 's character and patriotism .
The times are too serious , the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook .
So let us agree that patriotism has no party .
I love this country , and so do you , and so does John McCain .
The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America – they have served the United States of America .
So I 've got news for you , John McCain .
We all put our country first .
America , our work will not be easy .
The challenges we face require tough choices , and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn - out ideas and politics of the past .
For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits .
What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose – our sense of higher purpose .
And that 's what we have to restore .
We may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country .
The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang - violence in Cleveland , but do n't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK - 47s out of the hands of criminals .
I know there are differences on same - sex marriage , but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination .
Passions fly on immigration , but I do n't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers .
This too is part of America 's promise – the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort .
I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk .
They claim that our insistence on something larger , something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values .
And that 's to be expected .
Because if you do n't have any fresh ideas , then you use stale tactics to scare the voters .
If you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
You make a big election about small things .
And you know what – it's worked before .
Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government .
When Washington does n't work , all its promises seem empty .
If your hopes have been dashed again and again , then it 's best to stop hoping , and settle for what you already know .
I get it .
I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office .
I do n't fit the typical pedigree , and I have n't spent my career in the halls of Washington .
But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring .
What the nay - sayers do n't understand is that this election has never been about me .
It 's been about you .
For eighteen long months , you have stood up , one by one , and said enough to the politics of the past .
You understand that in this election , the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result .
You have shown what history teaches us – that at defining moments like this one , the change we need does n't come from Washington .
Change comes to Washington .
Change happens because the American people demand it – because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership , a new politics for a new time .
America , this is one of those moments .
I believe that as hard as it will be , the change we need is coming .
Because I 've seen it .
Because I 've lived it .
I 've seen it in Illinois , when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work .
I 've seen it in Washington , when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable , to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands .
And I 've seen it in this campaign .
In the young people who voted for the first time , and in those who got involved again after a very long time .
In the Republicans who never thought they 'd pick up a Democratic ballot , but did .
I 've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs , in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb , in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise .
This country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
We have the most powerful military on Earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
Instead , it is that American spirit – that American promise – that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
That promise is our greatest inheritance .
It 's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night , and a promise that you make to yours – a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west ; a promise that led workers to picket lines , and women to reach for the ballot .
And it is that promise that forty five years ago today , brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington , before Lincoln 's Memorial , and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream .
The men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
They could 've heard words of anger and discord .
They could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred .
But what the people heard instead – people of every creed and color , from every walk of life – is that in America , our destiny is inextricably linked .
That together , our dreams can be one .
" We can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
We cannot turn back . "
America , we can not turn back .
Not with so much work to be done .
Not with so many children to educate , and so many veterans to care for .
Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save .
Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend .
America , we can not turn back .
We can not walk alone .
At this moment , in this election , we must pledge once more to march into the future .
Let us keep that promise – that American promise – and in the words of Scripture hold firmly , without wavering , to the hope that we confess .
Thank you , God Bless you , and God Bless the United States of America .
