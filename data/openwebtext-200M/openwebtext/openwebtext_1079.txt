Joe Rudy releases a burning flare along side the smoke trail left by a vanished balloon while Chris Russo kneels down to get the next flare ready .
Strange lights appeared over Morris County , New Jersey , on Jan. 5 this year .
The bright red lights were first noticed in the night sky by an eleven - year - old girl , who pointed out three lights grouped together , and another pair some distance away .
The lights moved silently and slowly , then disappeared one by one .
The girl 's father , a pilot , said he was baffled : " I 've been in aviation for 20 years and never seen anything like it . "
Police fielded calls from alarmed residents , and the supposed UFO made national news .
I examined the case the next day , noting striking parallels between this sighting and the infamous 2008 Phoenix Lights hoax in which flares were tied to balloons .
I provided a detailed , point - by - point analysis showing that the New Jersey lights were almost certainly a copycat hoax .
However , many people refused to accept the skeptical explanations offered by myself and others , concluding that alien spacecraft was more likely .
Skeptical of the skeptics
Some UFO buffs ridiculed the idea that this was a hoax , claiming that the movements of the lights ruled out the possibility of flares .
One writer stated that " thousands of eyewitnesses said they saw a giant , solid , triangular object fly over their heads . "
Often the UFO - theory defenders cherry - picked their evidence and eyewitnesses , for example dismissing those who saw balloons tied to flares as mistaken while giving credence to others who did n't see balloons .
( For a fascinating glimpse into the rabid denials offered against the flares explanation , see the readers ' comments section of my initial column . )
The case was even profiled on the popular History Channel show " UFO Hunters . "
Bill Birnes , the lead investigator ( and publisher of " UFO Magazine " ) also dismissed the flare explanation .
According to the show , " police say the unidentified flying object was nothing but flares — a theory " UFO Hunters " has already tested and proven implausible . "
The show was very influential , with many viewers accepting their conclusions without question .
The case remained open ( among many UFO groups anyway ) , until this week when , on April Fool 's day , two 20 - something college kids , Chris Russo and Joe Rudy , admitted to the hoax .
" We set out into the woods … carrying one helium tank , five balloons , five flares , fishing line , duct tape , and a video camera , " the duo explain now .
" After filling up one 3 - foot balloon with helium , we tied about five feet of fishing line to the balloon , secured the line with tape , then tied and taped the flare to the other end of the line .
Once all five balloons were ready , we struck the 15 - minute flares and released them into the sky . "

But Joe Rudy and Chris Russo perpetrated the hoax with helium balloons and flares as part of a social experiment to create a media event .
It worked .

Realizing that , in the conspiracy - minded UFO community , hoax admissions are suspect , they carefully documented their prank in a series of videos .
For all but the outer fringe of UFO buffs who may suspect that those videos themselves were faked , their explanation is iron - clad and proven , case closed .
Social experiment
In a posting at Skeptic.com , the pair said the hoax was a " social experiment on how to create your own media event surrounding UFO sightings … to show everyone how unreliable eyewitness accounts are , along with investigators of UFOs . "
Indeed , that point was well made .
On the " UFO Hunters " show , investigator Birnes and his team reviewed footage of the lights , concluding that " these lights are moving without any independent movement … you can almost make out a frame . "
Yet we know this analysis was completely wrong : the lights were in fact moving independently ( tied to balloons in the wind ) , and there was no frame at all , triangular or otherwise .
As Russo and Rudy note , " If a respected UFO investigator can be easily manipulated and dead wrong on one UFO case , is it possible he 's wrong on most ( or all ) of them ? "
From red lights in the sky to red faces at the History Channel , this solved UFO case proves that you can't always believe what you see , either in the skies or on TV .

Answering fan questions on the subject , Howard said that there are " no current plans " for a fifth game in the Elder Scrolls series .
A little disappointing , true , but remember , " no current plans " only means no current plans .
Plans change .
And hey , maybe he 's just being coy , and they 're working on Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion II !

El jueves pasado se dio este intercambio entre una reportera y el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador durante su conferencia matutina :
Reportera : “ La otra pregunta , presidente , era sobre esta polémica de si su gobierno ha importado o no ha importado petróleo crudo .
La Secretaría de Energía dice que no , pero el Buró del Censo de Estados Unidos dice que sí , que sí han importado crudo ” .
AMLO : “ Hay que pedirle el informe a la Secretaría de Energía y a Pemex hoy y se informa .
Yo no tengo información de que se esté importando petróleo crudo , pero vamos a pedir la información ” .
La reportera se refería al informe mensual de exportaciones de petróleo estadounidense difundido el 30 de octubre pasado por la Administración de Información Energética de Estados Unidos ( EIA ) , que anota que México importó 17,000 barriles de petróleo diarios en julio pasado .
El hecho de que la EIA lo afirmara sorprendió a muchos en virtud de que AMLO ha negado reiteradamente que durante su gobierno se realicen esas importaciones .
Ese mismo jueves , en mi programa de radio y TV , el analista Ramsés Pech explicó que la importación reportada por la EIA podría deberse a que Estados Unidos ya no aceptará que la mezcla mexicana de exportación enviada a ese país contenga 3.5 % de azufre y que el ligero importado , combinado con el petróleo mexicano , podría servir para reducir dicho porcentaje a 0.5 % que ahora exigen los estadounidenses .
Al día siguiente , viernes 11 , en su conferencia de prensa , el presidente aclaró así la situación : “ En definitiva , es : no estamos importando petróleo crudo .
El dato que se dio fue equivocado , el dato que se publicó en la prensa no corresponde a la realidad (...)
Entonces , lo aclaro para que no quede ninguna duda ( ... ) hoy se va a entregar un informe al respecto para que tengamos todos los elementos ” .
En la tarde de ese día , en mi programa , cuestioné la versión dada por el presidente debido a que el dato no se publicó en la prensa , como él dijo , sino en el sitio de la EIA , que es un organismo del gobierno estadounidense , lo que lo hacía oficial .
Supuse que al presidente no le estaban dando la información correcta los dos principales funcionarios del sector energético : la secretaria de Energía , Rocío Nahle , y el director general de Pemex , Octavio Romero .
Conjeturé que , tal vez , no le están comunicando adecuadamente las cosas a su jefe porque , como se dice , se comenta y se rumora , hay una fuerte y creciente rivalidad entre ambos .
Y concluí que era verídica la única información oficial disponible , la de la EIA , mientras que el gobierno mexicano no demostrara lo contrario .
Poco después de terminar mi programa recibí la siguiente nota informativa de la agencia Bloomberg : “ El Buró del Censo de Estados Unidos dice que sus datos sobre las exportaciones de petróleo a México son incorrectos (...)
Dice que México no importó crudo en julio y agosto .
El gobierno de México había negado que el país hubiera importado crudo (...)
El buró identificó un informe erróneo de las presentaciones de exportaciones de petróleo crudo a México y determinó que las correcciones a sus datos eran necesarias ” .
Con base en esa aclaración sólo queda aceptar que AMLO tenía razón y estaba muy bien informado sobre el asunto .

Climate change caused by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) is now widely recognized .
But the other side of the equation — the massive absorption of CO 2 by the ocean — has received far less attention .
The planet ’s seas quickly absorb 25 to 30 percent of humankind ’s CO 2 emissions and about 85 percent in the long run , as water and air mix at the ocean ’s surface .
We have “ disposed ” of 530 billion tons of the gas in this way , and the rate worldwide is now one million tons per hour , faster than experienced on earth for tens of millions of years .
We are acidifying the ocean and fundamentally changing its remarkably delicate geochemical balance .
Scientists are only beginning to investigate the consequences , but comparable natural changes in our geologic history have caused several mass extinctions throughout the earth ’s waters .
That careful balance has survived over time because of a near equilibrium among the acids emitted by volcanoes and the bases liberated by the weathering of rock .
The pH of seawater has remained steady for millions of years .
Before the industrial era began , the average pH at the ocean surface was about 8.2 ( slightly basic ; 7.0 is neutral ) .
Today it is about 8.1 .
Although the change may seem small , similar natural shifts have taken 5,000 to 10,000 years .
We have done it in 50 to 80 years .
Ocean life survived the long , gradual change , but the current speed of acidification is very worrisome .
Emissions could reduce surface pH by another 0.4 unit in this century alone and by as much as 0.7 unit beyond 2100 .
We are hurtling toward an ocean different than the earth has known for more than 25 million years .
About 89 percent of the carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater takes the form of bicarbonate ion , about 10 percent as carbonate ion , and 1 percent as dissolved gas .
Modern marine life has evolved to live in this chemistry .
A wide variety of organisms use carbonate ion to manufacture their skeletons : snails , urchins , clams , crabs and lobsters .
And notably , it forms the calcified plates of microscopic phytoplankton that are so abundant and crucial to the entire marine food chain .
Meanwhile carbon dioxide levels influence the physiology of water - breathing organisms of all kinds , which for most creatures has been optimized to operate in a narrow range of dissolved CO 2 and ocean pH .
We are now carrying out an extraordinary chemical experiment on a global scale .
Our fossil - fuel emissions raise the dissolved CO 2 levels in the ocean , which reduces carbonate ion concentrations and lowers pH .
The ocean ’s sunlit surface layer ( the top 100 yards or so ) could easily lose 50 percent of its carbonate ion by the end of this century unless we reduce emissions dramatically .
Marine animals will find it harder to build skeletons , construct reefs , or simply to grow and breathe .
Compared with past geologic events , the speed and scale of this conversion is astonishing .
We therefore have a dilemma .
The ocean ’s absorption of CO 2 helps to keep atmospheric change in check .
For decades , climate scientists described the uptake as a blessing for society , and ocean chemists hoped that calcium carbonate sediments on the seafloor would dissolve in sufficient quantities to offset a drop in pH .
But research has shown that the rate at which sediments dissolve cannot possibly keep pace with the far faster rate of acidification .
Society can continue to depend on the ocean for help , but the cost is a rising threat to all marine life .
Although our understanding remains murky , the fossil record shows that ocean life has suffered massive extinctions during periods of rapidly rising carbon dioxide levels .
Marine animals ’ metabolic functions are typically tuned to narrow , internal pH ranges .
In addition to reducing the calcification of skeletons , more acidic water will acidify body fluids , likely raising respiratory stress and depressing metabolism .
Some organisms may tolerate a certain amount of change , but thinner shells will make others more vulnerable to damage or predators .
Some organisms might also tolerate acidification of internal fluids to a point , yet even so many will expend more energy to maintain their optimal acid - base balance or will struggle to supply their body with oxygen and to sustain cellular functions vital to life .
The extra expense of coping with acidification may make them more prone to dying .
These stresses will be particularly severe for deep - sea animals , which have adapted to an extremely stable environment .
And even if animals survive , the stresses will sap energy they would otherwise use for growth and reproduction .
We would probably see the effects of ocean acidification first in animal groups that have finely tuned environmental ranges , particularly those already “ living on the edge ” such as coral reefs , which have already suffered widespread bleaching and death from warming ocean temperatures .
Less appreciated are effects on massive communities of tiny animals that live in the ocean ’s midlevels .
These creatures migrate en masse to the surface layer at night to feed yet sink to deep water during the daytime to avoid predators .
In so doing , they form a critical link between the warm , oxygenated surface layer and the cold , oxygen - depleted waters of the deep , as well as a critical link in the oceanwide food chain .
Increased acidity and expanding zones of low oxygen in some regions may force these midwater organisms into shallower waters where they would be more exposed to predators .
And if , as expected , the zones of low oxygen expand and intensify , many of these migrators could die .
Together these effects could slice through this daily , migratory lifeline between shallow and deep waters — an outcome that could impact society ’s ocean fisheries .
How well marine life can adapt to rapid acidification remains an open question , but there is real reason for concern .
Ocean life has weathered large environmental perturbations during the earth ’s history , just barely ; some 250 million years ago massive volcanism is thought to have caused ocean acidification and other factors that left 90 percent of marine species dead .
Although man -made climate change will be much milder , strong and immediate action to stabilize CO 2 levels is essential to minimize our disruption of ocean chemistry and ecosystems .
We can no longer deny our role in global climate change .
Now is the time for serious discussion among science , business and political leaders about ways to minimize our impact on our air and water , to set limits on the effects of our fossil - fuel use , and to plan how to adapt to coming change .
Videogames and movies get along like cats made of oil and dogs made of water .
There have been a few good games based on films , but the best you can say about movies based on videogames is that they have n't actually killed anyone yet .
Things may be improving , though .
By giving respected director Sam Raimi the reins to the World of Warcraft movie , Hollywood is giving us reason to think that we 'll finally have a videogame movie at least as good as Darkman .
Dare we hope ?
Dare we dream ?
Dare we stand in line for weeks dressed as a Night Elf druid ?
Luckily , Wired.com acquired a device that lets us peer into the near future , and we were able to get a peek at Raimi 's production diary for the Warcraft movie , which is due in 2011 .
Here 's what we were able to make out :
Day 1
I 'll say it : I , Sam Raimi , am a genius .
My decision to hire actual World of Warcraft players as extras was a stroke of brilliance .
We get lots of publicity , they work for free and some of them are bringing their own swords !
This is going to be great .
Day 2
OK , problems .
To start with , there 's a huge line of extras waiting to get on the set , and every time we get a bunch of them in , the scenery crashes .
My technical advisers say this is normal for a launch , and they 're working on it .
In the meantime , they suggest that I build several identical sets , and encourage the extras to transfer to the other sets .
Day 12
We 've got the set problem worked out , but I 'm still getting a lot of complaints from the extras .
They 're saying the sides are unbalanced , that the Horde side has Scarlett Johansson and the Alliance just has Halle Berry .
I asked my technical advisers what calms nerds down , and they said I should add a Scarlett Johansson to the Alliance and a Halle Berry to the Horde to make things fair .
They also said , and I 'm quoting here , " Nerf Shia LaBeouf . "
I fired them .
Day 33
I can't believe how hard it is to get any work done on this project .
There are extras goofing off everywhere , but it takes an hour of asking around to get a group of 10 of them together to shoot a scene .
And then , just when we 're about to start filming , one of them suddenly has to leave because his mother needs him to clean his room or something .
Day 48
I 'm starting to regret firing the technical advisers .
Someone needs to explain to me how these dorks think .
For instance , whenever the extras " kill " someone during a battle scene , they immediately stop fighting and start grabbing pieces of his costume .
Even the ears !
If I did n't know better , I 'd think someone was paying them for detached body parts , but that 's crazy talk .
Day 75
Why is it that every time we wrap for the day , one of the extras asks me to " open a portal to Dalaran " ?
Is he asking for drugs ?
Day 103
I can't tell you how pissed off I am .
I keep giving the extras simple instructions for the final battle scene :
When Kel ' Thuzad raises his staff , run left .
When he raises his orb , run right .
That 's all there is to it , but every time we shoot , a bunch of extras run the wrong way , right into the pyrotechnics .
Every time !
We must have tried shooting the scene two dozen times and someone always screws it up .
Worse yet , we keep having to put shooting on hold while they get their armor repaired .
Day 108
I think I 've got it .
A production assistant suggested I provide the extras with incentives they understand .
I 've ransacked the prop department for every cheesy fantasy tchotchke and outfit I could find , and I 've started handing them out at the end of a day 's work .
I thought I 'd have to give everyone something , but it turns out I can just give them , like , five things and let them fight over who gets them .
They 've set up their own elaborate rules for who gets what , but it 's made them a lot more efficient , and I 'm finally getting some decent scenes filmed .
Now if I could just get them to stop dancing .

Lord Mandelson said progress on widening access had been limited Campaigners have welcomed an idea to give poorer students a two grade " head start " to help them get places at the leading universities .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson is looking at the idea , and a variety of others , to increase social mobility .
Les Ebdon , of university think tank Million + , said it was important to widen the social mix in universities .
However critics said the onus should be on schools to produce better candidates and added that the idea was unfair .
One consequence of the " head start " idea would be middle class students from successful schools being " bumped " from places on popular courses .
It is not fair on those who study hard , it is not fair on the schools that actually produce a good quality education .
Katie Ivens
In a speech delivered in July , Lord Mandelson said that limited progress had been made in widening access to higher education .
He said there was a strong case for using more contextual benchmarks for talent spotting which look at the way candidates have exploited the opportunities open to them .
Mr Ebdon said : " I think what all universities are in the business of looking for is potential among the students rather than achievement . "
Fairer system
However he added that because students from better background achieved more did not mean that they had a higher potential .
Mr Ebdon said the idea to give poorer students a grade boost was " a way of attempting to level the playing field " .
He added : " We have a real problem in this country .
Our medical schools are full of very earnest young people from middle class backgrounds and then we find it very difficult to find , for example , GPs to go and work in working class areas .
" Therefore we have got to do something to widen the social mix and traditionally medical schools have been seen as the preserve of middle classes rather than appealing across the whole spectrum of people . "
Unfair Katie Ivens , of the Campaign for Real Education , said the plan was positive discrimination .
She said : " It is not fair on those who study hard , it is not fair on the schools that actually produce a good quality education .
" You can not just push people into university because they come from a certain background and hope that will solve the problem . "
Ms Ivens said the standard of teaching in secondary schools and primary schools also needed to be examined .
She said the plan would create the possibility of a good grammar school student missing out on a university place to a student with worse results who may not make the grade .

The Jeddah offices of a Lebanon - based TV station which broadcast an interview with a Saudi man boasting about his sexual conquests have been closed .
Saudi Arabian authorities said the offices had been shut by order of the country 's deputy prime minister .
The 32 - year - old Saudi man 's interview shocked conservative Saudi society , prompting calls for him to be punished .
Mazen Abdul Jawad talked about his sexual conquests and how he picks up women in the kingdom .
A spokesman at the information ministry confirmed the decision to close the offices of the LBC TV station in the kingdom 's commercial capital .
" It was because of the interview with Mazen Abdul Jawad , " Abdul Rahman al - Hazzaa said , according to AFP news agency .
Discreet society
Saudi media say officials are considering whether to charge Mr Abdul Jawad over the interview , which appeared on a programme called Red Lines and challenged Saudi taboos .
The Saudi daily newspaper al - Watan said authorities had also closed other offices of the channel , which is mainly owned by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal .
Pre-marital sex is illegal in Saudi Arabia and Mr Abdul Jawad could face imprisonment or flogging .
Saudi Arabia is not only the most conservative society in the Arab world , it is also the most discreet .
If people break its strict Islamic code they face punishment - lashes or imprisonment for drinking or non-marital sex .
These rules are flouted by locals as well as expatriates , correspondents say , but almost everyone who breaks the rules keeps quiet about it and hopes they will not be found out .

Internet service providers ( ISPs ) have reacted with anger to new proposals on how to tackle internet piracy .
The government is proposing a tougher stance which would include cutting off repeat offenders from the net .
UK ISP Talk Talk said the recommendations were likely to " breach fundamental rights " and would not work .
Virgin said that " persuasion not coercion " was key in the fight to crack down on the estimated six million file - sharers in the UK .
TalkTalk 's director of regulation Andrew Heaney told the BBC News the ISP was as keen as anyone to clamp down on illegal file - sharers .
" This is best done by making sure there are legal alternatives and educating people , writing letters to alleged file - sharers and , if necessary , taking them to court . "
If Lord Mandelson really ' does n't get the internet ' , you can be sure that there will be plenty of people now offering to educate him
Rory Cellan - Jones
Man arrested over file - share site
But introducing measures to simply cut people off will not work , he said .
" Disconnecting alleged offenders will be futile given that it is relatively easy for determined file - sharers to mask their identity or their activity to avoid detection , " he added .
There are also concerns that the method of identifying offenders using the IP address of a specific machine may punish those who share a web connection .
A spokeswoman for Virgin Media was concerned that a " heavy - handed , punitive regime will simply alienate consumers " .
' Bizarre ' Politicians on all sides have been split by the proposal .
Speaking on Radio 4's PM programme , the former Cabinet Secretary , Tom Watson MP , said that Lord Mandelson had reached " the wrong conclusion " .
ILLEGAL FILE - SHARING
File - sharing is not illegal .
It only becomes illegal when users are sharing content , such as music , that is protected by copyrights
The crackdown will be aimed at people who regularly use technologies , such as BitTorrent , and websites , such as The Pirate Bay , to find and download files
There are plenty of legitimate services which use file - sharing technology such as some on - demand TV services
Q&A : Disconnecting file - sharers Don Foster MP , the Liberal Democrat 's culture and media spokesman , told BBC News that Lord Mandelson 's move was " reckless and dangerous " .
" There are many families whose children , unbeknown to them , might be illegally downloading but now their own access could be put in jeopardy by Lord Mandelson 's proposals . "
Mr Foster acknowledged that online piracy was " a major problem in the UK " but said overriding the opinions of Lord Carter and two secretaries of state was " bizarre " .
The Conservative MP John Whittingdale , who is also chairman of the Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee , said he was broadly supportive of Lord Mandelson 's proposals , but said that he may have inadvertently " killed his own bill " .
" Personally I am on his [ Lord Mandelson 's ] side ; peer - to - peer sharing is the greatest threat to our creative industries , " he said .
" I do n't think people should have their broadband cut off , but there are measures to restrict speed which is better than prosecuting people so they get a criminal record .
" That said , I have severe doubts that the government can get this bill through in the time available as if there is any opposition to it - and there will be now - there will be a general election before it goes through . "
Listening carefully Originally the Digital Britain report , published in June , gave Ofcom until 2012 to consider whether technical measures to catch pirates were necessary .
FROM THE PM PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .

More from PM
However , according to a statement from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) released on Tuesday , that timeframe is now considered " too long to wait " .
Stephen Timms , minister for Digital Britain , said : " We 've been listening carefully to responses to the consultation this far , and it's become clear there are widespread concerns that the plans as they stand could delay action , impacting unfairly upon rights holders . "
It proposes that internet service providers ( ISPs ) are obliged to take action against repeat infringers and suggests that the cost of tracking down persistent pirates be shared 50:50 between ISPs and rights holders .
HAVE YOUR SAY
By all means fine those who download illegally , but to cut them off from the internet would be taking away the right to free speech and communication Janet Shaw , Romford , UK The proposal has been welcomed by the BPI , which represents the recorded music industry in Britain .
" ' Digital piracy is a serious problem and a real threat to the UK 's creative industries , " it said in a statement .
" Today is a step forward that should help the legal digital market to grow for consumers . "
BIS denied that it had changed its position since the publication of Digital Britain and said that the recommendations were open to consultation .
" We are simply adding new ideas to the table that could potentially make the whole system more flexible and provide a quicker way to bring in technical measures , " it said in a statement .
It is estimated that half of all the traffic on the net in the UK is content that is shared illegally .
The UK government has set a target of reducing the problem by at least 70 % .

Two mates have found a novel way to make the most out of old rusting railway lines .
A few years ago Julio Mottola and Michael Albert hatched a plan to create a unique bike that could be ridden on rusting tracks .
Enter the " locobike " - two bicycles joined together with a solid aluminium frame with four little polyurethane wheels attached .
The wheels then lock the bicycles to the railway tracks and away you go .
Secret and illegal trials of the prototype , on the disused Casino to Murwillumbah rail line on the NSW north coast , were a success .
After covering more than 100 kilometres in these underground trials , the duo began lobbying to make their contraption legal .
Several Byron
Bay locals are backing the idea and a former lawyer for Dick Smith is working pro bono to organise a petition to take to the local council .
Jewellery designer Mr Mottola , and Mr Albert , who runs a hat shop in Melbourne , spent a year getting their invention just right .
" It 's a very safe and simple design and it's very easy to use , " Mr Mottola told ABC News Online .
" It requires less muscle work than riding a bicycle on the road because the tyres sit on top of the rails so there 's very little friction . "
It took the pedaling pair two - and - a - half hours to locoride from Mullumbimby to Byron Bay .
" It was quite exciting because the country is amazing , " Mr Albert , who lives in Melbourne but visits Byron Bay regularly , said .
" And we did raise a few eyebrows when people spotted us . "
All aboard
Mr Albert says there is far more to their ambitious plans than just " skylarking " ;
The duo believes the locobike offers plenty of transport and tourism potential for the region .
And if all goes according to plan and their machine becomes legal to use on the tracks , they will hand over the locobike concept to the local council .
" It would be a real feather in the Byron district 's cap , " Mr Albert said .
" It could be a fantastic landmark of Byron Bay , " Mr Mottola , who moved to the coastal town from Argentina eight years ago , said .
Both say inventing the locobike has nothing to do with finding fame and fortune .
" Nobody is going to make money , " Mr Mottola said .
" Michael does n't want to make any money , I do n't want to make any money .
We just know it 's our idea and hope it will help the community . "
Speed bump
But lantana growing throughout the region has currently stopped the prototype locobike in its tracks .
" The lantana 's very thick and the locobike , being very lightweight , just can't get through it on the tracks , " Mr Albert said .
But the pair have a way to stamp out the " filthy weed " .
" It dawned on us that the locobike is perfect to clear all the lantana , " Mr Albert said .
" The locobike will carry a load and you could put a basket in the middle and put your gardening gear in that .
" It 's got wonderful potential for land care as well as for community groups . "
And if the locobike gets that final tick of approval , the pair reckon there are many places their device would take off .
" There 's potential for it everywhere , even in third - world countries where the trains do n't work and they 've got unused rail lines , " Mr Albert said .
Mr Mottola also spruiks the endless possibilities for doing the locomotive .
" You could even have honeymoon locobikes , " he said .
But first things first .
" We 're getting that petition together and then we 'll light a few candles and pray , " Mr Mottola said .

In retrospect of my childhood , I played Donkey Kong almost as much as Super Mario World , which shows they were both fun and addicting .
After both games became instant classics , what is the next logical move ?
Make another , even better sequel , right ?
… Well in this case , I think it backfired , and instead of getting another evolution of the series , we actually see the gameplay take a few steps back .
In the third installment , DK and Diddy are captured and it is up to Dixie and Kiddy to team up and save them …yeah , its the usual “ been there , done that ” feeling you get with most long - running Nintendo franchises .
Anyways ,
The problem I had was that while Dixie is quick and has a very useful helicopter move with her hair , Kiddy feels absolutely useless .
I had the displeasure of being stuck as Kiddy the entire game , since my girlfriend and I did co-op , and she felt that she should be the girl character , so I saw firsthand how sluggish and awkward he is .
So if you are just playing this on single player , do n’t be surprised if you find yourself never playing as Kiddy unless you get Dixie killed .
While the visuals and music stay pretty much solid throughout , I think the main problem with DKC3 , is the fact that the developers ran out of ideas .
Looking back at DKC ( my favorite in the series ) , it had a good mix of platforming , creature - based levels , and gimmicks ( for instance , the mine cart levels ) .
With DKC2 , we saw those great attributes fleshed out a bit more and it kept it fresh , while DKC3 tried to do everything and was just kind of sloppy with the execution .
I think the fact that we have already been on a similar adventure twice before , will really turn a lot of gamers off , since DKC3 did n’t really improve very much .
Even though I did n’t care for the characters , I must say the addition of an open world map was pretty cool and unique for the time this came out .
You would ride around in a watercraft to various islands on the map ( you can usually choose between a few at a time ) , but there were limits .
Once you beat an area , Funky Kong would upgrade your craft so you can go over terrain , and get farther along in the game .
Even though it seems pretty typical , I thought it was cool that I sometimes had a choice as to where I wanted to start first .
The gameplay this time around seemed to take a huge hit .
I thought this game would be “ more of the same ” which is never a bad thing with such a good series , but it seemed like the team over at Rareware , just did n’t put as much love into the level design ; there was less fun platforming , and more tedious bullshit .
The only reason I could think this game felt unpolished , was the fact that it came out around the time of the Nintendo 64 , and most developers were more excited about the future generations of gaming .
There were so many levels that relied on trial and error with you hitting the right switches , making the right jumps in a mine cart , etc .
While I found many levels annoying , there was one that reigned supreme in the kingdom of cheap , crap levels … ” Lightning Look - Out ” .
In this level , not only are there baddies , but you are also having to dodge lightning every few seconds .
It would n’t be so bad if there was n’t water throughout the entire level , and if you did n’t hit that barrel JUST right , you land in the water and get electrocuted .
As you progress and get closer to the end , you will find that you are no longer having fun and pretty much just beating the game , instead of it beating you .
Wrapping up , this is a game you should get if you just have a lot of nostalgia for it or are a completest .
I know I sounded a bit harsh , but this really is n’t an awful game … I just feel it is n’t good enough to be a part of the DKC series .
If you are looking for a good platformer , stick with the original two , and leave it at that .
With uninspired gameplay that did n’t keep the formula fresh enough , you will find yourself becoming bored and really having to force yourself to finish .
To me , that does not make a good gaming experience , and your 800 Nintendo Points can be spent on something better in the Virtual Console library .

Chalk it up to the Demi Moore / Ashton Kutcher effect , or better yet , just call it creepy : Northern California is bracing for an influx of cougars in about a month .
And I ’m not talking about the animals ; I ’m talking about the ladies , specifically those in the 35 + age bracket who are seeking young men with better than average verility .
Pop culture loves cougars , but apparently real people do too .
Yesterday , a friend sent an e-mail inviting me to the following event :
National Single Cougars Convention Single cougars from all over America will converge on the Silicon Valley , the ONLY major metropolitan area in America with a surplus of single men , many of whom are young , educated , attractive , and prosperous , but lacking in experience with women .
7:30 pm – Complimentary appetizers from Trader Vic’s , as long as they last .
8 pm – Entertaining Keynote Address with author Francesca Gentille and Tahil Gesyuk , her romantic partner , who is 14 years younger .
9 pm-Midnight – The Cougar Ball , featuring dancing to your favorite hits .
At approximately 11 pm , one cougar at the Convention will be crowned MISS COUGAR AMERICA and receive prizes , including her choice of the upcoming Singles Halloween Cruise or the Spring Baja Cruise , courtesy of The Singles Travel Company , plus a Cougar Kit from Cardeaux Cosmetics , valued at over $ 100 .
To be eligible to win , the lucky Cougar must be present at the convention , legally single and at least 40 years of age .
BONUS : The first 50 women to arrive will receive free samples from Cardeaux Cosmetics !
Yes , you read correctly .
There will be prizes and even a coronation .
I ’ll be out of town that day , but if I were around , you can bet your bottom dollar I ’d be tempted to go watch .

FactCheck.org – Actually , abortion will be covered under health care bill
In addition to other rebuttals against opponents of the current health care bill , President Obama and other members of the left have laughed off suggestions that abortions will be paid for under the House proposal .
The President called it a “ fabrication , ” and I ’ve read many other articles treating the charge as ridiculous as stating the earth is flat .
Though the claim of taxpayer - funded abortions has been reasserted by the National Right to Life and supported by the revelation about the Capps Amendment , the charge gains a damning credence when it ’s backed up by no less than FactCheck.org , who provide an intensive and thorough vetting of the argument ( Heads - up from Hot Air ) .
The site , committed to digging for the facts behind public statements , has certainly been no friend to Republicans and conservatives – and yet they come to this conclusion :
“ As for the House bill as it stands now , it ’s a matter of fact that it would allow both a “ public plan ” and newly subsidized private plans to cover all abortions . ”
You should do yourself a favor and read the entire analysis , but here ’s another key part of the summary :
Will health care legislation mean “ government funding of abortion ” ?
President Obama said Wednesday that ’s “ not true ” and among several “ fabrications ” being spread by “ people who are bearing false witness . ”
But abortion foes say it ’s the president who ’s making a false claim .
“ President Obama today brazenly misrepresented the abortion - related component ” of health care legislation , said Douglas Johnson , legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee .
So which side is right ?
The truth is that bills now before Congress do n’t require federal money to be used for supporting abortion coverage .
So the president is right to that limited extent .
But it ’s equally true that House and Senate legislation would allow a new “ public ” insurance plan to cover abortions , despite language added to the House bill that technically forbids using public funds to pay for them .
Obama has said in the past that “ reproductive services ” would be covered by his public plan , so it ’s likely that any new federal insurance plan would cover abortion unless Congress expressly prohibits that .
Low - and moderate - income persons who would choose the “ public plan ” would qualify for federal subsidies to purchase it .
Private plans that cover abortion also could be purchased with the help of federal subsidies .
Therefore , we judge that the president goes too far when he calls the statements that government would be funding abortions “ fabrications . ”
As the article mentions , the President himself told Planned Parenthood in 2007 that “ reproductive care ” will be at the center of his health plan , and that “ reproductive services ” are essential and must be covered .
Did the President explicitly say abortion ?
Of course not .
But it would be beyond disingenuous to assert that it ’s not what he ’s talking about when his audience is one of the premiere pro-choice organizations in America .
So if it ’s true , and it ’s such a good idea , then the administration and the left should own it and be honest about it .
However , there ’s a reason why Obama and others have to downplay the whole notion of taxpayer - funded abortion – it will drive down the popularity of a bill finding fewer and fewer supporters , and with the revelation of a larger long - term deficit forecast , it ’s becoming an increasingly tougher sell .
That ’s the whole trouble for the administration on the whole health care debate – it ’s not contrived partisan anger , but genuine concern over the substance of what the plan actually does that is causing problems and will ultimately force Congress to make it more palatable to the center and the right , though it may cause the strident left to walk away in anger over a compromise that drops the public option .
In any case , I think an apology is owed to those who were accused of fabricating the whole thing .
It turns out it ’s true after all .

BAGHDAD — Abu Omar al - Baghdadi was captured again several weeks ago .
By now it ’s old hat .
Mr. Baghdadi is the leader of the most zealous group of jihadists fighting in Iraq , and he has been reported captured and killed several times before .
As many times , he has also been declared not real .
Usually , whether a man is in custody is a fairly straightforward proposition :
He is , or he is not .
But even casual Iraqologists would find the notion of a straightforward proposition here amusingly naïve , especially in a case as politically loaded as this one .
Politics here plays out in endless equivocations and manipulations that turn even hard facts  demographics , borders and crime statistics  into uncertainties .
So the tale of Abu Omar is worth keeping in mind as the jockeying intensifies for the all - important national elections to be held next January .
Mr. Baghdadi has long been a symbolic figure , regardless of whether he exists .
For jihadists , he is the purist who fights under the banner of the Islamic State of Iraq , the would - be caliph of a rising Islamic empire .
For the authorities , he is the snake ’s head of the organization in Iraq most closely involved with Al Qaeda .
Image DPI on the Web
Do you want to understand how image DPI affects images displayed in web pages ?
Consider this formula :
1 = 1
That 's all of the math you 'll ever need to understand how an image 's DPI ( dots per inch ) settings will affect how it will be viewed in a web browser .
That 's because image DPI is irrelevant on the web .
That 's a bold statement and there seems to be a lot of confusion on the subject .
The common misconception is that the higher an image 's DPI is , the more detail will be shown .
But once the irrelevancies have been stripped away , the reality is as simple as the formula 1=1 .
Let 's see why this is so .
When dealing with JPEG images , we are actually using JPEG File Interchange Format ( JFIF ) .
The DPI values we 're talking about are referred to in the JFIF specification as pixel density .
Here is an example .
Below are two versions of a photo of an interesting tree on the island of St. Kitts .
300 Pixels Per Inch 72 Pixels Per Inch
File Size : 23,662 bytes
File Size : 23,662 bytes
Both images above are 300 pixels wide by 400 pixels high and all of the same settings were used when saving them .
The only difference between the two is that the image on the left is 300 pixels per inch and the one on the right is 72 pixels per inch .
You should note that the file sizes are exactly the same .
How can that be ?
Simple .
The pixel density is simply a field , or more appropriately , three fields in the header of the JPEG file .
One field determines the units of measure and the other two determine the actual density for the X and Y axis .
The important part is that , when displayed in a web browser , all three of those values are ignored .
When displayed in a web browser , a pixel is a pixel .
Period .
Now , if you have trouble wrapping your mind around that , download the images .
Each of the images is also a link to that image , so it will be easy for you to save copies of them .
If you examine the properties of two files , you 'll see that 300d pi.jpg is a 300 DPI image and 72dpi.jpg is a 72 DPI image .
If you do a binary comparison of them , you 'll see that there are only four bytes different in the two files .
Below are the first parts of the two files examined in a hex editor with the bytes that are different highlighted :
300 DPI Image 72 DPI Image
Before we look at the bytes that are different , let 's talk about the one byte that immediately precedes them .
That byte is indicated by the term Density Units in the above screen grabs .
In both files that byte is 01 .
The Density Units byte will be set to zero if no density is specified .
In that case , values for the X and Y density show only the aspect ratio of the image .
Otherwise , the Density Units byte is set to 01 for pixels per inch , or 02 for pixels per centimeter .
In our case , both are 01 , so the pixel density for both images are specified in pixels per inch .
Now , looking at the four bytes that are different , the first two represent the X density and the second two are the Y density .
In the 300 DPI image , you have 012C hex , which is 300 for X density and 012C , again 300 , for the Y density .
For the 72 DPI image , you have 0048 hex , which is 72 for both the X and Y density .
So what 's the difference ?
The difference comes when you use a DPI aware program to print an image .
Here 's an example of a PhotoShop print preview of the two above images :
300 DPI Image
72 DPI Image
Now , you see a big difference .
Both images are 300 pixels wide .
When printed at 300 pixels per inch , that results in an image that is one inch wide .
When printed at 72 pixels per inch , it results in an image that is 4.167 inches wide .
At first glance , that may seem to run counter to what you 'd expect .
More pixels per inch should result in a higher quality image , right ?
The problem with that line of thinking is that you 're looking at images with the same pixel dimensions .
With given pixel dimensions , there is nothing you can do to improve the quality of the image or add detail to it .
On the other hand , if an image is scanned at a higher pixel density , it will contain more detail , but will also result in an image that has greater dimensions .
If you scan a photograph that is 8 inches by 10 inches at 72 DPI , the resulting digital image will be 576 pixels by 720 pixels .
If you scan that same 8x10 photo at 300 DPI , the image will be 2,400 pixels by 3,000 pixels .
The two will both print the same size , but 300 DPI image will contain more detail in its 2,400 x 3,000 pixels and when printed be a much sharper , higher quality image .
That , however , has no bearing on how images will be displayed in a web page .
There , we were talking about the original image acquisition .
In images of given pixel dimensions the DPI , or pixel density , has no bearing on file size , or how those images will display in a web page .
So , as was stated at the beginning of this article , each pixel in the image will be represented by exactly one pixel on the computer screen .
1=1 .
Note :
If you doubt my conclusions here and would like to check the standard yourself , you can find a copy of it on the Joint Photographic Experts Group ( JPEG ) web site at http://www.jpeg.org/public/jfif.pdf.
If you do n't already have programs that allow you to examine files in hex mode , or view the properties of an image , WinVi can examine files in hex mode and IfranView can show image properties .
Both programs are free downloads for Windows machines .
Hope that helps clear up some of the confusion .
It 's what we thought ;
The Sony Daily Edition reader is Sony 's first ( AT&T ) 3G reader with a seven - inch touch widescreen display that you can rotate to view books in landscape .
It 'll be available in December for $ 399 .
Updated .
But yeah , check out how crazy wide that display is .
Newspaper content announcement is coming later , unfortunately — as in weeks later , not later today .
Also unfortunately , Sony only brought one model and we can't touch it .
And while 3G will be free , just like the Kindle , wireless access only gets you access to Sony 's book store , none of the other new partnerships announced .
Boooo .
One saving grace ?
The electronic library program :
The eBook store will now have a Library Finder page , where you type in your zip and it'll take you to local library , where you can check out books from your library electronically .
Books will expire in 21 days .
They 're taking the " virtual library " concept fairly literally here , so libraries will have to purchase licenses for each individual copy , which is loaned and returned in the same way as a physical one would be .
That means a library will have a limited stock of virtual books — weird , I know — all licensed from an outside company called Overdrive .
We 'll have to see what the selection is like before getting too excited about this , but it 's a pretty cool concept .
And hey , free books !
Also , anybody else disappointed there 's no Barnes & Noble partnership to really fight the Amazon book Borg ?

The UK newspaper the Independent today is featuring an article titled Warning : Oil supplies are running out fast .
The article is based on an interview with Fatih Birol , Chief Economist of the International Energy Agency .
In a stark warning to Britain and the other Western powers , Dr Birol said that the market power of the very few oil - producing countries that hold substantial reserves of oil – mostly in the Middle East – would increase rapidly as the oil crisis begins to grip after 2010 .
" One day we will run out of oil , it is not today or tomorrow , but one day we will run out of oil and we have to leave oil before oil leaves us , and we have to prepare ourselves for that day , " Dr Birol said .
" The earlier we start , the better , because all of our economic and social system is based on oil , so to change from that will take a lot of time and a lot of money and we should take this issue very seriously , " he said .
" The market power of the very few oil - producing countries , mainly in the Middle East , will increase very quickly .
They already have about 40 per cent share of the oil market and this will increase much more strongly in the future , " he said .
There is now a real risk of a crunch in the oil supply after next year when demand picks up because not enough is being done to build up new supplies of oil to compensate for the rapid decline in existing fields .
Many African students in Moscow are afraid to go outside Nearly 60 % of black and African people living in Russia 's capital Moscow have been physically assaulted in racially motivated attacks , says a new study .
Africans working or studying in the city live in constant fear of attack , according to the report by the Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy .
A quarter of 200 people surveyed said they had been assaulted more than once .
Some 80 % had been verbally abused .
But the number of assaults was down from the MPC 's last survey in 2002 .
The report 's clear conclusion was that Africans living in Russia exist in a state of virtual siege , says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Moscow .
Extreme violence Many of the African respondents said they : Avoided using the Moscow metro
Were also careful to avoid crowded public places
Did not go out on Russian national holidays or on days when there were football matches Many of the attacks on Africans were pre-meditated and extremely violent , the report found .
One Nigerian migrant interviewed by the BBC had been repeatedly stabbed in the back and then shot .
Another man said his attacker had attempted to remove his scalp .
Officially there are some 10,000 Africans living in Moscow , but far more are believed to live there illegally - many as economic migrants .
The Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy is an English - speaking interdenominational Christian congregation that has ministered to Moscow 's foreign community since 1962 .
Read some of your comments about this story :
As a foreigner you will never feel safe in this country .
Shairaz , St. Petersburg , Russia I 'm Asian , not black , but that was one of the main reasons why I left Moscow years ago .
I did hear and see the violent assaults on just any black people in Moscow , and our school actually told all the black students not to come in for two weeks around Hitler 's birthday for feared attacks .
I 've lived in many different parts of the world but Moscow certainly was the worst one in that respect .
Such a shame .
B. , Moscow , Russia
It is dangerous to use Moscow tube for all kinds of minorities , not only for Africans .
Moscow hooligans point out different targets from the crowd .
While visiting Moscow I try to look alike typical muscovite to avoid attention attraction .
If you are in a crowd it 's safe to use the tube and any other public areas .
Kirill , Rostov - on - Don , Russia
However sad it is , I have to admit that these facts are true .
We are in 21st century , but still attitude towards non Russian people here in Moscow remains the same .
Foreigners at least are treated with suspicion ; at most they are attacked , bullied .
I do n't see that many Africans on the streets , you can hardly find them in public places .
Even though I know that many study in Moscow .
When you see Africans in Moscow , they always go in large groups of four or five people , never alone .
Seeing a black person here is still exotic .
Ordinary people just stare at them , but there are groups of youngsters , who think that Africans should not be here .
Listening to all of this horrible stories on radio , TV about Africans being attacked , I am surprised why there are any who choose to come to Moscow .
Svetlana , Moscow , Russia
For me it comes down to one thing , these people are living in the past .
We welcome every foreigner including Europeans back home .
The only way we can improve our own communities , we come and learn , then take back our experiences back home .
Unless someone realises this , tough time are ahead of us .
O. , Moscow , Russia Really ?
I lived in Moscow for four years and never once witnessed the subject of the report .
It was something reported in the foreign press which mysteriously I and my colleagues never saw .
Like most everything else reported on Russia , it was not true .
However , I have seen rampant and very unpleasant prejudice twice in my life once in Nova Scotia and once in Salisbury in Wiltshire .
Michael Hockney , Vancouver , Canada
While I did n't live in Moscow , I did live in St. Petersburg for the winter of 2005 on a study abroad trip .
Even then , the racial violence was startling ... people were being attacked on the streets just for the colour of their skin .
The anti-caucasus sentiment as spread to a nationalistic furore against any foreigners , students included .
There was a contingent of African students at the university where I studied , and they all lived in the dormitory in the same building as the classes .
They all travelled together if they had to go anywhere , while I felt fine walking alone in the dark winter days .
I felt so guilty for feeling safe inside my white skin , and so horrified that innocents were being attacked just because they were there .
This is a problem that the West has roundly ignored for too many years .

The largest singular economy in the United States is still facing a fiscal mess .
California is still trying to grapple with the budget deal that is now in place .
The challenging part seemed getting a budget passed but the more challenging aspect of the budget process is enacting the $ 26 billion in fixes .
Over the last two chaotic years , the state of California has had to figure out how to bridge a stunning $ 60 billion budget gap .
Much of this has to do with the 30 year housing bubble that exploited the gold rush mentality of California .
Since the bubble burst in 2007 , the state ’s revenues have fallen off a cliff and with it , taking down most of the money that the 8th largest economy in the world takes in .
Many economists are now predicting a peak unemployment rate for the state of 13 , 13.5 , and 14 percent .
There will be tough times ahead for the state and I would expect that come fall and winter , we will be seeing another gap in revenues .
Much of this has to do with projections that were simply too optimistic .
Let us take a look between the May 2008 and the May 2009 projections :
Keep in mind that the Department of Finance made these projections during a time when the housing bubble was already contracting and revenues were starting to decline .
This was not a sudden stunning revelation of lost revenues .
In one year , they were off by the following : $ 30 billion , $ 112 billion , and $ 175 billion .
If in a one year estimate you miss your projections by $ 317 billion you will have major problems .
Yet the state was making projections based on bubble economic traffic .
The lifeblood of any nation is trade and commerce .
We have two of the biggest and busiest ports in the world in the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports .
If you want to see the recession in action , let us look at trade traffic :
At the peak in 2007 some 7.3 million cargo containers went in and out of the Long Beach port .
This was a doubling of cargo traffic since 1997 .
However , since that time the amount of cargo coming in has stalled .
Let us take a look at current traffic :
If the current rate holds , we are now back to a sub - 5 million level which can put us back nearly a decade .
This is why paying attention to cargo is a solid indicator of measuring the health of an economy .
We ’ll need to monitor this closely to see what occurs over the next six months .
So clearly , California is not out of the woods simply because they relied so heavily on the housing market .
The state boomed with the bubble but is busting with it as well .
Subprime lending started in the state and many of the top outfits like Countrywide Financial and New Century Mortgage made their home here .
Not only did they make their home in California , but in Southern California .
The economic damage is extremely concentrated in certain regions of the state .
Projections need to be adjusted and the latest Department of Finance report shows how wide this gap is for state spending :
State revenues are heading back to levels not seen in a decade .
Keep in mind we are not factoring the inflation over the past decade .
Dollar for dollar we are heading back a decade .
That is why even though the nationwide employment data may have slightly improved last month California is in a different ball game .
Keep in mind that nationwide we still lost 247,000 jobs ( a 3 million annual rate ) but a big jump occurred because of primarily two reasons .
A large number of discouraged workers quit looking for work and employers stopped hiring .
So to claim it is a recovery is premature .
A state like California that just patched a $ 26 billion budget deficit with over $ 15 billion in cuts will expect to see payrolls shrink as the budget is implemented .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are missing one crucial point here .
That point involves job creation .
We keep hearing about this “ jobless ” recovery when 26,000,000 Americans are unemployed or underemployed .
The age - old wisdom comes from the data that shows that most recoveries start in equities and finally , find their way to actual jobs or what most average Americans would call the real economy .
This idea has been right in many of the last recessions but this is not your typical recession .
There are a few different things in this recession .
Many of the economic shocks occurred from non-job related areas .
What this means is we have never seen a nationwide housing bubble implode annihilating $ 13.89 trillion in household wealth that then led to real job losses .
In past recessions , even with growing job losses some weakness in the housing market occurred as people lost jobs .
This time , the bursting bubble led to job losses related to housing .
Given we will have no massive housing bubble again , what is going to make up for that gap ?
The housing question probably pertains more to California than any other state .
Some 40 percent of industry growth since the beginning of the decade relied on housing related industries .
With that market gone , what will make up that void ?
It is hard to say but patching up $ 60 billion in gaps in one year is not symptomatic of a healthy state .
California is not alone but the problems are deeper here given the structure of the economy .
The actions taken to close the gap will have longer - term consequences :
Until we have stability in the job markets , there is little reason to believe we will have a jobless recovery .
Just because it has happened in the past , does not mean it will happen this time .

LAS VEGAS ( AP ) —
A court on Wednesday approved a total of $ 800 million in payouts from casino company MGM Resorts International and its insurers to more than 4,400 relatives and victims of the Las Vegas Strip shooting that was the deadliest in recent U.S. history .
The action makes final a deal announced earlier this month and settles dozens of lawsuits on the eve of the third anniversary of the shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 at an open - air concert near the Mandalay Bay resort .
Clark County District Court Judge Linda Bell , in her brief order , cited “ near - unanimous participation in the settlement among potential claimants . ”
Authorities said more than 22,000 people were attending an outdoor music festival when a gunman firing military - style weapons from windows on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay rained rapid - fire bullets into the crowd .
MGM Resorts , owner of the hotel and the concert venue , acknowledged no liability with the settlement .
It will pay $ 49 million , while its insurance companies will pay $ 751 million .
“ We are grateful that the decision brings families , victims and the community closer to closure , ” the company said in a statement .
It noted the anniversary of the Oct. 1 , 2017 , event , calling it “ a time of great sadness and reflection . ”
Memorial ceremonies are scheduled Thursday at several venues in Las Vegas , including a reading of the names of the slain beginning at 10:05 p.m. — the time the first shots rang out .
Attorney Robert Eglet , the plaintiffs ’ lawyer who spent a year arranging the settlement with clients , legal firms and attorneys in at least 10 states , said amounts to be disbursed will be determined by two retired judges and he ’s hopeful that payments will begin going out by the end of the year .
“ There ’ve been no objections and we expect no appeals , ” Eglet told The Associated Press .
“ We ’ll send out notices of the order .
After 30 days the $ 800 million will be deposited . ”
The case will be dismissed at that time , he added .
Eglet previously said that everyone involved “ recognized there are no winners in long , drawn - out litigation with multiple trials where people and the community are reliving the event every time we try a case . ”
A line - by - line list of victims , identified by their initials only , runs for more than 170 pages of a 225 - page civil complaint filed Sept. 9 seeking compensation and punitive damages from MGM Resorts .
It accused the casino company of negligence , wrongful death and liability in the 2017 shooting .
Millions of dollars could go to the most severely and permanently injured , Eglet said , depending on factors including age , number of dependents , type of injuries , previous and future medical treatment , and ability to work .
A minimum $ 5,000 would go to each person who filed a claim for unseen injuries and did not seek medical attention or therapy .
Administrators of the account will be retired Nevada Judge Jennifer Togliatti and retired California Judge Louis Meisinger , with help from the Virginia - based claims management legal firm BrownGreer .
Court filings in the case do n’t mention the gunman , Stephen Paddock , who killed himself before police closed in .
Las Vegas police and the FBI determined the 64 - year - old retired accountant and high - stakes poker player meticulously planned the attack and acted alone .
They theorized he may have sought notoriety , but said they never determined a clear motive for the attack .
Amid tumbling banks and bankrupt companies , small businesses may have cause for celebration .
The Senate reauthorized the Small Business Administration 's Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) and Small Business Technology Transfer ( STTR ) programs last Wednesday .
In the House , Congressman David Wu ( D - OR ) shepherded the bill through , with a resounding 386 - 41 vote .
The bill will now head to the conference committee , where differences between the House and Senate bills will get ironed out , says Edsel Brown , assistant director for the Office of Technology at SBA .
Congress has until the July 31to conference the bill .
If the revision passes , this legislation will reauthorize the programs for eight years as well as add some much necessary fixes .
One major adjustment includes allowing small businesses backed by venture capitalists to participate in the programs .
" The fact that we can move forward provides stability to the programs and gives small businesses an experienced program , " says Brown , " not only for themselves but to move America forward in terms of innovation . "
The SBIR program was established by Congress in 1982 , while the STTR came later in 1992 , to aid the government in research and innovation .
Today , federal agencies with an extramural research and development budget of more than $ 100 million allocate 2.5 percent of their dollars to the SBIR program , while agencies with more than $ 1 billion must donate an additional 0.3 percent to the STTR program .
With 11 different agencies , the SBA on average receives $ 2 billion annually for SBIR and $ 200 million for STTR programs .
" SBIR is fundamentally an innovation program .
Given the current economic climate and growing global competition , we need a robust SBIR program that supports cutting - edge companies , " said Congressman
Wu in his floor statement .
The SBIR awards have produced more than 85,000 patents and created millions of jobs , according to the SBA .
Or , Large Majorities of Americans Support the Specific Reforms Obama Is Proposing , But the Debate Going On Now Has Confused Them Into Opposing It
[ digg - reddit - me ] Andrew Sullivan provides a pretty good summary of the policy questions at stake in the health care debate – slightly modified by me to make it a list :
Should we demand that insurance companies provide policies to anyone regardless of pre-existing conditions ?
Should we help the working poor buy that insurance with subsidies ?
Are competitive exchanges for health insurance a good or bad thing ?
Would a public option or a co-op help bring down healthcare costs ?
Does it make sense for the government to study the effectiveness of various treatments as a guide for doctors ?
These are the basic questions Democrats are trying to answer .
The only real presumption Democrats made in creating these policies is that the government can be effective .
The proposals on the table now are modest – tinkering even – in which market mechanisms , government regulation , and a government plan together are designed with three goals :
to provide more security and choice to those Americans already covered by banning abusive insurance company practices and allowing individuals to buy insurance on a health care exchange ;
to those Americans already covered by banning abusive insurance company practices and allowing individuals to buy insurance on a health care exchange ; to institute certain incentives that will hold down the growth of health care costs – using market mechanisms in the Health Insurance Exchange , spreading information with the Independent Medical Advisory Committee , and with the public option ;
– using market mechanisms in the Health Insurance Exchange , spreading information with the Independent Medical Advisory Committee , and with the public option ; to cover the 47 million Americans without health insurance ( whose use of health care , which we already provide as a matter of right , creates a de facto $ 1,100 tax on each individual ) .
The various bills under consideration are so long and complicated because they attempt to make slight adjustments to the system we have – and to remain true to Obama ’s promise that if you like your health insurance you can keep it .
They prohibit certain practices by insurance companies , they set up a Health Insurance Exchange , they may or may not allow citizens to choose a publicly run health care plan , they subsidize individuals who currently cannot afford insurance , they set up committees to study best practices .
What they certainly do not do is attempt radical change .
This is n’t about the free market versus communism , or radicalism versus moderation .
The anger at Obama ’s health care reforms has little to do with what he or other Democrats are proposing .
There are those with reasoned objections .
But the Republican Party has instead embraced and encouraged the inchoate rage of people frustrated with the direction our country is headed , with the various moral dilemmas George W. Bush left for his successors , with the massive failure of the markets that caused our current recession , with the failures of the visceral politics and policies of George W. Bush .
On Slate ’s Political Gabfest today , this exchange captured pretty well the essense of the hyperbolic debate going on now :
DAN GROSS : In college , we had the primal scream where at a point in time people would open their windows and just yell randomly .
It was done to relieve stress but you were n’t yelling a set of statements about how your workload was too high .
You were simply yelling .
And it strikes me …that the things they are yelling are not the reasoned case for doing health care reform in a different way .
They ’re saying things like , “ Let ’s take our country back ! ” or “ Lies , lies , and socialism , communism , fascism . ”
JOHN DICKERSON : Yea – it is a sort of Tourette ’s of the political …
I want to repeat that there are reasoned cases to make against the various policies Obama is proposing – but aside from an odd blog post by a libertarian economist every now and then , I do n’t see them made .
Instead , we get the approach Jon Stewart described : “ You know , the individual mandate is going to hurt small businesses by…aw , fuck it : YOU’RE ALL GOING TO DIE !!! ”
That ’s what we ’re dealing with : cynical manipulation of an inchoate public anger by entrenched interests and the primal screams of a minority of people frustrated with the direction of the country – both of whom are trying to scare the majority into indecision and intimidate the Democrats into submission .
Then there are the many – some of whom are wary of action on health care right now ; some of whom are concerned about government spending ; some of whom support reform , but are n’t clear on the issues ; some of whom are frustrated with Obama ’s moderation .
Very little of the public debate has to do with the issues addressed above .
Instead , we have anonymous lies spread by email , we have right - wing organizations claiming that “ Obamacare = Gov’t Funded Abortion and Euthanasia , ” we have Sarah Palin claiming Obama would make her son go before an evil “ death panel , ” we have Senator Jim DeMinto comparing America under Obama to Germany under Hitler , we have people on the streets and in town halls and on the radio claiming that Obama is instituting Nazi policies , we have protestors deliberately trying to shut down debate ( pdf ) and silence those in favor of reform .
And I ’m not cherry - picking the most egregious examples here – these are the tactics used by mainstream opponents of health care reform .
The response and the debate going on now is unfortunately unhinged from reality and has very little to do with any bill being considered .
Americans started out in favor of Obama ’s health care proposals – expressing support for both him and the policies he had campaigned on .
Polling shows they still support the policies : 72 % of Americans are in favor of the public option ; 74 % of Americans believe that health insurance companies should not be allowed to exclude those with pre-existing conditions ; 71 % of Americans believe that the fact that 47 million Americans are uninsured is a “ very serious ” problem , with 49 % willing to accept higher taxes to cover these individuals .
When Obama ’s plan was described in neutral terms , 56 % of Americans still supported it today ( with 38 % opposed ) .
But as Obama and Republicans and Blue Dog Democrats all raised concerns about deficit spending and soaring health care costs , many in the public became wary of increased spending .
And as Republicans and entrenched interests began to spread rumors of the health care reforms being proposed , Obama ’s support dropped .
But now this debate has broken out into the open – and amid all the accusations of Nazi policies and “ death panels ” and rationing and socialism ! and “ killing Granny ” the American public can see what is really going on .
Republicans will soon learn the truth of Abraham Lincoln ’s aphorism :
You can fool all of the people some of the time , and some of the people all of the time , but you ca n’t fool all of the people all of the time .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Clad in black or white and cradling candles , Hong Kong residents transformed a park into a sea of lights on Thursday in memory of pro-democracy demonstrators killed in Beijing ’s Tiananmen Square 20 years ago .
While China has tried to whitewash the incident over the past two decades and has tightened security around Tiananmen Square in recent days , Hong Kong has long made the most of its freedoms to openly challenge Beijing to reverse its verdict on June 4 and fully account for the killings .
The turnout was estimated at 150,000 people , organizers said , as crowds over spilled from six football pitches in a downtown park .
The figure was even higher than in 1990 when the annual vigil first began , underscoring the anniversary ’s poignancy .
But Hong Kong police put the estimate at around 60,000 .
“ We will never forget June 4 , ” the crowds chanted while singing remembrance songs , waving candles and linking arms .
Many in Hong Kong acknowledge China ’s economic progress since 1989 , but still find the memories of June 4 impossible to forget .
“ I know China is improving , but I hope that they will admit that they fired guns and did wrong , ” said Kong Choi-fung , a 44 - year - old church worker who took her two children to the vigil .
A recent survey found a record 60 percent of Hong Kong people want China to reverse its official verdict on June 4 .
ZHAO ’S MEMOIRS
A British colony until 1997 when Hong Kong switched to Chinese rule , the city has enjoyed wide - ranging freedoms of expression denied most people in mainland China .
But China has delayed calls for direct elections till 2017 at the earliest .
This year , painful memories have been accentuated in the city by political controversy and the symbolic 20th anniversary .
The memoirs of former Communist Party Chief Zhao Ziyang , who sided with the 1989 demonstrators , has been a publishing sensation , with some of his voice recordings played at the vigil .
Meanwhile , the city ’s leader Donald Tsang also drew criticism for suggesting most Hong Kong people wanted to reassess June 4 , given China ’s economic progress since then .
Some at the vigil wore T - shirts and bandanas with the rebuke “ ” Donald Tsang you do n’t represent me . ”
The vigil also saw the rare appearance of a Chinese student leader from 1989 , Xiong Yan , who was able to enter Hong Kong over the weekend .
Other Chinese June 4 dissidents suh as Yang Jianli and Xiang Xiaoji were turned away before the anniversary .
“ Hong Kong is a part of China and can influence China more than any country , more than any place , ” said Xiong , who was one of 21 people placed on Beijing ’s “ most wanted list ” in 1989 .
“ I heard a lot of people came down from China tonight .
They want to experience this .
That ’s great ... where there is freedom , there is the meaning of life , ” he told Reuters .

Mr. Joya ’s conflicting images  a vilified figure who portrays himself as a victim  are as hard to reconcile as his life story .
Human rights groups consider him one of the most ruthless former operatives of an American - backed military unit , known as Battalion 316 , responsible for kidnapping , torturing and murdering hundreds of people suspected of being leftists during the 1980s .
Today , Mr. Joya , a 52 - year - old husband and father of four , has become a political consultant to some of the most powerful people in the country , including Mr. Micheletti during his failed campaign to become president last year .
Now that Mr. Micheletti has effectively secured that post , Mr. Joya has resurfaced again as a liaison of sorts between Mr. Micheletti and the international media .
Mr. Joya looks straight out of central casting , though not for the role of a thug .
He has more of the smooth , elegant bearing of a leading man .
And in the 14 years since he was first brought to trial on charges of illegally detaining and torturing six university students , he has undertaken a solitary quest  one that can at times border on obsession  aimed not only at defending himself , but also at vindicating the government ’s past fight against Communism .
In 1995 , he released a 779 - page volume of newspaper clippings , government records and human rights reports meant to substantiate the military ’s narrative of the cold war , which essentially accuses its opponents of having blood on their hands as well .
And in 1998 , after living for a couple of years in exile in Spain , Mr. Joya said he was the first and only military officer to surrender himself for trial .
“ Not once in 14 years has there been a single legitimate piece of evidence linking me to these crimes , ” he said .
Referring to human rights organizations , he said , “ What they have done is to condemn me in the media , because they know if they proceed with these cases in court , they are going to lose . ”
A British man has been arrested for his role in running one of the internet 's oldest file sharing websites .
The man - who started the FileSoup website in 2003 - was taken into custody last week after a raid on his home in Taunton , Somerset , and subsequently released on bail without charge .
FileSoup , which was started in 2003 , is well - known in the file sharing community but does not host illegal material itself .
Instead , it operates forums where users share links to files which then allow them to download TV shows and movies from around the internet .
When contacted by the Guardian , the man verified that he had been arrested last Monday , but refused to comment further without consulting a lawyer .
However , in a posting on FileSoup itself , he detailed the situation - including how police seized a number from his home , including mobile phones , computers , hard drives and a video camera .
" I was arrested and taken to the local police station , " he wrote .
" On the way I asked and was told that it would take about a couple of hours .
When I arrived , the booking - in charge was entered as suspicion of downloading copyrighted movies . "
After what he claims were several hours in which he was refused contact with friends , family or a legal representative , he was eventually given a solicitor , interviewed by officers and released without charge .
His bail conditions state that he must surrender to police in October .
Avon and Somerset police would not comment on the case when contacted by the Guardian on Tuesday evening .
Known online as " Geeker " , the man has run FileSoup since it started in 2003 .
For several years it operated as a so - called " tracker " website - much like notorious Swedish file sharing site the Pirate Bay , whose backers were each sentenced to a year in prison and fined £ 600,000 by a court in Stockholm for copyright offences .
Since 2005 , however , FileSoup has not operated as a tracker - instead hosting forum pages where community members regularly post links to files that let them download copyrighted programmes and films .
However , with British law still unclear whether such sites are illegal - since they effectively act as search engines for online material , rather than hosting it - the site 's fans were left up in arms .
" This is insane , " said one commenter on the Torrentfreak website , which broke the news .
" I 'm saddened by this news , " commented another .
Among the concerns was the news that the goods seized during the operation were no longer being held by police , but had instead been handed over to the Federation Against Copyright Theft ( Fact ) , an accredited private group that often assists law enforcement with inquiries in such cases .
A spokesman for Fact , which is funded by organisations such as BSkyB , Paramount and Sony Pictures , said it could not comment on an open investigation .
The federation largely concentrates its activities on shutting down the authors and sellers of pirate DVDs , but recently it has been intimately involved in a number of high - profile file sharing cases - not all of them successful .
Two years ago a 26 - year - old man from Cheltenham was arrested for running a website called TV Links , which pointed users towards television shows online , some of which had been illegally copied .
Although no charges were ever brought against the individual behind the site , it was closed down as a result .
Shortly after that incident , police raided the HQ of another file sharing website , a private music community called Oink .
The site had become well - known for allowing users to access out of print material and pre-release versions of new music - and was even used by musicians including Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor , who told New York magazine that he " frequented it quite often " .
The site 's administrator , 25 - year - old Alan Ellis , was taken into custody by Middlesbrough police and after further raids in May 2008 , four men eventually plead guilty to various copyright infringement offences .
Three defendants were sentenced to community service , and all four fined between £ 360 and £ 500 .

Federal prosecutors have reached a plea deal with a man accused of shooting at a San Juan County sheriff 's deputy , so the sheriff 's department on Wednesday released video of the extended 2007 incident .
According to a news release , Lionel Claw , 22 , pleaded guilty to federal charges of assault with a deadly weapon , discharging a firearm during a violent crime and possession of a firearm by a person under indictment .
He 'll serve 25 years in prison on those charges .
Claw had earlier been sentenced to a total of 30 years in prison for state charges relating to this incident and a separate armed robbery .
The five - minute video shows views from two dashboard cameras of parts of the chase and shootout from May 2007 .
The San Juan County Sheriff 's Department edited and annotated the video before releasing it to the media .
According to a news release , three Bloomfield police officers were dispatched to a call about a fight at the Quick Stop Laundry on North First Street in Bloomfield just before 7 p.m. on May 12 , 2007 .
A black passenger car was seen leaving the business at a high speed , and later found at a nearby mobile home park .
At the mobile home park , police tried to apprehend the four people inside the vehicle .
One fled on foot .
Sgt. Joe Templeton of Bloomfield police tried to use a stun gun to take the driver , identified as Claw , into custody , but the darts struck two different people , preventing the weapon from working .
Claw left the area at a high speed and other officers caught up .
During the chase , according to the news release , the suspect held a gun outside the driver 's window and fired at the pursuing officers , hitting their vehicles .
San Juan County deputies and state police joined the pursuit , which after leaving Bloomfield town limits reached 94 miles an hour at times on U.S. Highway 550 .
One of the passengers , Eli Trujillo , jumped out of the moving vehicle , leaving Claw and a teenage girl inside .
Trujillo suffered serious injuries .
As the chase continued , according to the news release , the girl leaned out the front window and fired several shots at the pursuing law enforcement cars .
More shots were fired through the car 's rear window as well , according to the news release .
The chase soon reached the Navajo Nation .
The suspects fired several more shots at the pursuing vehicles .
Meanwhile , officials deployed spike strips on the road , deflating the left tires of the suspect vehicle .
The vehicle continued into a housing area , where the girl entered a home .
She was later taken into custody .
According to the news release , Claw pointed a gun at the officers , reentered the vehicle and drove away , but a San Juan County deputy performed a PIT maneuver to stop it .
Other deputies worked to pin the driver in .
Claw then fired several times at Sgt. Kory Faulk , the news release said .
He and other officers returned fire , hitting Claw several times .
Claw was soon airlifted to the San Juan Regional Medical Center , where he was treated and released into police custody .
Faulk , who was hit several times by bullet and glass fragments , was also treated for his injuries and released .
The teenage girl later pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated assault on a police officer and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile facility .
Barclays , which avoided having to ask for a Government bail - out during the recent banking crisis , is even expected to disclose next week that its wage bill has increased by more than 20 per cent after it paid out substantial bonuses to keep hold of bankers who have helped the company post a predicted £ 2 billion profit .
Although the FTSE 100 index dropped 23.25 points yesterday to close at 4608.32 , overall it finished the month up 8.5 per cent .

Scientists have long speculated that Mars might have played host to microbial life in an earlier era .
Now that it 's certain water exists on the Red Planet , they 're trying to grow some microbes that could live there .

The microbe Methanosarcina barkeri is known to grow on Earth in places where oxygen and nutrients are scarce and conditions are harsh — much like they are on Mars .
University of Maryland scientist Kevin Sowers thinks that M. barkeri could survive the various climate extremes of Mars because it already often does so on Earth .
According toAstrobiology Magazine :
" We are pushing the envelope to see what the organism 's limits are , " Sowers says .
They will use DNA microarrays and 3D tomography to see how the cells respond and what benefit the outer shell confers .

Sowers and his colleagues are interested in M. barkeri because it excretes methane as part of its respiratory process , which some believe might be the source of the methane in the Martian atmosphere .
Sowers and colleagues are investigating how the microbe reacts to the specific extremes of Mars , including huge temperature and humidity swings and scarce nutrients .
M. barkeri might well be up to the challenge of surviving unassisted on Mars : in addition to exhaling methane , it can digest methanol and acetate and , lacking that , can create its own organic molecules from other molecular elements it finds in its environment .
Unlike spore - forming microbes , when conditions get too harsh to support even microbial life , M. barkeri forms a tough outer layer not unlike connective tissue in higher vertebrates .
Once tested on Earth , it 's even possible that M. barkeri could be part of a future expedition to the Red Planet along with some human passengers in need of more technological assistance .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Use of antidepressant drugs in the United States doubled between 1996 and 2005 , probably because of a mix of factors , researchers reported on Monday .

About 6 percent of people were prescribed an antidepressant in 1996 -- 13 million people .
This rose to more than 10 percent or 27 million people by 2005 , the researchers found .
“ Significant increases in antidepressant use were evident across all sociodemographic groups examined , except African Americans , ” Dr. Mark Olfson of Columbia University in New York and Steven Marcus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia wrote in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
“ Not only are more U.S. residents being treated with antidepressants , but also those who are being treated are receiving more antidepressant prescriptions , ” they added .
More than 164 million prescriptions were written in 2008 for antidepressants , totaling $ 9.6 billion in U.S. sales , according to IMS Health .
Drugs that affect the brain chemical serotonin like GlaxoSmithKline ’s Paxil , known generically as paroxetine , and Eli Lilly and Co ’s Prozac , known generically as fluoxetine , are the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressant .
But the study found the effect in all classes of the drugs .
Olfson and Marcus looked at the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys done by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , involving more than 50,000 people in 1996 and 2005 .
“ During this period , individuals treated with antidepressants became more likely to also receive treatment with antipsychotic medications and less likely to undergo psychotherapy , ” they wrote .
SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE
The survey did not look at why , but the researchers made some educated guesses .
It may be more socially acceptable to be diagnosed with and treated for depression , they said .
The availability of new drugs may also have been a factor .
“ Although there was little change in total promotional spending for antidepressants between 1999 ( $ 0.98 billion ) and 2005 ( $ 1.02 billion ) , there was a marked increase in the percentage of this spending that was devoted to direct - to consumer advertising , from 3.3 percent ( $ 32 million ) to 12 percent ( $ 122.00 million ) , ” they added .
Dr. Eric Caine of the University of Rochester in New York said he was concerned by the findings .
“ Antidepressants are only moderately effective on population level , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Caine , who was not involved in the research , noted that several studies show therapy is as effective as , if not more effective than , drug use alone .
“ There are no data to say that the population is healthier .
Indeed , the suicide rate in the middle years of life has been climbing , ” he said .
Olfson and Marcus said out - of - pocket costs for psychotherapy and lower insurance coverage for such visits may have driven patients away from seeing therapists in favor of an easy - to - prescribe pill .
The rise in antidepressant prescriptions also is seen despite a series of public health warnings on use of antidepressant drugs beginning in 2003 after clinical trials showed they increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and teens .
In February 2005 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added its strongest warning , a so - called black box , on the use of all antidepressants in children and teens .
Cardinal Sean Brady has warned Irish legislators that they are directly challenging the Republic ’s constitutional protection for the family and leaving registrars of marriage open to prosecution by planning to introduce civil partnership for gay and lesbian couples .
He said the people of Ireland would soon have to choose to “ stand clearly on the side of Christ or depart from him ” .
The cardinal claimed that “ what the government is planning will hugely change people 's concept of the family .
Nevertheless , marriage between a man and a woman will always remain the ideal environment in which to raise children .
“ Any government that undermines such an environment could hardly be said to be promoting the common good ” .
He said that during the next Dail term politicians and citizens will be asked to make a fundamental choice about the future of marriage and the family in Ireland .
“ They will be asked to approve legislation and policy which , among other things , will make same - sex partnerships equal in status to marriage , with the same benefits in tax and welfare as married couples — the only difference being the right to adopt — will give cohabiting same - sex , or opposite - sex , partners the same status as marriage , after they have lived together for a short period , will remove ' marital status ' from key legislation and public documentation and replace it with ' civil status ' , thus directly challenging the constitutional recognition that marriage is ' a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights , antecedent and superior to all positive law ' . ”
Cardinal Brady claimed that any Registrar of Marriage who , in conscience , declines to officiate at same - sex ' weddings ' , will be guilty of an offence .

I 've never believed the argument that web applications will completely replace native client - side applications .
The last time someone said that , I held up my Android phone and said " This is a pervasive Internet device .
I use several applications regularly .
The only native web application I use is a web browser . "
Maybe I 'm an old dinosaur well before my time , but I 'm happy writing these posts in Vim ( with copious macros and customizations ) through It 's All Text !.
I do n't mind using Git from the command line , and I think ctags is still one of the most useful IDE inventions .
That does n't mean I reject the billion or so devices that make up the Internet , nor all of the information they contain , nor the services they provide .

A Modern Perl Identi.ca / Twitter CLI
Twitter may be a morass of uselessness which all too often proves the existence of sewers upstream of the collective stream of consciousness , but in between all of the " lollers " and " RT RT RT lollers cat falling down video ! ! " sometimes it's a good way to pass on lightweight , transient information to people who might care .
I 've used Identi.ca for a year now .
As part of marketing my business , I set up a couple of accounts to which I publish notifications about the fiction and non-fiction publishing work we do .
If I edit a chapter in an upcoming novel we 've announced , I can send out a short notice to anyone following that novel 's progress .
The same goes for a book .
It 's easy , it 's quick , it 's non-intrusive , and people really do seem to follow this information .
( Would n't you like to know how far away is the next book from your favorite author ?
Still waiting for that seventh Zelazny Amber story .... )
Setting all of this up for multiple books and multiple accounts could be tricky .
I could log into Identi.ca manually every time I want to post an update ( maybe a couple of times a day ) .
I have to manage several user names and passwords .
What could be a 15 - second update when it 's fresh in my mind could take several times that long , and I would n't do it .
That 's why I have a decent shell and modern Perl .
I wrote a proof of concept in ten minutes using Net : : Identica ; all hail Perl and the author :
#!/usr /bin/perl use Modern :: Perl ; use Net :: Identica ; use File :: Temp ' tempfile ' ; sub main { my ( $username , $ pass , $ message ) = @ARGV ; do { $ message = get_message ( $ message ) ; } until ( $ message && length ( $ message ) <= 140 ) ; post ( $ username , $ pass , $ message ) ; } sub get_message { my $ message = shift ; my ( $fh , $ filename ) = tempfile ( ) ; print { $ fh} $ message if $ message ; system ( $ ENV{EDITOR} , $ filename ) ; seek $ fh , 0 , 0 ; exit if eof $ fh ; return do { local $/ = < $ fh > } ; } sub post { my ( $username , $ pass , $ message ) = @_ ; say " [ $ message ] " ; my $ ni = Net : : Identica -> new ( legacy => 0 , username => $ username , password => $ pass , ) ; $ ni ->update ( $ message ) ; } main ( ) ;
I 've highlighted the most interesting line .
The program takes three arguments , a username , a password , and an optional message to post .
The emboldened line launches ( for me ) Vim on a temporary file containing the message .
If there 's no message , I can write one .
If there is a message , I can edit it .
When I save the file , the program immediately posts it to Identi.ca , with the given username and password .
It 's easy to create bash shell aliases to customize the behavior further .
I have a file called ~/.alias , which can contain , for example :
alias gigdent = " perl ~/bin/dentit gigapolis password " alias mpdent= " perl ~ /bin/ dentit modern_perl password "
For every new project I start , I can create a new account and shell alias .
Then I only have to remember the name of the alias to write a status update .
50 generously - spaced lines of modern Perl code and a bit of shell glue later , I can get my work done with little fuss and even less cognitive overhead from task - switching .
Maybe it 's not jaw - droppingly amazing like rounded corners on a Web 2.0 startup written by skinny - jeans hipsters with deliberately messy hair and flipflops , but it helps gets my work done and it took longer to write this post than to write the code .
I 'll call that a Perl success story any day .
Where ’s the Hyperinflation ?
When the unaccountable , secretive arm of the banking industry known as the Federal Reserve started lending itself ( the banking industry ) billions of newly invented dollars , late last year , responsible people all over America were horrified .
Some of the soundest economic minds even started predicting “ hyperinflation ” .
Well , it ’s been three quarters , now … soon it ’ll be a year .
“ Where , ” other people are saying , “ oh where is that oh - so - scary hyperinflation ? ”
The answer comes in several parts :
What is Hyperinflation ?
Hyperinflation is a specific thing .
It ’s not the three percent inflation we normally “ enjoy ” , any more than it ’s a flavor of cream pie .
We must define what it is , in order to know if it happens .
What Causes Hyperinflation ?
Having defined it , we need to know if the things that cause it are happening .
The Fed has printed new money for nearly 100 years , never with hyperinflation .
Is what happened recently sufficient to change that ?
How Long Would it Take ?
Is it too late ?
It ’s been nine months ; are we safe ?
Well , Let ’s See
What is hyperinflation ?
Well , “ inflation ” is when you increase the amount of money , or the supply of it compared to the demand for goods in society … but when non-economists say “ inflation ” , they usually mean “ prices go up ” .
And so “ hyperinflation ” is just “ prices going up really , really fast ” .
The amount necessary to count is generally said to be “ 100 % per year for three years ” , for long - term hyperinflation , or else “ 50 % per month ” for short - term hyperinflation .
The most inflation we ’ve ever suffered , in the 1970s , was less than 14 % per year .
Normally , it ’s between 2 % and 3 % .
Right now , prices are going DOWN most months , not up .
There is n’t even price stability now , much less price inflation .
But why would prices be going up OR down , in an unhealthy way ?
Super - quick history :
Almost exactly 100 years ago , in 1907 , the US suffered yet another in a long series of destructive depressions and panics , generally caused by money shortages creating runs on banks , price failures , stock market crashes , et cetera .
But this one was stopped dead in its tracks by a group of wealthy entrepreneurs who made very short - term loans to various financial groups , allowing banks to pay off depositors , et cetera .
The result was the downturn cut short , never becoming a full - blown depression .
A brilliant lesson was about to be learned , but unfortunately government prevented that .
Instead of a newish industry of short - term finance lenders / insurers springing up , the Federal Government announced it was going to act in that role , from now on .
It created the Federal Reserve , which would use its coercive power to print imaginary new money to lend to financial institutions in times of crisis .
( Sadly , it did the opposite ; it lent out newly minted money in good times , but tended to cut it off whenever there was a financial panic , which was the only time it was supposed to lend in the first place … this is part of what triggered the start of the Great Depression in 1929 )
Well , the Fed is a whole other discussion , of course , so we ’re going to skip ahead , now
Today :
So instead of lending out money during a crisis , the Federal Reserve increases the amount of money a few percent per year , lending it out in good times .
This is part of why we have ( usually moderate ) inflation … the amount of money increases faster than the demand for goods , so there ’s more money to spend than stuff to buy , and prices increase .
But from 2004 through 2008 , the Fed did something it had n’t done since 1938 when we went off the Gold Standard :
It started DECREASING money supply :
Notice that the most important line , the red M1 , goes below zero ( to shrinking money ) , and stays negative longer than it had been at any but one time in fifty years .
And currency ( actual paper money ) falls lower than ANY time in that span .
This is because M3 , which includes money in foreign banks , was going up so quickly : Money was fleeing the US because of our wars , and the 700 % inflated oil prices , and our billions in new foreign aid .
We would buy oil that should have cost a few hundred billion , but instead cost us trillions , and send the money for that oil to Saudi Arabia , and other foreign countries .
Over the course of four years , this added up to a shortfall of between two and three trillion dollars in the domestic US economy .
That money was all overseas .
Here comes deflation
This did n’t even leave enough money to pay for our normal goods , much less allow the economy to grow …plus , of course , the cost of making things was shooting up from the high oil prices , as all things require energy , while there was LESS money to cover that universal new expense .
The result ?
Deflation , and therefore a money shortage , that led to the economic depression starting in 2008 .
There was not enough money to run the economy , so prices began FALLING , the US suffering what appeared to be a “ loss ” of about three trillion dollars .
This was simply the change in prices to represent the trillions missing because of M1 shrinking for four years .
The Federal Reserve ’s response ?
It actually CUT its offered money supply in 2008 , by refusing to lend to banks suffering financial trauma…once again failing to act in its sole official role of “ lender of last resort ” as in 1907 .
But it could n’t keep that up , because deflation destroys a market economy .
So , once this cutting off of emergency money caused the banks to start failing , the Fed belatedly loosened its purse strings :
It lend out over two trillion dollars to financial institutions , in just a few months .
Is It Enough to be Hyper ?
Now if the Fed did this all the time , lending out a trillion dollars each month when the economy was just fine , we might really have hyperinflation .
But , instead , the Fed did this ONE TIME , starting from a money deficit of three trillion dollars .
So , in fact , what it did was produce enough new money to , hopefully , make up for the money shortage .
Being down trillions of dollars , then adding two trillion , could not make prices double every year .
Or even once .
Even if there had been no shortage , two trillion is not enough to increase prices by 50 % every month , nor 100 % every year , because it is a fraction of the many trillions of dollars in our economy , and only happened one time .
Hyperinflation requires more money to be printed even as prices are going through the roof , so that people come to expect it and overprice things ahead of time .
But , even if it had been enough to cause hyperinflation , there ’s one last big factor :
Time delay .
How Long ?
We ca n’t guarantee that there will be NO backlash from this infusion of money , until about 18 months have passed .
Historically , changes in money supply take between 6 and 18 months to hit prices in an economy .
It has to gradually spread throughout the system , being spent , invested , and saved over and again , until its full impact is felt and absorbed .
So we have until mid 2010 to see whether there are SOME effects from the unhealthy throwing of two trillion unearned dollars at our socialized banking institutions .
What About Government Spending ?
For better or worse , it is actually impossible for government spending to “ stimulate ” an economy , at all .
And since the current “ stimulus packages ” are financed by bonds and deficit , not the printing of money , they are actually DE - Flationary .
Read the above link , to understand exactly why these things are so .
Sorry , Not Even Close
But , ultimately , whatever backlash there is , it can not be hyperinflation .
With an economy of , depending on how you count , eight to twelve trillion dollars , you ca n’t make prices jump even 50 % , even for ONE month ( and it must keep happening , to be hyper ) , by printing two trillion new dollars .
Not even if there were not already deflation to counter .

The world has been riveted by Bill Clinton ’s dramatic rescue of two journalistic damsels from the clutches of Kim Jong Il , the diabolical and unpredictable North Korean despot .
One cannot help but be relieved for the two women and their families and touched by the moving family reunions .
Yet even though the happy outcome tugs at our sentimental side , we should be asking whether the rescue was good public policy .
Several hard questions arise :
1 . Is the U.S. government responsible for bailing out American journalists , business people , or tourists who do stupid or risky things in dangerous and autocratic foreign countries ?
Although Bill Clinton is a private citizen , he is a former president and his wife Hillary is the nation ’s secretary of state and top diplomat .
Therefore , any visit by Bill Clinton had the tacit approval of the Obama administration , and everyone knew it .
The U.S. government has been bailing out a lot of people lately , but these journalists knew that doing a story about human trafficking in autocratic North Korea was very risky .
Similarly , several hikers carelessly strayed over the Kurdistan - Iran border into Iran and have been detained .
Although the families of all these people understandably want the U.S. government to do everything possible to get them back , and the U.S. government may have a responsibility to at least make diplomatic approaches to do so , should it be expected to pay ransom — in the case of the journalists , a coveted visit by an charismatic former president ?
And where does the government ’s responsibility end ?
Someday , such inflated expectations of the government ’s role could allow such irresponsible private hostages to drag the United States into a needless war .
2 . Is it wise to reward bad behavior by any cantankerous regime , especially one with a track record like North Korea ’s in which it regularly acts obnoxiously to win more favors from the United States and its neighbors ?
North Korea ’s bizarre leader has recently fired off missiles and conducted a second nuclear test to test the new Obama administration and enhance his bargaining position in the world ’s attempt to negotiate away the regime ’s nuclear weapons program .
Then to win the release of the journalists , Kim specifically demanded and received a prestigious visit by Clinton .
Next , he will probably be looking to receive even more in exchange for pardoning and setting the journalists free and will be irate if he does n’t get it .
Any child psychologist will tell you that rewarding a child ’s tantrum will only cause more tantrums .
For some time under previous administrations , including that of George W. Bush and Clinton himself , the U.S. has been reinforcing bad behavior on the part of Kim by giving North Korea more attention and aid whenever the country misbehaves .
Such pay offs only increase future bad behavior to get more goodies from the West .
3 . What policy should the U.S. pursue toward North Korea ?
All of this does n’t mean we need to assume a belligerent policy toward North Korea — as advocated by neoconservatives — because backing a paranoid , nuclear - armed country into a corner is dangerous .
A child psychologist would recommend rewarding good behavior , while simply ignoring bad behavior .
The U.S. could offer a " grand bargain " of full diplomatic recognition for North Korea and the end of world ostracism through the termination of economic sanctions , all in exchange for elimination of the North ’s nuclear weapons program .
Given the historical track record of the West ’s rewarding North Korean bad behavior , however , this may no longer be a viable option .
Too much water has flowed under the bridge .
Instead , the United States should probably just accept that North Korea will be a nuclear weapons state and focus on deterring the regime from using such weapons against the U.S. — the threat of incineration by the world ’s most powerful nuclear arsenal should suffice — or selling such technology abroad .
Otherwise , treating Kim like a child , the U.S. should simply ignore North Korea and its belligerent posturing .
Eventually , such behavior will likely attenuate .
Doing nothing is doing something and is much better than the ill - advised policy the United States currently has toward North Korea .
Trivia
In September 1981 , a case occurred in Germany , under circumstances quite similar to the Barbara Jane Mackle case : A ten - year - old girl , Ursula Hermann , was buried alive in a box fitted with ventilation , lighting and sanitary systems to be held for ransom .
The girl suffocated in her prison within forty - eight hours of her abduction because autumn leaves had clogged up the ventilation duct .
Twenty seven years later , a couple was arrested and tried for kidnapping and murder on circumstantial evidence .
According to the Daily Mail , the couple were inspired by the scene in which the Scorpio Killer kidnapped a girl and placed her in an underground box .

Queen Cleopatra 's lover , Mark Antony , supported King Herod during the Parthian Wars .
In 37 BC , Herod and Mark Antony 's armies captured Judea , including Jerusalem and the Dead Sea region .
Herod became the puppet King of Judea .
If you look at Dead Sea salt vendors , spas , and cosmetic sellers on the internet , they pretty much all say that Cleopatra went to the Dead Sea and built her own spa there , and was an enthusiastic user of Dead sea salt cosmetics , skin creams , and lotions .
They are all a bit light on actual historical evidence , though .
Cleopatra definitely funded the wars , as Mark Antony 's brother - in - law in Rome , Octavius , kept promising to fund an army but never quite got round to doing it .
But in the reading I 've done on the Parthain War , I 've not seen any reference to Cleopatra 's Dead Sea Spa .
In Plutarch 's Lives , he wrote that Mark Antony sent :
Fonteius Capito to bring Cleopatra into Syria .
To whom at her arrival he made no small or trifling present , Phœnicia , Cœle - Syria , Cyprus , great part of Cilicia , that side of Judæa which produces balm , that part of Arabia where the Nabathæans extend to the outer sea ; profuse gifts which much displeased the Romans .
So it seems that Mark Antony " gave " the area including the Dead Sea to Cleopatra ( nice gift ! ) but does n't say she went there .
In fact , he goes on to say that Mark Antony sent Cleopatra back to Egypt some time later , then joined her there for the winter .
It 's also known that Cleopatra leased the rights to the Dead Sea salt and mineral industries back to the Nabataeans , for 200 silver talents a year ( a vast sum ) .
Nice as it would be to think of this renowned historical beauty at the Dead Sea , until I see some historical reference , the jury 's out as far as I 'm concerned .
The iPhone , iPhone accessories , and iPhone ringtones are all the rage right now , so why not make your own iPhone ringtone ?
With a Mac or Windows PC it ’s pretty straightforward using iTunes , follow these 10 steps and you can easily create your own iPhone Ringtone from whatever song you want .
Note that songs with DRM will not usually work , meaning things purchased from the iTunes Music Store will probably not be able to turn into ringtones if they have DRM protection .
10 Easy Steps to Make your own Custom iPhone Ringtone for Free
1 : Launch iTunes
2 : Find the song that you want to use for your iPhone ringtone , make note of the start and stop times of what you want to be the actual ringtone ( the chorus , or whatever ) .
3 : Control - click ( Mac ) or Right - click ( Windows ) the song you chose and select ‘ Get Info ’
4 : Click the ‘ Options ’ tab and set the start and stop time of your ringtone in the settings below .
Keep the selection at 30 seconds or less .
Click ‘ OK ’ – Note : I suggest making a backup copy of the song so you do n’t accidentally shorten the song itself .
5 : Control - click ( Mac ) or Right - click ( Windows ) the song again and select ‘ Convert Selection to AAC ’ and iTunes will convert the song as another copy in the AAC format .
6 : Now Control - Click or Right - click the ringtone and select ‘ Delete ’ making sure to click on the “ Keep Files ” button
7 : Locate the file you just created .
Typically located in your home directory under Music > iTunes >
iTunes Music and then under the band ’s name , the file you ’re looking for will have an m4a extension
8 : Now replace the ‘ m4a ’ extension of the ringtone file with “ m4r ” , so if the file is named MrRoboto .
m4a the new file will be called MrRoboto . m4r – you ’ll get a warning about changing the file extension time but click “ OK ”
9 : Double click to open the ringtone file you just renamed .
iTunes will automatically add this new ringtone to the Ringtones folder within the application
10 : Finally , connect your iPhone and sync your new ringtone !
You can then select it as any other iPhone ringtone via your iPhone settings .
This method will work in iTunes under Windows or Mac OS X !
It ’s critical to remember that in order for the iPhone ringtone to work , it must have the proper iPhone ringtone extension of “ .m4r ” in use and appended to the filename .
Without the file being an .m4r , iTunes and the iPhone will not recognize the file as a ringtone , and the file will not appear in the iTunes “ Tones ” folder for transferring to your phone .
Update :
If you have upgraded to iTunes 9.1 or later and you are having problems , you will need to make some changes to the preferences in order to convert songs to m4a ringtone format in iTunes 9.1 .
Other than the import settings adjustment to iTunes Preferences , the process is practically identical .
You will still need to create an .m4a file then rename the extension to .m4r for iTunes to recognize it as a ringtone .

Jobs that would be better than mine
I get up after hitting the snooze button a minimum of six times .
I make a coffee , then sit in the shower drinking it and smoking cigarettes until the initial agony of knowing I have to spend another day with my coworkers dissipates .
I generally spend this time trying to calculate the pros and cons of just not turning up .
I know they will bitch but their opinions mean little to anyone so sometimes I just stay in the shower for an hour and then go back to bed .
If I do decide to go in , I sit in an office the size of a wardrobe and temperature of a kiln prostituting myself by spending the day making poor products look appealing so that people will be tricked into buying them .
This pretty much sums up the entire design industry .
Sometimes I grumble and whine out loud so that people think I am working but I will be on the internet instead .
It has lots of things on there I like .
As I am possibly the laziest person I know , the design industry is only field I can survive in .
I would last less than an hour doing manual labour of any form and I often cope on less than two hours sleep a night so anything requiring alertness or intelligence is out of the question .
As is anything requiring personal hygiene .
This leaves either taxi driver or my boss 's position .
As his job role consists only of pretending to talk on the phone , passing blame and downloading pornography , I am more than qualified .
Fortune Cookie Writer
As far as writing jobs go , this would probably be the easiest as the pages are very small .
When I was at school , I had an English teacher named Judith Bowman who would make us read a novel every few weeks and write a two page essay on each .
This would not usually be an issue , as I enjoy reading , but Mrs Bowman loved Agatha Christie novels so would force us to read only these .
As my interest in reading about French inspectors on trains is on equal par with being molested by a drunk uncle , I handed in my two page essay on two pieces of paper measuring two by three centimetres each ( arguing that the size of the two pages had not been indicated at any time ) with the words " Reading the novel Murder on the Orient Express was " on one piece , and " less enjoyable than being molested by a drunk uncle . " on the other .
This did not go down as well as might have been expected and I was forced to re-write the essay which this time I began with " Being forced to read Mrs Bowman 's own personal preferences in literature is less enjoyable than being molested by a drunk uncle which is why I chose to read Enders Game by Orson Scott Card instead . "
If I was a professional fortune cookie writer , amongst the standard messages of promised hope and riches , I would include statements such as " I am sending you this message from the future , robots will take over in four days , leave the city immediately . " and " Judith Bowman has anal warts " .
Wind Turbine Technician ( specialising in aerotechatrons )
Everyone loves wind turbines because they are so big and white and symbolise clean , renewable energy and environmental responsibility .
I knew a girl once who had a poster of one on her wall and when I asked if she was an evironmentalist she answered " no , I just like them " which is fair enough .
Everyone does .
I have never heard anyone say " God I hate wind turbines " so if my business card said Wind Turbine Technician rather than Graphic Designer , I would probably receive the pity look a lot less .
The only problem is that I would probably have to pretend to care about the environment .
There is an old saying that " this is not our planet , we are just looking after it for our children " but in thirty years when my offspring complains that we trashed the planet , I will say " That 's what you get for all the crap Fathers day presents . "
Park Ranger
Sometimes when I am at work and I have had enough of moving pixels around the screen , I will grab my keys and say " I have to go to a client meeting , I will be back in an hour " and run out the door before anybody can question who the meeting is with .
Then I go shopping for cleaning products or to a movie .
If I was a park ranger I would tell everyone that I had a meeting with a bear or something then go for a canoe ride or trap squirrels .
Drug Dealer
It would seem to me that being paid to provide something that makes people happy would be one of the most satisfying professions available .
A while back , my mother visited a Tasmanian region where they grow opium poppies for medicinal puposes and brought me back me a seed she had ' found ' .
I planted it in my front yard and several weeks later it bloomed .
Having read L.Ron Hubbard 's Mission Earth series which included detailed instructions on processing opium , I used a scalpel to cut lines in the black centre then dried the milky substance resulting in about half a teaspoon of white powder .
That night , my friend Kas came over to my place with his entire CD collection to listen to and we decided to try some of the powder .
A short time later , with the live version of Gary Numan 's Down in the Park playing on loop , we were both standing completely naked in the bathroom shaving our entire bodies following a discussion about how nice it would be to have smooth skin like an eel .
I do not recall much of the rest of the evening but I awoke to find myself wearing a pillow case with holes cut out for my arms as a shirt and Kas asleep on the sofa wearing the same plus 3D glasses .
Before waking and leaving later that afternoon , Kas swapped me his entire CD collection for the remainder of the powder , which proves there is a market .
New Zealand Tourism Operator
This would give me plenty of spare time as nobody wants to go there .
Parking Inspector
Although there would obviously be many benefits to being a parking inspector , the knowledge that every day I would be making the world a better place would be the most satisfying aspect .
They would try to pay me and I would put my hand up and say " No , the important contribution I make to society is payment enough . "
Accident Claim Investigator
Having a job where people tell you a story and you say " I do n't think so " seems like it would be a lot of fun .
I have been in a total of three vehicle accidents .
The first occured when I was driving on a dirt road in the rain , lost control and hit a cow .
The second involved forgetting to set the handbrake and a river .
The third and most recent accident occured while driving home from my friend Simon 's place .
While at his house for a coffee , I attached a black rubber spider on string to the inside of his cupboard with sticky tape so that the next time he opened it to grab a coffee mug , the spider swung out at him .
The reaction was more than expected as Simon screamed , threw himself backwards onto the floor and actually sobbed a little .
Later that afternoon as I was driving home , I lowered the sun visor and the rubber spider , which Simon had placed there in what he felt was appropriate retaliation , fell forward onto my lap .
My immediate reaction was to press hard on the brake and turn the steering wheel which sent the vehicle into a spin before clipping a white Mercedes and ending up in an elderly man 's front hedge .
On all three occasions I have been assigned an accident claim investigator .
Forest Fire Lookout
As far as I can tell , the position consists entirely of sitting in a very tall cubby house looking out the window .
As you would be able to see for miles around and tell if anyone was coming , you could do anything you wanted in between reporting over the radio that you have not seen any forest fires yet .
I would probably watch a lot of pornography and do drugs .
When I was about ten , a friend of mine and I built a cubby house in the tallest tree in our backyard using wooden planks stolen from the neighbours fence .
Late one evening , while my parents were at a marriage councelling session , I was in the cubby house ( as it overlooked the neighbour 's bedroom ) when a strong breeze caused the cubby house to collapse and pin me between the floor and a fallen wall .
Unable to call out or move due to the crushing weight , I remained there the entire night , falling asleep at one point but waking when it started to rain , before finally being rescued the next day when the neighbour let his cat out and heard my soft cries for help .
While I was at the hospital being checked over , the neighbour took back his wooden planks .
World Nut Daily reports that Sean Hannity is going to Run for President .
WASHINGTON – Talk - show host Sean Hannity , a vocal opponent of Barack Obama 's policies , said today he would not rule out a bid for the presidency in 2012 .
Egged on by radio colleague Bill Cunningham , Hannity said he would consider entering the front lines of the political fray if God directs him .
" I 've never made a decision in my life without – whatever destiny God has you 've got to fulfill it , " he said .
" I 'm not sure that 's my destiny . "
God always intended for Hannity to be a douchebag , and he 's fulfilled that destiny .
So you never know .
Besides , as News Max points out ,
Hannity would make a formidable candidate , with the likability of Reagan , good looks and strong convictions .
He 's also a polished communicator and knows the issues inside out .
Hee hee .
But the best part is this :
Later in the program , a member of the audience asked what the host thought of a Hannity - Palin ticket .
The studio audience erupted in applause .
Hannity asked : " Would any of you really want me to run ? "
Loud applause followed .
Hannity then asked , " How about I just stay on the radio ? "
No applause .
Even these idiots do n't want him to stay on the radio .
Or not .
Anyhow , my first thought was , why would Hannity leave his gig where he gets rich off being totally irresponsible ?
And he probably wo n't .
But my second thought was , you know , a Hannity / Palin ticket probably would be able to take the GOP nomination .
And , since I 'm in a really bad mood about politics right now , I suppose that just might be the fucking government America deserves .
Depending on your league 's scoring system , a poor defense could mean the difference between a win and a loss .
In two of the leagues that I 'll be in for 2009 , a poor defensive outing can easily spell L - O - S - S. Starting a weak defense could bring you - 10 or - 15 points which can negate a strong performance from some of your studs .
Looking back at the Nerd 's 2008 rankings showed what a difficult year it was in predicting defensive performances .
I like 2009 's consensus and I think there will be a few surprises this year .
Here 's what the experts are thinking for 2009 .
Top 10 Fantasy Football Defenses
1. Pittsburgh Steelers
Is there another defense in the NFL as scarily good as Pittsburgh ?
The Steelers have virtually all of their players back led by Palumalu , Woodley , Hampton , and Harrison .
They were the 2nd highest scoring defense last year and allowed the fewest points of all teams .
It 's hard to argue against the Steelers being # 1 in 2009 .
2. New York Giants
Osi Umenyiora is back and the Giants have depth galore at the various defensive positions .
That 's a good thing .
Good enough that the consensus is that they 'll outperform the Ravens and Titans even though those two teams outscored the Giants in 2008 .
The Giants have brought in some new talent this year which should improve upon an already impressive team .
Boley , Brown , Canty , and Bernard are calling New York home this year and should help convince you to take NY when it 's time to draft a defense .
3 Baltimore Ravens
Baltimore lost some great players this offseason , however Ray Lewis , Ed Reed and Terrell Suggs are gearing up to lead the Ravens in 2009 .
The Steelers may have allowed the fewest points among all DEF 's last year , but Baltimore outscored them in fantasy points ( standard scoring ) .
The biggest reason for the Ravens to come in at # 3 in the consensus rankings is due to their schedule .
Their 2009 schedule is a bit harder than last year 's , but they 'll still keep points off the board while putting up some of their own .
4 Minnesota Vikings
You 'll have a difficult time arguing against the superior line in Minnesota .
Jared Allen along with Pat and Kevin Williams can not only stop the run , but they 'll grab a number of sacks along the way .
The question in Minnesota is n't can they stop the run , it 's can they stop the pass ?
Darren Sharper fizzled last year and the Vikings wo n't have him on the field this year .
If you liked the Vikings last year , you 'll like them again .
I 'm expecting only a slight decline in their fantasy production .
5 Philadelphia Eagles
The Eagles blitz and blitz and blitz .
In fact , they finished 3rd in sacks last year .
Unfortunately ( or fortunately ) there 's a new cast of characters in Philly .
The secondary may struggle from time to time , but the front line will make up for that .
Oh yeah , they still have Asante Samuel .
6 New England Patriots
Even though the Patriot 's defense did n't come close to expectations last year , they 've made enough moves to solidify their defense ensuring a strong 2009 .
Jerod Mayo has a year under his belt and the New England offense should be very , very solid .
7 Tennessee Titans
I 'll admit that I thought I 'd see Tennesse in the Top 5 and perhaps the Top 3 so I was a bit surprised by their # 7 billing .
I 'd personally take the Titans ahead of Minnesota , Philly , and New England .
Here 's why : Even though they lost Albert Haynesworth , they basically retained everyone else .
The Titans had more turnovers than anyone else last year and were ended last season with the 2nd most fantasy points .
They no longer have the depth I 'd like to see , so as long as they stay healthy , they 're a stellar fantasy option .
8 New York Jets
The Jets D came out of hibernation last year to the delight of many fantasy owners .
Like a bear waking up from a long winter 's nap , the Jets will come out in 2009 very , very hungry .
This is an aggressive team and blitzing attacks should be anticipated by opposing offenses .
Calvin
Pace will miss the first four games , but there are big names to pick up any temporary slack .
How about Revis , Sheppard , Ellis , Jenkins , and Harris ?
I think the Jets will put a smile on many fantasy faces this year .
9 Chicago Bears
I 'm not completely sold on the Bears this year and that 's not because I 'm a Packer fan .
The once mighty Bears have n't shown that they 're a Top 10 Defense and I can't find many reasons to believe that they will in 2009 .
The secondary is suspect and they do n't play with any consistent purpose .
Urlacher and Briggs are still very talented but they 're not performing very well .
I find myself disagreeing with the Nerd on the # 9 ranking considering the fact that the Bears could n't find their way into the top half of the league in points and yards allowed last year .
Do n't get me wrong .
The Bears D is n't bad .
It just is n't worthy of a # 9 ranking .
10 Dallas Cowboys
DeMarcus
Ware leads a good Cowboys team back onto the field .
Even without problematic Pacman Jones and Tank Johnson , Dallas still has a strong team overall .
The secondary will get burned again like 2008 , but the front line will record a ton of sacks .
Beyond the Top 10
12 Green Bay Packers
It 's difficult to be born in and live in Wisconsin and not be a Packer fan .
Do n't let my love for this team take away anything from the Packer 's 2009 defensive capabilities .
Do n't let that interfere with my prediction that the Packers will be the Super Sleeper Defense of 2009 .
With the new 3 - 4 defense implemented by new coordinator Dom Capers , they 've looked incredible during the pre-season .
I do n't care for white - haired - owl - face ( aka Ted Thompson ) , but I do like the B.J. Raji pick .
Raji will go toe to toe with some of the best backs in the league and stop them short .
Barnett is back and AJ Hawk completes this dynamic duo .
Opposing runners will find it difficult to get through the line , but if they do , they 'll find a stone wall with these two .
Aaron Kampman is one of the hardest working defensive players in the NFL and he 's doing very well in the 3 - 4 transition .
I also like Charles Woodson and Al Harris .
These veterans are just as good today as they have been in years past .
The Pack is back !
14 Miami Dolphins
I firmly believe that the Dolphins could be ranked higher than 14 if their schedule was as attractive as last year .
Unfortunately , that 's not the case .
For Miami fans , you 've still got Jason Taylor and the awesome Joey Porter .
Porter provided 17.5 sacks in 2008 which was good enough for 2nd in the NFL .
Expect another solid year out of the Fins .
Wrapping it up
Steer clear of the following teams .
These are the kinds of teams that will happily give you negative points should your league allow for that type of scoring .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again .
The Raiders should bring back Bo Jackson just so they can start looking like an NFL team again .
The Oakland Defense ( ranked # 25 ) has one good stud .
Nnamdi Asomugha is simply phenomenal , but he can't do everything for them .
Even the worst rushing teams in the league do n't fear the Raiders .
Oakland gave up more than 150 yards to opposing rushers last year .
Oh how I love to see my fantasy players facing Oakland .
The Broncos ( ranked # 26 ) are the NFL 's version of a soap opera ( Minnesota 's soap opera is on ESPN ) .
I relish my fantasy QB 's facing the porous Bronco 's secondary .
Denver can't stop the run and you can drive a truck through their secondary which means lots of fantasy points for the offense !
The Bronco 's offense has the ability to make the team shine , but the defense keeps the shine to an ugly dull .
I ( and millions of other fantasy players ) actually enjoy the fact that the Saints ' defense ( ranked # 27 ) is poor .
I would n't ever , ever , ever start the New Orleans defense , but that does n't make me love them any less .
It 's the defense that makes the offense such a fantasy scoring machine .
When the Saints are behind , they have to throw .
When they have to throw , Drew Brees becomes the go - to man .
When Brees takes charge , the offense provides you and I with all the points we can handle !
There 's one thing in common with the bottom five teams on the Fantasy Football Nerd 's defensive rankings : they all are so bad that they do n't warrant even a bench spot on your fantasy team .
The Browns , Bengals , Rams , Chiefs , and the 0 - 16 Lions are offensive meals .
Do n't let me catch you with any of them on your teams . :-)

One of the most fundamental principles of is that women are much more selective than men in their mate choice .
Because women pay far greater reproductive costs by making the wrong choice , women have been designed by evolution to be more cautious and choosier than men in mate selection .
Hence the “ coy ” female , and the sexually aggressive male , in every human society ever found ( as well as in most other mammalian species ) .
In a forthcoming article in Psychological Science , however , Eli J. Finkel and Paul Eastwick of Northwestern University have overturned this long - standing consensus in evolutionary psychology and shown that , under some circumstances , women can be just as aggressive as men , or men can be just as coy as women , in mate selection .
Finkel and Eastwick , known to PT blog readers as The Attractionologists , employ the popular speed - dating format in their study of mate selection , as do many experimental psychologists today .
They knew that , in these speed - dating events , men are far less selective than women in their mate choice ; after meeting all of the potential dates , men check “ yes ” for a far larger number of women ( indicating their desire to see them again ) than women do for men .
This is not surprising , as it mirrors most real - life dating situations where men come on to women far more frequently and aggressively than women come on to men .
The genius of Finkel and Eastwick began when they made one seemingly minor , almost irrelevant observation .
In all the speed - dating events ( both commercial and scientific ) , all the women remain seated at their respective tables , while men go around the room to meet each woman at her table at the beginning of their brief “ date . ”
According to one executive of a speed - dating service quoted in Finkel and Eastwick ’s article , this is a practical decision .
Women typically carry more things with them ( such as a purse and pieces of clothing ) than men do , so it is physically easier for men to go around the room quickly than it is for women .
For this reason , the format where women remain seated and men go around the room has become universal in all speed - dating events .
Finkel and Eastwick wondered , “ What if we changed that ?
What happens if we reverse the arrangement , and have men seated at their tables while women go around the room meeting men at their tables for their brief dates ? ”
So they went about to see what happens if the universal institutional arrangement is reversed .
In their experiment , they hosted 15 heterosexual speed - dating events , with about 12 men and 12 women for each event .
In eight of them , men rotated among women while women remained seated ( in the manner of universally observed speed - dating format ) , and in the other seven , women rotated among men while men remained seated .
Everything else was held constant between the two conditions .
What they discovered was truly astonishing .
In the traditional “ men rotate , women sit ” arrangement , men were significantly less selective in their mate choice ; they checked “ yes ” for a larger number of women than women did for men , and they experienced greater sexual and romantic chemistry with the women than women did with men .
This is not at all surprising , as it is what evolutionary psychology would predict and it is what we normally observe in real life ( less selective , more aggressive men , and choosier and more coy women ) .
In sharp contrast , in the novel “ women rotate , men sit ” arrangement , women were just as aggressive and , as a result , less selective , as men were in their mate choice ; they checked as many “ yeses ” for men as men did for women , and they experienced as much sexual attraction and romantic chemistry for the men as men did for women .
Finkel and Eastwick explain the reversal of the pattern with their embodied hypothesis .
Research on embodied cognition has uncovered some pretty interesting ( if wholly mysterious ) findings .
For example , seated experimental subjects who place their palms on the bottom of a table and press up ( a gesture associated with approach ) rate neutral Chinese ideographs as more appealing than those who place their palms on the top of the table and press down ( a gesture associated with avoidance ) .
In other words , because they view the ideographs while they are engaged in the approaching gesture , they come to view them more positively .
Similarly , non -black participants who have been trained to pull a joystick toward themselves ( a gesture associated with approach ) when a picture of a black person appears subliminally on a computer screen and to push the joystick away from themselves ( a gesture associated with avoidance ) when a picture of a white person appears , subsequently exhibit more positive attitudes toward blacks and behave more warmly toward them than do non-black participants who perform either the opposite joystick task or a side - to - side ( neutral ) joystick task .
Finkel and Eastwick reason similarly to explain their findings .
The mere act of physically approaching their potential romantic partner , behavior far more typical of men than women , makes people more confident and increases their attraction to their potential partner .
In other words , by acting more like men ( by physically approaching their dates ) , they begin to think more like them as well ( by being more confident , aggressive , and less selective ) .
In support of their embodied cognition hypothesis , Finkel and Eastwick show that , whether they are men or women , “ rotators , ” who approach their dates , have greater than “ sitters , ” who are approached , and once they statistically control for self - confidence , the institutional arrangement ( whether men or women rotate ) ceases to have any effect on whether men or women were more selective .
Finkel and Eastwick ’s finding in their experiment is truly stunning and potentially devastating for evolutionary psychology .
Women ’s greater selectivity in mate choice ultimately stems from the sexual asymmetry in reproductive biology , which has remained constant for millions of years , long before we were humans or even apes .
Simply put , women are choosier than men in mate choice because they are the ones who get and must nurse the offspring for years afterwards .
That has always been the case , without exception , and that is why the differences in mate selectivity are deeply genetically encoded in male and female human nature , which is why it is culturally universal .
How can evolutionary psychology account for Finkel and Eastwick ’s novel findings ?
Or do they spell the end of evolutionary psychology ?
Is evolutionary psychology dead ?
Should I quit being an evolutionary psychologist and get a real job , perhaps working for my uncle ’s bakery in Fresno ?
Stay tuned ....
P.S. Heartfelt thanks to Eli J. Finkel and Paul Eastwick for the discussion about their article , and , especially , for allowing me to talk about it in my blog rather than insisting on doing so themselves in theirs .
I was among friends the other night , listening to a doctor go off about how health care in this country costs so much because Americans are fat .
If she had to see one more obese mother feed her already - overweight eight - year - old child Cheetos for breakfast , this doctor said , she was going to scream .
Want to know why we ’re a nation of arthritis - and diabetes - prone heart - attack and stroke victims ?
she asked .
Just think about all that extra weight our bodies were never meant to carry around .
I was attracted to this concept of fat - as - the - problem ; I like simple explanations .
So I was quite happy — well , maybe happy is n’t exactly the right word — to come across some data to back up that doctor ’s claim .
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) , a division of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , recently put out this research note ( PDF ) , demonstrating that in recent years health care costs for overweight and obese people have escalated much faster than for the rest of us .
This is something to think about , considering that out of 216.8 million American adults , 58.9 million of us are obese ( that ’s 27 % ) and 75.7 million of us are overweight ( another 35 % ) .
Oh , and we ’re quickly getting fatter .
We added 10 million more obese people just between 2001 and 2006 .
The numbers the AHRQ gives are these :
Between 2001 and 2006 , average health care expenditure for normal weight people increased from $ 2,607 to $ 3,315 — a 27 % gain .
For overweight people , the average cost rose from $ 2,792 to $ 3,636 — an increase of 30 % .
And for obese people , the average amount paid increased from $ 3,458 to $ 5,148 — a gain of 49 % .
The AHRQ defines all those “ weight ” categories in terms of body - mass index , but I wo n’t get into that here .
We all probably have an intuitive understanding of normal , overweight and obese .
And now we also all have an understanding of how much those various conditions cost in terms of health care .
Though I should point out that the AHRQ ’s expenditure amounts are in nominal dollars .
The relationship between normal , overweight and obese holds either way , but if you want to know how much more expensive health care is in terms of what else you might buy with that money , you should adjust for inflation .
I did that , putting everything into 2006 dollars : costs for normal - weight people have jumped by 11 % , for overweight people by 14 % and for the obese by 31 % .

( CNN ) --
If you 're working in a stressful environment , you and your colleagues may be communicating tension to one another without even realizing it .
Effects shown in the study may help people understand situations such as stressful offices , researchers said .
A new study published in the online journal PLoS
One reveals changes in brain activity when people are exposed to sweat from others who have been in a stressful situation .
Researchers found that people may become more alert to potential threats when inhaling this " stress " sweat .
" The results suggest that we can detect others ' stress just by breathing in their sweat , " said Lilianne Mujica - Parodi , assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Stony Brook University in New York and lead author of the study , in an e-mail .
Researchers took sweat samples from 144 people who had put themselves in the somewhat stressful situation of tandem skydiving for the first time .
Each participant was strapped to an expert skydiver , and each pair jumped from 13,000 feet .
Control samples were taken from people who had run on a treadmill .
In the first trial , sweat samples from the experimental and control conditions from 40 donors were given to eight males and eight females while their brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging .
This procedure was repeated with 40 more donors and a group of 16 different participants with the same gender ratio .
Imaging results indicated that the amygdala , an area of the brain associated with emotion , was more active when exposed to the skydivers ' sweat than to the runners ' sweat .
An additional experiment showed that participants could not discriminate between the sweat samples based on smell alone .
Researchers then conducted a behavioral test in which participants separately breathed the " exercise " sweat and the skydiving " stress " sweat while judging the emotions conveyed in pictures of faces on a computer screen .
People tended to discriminate better between neutral and angry faces when exposed to the " stress " sweat .
The results suggested that more activity in the amygdala is associated with more awareness of possible threats , Mujica - Parodi said .
" It would certainly make sense that if others around us are stressed , that we would enhance our vigilance to potential danger , " Mujica - Parodi said .
The study does not , however , prove that the signals from sweat that the participants ' brains responded to are " pheromones , " chemicals found in animals that communicate information and influence responses in behavior and physiology .
Pheromones have been popularized as a factor in sexual desire -- namely , that certain odors that people give off attract potential mates -- but their role in humans is still controversial .
There is no hard evidence that the same kinds of pheromones found in animals also exist in humans , said Charles Wysocki , researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
There are fragrance products marketed as " pheromonal " but which do not actually contain pheromones , he said .
Pheromones in certain animals have been found and classified according to their functions , including sexual attraction and puberty .
Some animals can even learn about each other 's sex , reproductive status , age and dominance status , just by smelling .
In humans , no one has identified analogous chemical compounds that serve as signals or prompt behavior in these ways , Wysocki said .
However , humans may have their own kinds of pheromones .
One of Wysocki's studies showed that when women were exposed to male underarm sweat , they became more relaxed and less tense .
That paper also found that male sweat may affect the length and timing of a woman 's menstrual cycle .
Other studies have concluded that people give off different body odors that correspond to certain emotional situations , but what has n't been shown is whether other people become a little stressed after smelling the body odor from stressed people , Wysocki said .
The Stony Brook study goes in that direction , looking at the brain region that modulates emotion and finding that people responded differently to behavioral tests .
Wysocki questioned the procedures that the Stony Brook study used to isolate the sweat chemicals from participants and whether the actual compound that could have triggered behavioral patterns was preserved .
But Mujica - Parodi said the researchers did not alter the sweat at all , just diluted it with clean water .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Reduce stress and restore harmony
" The reason the sweat did not have odor is that , when you think of ' sweat odor , ' you 're not really smelling the sweat , " she said .
" You 're smelling the bacteria that feed off of it . "
Mujica - Parodi said humans do emit reproductive pheromones , but the extent to which they affect everyday social behavior is not established , causing the debate among scientists , she said .
Research such as this study may help people develop safety measures that take into account how people react to emergency situations : for example , on an airplane or a space shuttle , she said .
They may also provide insight into behavior in stressful office environments and emergency rooms .
One theoretical application of research along this lines would be creating a substance that enhances or maintains vigilance , she said .
This would be useful in people who have to make critical assessments under repetitive or sleep - deprived conditions , Mujica - Parodi said .
But Wysocki noted that the chemical signals animals give off are relatively fleeting .
Thus , this idea could work for " someone who knew that they needed to be alert during a very short episode " -- and that person could perhaps get an effect for 10 or 15 minutes after a snort of this theoretical substance , he said .
" But you would n't want to let a long - haul truck driver try this , " he said .
All About Psychology
I was talking to a friend yesterday who said the reason he has n’t succeeded is because he does n’t have the money to start his own business .
He said , if only he had a good friend who could lend him the money he could succeed ( he may have been referring to me as that “ good friend , ” I do n’t know ) .
But the reality is , you do n’t need lots of money to achieve success .
There are 4 things that you need to succeed , and they do n’t cost anything :
1 . The first thing you need is “ Time ”
With time you can climb mountains , develop a six - pack , break world records , write a bestseller , become rich , or anything else .
Time is far more valuable than money .
You can exchange your time to get money , but you ca n’t exchange your money to get more time .
Time is the first thing you need to succeed , and it ’s free .
2 . The second thing you need are “ Ideas ”
I think about the articles that I write ; everything I write is just an “ idea . ”
There ’s no limit to the number of ideas we can have .
I am inspired to write maybe five or six times a day , I have more inspirational thoughts than I can possibly write about .
Why is this ?
Because there is no shortage in this world ; shortage is only a figment of the imagination .
You know , it ’s an amazing thing ; ideas that are “ free ” can actually make you rich .
Randy Gage said , “ You do n’t have a money shortage , you have an idea shortage . ”
If you wanted to write a bestselling book , all you would need is an “ idea . ”
An idea of what to write about , an idea as to how you could make it unique , an idea as to how you could get a publisher , an idea as to the best way to market it , an idea on a catchy title , an idea on how to get the right person to foreword it .
It ’s all ideas .
Success comes from ideas , not from money .
You need to tap into your limitless river of ideas .
3 . The third thing you need is “ Consistent Action ”
This is where most people have trouble .
Our society has so programmed us with “ get rich quick schemes , ” and “ instant gratification fixes ” that we do n’t understand that some things require consistent action for many years .
Instead of us patiently cultivating the talents that we have , we sell our birthright of success and prosperity for a false hope ; we sell it for fool ’s gold , the false thinking that we can somehow get something for nothing .
Let ’s be clear , becoming a success and fulfilling what ’s on the inside of you is going to take work !
It ’s going to take patience , persistence , faithfulness , faith , dedication , consistency , and determination , when it seems like nothing is working .
But if you ’re consistent , you will succeed .
4 . The fourth thing you need is “ Passion ”
It ’s critical that you pursue your passion .
Firstly because you ’ll be willing to put in the time and dedication to make it a success , and secondly because your passion sparks your creativity and the flow of ideas ; it sparks ideas that are unique , ideas that people will gladly pay to see manifested .
Just like a seed , you have everything you need on the inside of you to succeed , you just need to be planted in the right soil and cultivated .
The soil represents being involved in activities that you ’re passionate about ; the cultivation means doing the hard work which causes success to come .
In conclusion , there are no excuses , everyone has the ability to succeed , so get started today !

Giorgi does n't seem like the sort of man who'd be at the centre of a massive internet meltdown .
When we meet in a trendy Tbilisi nightspot , the unassuming 34 - year - old looks exhausted .
" It 's crazy .
I was on the phone the whole day .
I 'm very tired , " he says .
The last few days have all been crazy for Giorgi .
At 5.30 pm on Thursday he was preparing to add a post to his page on the popular blogging service LiveJournal .
When he was unable to access the site , he tried to post a message on Facebook , telling his friends that there was a problem with his blog .
When that did n't work Giorgi tried his Twitter account , again , to no avail .
Giorgi assumed that there was a problem with the websites , but when he checked his email an hour later , he realised that something was very wrong .
Hundreds of thousands of spam messages had been sent from his gmail account , inviting recipients to visit his blog .
His inbox was being flooded with automated responses – so many that Giorgi was unable to delete them before more arrived .
A group of as - yet unidentified hackers had tried to kick him off the web : he had become the victim of a massive cyber attack , but he was not the only one affected .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The attacks paralysed some of the most popular sites on the global web .
Twitter was overwhelmed by the distributed denial - of - services attacks .
The site 's estimated 10 million users were unable to access it for several hours .
Facebook , which has more than 30 million users , was also affected , as was Google .
But why did the hackers target this slightly bookish economics lecturer ?
While fairly well known among blogging circles in Georgia , Giorgi is no internet sensation .
His blog has about two thousand subscribers , and attracts around two hundred hits a day .
With such a modest following , it seems bizarre that he should be the victim of a massive cyber attack .
Giorgi writes about politics , specifically about Georgian politics , and the relationship between Russia and Georgia .
The post he tried to add on Thursday was going to focus on last year 's Russo–Georgian war , a conflict for which Giorgi squarely blames Russia .
Giorgi thinks it is no coincidence that the cyber attacks hit as Georgia prepared to commemorate the first anniversary of the war .
" Maybe this is the Russians celebrating one year since the war , " he speculates .
" Maybe the hackers want me to stop writing the truth about what happened . "
During that war , cyber attacks that probably originated in Russia blocked service to hundreds of Georgian websites .
Giorgi thinks that something similar might be happening now .
" Only Russia has a big problem with Georgia , and I wrote many things critical about their political system , " Giorgi says .
The sheer scale of the attack leads him to suspect some level of involvement by the Russian security services : " It is not possible that only five or 10 people could shut down LiveJornal , Facebook and Twitter . "
That 's why Giorgi is being cautious about his personal security .
I am the first journalist to meet him face - to - face , and he refuses to give his surname or to be photographed .
" I have a family , a mother , father , wife and children .
I do n't know what will happen tomorrow , " he says .
" If it is possible for them to shut down three huge servers , then anything is possible . "
Though Giorgi lives in Tbilisi , he is originally from Sukhumi , the capital of Georgia 's breakaway province of Abkhazia .
His internet handle is ' Cyxymu ' , a rendering of the Cyrillic name for the city in Latin script .
Along with 250,000 other ethnic Georgian inhabitants of the region , Giorgi fled Abkhazia in 1993 after separatists defeated Georgian forces and declared independence .
For the past four years , Giorgi has run his blog as a place for people with connections to Abkhazia to discuss issues and ideas .
" When I created it , the blog was an open platform for Georgians , Abkhazians , Russians to talk about the future , " he says .
Like almost all of those displaced from Abkhazia , Giorgi passionately believes that his homeland should be re-united with Georgia , and is critical of what he sees as a Russian attempt to annex the region .
Although he has been described in the press as an anti-Russian blogger , he insists this is not the case .
" My first language is Russian .
When I speak Georgian everyone can see .
I am an eighth Russian .
I am not anti-Russian ; I am anti-Putin . "
Giorgi wanted his blog to be a place for people of all political standpoints to exchange views .
" People of all opinions have the right to leave comments on my posts .
This is the plus of the blogosphere . "
But Giorgi 's experience also demonstrates the vulnerability of web 2.0 to attack .
His accounts are still blocked , and he is not hopeful they will come back on line anytime soon .
Nonetheless , there is a sense of cheeky defiance about Giorgi .
" I am proud because these bad people attacked me .
It means I am doing a good thing " he says with a wry smile .
" I will create a new blog in LiveJournal .
If it will be under attack , I 'll create another .
If that is attacked , I 'll create another . "

How do you protect something that has not even been confirmed or verified as being a species ?
History records one major local law against killing Bigfoot .
This one :
Skamania County Ordinance Ordinance No. 69-01
Be it hereby ordained by the Board of County Commissioners of Skamania County : Whereas , there is evidence to indicate the possible existence in Skamania County of a nocturnal primate mammal variously described as an ape - like creature or a sub-species of Homo Sapiens ; and Whereas , both legend and purported recent sightings and spoor support this possibility , and Whereas , this creature is generally and commonly known as a “ Sasquatch ” , “ Yeti ” , “ Bigfoot ” , or “ Giant Hairy ape ” , and has resulted in an influx of scientific investigators as well as casual hunters , many armed with lethal weapons , and Whereas , the absence of specific laws covering the taking of specimens encourages laxity in the use of firearms and other deadly devices and poses a clear and present threat to the safety and well - being of persons living or traveling within the boundaries of Skamania County as well as to the creatures themselves ,
Therefore be it resolved that any premeditated , wilful and wanton slaying of such creature shall be deemed a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ( $ 10,000 ) and / or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed Five ( 5 ) years .
Be it further resolved that the situation existing constitutes an emergency and as such this ordinance is effective immediately .
ADOPTED this 1st day of April , 1969 .
The above ordinance was partially repealed and amended in 1984 by Ordinance 1984 - 2 : The ordinance was amended to make the crime a gross misdemeanor , punishable by up to one year in the county jail and / or a $ 1000 fine .
The new ordinance also created a million - acre refuge within the County .
Board of Commissioners of Skamania County
Of course , having an initial date ( even though it was amended later ) of April Fool ’s Day does not get it much respect .
What firm legal enactments have been made to protect against harming or killing Sasquatch , Nessie , the Abominable Snowmen , and varied cryptids ( other than extra “ creature searching fees ” and / or “ monster hunting ” restrictions ) ?
A second year student at Tulane Law School in New Orleans emails in to me a question for a research paper this individual is writing for their animal law class :
What “ the laws ( or lack of ) protecting cryptids ” exist ?
Well , “ lack of ” is an open - ended research project because that would be an endless list , so let ’s concentrate on any that you know exist or have existed , okay ?
Let ’s help this student out , Cryptomundians , and wake up those brain cells in the middle of the week !

Copper produces blue sparks .
Barium , also used in rat poison and glassmaking , makes green .
A mix of strontium salts , lithium salts and other stuff makes red .

Fireworks for the 4th of July are all about light , color and sound .
But inside , there are some bizarre ingredients , from aluminum to Vaseline and even the stuff of rat poison .
An ancient mix of black powder , essentially gunpowder little changed from its invention in China a millennia ago , gets each rocket in the air by creating pressure in gas trapped in a tube , or mortar .
Two fuses are lit at once : one to ignite the black powder , and another that burns slower , creating a well - timed explosion high in the sky .
The shells of commercial fireworks contain a powdery concoction of chemicals that produce the bangs and the whistles , as well as the pretty effects .
Tubes , hollow spheres , and paper wrappings work as barriers to compartmentalize the effects .
More complicated shells are divided into even more sections to control the timing of secondary explosions .
Big booms and whistles come from flash powder .
Once used for flashes in photography , it is a combination of fuel - like metal and a chemical that feeds oxygen to fire up the fuel .
Different combinations of metals and oxides produce a whole array of sounds .
While ancient Greeks and Romans used bismuth in their beauty care products and coins , chemists add bismuth trioxide to the flash powder to get that crackling sound , dubbed " dragon eggs . "
Ear - splitting whistles take four ingredients , including a food preservative and Vaseline .
The variety of color in a fireworks show depends on the mix of metals .
Copper produces blue sparks .
A mix of strontium salts , lithium salts and other stuff makes red .
Aluminum and titanium put the white stars in an aerial flag .
Barium , also used in rat poison and glass making , makes green .
Calcium burns orange and sodium , yellow .
In recent years , chemists have worked to develop more environmentally friendly fireworks , in part because one ingredient , perchlorate , was found in higher than normal concentrations in a lake where fireworks were shot off , and the chemical is known to cause thyroid problems in humans .
Meanwhile , to light up a red , white , and blue flag , chemists can lay out the emblem 's design on wax paper .
The pattern you see up in the air , whether it's a smiley face or a bow tie , mirrors the arrangement of the metals in the shell .
Because the flag , or any other pattern , shoots out from the shell as a two - dimensional image , people watching the show from different angles can't always tell what they 're looking at .
To make sure everyone has a good view , pyrotechnists tend to send duplicates into the sky at the same time .
You can see fireworks before you hear them because light travels faster than sound .

Easy : The Most Likely Places You 'll Find Free Wi-Fi
You can find some free Wi-Fi love at the local public library , Barnes and Noble , McDonald 's , the airport , university campus , independent coffee shop , or hotel lobby .
Not all airports or hotels or even campuses offer free Wi-Fi though , so give the destination a ring before you hoof it over there only to be disappointed .
( For example , the San Diego airport offers free Wi-Fi as does JetBlue 's T5 in New York 's JFK , but many other airports are pay - for access only .
On the UCSD campus you used to need a password to log on ; now guests can get free access . )

If you 're in a residential area , a little war - driving with the right equipment can turn up an open " linksys " hotspot .
Rather than breaking open your conspicuous laptop , use your Wi-Fi-enabled smartphone or a Wi -Fi scanner keychain to scan and detect networks .
( See the smartphone apps for finding open networks below . )
The serious nerd can even outfit him or herself in a Wi -Fi scanning t- shirt , hat , or pair of sneakers .
( Thanks , adrian_rich ! )
Medium : Employ Wi-Fi Scanner Apps and Look - up Tools
Sometimes the built - in scanner on your smartphone or laptop can be too slow or wo n't give you all the information you want about area networks .
Here are some free apps and tools for scanning and finding free Wi -Fi networks .
Advertisement
Windows
Advertisement
When Windows ' built - in Wi-Fi network detector is n't cutting it , download the free NetStumbler to get a detailed listing of available networks listed by channel , signal strength , and security type , including " hidden " SSID 's your PC might not detect otherwise .
Advertisement
Previously - mentioned free Windows app WeFi offers a community - generated database of free hotspots for searching .
It does an okay job of finding hotspots , but beware of optional crapware in the installation process .
( Just say no . )

Mac

On the Mac , iStumbler is the free scanner application of choice .
iStumbler offers an informative table of nearby hotspots , including their names , security mechanism , channel , signal and noise percentages , and MAC addresses .
iStumbler has n't been updated in a long time , and it did n't work as well as it used to on Leopard on my Snow Leopard installation .
For a pay - for alternative to iStumbler , check out AirRadar ( $ 16 / license , free trial available ) .
Smartphones : iPhone , BlackBerry , Windows Mobile , Android
Your Wi-Fi enabled smartphone can scan for nearby networks using its built - in antenna , but a few apps let you search near your location or another location , too .
Advertisement
On the iPhone , I got the best results from JiWire 's Free Wi-Fi Finder , which searches areas by zip code or your current location .
( You can also use the mobile JiWire webapp at iphone.jiwire.com . )
Other iPhone Wi-Fi scanner apps include WifiTrack ( $ 1 ) and WiFiFoFum ( $ 3 ) .
Advertisement
On Windows Mobile , WiFiFoFum is available , and as Kevin pointed out , the WeFi app is also available for Android .

Webapps
Installable applications aside , if you 've got a smartphone with internet access , several webapps will search an area to help you find a Wi -Fi hotspot for your laptop , including :
Bookmark those in your mobile browser for future reference .
Desperation Level : High
Desperate times call for desperate measures .
If your search for Wi -Fi is fruitless — or turning up only security walls — you 've still got a few options .
Advertisement
First , you can turn your smartphone into a router by tethering to its connection .
This is n't going to give you the fast connection that most public Wi -Fi hotspots will , but it will get your laptop online .
Here 's one method for enabling tethering on your iPhone 3.0 ; here 's how to turn a Palm Pre into a tethered Wi -Fi router .
Android owners , the PdaNet app tethers your device to your laptop .
In fact , PdaNet is a popular tethering app that works on Windows Mobile , BlackBerry , Palm OS , and iPhone — though you 'll need to jailbreak your iPhone to get it working .

Finally , from the " do n't be a jerk " files , if you absolutely have to , you can force your way onto a WEP - secured wireless network .
Here 's how to crack a Wi -Fi network 's WEP password with Backtrack .
Just because you can does n't mean you should , of course — be prudent about hopping someone else 's virtual gate .

About a month ago I wrote a pretty silly and fairly mindless piece here at SA that poked fun at the hype surrounding the Internet 's new toy , Twitter , for which a real use had n't yet been found .
Naturally , this was like 3 or 4 days before the Iranian election , and then right after that Jacko ups and dies , so now everyone 's all Twitter - this and Twitter - that .
Yeah , I know , pretty dumb timing .
I had failed to realize the true power of what I was so flippantly mocking .
Here 's this tool that is just humming along minding its own business , and then here 's this sudden use for it that 's so far and away beyond what I thought could 've been possible .
Think about it , could a small collection of people on the Internet cause a large population to revolt in disgust -- even in horror -- over what they were seeing before their very eyes ?
The answer is yes , but I 'm not talking about political unrest , I 'm talking about a few guys showing everyone else goatse .
For those of you using the Internet for the first time , to ' goatse ' someone is to mislead them into viewing a specific classic picture of a guy pulling open his butthole with his hands .
Before we continue , let me say that everyone knows that doing this is n't really funny and has n't been for like 10 years , but for just a moment , consider the hot dog .
A single hot dog is nothing special , it 's bland and boring and mildly gross , but when some weird guy eats nearly 70 of them in a minute it 's suddenly pretty amazing .
Well , showing goatse to your idiot friend in Nevada is nothing , but showing Nevada is kind of special .
The evening of June 15 , SA 's own Abraham ( owner of goatse.asia ) , mentioned that over 21,000 people viewed goatse within 5 minutes off a single man 's single tweet :
hoobastank_band
Shots overheard in outlying Iran city / town of Tehran ( goatse link ) #iranelection # tehran #mousavi- danger
Despite hoobastank_band 's limited amount of followers , thousands of people clicked the link .
The key here being the hashtags at the end of the Twitter post .
When you 're trying to follow a topic on Twitter , you often look for these in order to filter out the " im going 2 collage " crud -type posts .
If millions of people are looking at certain hashtags , millions of people will see those certain posts .
And again :
hoobastank_band OMG !!!!
# Ahmedinejad 's Military Advisor Calls Mousavi " a Faggot " On Camera !!
( goatse link ) # IranElections # MahmoudMonster # GR88
Hoobastank , the band , how could you ?!
hoobastank_band Shock Jock Limbaugh : " A tiny baby , thats what Jackson died like " ( goatse link ) # MichaelJackson # MJ # Limbaugh # RudeRepubs
Very often , in an effort to be the first to retweet the newest information on a topic , these links were retweeted again and again by people before anyone even clicked them .
By the time they did , they and their friends had all goatsed their aunts and uncles and countless boatloads of people watching Twitter 's trending topics .
Add to that several copycats doing their thing , and before long Abraham was reporting that over two million people had clicked the tweeted and retweeted goatse links .
That 's about the population of Slovenia , four times the population of Sarah Palin 's Alaska , or about one goatse for each hour the United States has existed .
For a moment , it seemed that one - hit wonder band Hoobastank was responsible for the world 's largest goatse - ing in history ...
Thankfully , before anyone called VH1 to check , someone who can only be assumed to be the guy from Hoobastank got online and set the record straight .
HoobaFans :
He was not the gross link maker guy .
It was someone else .
He did n't do the attacks , no evidence .
So there you have it .
After probably several frantic phone calls between bandmates , agents , publicists , and web developers , the guy from Hoobastank took time out of his day to prove that he did not show millions of people a man 's butt .
I 'm really sorry , Twitter .
I take back everything I ever said about you and your service .
It 's actually really neat .
– Jon " @fart " Hendren ( @fart )
Moreover , with large complex sets of training patterns , it is likely that some errors may occur , either in the inputs or in the outputs .
In that case , and again particularly in the later parts of the learning process , it is likely that backprop will be contorting the weights so as to fit precisely around training patterns that are actually erroneous !
This phenomenon is known as over - fitting .
This problem can to some extent be avoided by stopping learning early .
How does one tell when to stop ?
One method is to partition the training patterns into two sets ( assuming that there are enough of them ) .
The larger part of the training patterns , say 80 % of them , chosen at random , form the training set , and the remaining 20 % are referred to as the test set .
Every now and again during training , one measures the performance of the current set of weights on the test set .
One normally finds that the error on the training set drops monotonically ( that 's what a gradient descent algorithm is supposed to do , after all ) .
However , error on the test set ( which will be larger , per pattern , than the error on the training set ) will fall at first , then start to rise as the algorithm begins to overtrain .
Best generalization performance is gained by stopping the algorithm at the point where error on the test set starts to rise .
generalized delta rule
An improvement on the in error backpropagation learning .
If the learning rate ( often denoted by η ) is small , the backprop algorithm proceeds slowly , but accurately follows the path of steepest descent on the error surface .
If η is too large , the algorithm may " bounce off the canyon walls of the error surface " - i.e. not work well .
This can be largely avoided by modifying the delta rule to include a momentum term :
Δw ji ( n ) = α Δw ji ( n –1 ) + η δ j ( n ) y i ( n )
in the notation of Haykin 's text ( Neural networks - a comprehensive foundation ) .
The constant α is a termed the momentum constant and can be adjusted to achieve the best effect .
The second summand corresponds to the standard delta rule , while the first summand says " add α × the previous change to this weight . "
This new rule is called the generalized delta rule .
The effect is that if the basic delta rule would be consistently pushing a weight in the same direction , then it gradually gathers " momentum " in that direction .
gradient descent
It 's still three years away , but that is n't stopping Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige from dropping hints about who and what to expect from the big superhero mash - up movie The Avengers when it eventually comes out .
Advertisement
Talking to Comic Book Resources , Feige admitted that Samuel L. Jackson 's nine movie deal with Marvel is indeed a clue as to how the Avengers are going to get toegther :
At the end of the first [ Iron Man ] , for the people who were patient enough to wait through the end credits , they met this guy named Nick Fury .
They or Tony had no idea who he was .
In this movie , he opens that door a little bit more for Tony and invites him to walk through it .
Tony may or may not do that in this movie .
But Nick Fury is the conduit through which all the characters will connect .
Advertisement
When asked whether the Hulk would feature in the Avengers movie , Feige replied ,
I think so .
In the comics , he has .
Another character we can expect to see in Avengers is Scarlett Johannsen 's Black Widow ; Feige was asked whether fans could expect to see her in that movie or her own spin - off , and he said ,
She 's signed on for all of those should we be lucky enough to have an audience that wants to see them .
So now we know at least six characters who'll be appearing in the movie : Iron Man , Thor , Captain America , Hulk , Nick Fury and Black Widow .
Given that Iron Man 2 is also introducing well - known Avengers character Hawkeye , it 's a fair bet to assume he 'll be a seventh ... and we have a line - up that should be very familiar not only to fans of Marvel 's early Avengers comics , but also Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch 's Ultimates rebooted version .
With Avengers screenwriter Zak Penn having previously said that Ultimates was a big influence on how he approaches this material , is it too early to assume that the first Avengers movie will be an adaptation of that particular series ?

1. Transgender people do not all look alike .
2 . Thus , there is no such thing as “ looking like ” a transgender person .
3 . If you think there is , that ’s based on our own prejudiced assumptions .
4 . There is nothing wrong with being transgender , nor with looking like whatever it is you think that transgender people look like .
5 . Therefore , saying that someone “ looks ” transgender as a form of insult is nonsensical not only as a statement , but also as an insult .
6 . And it ’s sure as hell not funny .
7. “ Tranny , ” however , is a bigoted slur against transgender people , particularly trans women or other people on the trans - feminine spectrum .
8 . Saying that someone “ looks like a tranny ” is therefore also an insult not to the person ( usually not transgender ) who is being “ insulted , ” but to actual transgender people , as it indicates not only that they all look alike , but also that there is something wrong and amusing by looking like they ( both supposedly and actually ) do .
9 . The kind of thinking that says there is something wrong or amusing about “ looking transgender ” or actually being transgender contributes an incredible amount to the frequent murder of transgender people , particularly trans women .
10 .
If any of this has made you think about things that you ’ve never thought about before , and you would like to learn more , you really ought to google “ transgender 101 . ”
I have a sad feeling that it will be necessary to link to this post many , many times in the future .
If there ’s anything I ’ve missed on the topic of this one narrow yet very prevalent slice of transphobia , please feel free to reblog with additions .

ONLY FROM BAYER AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
The truth really is stranger than fiction .
My best friend and co-author , George McMahon , is one of only seven citizens who can legally smoke marijuana in every state of the union .
In fact , the U.S. government has provided George with 300 prerolled marijuana cigarettes each month for 14 years , through a program called Investigational New Drug , administered by the National Institute of Drug Abuse .
Our government has grown and distributed medical marijuana since 1978 .
The federal patients use marijuana to treat diverse symptoms of pain , spasms , nausea and glaucoma - related ocular pressure .
Of course , officials wo n't yet admit their appointed " demon weed " is a medicinal herb .
They call the IND program a " research " project instead .
However , in 26 years of the program 's existence , no government research has been conducted regarding the recipients of the federal marijuana .
Perhaps certain officials do n't want to empirically quantify what they already suspect : Marijuana is good medicine , particularly when compared with the often - toxic drugs promoted by pharmaceutical industry lobbyists ( well - known in political circles as deep - pocketed campaign contributors ) .
Had government officials performed the vital research , they would understand why McMahon is alive today .
Prior to his acceptance in the IND program , George had been through 19 major surgeries , was declared clinically dead several times , took 17 prescribed substances on a daily basis and was confined to a wheelchair .
For the past 14 years , George has smoked 10 marijuana cigarettes each day .
During this time , he has had no surgeries or hospitalizations , he no longer takes any pharmaceuticals ( aside from the occasional aspirin or antibiotic ) , and he is fully ambulatory .
He is living proof that marijuana has medical value , yet , many federal legislators refuse to admit it .
They stubbornly persist in criminalizing patients , spreading misinformation , defying the express will of the people and denying the states their constitutional authority to resolve the issue independently .
Despite our national hypocrisy regarding medical marijuana , the international medical research on marijuana is astounding .
In the United Kingdom , Bayer Corp. is partnering with GW Pharmaceuticals to create Sativex , a natural marijuana extract inhaler that works like a bronchial inhaler , only sublingually .
Sativex relieves symptoms immediately ( similar to smoking a marijuana cigarette ) , without the negative ramifications of smoking .
The medicine requires no cleaning or rolling .
Sativex is portable and can be used discreetly , without a strong odor .
For many sick and dying patients in the United Kingdom , Sativex will be ideal .
The European free market is operating in accord with sensible public policy in order to provide patients with quality medicine .
American patients , however , will be thrown in jail if they use Sativex .
Adding insult to injury , Bayer is a major financial contributor to Partnership for a Drug Free America -- an organization that claims marijuana has no medical value .
It 's enough to make a person sick , especially if they are compassionate and reasonable .
The medical marijuana issue is not about recreation -- it 's about patients with painful , debilitating , and life - threatening symptoms .
The American public is certainly capable of making this common - sense distinction between use and abuse .
Perhaps that 's why national polls repeatedly demonstrate 75 percent to 80 percent approval for the decriminalization of medical marijuana , in spite of the constant flow of government - sponsored " reefer madness " rhetoric .
During my travels across the nation , I 've spoken with several legislators who claim they are hesitant to change the medical marijuana laws because they do n't want to " send the wrong message " to children .
As a father who delivered both his children with his own ( trembling ) hands , I can empathize with this concern .
I do n't want my children misusing any substance , be it alcohol , morphine , or marijuana .
But if my children ever become sick , then I want them to have access to any medicine , including marijuana - based remedies , which will ease their symptoms and improve their quality of life .
And I hope they will never be marginalized , ostracized , or criminalized for the treatment of their disease .
In a laudable but misguided attempt to administer equal justice under the law , our legislators have taken a one - size - fits - all approach in response to therapeutic marijuana .
But doctors acknowledge that each person has unique physiological , psychological , and environmental circumstances .
One man 's poison is another man 's salve .
This applies to herbs , drugs and delivery systems alike .
Perhaps one day our national leaders will mature enough to grasp this simple principle and implement meaningful reform .
Until that day , I 'll keep my hopes high by repeating the words of Robert Randall , the first recipient of federal marijuana : " History indicates the most trivial of facts can implode the most powerful dogma . "

Tobacco companies made changes without informing consumers
As President Obama prepares to sign a bill giving the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) oversight of the tobacco industry , a new study from Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) researchers shows that tobacco manufacturers have continually changed the ingredients and the design of their cigarettes over time , even if those changes have exceeded acceptable product variance guidelines .
The result , say the researchers , is that consumers who buy the same brand of product are not made aware of how that product has been altered and what effect those alterations might have on their levels of addiction or harm .
“ I hope the FDA requires disclosure of any changes made to tobacco products and that the changes are disallowed if shown to increase appeal , addiction and harm , ” said Greg Connolly , director of the Tobacco Control Research Program at HSPH .
The study appears in the “ Online First ” section of the Journal of Tobacco Control and will appear in an upcoming print issue of the journal .
For their study , Connolly and lead author Geoffrey Ferris Wayne , an HSPH researcher , studied internal tobacco company documents released following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement .
These documents describe significant changes made to commercial products over time , including blend , processing , casing , flavoring and physical design features .
For example , new methods were developed to process tobacco , altering the smoke chemistry and the form of nicotine delivery , and the levels of processed tobaccos were regularly adjusted within brands .
Despite the constant innovation of tobacco products , which in many cases have exceeded the levels of acceptable variance established within the tobacco industry , for the most part , these changes were not disclosed to consumers , say the researchers .
“ Even incremental changes that occur over a period of years can result in significant design differences .
The resulting product may have altered chemistry or delivery , yet the smoker is largely unaware of these changes .
This underscores the need for industry transparency and accountability , ” said Ferris Wayne .
The study builds on earlier research done at HSPH on how products are designed to enhance appeal and addiction .
At Senate hearings on the FDA bill last year , Connolly discussed that research , including how tobacco companies have increased nicotine content over time , manipulated menthol and added candy - like flavors to enhance appeal to children .
Until regulators have a system in place for assessing product revisions , Connolly and Ferris Wayne advise that all changes to tobacco products be reported to the FDA and that no changes be allowed until they have been scientifically shown to reduce addiction or harm .

The Touch Books ' main gimmick is that its screen can be detached and used as a standalone tablet , and the second gimmick is that it runs the TI OMAP 3 chip , which is looking like a killer PMP / tablet processor .
In all , it looks like by Christmas of this year , we 'll have the long - awaited Intel Atom vs. ARM Cortex A8 netbook price / performance / power smackdown that the gadget press has been waiting for since 2007 .
There 's a sizable amount of hype around the Cortex A8 parts being considerably cheaper and more power - efficient than Intel 's Atom , but it 's worth taking a moment to think about how the two platforms actually stack up against one another .
In terms of absolute power draw , there 's no question that the sub - 1W ARM A8 platforms are going to smoke Intel 's Atom platform .
Atom alone has a TDP of around 2W ( give or take 0.5W , depending on usage ) , and when you factor in the other two chips that make up the current iteration of the platform , then you can tack on another zero there .
Intel 's forthcoming two - chip Pine Trail will help this situation considerably , but it still relies on a separate I/ O hub that will add to the power draw vs.
ARM SoCs ; the latter have everything from the CPU and GPU out to the USB controller on one die .
So these ARM - based smartbooks will face off against Pine Trail - based netbooks , and who wins will depend on which market you 're talking about .
In terms of relative performance per watt at the platform level , it 's not so clear that Cortex A8 really has a considerable edge over Atom .
Benchmark data is close to nonexistent , but looking at the two fairly similar CPU architectures , Atom 's x86 tax may not be that severe .
By the time an A8 part is clocked high enough to go toe - to - toe with Pine Trail in raw performance , it will probably also be in Intel 's ballpark in absolute power draw .
It 's still likely that the A8 implementations will win in performance per watt , but in any contest where Intel is in the same ballpark , the company will try to close the distance with features in price .
In Atom 's case , this means that it can accommodate the full range of Intel platform bells and whistles — including 64 - bit processing , the full alphabet soup of Intel SIMD extensions , hyperthreading , and Active Management Technology — in a very low - power package .
Depending on how you evaluate those features , they could close the relative price / performance gap .
For instance , hyperthreading 's main use is to increase performance by hiding memory latency , and its success in this area is workload - dependent ( in some cases it makes performance worse ) .
I will be very interested to see how hyperthreading interacts with a sample Chrome browser workload — multiple tabs , multiple threads , branchy Javascript code , and other elements that may make hyperthreading shine .
AMT is another place where Atom has an edge , at least in the corporate market .
If you outfit a fleet with Pine Trail , then you can do the kinds of remote management tricks that Intel likes to tout .
If this sort of thing matters to you , then you 'll be quite happy to trade 30 minutes or so of battery life for it .
In the end , I would expect smartbooks to do to netbooks what netbooks are doing to notebooks , i.e. , they 'll cannibalize parts of the market , but they 'll also create new niches .
If the ARM - based smartbooks really do deliver on all - day battery life with acceptable performance at a lower price , then Intel will be left scrambling at 32nm for whatever new niches they open up .
The Poker Players Alliance ( PPA ) will host a fly - in in two weeks as part of National Poker Week .
Greg Raymer , Chris Ferguson , and Andy Bloch are among a handful of poker pros that will meet and greet representatives of Congress in an effort to legalize and regulate the game in the United States .
Poker News Daily caught up with the trio at the 2009 World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) .
2004 WSOP Main Event Champion Greg Raymer
On Washington lobbyists :
“ The whole thing is such a joke .
If you look at the people who say they ’re against gambling on moral grounds , the money funding those groups is from other gambling interests that are against online poker or online gambling .
The horse lobby , which wants people to come to the physical racetracks , is giving money to the conservative Christian group that says they ’re anti-gambling . ”
“ Online poker is easier to regulate than live poker .
It ’s impossible for the live venues to do some of the things you can do online in terms of tracking .
On PokerStars , we can save every hand you ’ve played and know how much money you put into the pot , how much you won or lost , and the hours you ’re playing .
We can even track the IP addresses to know where you logged in from .
There ’s so much tracking we can do , so if you ’re worried about minors slipping in or problem gamblers who want to be stopped , the online sites can deal with those issues .
We can do it more effectively than a brick - and - mortar casino . ”
On why the issue is important : “ I ’m a Libertarian in terms of my general philosophy .
I do n’t think the government should ever tell me what to do with my own time and money .
If you ’re committing a crime against me , that ’s where the government is supposed to stop you , but if you ’re going to be at your own home doing something by yourself , the government should n’t have anything to say no matter what you ’re doing .
If a child is there , the government should step in and make sure you ’re not doing something that ’s harmful .
The child is not old enough to give their consent to certain activities .
“ Even things that I find totally ridiculous like methamphetamine , the government should n’t be stopping people from doing it .
I think you ’re a total idiot if you do that , but if you ’re an adult and you want to do something stupid , it ’s not the government ’s job to step in . ”
Full Tilt Poker Pro Andy Bloch
On the PPA Fly - In :
“ It ’s going to be a busy couple of weeks for me .
Hopefully I ’ll make it to the WSOP Main Event final table .
If not , I ’m flying to London for a poker event and then on the way back , I ’m stopping in Washington , DC for four days .
The PPA did a fly - in last year and it was a great success .
I think we ’re going to bring in more people and be able to talk to more Congressmen this year . ”
On why being active politically is important :
“ I went to law school because I thought I wanted to get involved in politics or human rights .
If the government can stop you from playing online poker in your own home , what ca n’t they stop you from doing ?
That ’s one of the reasons why Barney Frank is one of our biggest supporters :
He believes in personal freedoms .
That ’s why we have Ron Paul and other Republicans supporting us .
If the government can come in and say you ca n’t play $ 0.05 - $ 0.10 poker or $ 5 sit and gos in your living room , what ca n’t they stop ?
Where does it end ?
They can tell you what you can do , what you can buy , what clothes you can wear , and what kind of food you can eat .
I do n’t want to live in a world like that . ”
Full Tilt Poker Pro Chris Ferguson
On the PPA Fly - In :
“ There has really been an attack on poker , particularly on online poker , during the last few years .
We really think it ’s unjustified .
We think poker is a wonderful game and everyone should have the right to play it .
We have casinos all over the United States where you can play poker .
Why ca n’t you play online ?
What we ’re doing is very good for poker and it ’s going to bring the game to thousands of people all over the world . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A federal judge on Monday ruled against an effort by the U.S. Federal Reserve to block disclosure of companies that participated in and securities covered by a series of emergency funding programs as the global credit crisis began to intensify .
In a 47 - page opinion , Chief District Judge Loretta Preska of the federal court in Manhattan said the central bank failed to show that disclosure would cause borrowers in the Federal Reserve System to suffer “ imminent competitive harm , ” by stigmatizing them for using Fed lending programs .
“ The board essentially speculates on how a borrower might enter a downward spiral of financial instability if its participation in the Federal Reserve lending programs were to be disclosed , ” she wrote .
“ Conjecture , without evidence of imminent harm , simply fails to meet the board ’s burden . ”
Monday ’s ruling comes as lawmakers and investors demand greater disclosure in how the government manages a series of programs designed to lift the economy out of its deepest recession in decades .
The case arose when two Bloomberg News reporters submitted requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) about actions the Fed took to shore up the financial system in 2007 and early 2008 , including an expansion of lending programs and the sale of Bear Stearns Cos to JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N .
After the Fed resisted the request , Bloomberg sued to compel disclosure .
Preska concluded the Fed “ improperly withheld agency records in response to a FOIA request by conducting an inadequate search , ” she wrote .
FOIA obliges federal agencies to make government documents available to the public , subject to various exemptions .
Bloomberg News and the Fed did not immediately return requests for comment .
The case is : Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) , No. 08-9595 .

A " plastic soup " of waste floating in the Pacific Ocean is growing at an alarming rate and now covers an area twice the size of the continental United States , scientists have said .
The vast expanse of debris – in effect the world 's largest rubbish dump – is held in place by swirling underwater currents .
This drifting " soup " stretches from about 500 nautical miles off the Californian coast , across the northern Pacific , past Hawaii and almost as far as Japan .
Charles Moore , an American oceanographer who discovered the " Great Pacific Garbage Patch " or " trash vortex " , believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region .
Marcus Eriksen , a research director of the US - based Algalita Marine Research Foundation , which Mr Moore founded , said yesterday : " The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on .
It is not quite like that .
It is almost like a plastic soup .
It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Curtis Ebbesmeyer , an oceanographer and leading authority on flotsam , has tracked the build - up of plastics in the seas for more than 15 years and compares the trash vortex to a living entity : " It moves around like a big animal without a leash . "
When that animal comes close to land , as it does at the Hawaiian archipelago , the results are dramatic .
" The garbage patch barfs , and you get a beach covered with this confetti of plastic , " he added .
The " soup " is actually two linked areas , either side of the islands of Hawaii , known as the Western and Eastern Pacific Garbage Patches .
About one - fifth of the junk – which includes everything from footballs and kayaks to Lego blocks and carrier bags – is thrown off ships or oil platforms .
The rest comes from land .
Mr Moore , a former sailor , came across the sea of waste by chance in 1997 , while taking a short cut home from a Los Angeles to Hawaii yacht race .
He had steered his craft into the " North Pacific gyre " – a vortex where the ocean circulates slowly because of little wind and extreme high pressure systems .
Usually sailors avoid it .
He was astonished to find himself surrounded by rubbish , day after day , thousands of miles from land .
" Every time I came on deck , there was trash floating by , " he said in an interview .
" How could we have fouled such a huge area ?
How could this go on for a week ? "
Mr Moore , the heir to a family fortune from the oil industry , subsequently sold his business interests and became an environmental activist .
He warned yesterday that unless consumers cut back on their use of disposable plastics , the plastic stew would double in size over the next decade .
Professor David Karl , an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii , said more research was needed to establish the size and nature of the plastic soup but that there was " no reason to doubt " Algalita 's findings .
" After all , the plastic trash is going somewhere and it is about time we get a full accounting of the distribution of plastic in the marine ecosystem and especially its fate and impact on marine ecosystems . "
Professor Karl is co-ordinating an expedition with Algalita in search of the garbage patch later this year and believes the expanse of junk actually represents a new habitat .
Historically , rubbish that ends up in oceanic gyres has biodegraded .
But modern plastics are so durable that objects half - a- century old have been found in the north Pacific dump .
" Every little piece of plastic manufactured in the past 50 years that made it into the ocean is still out there somewhere , " said Tony Andrady , a chemist with the US - based Research Triangle Institute .
Mr Moore said that because the sea of rubbish is translucent and lies just below the water 's surface , it is not detectable in satellite photographs .
" You only see it from the bows of ships , " he said .
According to the UN Environment Programme , plastic debris causes the deaths of more than a million seabirds every year , as well as more than 100,000 marine mammals .
Syringes , cigarette lighters and toothbrushes have been found inside the stomachs of dead seabirds , which mistake them for food .
Plastic is believed to constitute 90 per cent of all rubbish floating in the oceans .
The UN Environment Programme estimated in 2006 that every square mile of ocean contains 46,000 pieces of floating plastic ,
Dr Eriksen said the slowly rotating mass of rubbish - laden water poses a risk to human health , too .
Hundreds of millions of tiny plastic pellets , or nurdles – the raw materials for the plastic industry – are lost or spilled every year , working their way into the sea .
These pollutants act as chemical sponges attracting man-made chemicals such as hydrocarbons and the pesticide DDT .
They then enter the food chain .
" What goes into the ocean goes into these animals and onto your dinner plate .
It 's that simple , " said Dr Eriksen .

Caracas , August 3 , 2009 -- Venezuelanalysis.com --
The head of Venezuela 's telecommunications agency ( CONATEL ) and minister of housing and infrastructure Diosdado Cabello announced on August 1 the immediate closure of 32 privately owned radio stations and two regional television stations , because their broadcast licences had expired or they had violated regulations .
Cabello said the recovered licences would be handed to the community media .
The minister said many of the stations were operating illegally and had failed to register or pay fees to CONATEL .
Decisions are still pending on a further 206 stations .
Nelson Belfort , president of the Chamber of Radio Broadcasters and the Caracas - based Circuito Nacional Belfort , which owns five of the closed radio stations , described the move as a government " attack " that aims to limit freedom of expression .
He said the CNB would appeal the decision .
However , Cabello explained that the measure is within the framework of the current law and that the licences are being revoked for violating regulations .
" I challenge those who operate the Circuito Nacional Belfort to provide a document showing that CONATEL has authorised them to operate the 102.3 frequency .
They are saying that the station is theirs and it's not true , " Cabello declared .
" They say that we are revoking concessions and that is not true .
The state is simply recovering the concessions that were being used illegally for more than 30 years .
It is an act of justice that has to do with giving power to people " , he said .
The minister denied the government is trying to limit freedom of expression , saying those affected can continue transmitting their programs through the internet as the measure only applies to the use of the state - owned airwaves .
Cabello said that powerful families in Venezuela who had " swindled " the people had acquired many of the radio stations illegally and constituted " media latifundios " ( a reference to large , privately owned estates ) .
Twenty - seven families controlled more than 32 % of the radio and television airwaves .
Many of those affected own 10 to 20 or stations , the minister added .
Telecommunications law
New reforms to the telecommunications law aim to break up " media latifundios " by limiting ownership of radio or television stations to three per private owner , according to Cabello .
Under the reforms broadcasting concessions are designated as non-inheritable property , and are therefore non-transferable to family or colleagues in the event of the death of a concession holder .
The minister warned that those who continue to operate illegally without permits will be subject to sanctions under the telecommunications law .
" There are various penalties , including confiscation of equipment and secondly they will be subject to suspension , for five years , of activity in telecommunications and can go to jail if they repeat these actions .
We will apply the law regardless of their surname , regardless of who their families are " , he said .
In relation to a call by the private television station Globovision to protest in the streets against the measure , Cabello responded , " If you want to protest do so , but do not try to subvert the constitutional order , or call violent protests . "
Around 200 people gathered to protest the decision outside the offices of CNB on August 1 and on August 3 a small group of journalists rallied in front of CONATEL .
However , many Venezuelans share little sympathy for the private media due to its role in the April 2002 coup that briefly ousted President Hugo Chavez from power .
Private television and radio stations collaborated directly with the coup regime and imposed a media blackout , broadcasting cartoons and soap operas .
On July 23 the National Association of Free and Alternative Community Media ( AMCLA ) held a rally in Caracas calling for radio and television airwaves to be handed over to the people .
Then on August 2 several hundred people rallied in front of CONATEL in support of the government measure .
Mireya Bolet , a councilor and resident of Chacao who attended the rally , said , " I 'm totally in agreement with the measure that minister Diosdado Cabello has taken of placing the airwaves in the hands of the Venezuelan people . "
President Chavez said on August 1 that the 34 stations were operating outside the law and have been recovered and would be handed over to community media .
The measure should be supported , Chavez argued , because the " radio stations now belong to the people and not the bourgeoisie " .
He stressed that the people must be the owners of the strategic means of production , and said that the Bolivarian government is also working on the recovery of other spaces .
Community media :
The thriving voice of the Venezuelan people
The 1999 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was written and ratified by the people themselves , setting a societal precedent of democratic participation .
The constitution contains articles that grant new rights to Venezuelans , such as Indigenous people 's rights , universal access to education , healthcare , housing , employment , political participation and many other rights that make the Venezuelan constitution one of the most progressive in the world in the area of human rights .
Article 58 specifically states , " Communication is free and plural and must adhere to the obligations and responsibilities under the law .
Every person has the right to objective , true and impartial information , without censorship .... "
Article 108 of the constitution ensures that all communication media , public and private , must contribute to the social development of citizens .
The same article guarantees public access to radio , television , library networks and information networks in order to permit universal access to information .
Public access channels and community - based media are rights that , for the first time , were ensured under the 1999 constitution . [ 2 ]
The Organic Telecommunications Law , which was passed in June 2000 , states that there are three types of broadcast media in Venezuela : private , state and community .
The law gives legal recognition to community broadcasting , enabling it to receive special tax breaks .
In order to be recognised as a community broadcaster , the programming has to meet the certain criteria .
Principally , the station must be non-profit and dedicated to the community , with the requirement that 70 % of its programming must be produced within the community .
Also , there must be a separation between the station and its programming , which means that the station itself may only produce 15 % , leaving the remainder to be produced by community volunteers .
In addition , the station must provide training to community members so the production of media is accessible to everyone .
The law also states that the directors of the community media cannot be party officials , members of the military or work for private mass media . [ 3 ]
Although the constitution of Venezuela recognises community media , prior to the April 2002 coup against the Chávez government these small television , radio and newspaper resources did not receive much attention from the state .
Active support was not provided .
Before Chávez was elected president , participating in community media was a clandestine activity and a victimised form of freedom of speech ; homes and offices that housed community radio stations were often raided and operators feared for their lives .
Community media stations have since multiplied , amplifying the voices of individuals and communities , increasing community communication and cohesion , fostering cultural awareness and political participation , and increasingly meeting the positive freedom of speech rights of Venezuelans .
A new form of participatory communication based on local experiential knowledge is gaining popularity and influence . [ 4 ]
Despite the strong foundation community media has in the Venezuelan constitution and laws , community media is still a relatively new voice evolving into an active forum for the democratic and revolutionary process of the Venezuelan people .
Community media has become a necessary alternative because it is made and controlled by the people .
After the failed coup attempt , the government realised how crucial community media is to the people and to the state .
It became apparent that the state media cannot be the only alternative to the private media because of its relatively low ratings and its consolidated nature , which make it vulnerable in a coup situation .
When Channel 8 , the state - run television channel , was taken off the air during the coup in April 2002 , most Venezuelans were denied accurate coverage of events .
The coup was defeated with the help of community media stations and activists ; they rallied their communities to take to the streets and demand their voices be heard . [ 5 ]
In stark contrast to the corporate media that creates a dominant ideological framework , community media is an instrument of ideological formation that harmonises with the democratic , social and economic progress occurring in Venezuela .
Many Venezuelans formerly denied access to the media are now beginning to control their media and create positive change .
Communities are telling their own stories , sharing their struggles and exposing their truths that had been excluded and silenced for so long .
Community media has become a tool to battle against corporate media control .
Blanca Eekhout , a founding member and director of community run CatiaTV in the Catia barrio of Caracas , speaks of the film movement connecting her community :
The next step in the process was decisive : the activists in the struggle for water , in the asamblea popular del agua , began to use film as a tool for their struggle .
The camera became a weapon : we would tape officials coming to the community and making promises , and use the film to hold them accountable .
This film movement started to become the cables of a network to connect the community .
A network of barrio news was created , based on creating and passing these films . [ 6 ]
CatiaTV and other community TV stations engage in the struggle for liberation from the corruption of private media with a critical , self - critical and class - conscious perspective because participation comes from within the communities .
According to the CatiaTV Collective , " community media works to democratize communication , affecting the necessary separation of the medium and the message " . [ 7 ]
Community media activists created a National Association of Alternative and Community Media ( ANMCLA ) in response to the extreme difficulties the community media stations faced when trying to obtain authorisation through the National Commission of Telecommunications ( CONATEL ) .
Carlos Carles , a journalist with Radio Perola in Caracas , said that CONATEL in presenting what validates an alternative radio station :
proposed techniques of demonstrating statistical data .
Against this , we proposed local knowledge , oral narrative , historical memory , and the everyday work of the community .
As a result of this difference , we entered into a major debate , and we completely rejected the legal component of the proposal made by the Chávez government . [ 8 ]
With ANMCLA , a community can authorise a station and legalise it themselves .
There is no such thing as an illegal station because everyone has the constitutional right to communication and freedom of expression .
Community media is democratic media .
Vigorous citizen participation is needed from the bottom up and it operates according to the needs and wants of the public .
A clear difference is understood and made between citizens and consumers ; the viewer is seen as a " protagonist " rather than a consumer , the prominent portrayal of viewers in private media . [ 9 ]
The community media movement promotes public ownership and control of resources such as public rights over the air waves , the radio and TV spectrum and communication infrastructures are supported .
Democratic media concern themselves with the civil and human rights of all media participants -- media producers must be free from government and commercial interference and free to innovate and present controversial issues .
Because the programming comes directly from the community , the content is truly democratic and inclusive .
In addition to providing a meaningful space for community communication , community radio and television stations can be a space to keep local culture and traditions alive .
Paraguaipoa , the first indigenous community radio station located in the state of Táchira , is now one of nine indigenous community radio stations in Venezuela .
All programming on Paraguaipoa is either in Wayuu or provides bilingual programming for accessibility and the preservation of language .
The radio station shares a building with one of the first Indigenous primary schools which places an emphasis on traditional Wayuu culture , language and traditions .
The school has two weekly radio programs in which students regularly create their own shows .
Ángela , a Wayuu member who has a weekly radio station , captures the essence of the role community media plays :
Our children turn on the radio , and they hear their aunt , their friend 's mother , their older sister and her friends .
They hear stories from the mouths of those who know the community and what we need .
And they hear our language .
All of this makes the children proud and eager to participate , and it gives our own community some of the power we lost to the lies of the media stations . [ 10 ]
The private media fails to report the great successes of community media because , despite their small size , these stations pose a serious threat to those who are in control of the information that mainstream Venezuela receives .
Venezuelans are making their own news , reporting their own stories and are unmasking the lies and manipulations that the corporate media has controlled for so long .
Community media is a strong , promising and essential step toward democratising Venezuelan society , but the road there is n't necessarily a smooth one .
There are many challenges that lie ahead .
To begin , community media sector is still small -- one that the majority of Venezuelans do not take part in . [ 11 ]
Venezuelans must reject this dependence on private media sources and begin to participate within their community .
Without the direct participation of the people , there is no alternative voice to the dominant media in Venezuela .
And a capacity to coordinate these guerilla media resources must be strengthened .
Community radio and television stations are incredibly effective in covering issues affecting the community and facilitating community communication and organisation , but not all stations cover national and international issues .
This is why the network of cooperation between community radio and television stations in Venezuela is so important .
Through sharing programming and air space with stations throughout the country the stations , which often have a regional focus , are able to provide more comprehensive coverage .
Exchanging knowledge , information , resources and ideas is crucial in furthering and strengthening the community and alternative media movement .
True freedom of speech
There has been some criticism over government funding of community media .
Because many stations were only legalised under Chávez , and the majority receive governmental funding , many have voiced concerns of government intervention or pressure concerning content .
[ 12 ] ECOS radio , the station for Barrio Pueblo Nuevo in Mérida , occupied an abandoned building for three years before it was expropriated by the government and they received the title .
Now , they share the space with the barrio's community centre , often using the radio for community organising .
Although the station has benefited from the expropriation of their building , the legalisation of their station under the radio and telecommunications
Act , and the donation of equipment , ECOS is in no way under the control of Chavez .
We believe it is important to work for the revolution that is working for us , but we often express criticisms of el proceso bolivariano ... of course the state has played a large role in the implementation of the social programs , but there are many movements , many great things that come directly from the community here and that is what she share here at ECOS . [ 13 ]
This sentiment has also been expressed by Chávez .
When Catia TV was officially legalised , he urged the community media centre to speak out on issues important to the community and hold the government accountable to its promises , welcoming criticism . [ 14 ]
Community media stations are ensuring true freedom of speech and expression in Venezuela .
The media conglomerates that are trying to take this democratic process out of the hands of the people can be fought and defeated with the awakened , aware and united voices of the Venezuelan people .
As activist Eva Gollinger states :
The case of Venezuela evidences the first time that the media , as a powerful , private actor , has waged war against the people in order to advance its own agenda .
Public access to media and diversity of voices have been usurped by the private media moguls in Venezuela propagating their own political and economic aims . [ 15 ]
Community media in Venezuela is fighting back .
The private mass media 's monopoly on the power to manipulate public opinion has been threatened .
The Venezuelan revolution is based on the principles of inclusion , participation and protagonism ; on spreading what used to be reserved for a few to the entire population , from political representation and participation to social services such as healthcare , food and education , to the ability to participate in the media .
As individuals work together to learn to use equipment , collaborate to create radio shows and proceed together with the long process of experiential learning , the self - sufficiency of the community grows .
In creating a community voice organically from those who have lived and breathed and struggled there all their lives , a sustainable means of communication media is established .
Voices formerly silenced by the corporate media emerge on their own terms , articulating the reality they are creating for themselves through participatory communication .
They are deciding what the important issues are for their own communities and framing their own debates .
The democratisation of the media has begun .

An art exhibition where people are encouraged to write in a Bible has seen visitors daub abuse and obscenities across its pages .
Part of Made in God 's Image , the exhibit also includes a video of a woman ripping pages from the Bible and stuffing them into her bra , knickers and mouth .
Next to the copy of the Bible at the Gallery of Modern Art ( Goma ) in Glasgow is a container of pens and a notice , which says : ' If you feel you have been excluded from the Bible , please write your way back into it . '
Outrage :
The copy of the Bible at Glasgow 's Gallery of Modern Art has been defaced with abuse and obscenities
Organisers of the exhibit , called Untitled 2009 , say it was meant to reclaim the Bible as a sacred text
The exhibit , entitled Untitled 2009 , was put forward by the Metropolitan Community Church with the aim of reclaiming the Bible as a sacred text .
But its pages have been scrawled with comments including ' F *** the Bible ' and ' I am Bi , Female & Proud .
I want no god who is disappointed in this ' .
The exhibition was created by artists Anthony Schrag and David Malone , alongside organisations representing gay Christians and Muslims .
Mr Schrag , the gallery 's artist in residence , said he did not believe in God , but that research into the £ 7,000 show had reinforced his respect for people of faith .
He said : ' Any offensive things that have been written are not the point of the work .
It was an open gesture .
' Are those who say they are upset offended by the things that people write , or just by the very notion that someone should write on a Bible ? '
The artist , a Canadian who studied for a master 's degree at the Glasgow School of Art , said that human rights are behind the show .
He added : ' Art allows us to discuss difficult things , and Goma allows difficult discussions to take place - that is why Glasgow is at the cutting edge of contemporary art . '
Controversial :
The exhibit 's producers said they regret the insults and that the most offensive pages will be removed
Jane Clarke , a minister of the community church , said she regretted the insults that had been written in the Bible .
She said : ' The Bible should never be used like that .
It was our intention to reclaim it as a sacred text . '
Other messages written in the book feature alterations to lines in the Old Testament .
These include ' The Gospel According to Luke Skywalker ' and ' In the beginning , God ( me ) I created religion ' .
Producers of the exhibition have said that the most offensive pages will be removed .
But critics including the Church of Scotland , the Roman Catholic Church , the Christian Institute and a Christian lawyers ' group questioned why the exhibition was allowed to be staged .
George Reid , an ex-Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland , is on the board of the council - funded arts body behind the show .
Mr Reid , who said he did not know about the event , branded the exhibit a ' sad form of sensationalism ' .
He said : ' Glasgow has a fine record of opposing discrimination and violence .
Defacing the Bible will not help to build an inclusive and tolerant society .
' It is a sad form of sensationalism which will cause gross offence to believers of many faiths . '
Simon Calvert , deputy director for public affairs at the Christian Institute , said : ' People writing on the Bible does n't change the truth .
' We all know that they would n't do that if it was the sacred text of another religion .
' That a taxpayer subsidised gallery should see fit to give space to something like that is disappointing . '
Andrea Minichiello Williams , director of the Christian Legal Centre , said : ' We have got to a point where we call the desecration of the Bible modern art .
' The Bible stands for everything this art does not : for creation , beauty , hope and regeneration . '
A Church of Scotland spokesman said : ' We would discourage anyone from defacing the Bible . '
A spokesman for the Catholic Church said : ' One wonders whether the organisers would have been quite as willing to have the Koran defaced . '
Susie Squire , of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : ' People pay their council tax to get their bins collected , not to fund pornography and destruction of religious texts . '
The Goma gallery is also home to sh[ OUT ] , a project which includes an exhibition featuring gay pornography and a series of ' community outreach ' events designed to tackle homophobia .
Heilman 's Family Wants Justice For Son's Shooting Tyler Heilman was unarmed , wearing a swimsuit , when a cop fatally shot him .
July 22 , 2009  --
The family of Tyler Heilman , the 24 - year - old Minnesotan who was fatally shot despite being obviously unarmed -- he was wearing only a bathing suit -- wants the officer involved to be " taken down . "
Heilman had been driving " erratically " on his way home from a day of swimming at a Minnesota lake Monday when Le Sueur County Sheriff 's investigator Todd Waldron approached him and later shot him as many as four times , according to authorities .
" This guy has got to go down , " said the dead man 's uncle , Patrick Heilman .
" He 's insane .
You do n't just gun someone down like that . "
Heilman , 45 , said that his nephew is survived by his 3 - year - old son Haydin and his girlfriend of seven years .
He had been driving to a friend 's apartment in the small rural town of Kasota , Minn. , about 80 miles southwest of Minneapolis , just before he was confronted by the officer .
" The cop got out of control and lost it .
All Tyler had on were swimming trunks , " said Heilman .
Kris Hoehn , one of Heilman 's best friends who was with him when he was killed , told ABC News ' Minnesota affiliate KSTP - TV that his friend had no idea the man confronting him was an officer and that if he had , he would never have argued with him .
The argument escalated into a brawl where the two men ended up wrestling on the ground .
According to police , Waldron approached Heilman , who had exited his vehicle , in an apartment complex parking lot .
When Heilman allegedly resisted arrest , according to police , Waldron tried to " detain " him and a physical confrontation began .
" If he would have identified himself and said , ' Hey , I 'm an officer ' and said , ' Hey , listen to me this is what 's going on , ' my friend would have stopped , " said Hoehn .
Hoehn said Heilman eventually realized Waldron was an officer when he saw Waldron 's badge 's on his belt .
" Tyler got on top of him , seen that he had a badge finally , stepped back like this and the guy sprung up and fired three shots , " Hoehn said .
According to Andy Skoogman , the spokesman for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that is leading the investigation into Heilman 's shooting , the young man had been violating traffic laws immediately prior to his death .
" Waldon has been in the area working on an unrelated case when he spotted Heilman 's vehicle driving erratically and at times at high rates of speed , " said Skoogman .
" At one time the car had gone up a steep embankment . "
Police Admit No Weapon Found at Scene of Shooting
It was not immediately clear whether Heilman had been under the influence of alcohol at the time and Skoogman said toxicology reports and an autopsy are underway .
Skoogman confirmed that no weapons had been found at the scene of the crime and that Heilman had , in fact , been wearing only shorts and no shirt when he was shot .
Waldon , a 10 - year veteran of the Le Sueur County Sheriff 's Office , is on paid administrative leave , a move Skoogman said is not disciplinary but entirely " normal " when it comes to officers involved in shootings .
Messages left for Waldon by ABCNews.com were not immediately returned .
Skoogman declined to comment on the department 's protocol when it comes to plainclothes officers identifying themselves , but did say that Waldon had his badge clipped to his belt at the time of the incident , which lasted approximately 20 minutes .
He added that Waldon had called for backup in the form of a marked police car , but that it did not arrive until the shooting had already occurred .
According to KSTP , records show that Heilman had 17 convictions between 2002 and 2008 , crimes that including everything from littering to underage consumption to assault to possession of marijuana .
Despite Heilman 's checkered past , his father Mark Heilman told Minnesota 's Star Tribune newspaper that his son was turning his life around and was planning on starting a landscaping job in August .
" He got along with everyone , he had so many friends , " said Heilman 's uncle , speaking on behalf of his brother and Tyler 's father , Mark Heilman , who was meeting with lawyers .
" He liked to be outside and there was a lot of love there for his son , Haydin , " he said .
" It 's a tragedy and this should n't have happened . "
There is an incredible story out of Pakistan concerning the plight of what are called “ eunuchs ” in that country .
The term is used broadly to refer to transsexuals , transvestites , or hermaphrodites .
These marginalized individuals are forced to live in colonies and become prostitutes in a country that shuns and abuses them .
The story of Shazia is particularly horrific , including a forced castration in one of these camps .
Given the status of women in Pakistan , it is hard to be hopeful for these individuals in receiving protection and rights .
However , media coverage is the key to such awareness and this article is an excellent , if disturbing , insight into their plight .

WASHINGTON --
The pharmaceuticals industry , which President Barack Obama promised to " take on " during his campaign , is winning most of what it wants in the health - care overhaul .
The final contours of the legislation are far from settled , but the industry , led by a onetime powerful congressman , has notched a string of victories .
Legislation expected soon in the powerful Senate Finance Committee will leave out cost- cutting steps as part of an agreement with the industry and the White House , according to Congressional aides , industry lobbyists and others involved in the talks .
The missing items include two planks of Mr. Obama 's campaign platform : allowing cheaper drugs to be imported from Canada and giving the federal government the right to negotiate Medicare drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies .
While the industry has engaged in vigorous lobbying just as Mr. Obama took office , that alone does n't explain all the success .
Reimportation and Medicare drug - price negotiation are largely symbolic and Congressional researchers have said they wo n't save much money in the long run .
Mark Hanson comments on the recent upswing in real estate prices as indicated by the highly regarded S&P Case - Shiller Home Price Indexes .
It seems that , almost every few months now , there 's a new wrinkle in how home price changes are reported and , coming as it does amid what millions of people think is a bottom for home prices , this one 's a doozy .
Who is the Mid - to - High end Seller ?
Why Is This Important ?
Now , think about those that are selling these mid-to - high priced houses .
It is not the person who bought from 2005 - 2007 on a Pay Option ARM with 5 % down because they ca n’t sell .
It is the person who bought years ago that has enough equity to dump the price , sell , and have enough left over for the down payment on the house they plan to steal in the desert .
Even with the price dump , a person who bought in 1999 for $ 450 k — who saw their house price rise to $ 1.5 million by 2007 and subsequently drop to $ 700 k — realizes a price gain and so does CS .
Even though CS reduces the weighting of pair sales the longer ago they occurred — when this is all you have selling — it carries most of the weight .
The bottom line is that Case - Shiller reports what sold , period .
It is my opinion that the real estate market is so thin and bifurcated that what is selling today is not representative of the true real estate market .
It likely is not accurately representing properties purchased during the bubble years that are now worth a fraction of their purchase price because they are not transacting .
While I have n't read the details of how the index is calculated recently , one can immediately understand how the index values can be affected by how long the seller has owned the home after reading the following :
This is apparently part of a private letter to clients .
If anyone has a copy and would like to share some more details , please feel free to do so in the comments section or via email .
Maybe , I 'll drop Mark a line and ask him if he would like to share any more details about this because my interest is piqued .
Then again , I have n't checked Calculated Risk yet today and Bill might already have an analysis on this subject posted .
Anyway , this all makes a good deal of sense to me - aside from a few price ranges in a few areas of the country that may have hit bottom , there is much more work to do to get home prices back to more normal levels - and then there 's the typical " overshoot " .
' White supremacist found with bombs and SS handbook was on verge of launching terror campaign against non-British '
Accused : Neil Lewington planned to emulate notorious killers including London nail bomber David Copeland , the court heard
A Neo -Nazi plotted to launch a terror campaign against Asians with tennis balls converted into shrapnel bombs , the Old Bailey heard yesterday .
Neil Lewington , 43 , wanted to copy his murderous idols , including London nail bomber David Copeland and Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh , the jury was told .
The unemployed electrician used his expertise to amass the necessary components to carry out his attacks , which he implied he would begin by bombing the home of an Asian family , it was claimed .
But Lewington 's plans were thwarted when he was arrested for urinating on a railway platform .
A search of his bag uncovered two incendiary devices and a subsequent search of the home he shared with his parents allegedly unearthed a haul of bomb - making equipment and fascist literature .
Astonishingly , despite living with A NEO - Nazi plotted to launch a terror campaign against Asians with tennis balls converted into shrapnel bombs , the Old Bailey heard yesterday .
Neil Lewington , 43 , wanted to copy his murderous idols , including London nail bomber David Copeland and Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh , the jury was told .
The unemployed electrician used his expertise to amass the necessary components to carry out his attacks , which he implied he would begin by bombing the home of an Asian family , it was claimed .
But Lewington 's plans were thwarted when he was arrested for urinating on a railway platform .
A search of his bag uncovered two incendiary devices and a subsequent search of the home he shared with his parents allegedly unearthed a haul of bomb - making equipment and fascist literature .
Astonishingly , despite living with friend 's barbecue safely . '
The court heard a search of his home in Reading unearthed a Toys R Us chemistry set , canisters of weedkiller , timers , and videoed news footage of his white supremacist heroes .
It was , effectively , a ' bomb factory ' the jury was told .
Mr Altman said the finds proved Lewington ' was on the cusp of embarking on a campaign of terrorism against those he considered non-British ' .
He added : ' It 's abundantly clear that in the privacy of his bedroom , far from the gaze of his parents , this defendant had begun to manufacture improvised explosive devices , a production line from which he garnered the two devices he carried to Lowestoft .
' The fact he was travelling far from home in a public place with the constituent parts of such viable devices , including real explosive substances proves his intention to engage in terrorism .
' In addition to all that , the police discovered evidence of the defendant 's quite clear adherence to white supremacist and racist views . '
In his Waffen SS UK Members ' handbook , under the heading ' Targeting or Attacking Pakis ' he had allegedly written sub-sections which included ' observing Asians in their cars ' , ' planting motion sensitive bombs ' and ' hit and run by vehicles ' .
It also included a claim that the the Waffen SS UK , a hitherto unheard - of organisation , had 15 two - member cells planning random bombings to drive ' non-British ' people from the country .
The court heard Lewington – who called him self Aristocrat or Amadeus when chatting up women online – had boasted to one girlfriend , Army cadet instructor Barbara Baldwin , of making tennis ball bombs .
His possessions were said to have included three tennis balls , and a diagram showing one converted into a shrapnel bomb .
He allegedly told another girl he could attack an Asian family by throwing such bombs , and asked for the address of Asians on her street .
When confronted about the weedkiller in his bedroom , the accused claimed it was for gardening , the court heard .
' Needless to say , according to his parents he never touched the garden , ' said Mr Altman .
Lewington is accused of preparing for terrorism by having bomb parts in a public place and related counts including possessing explosives with intent to endanger life .
He denies all eight charges .
The case continues .

Of what makes her think so , she explains , “ Rob is , what , 22 ?
Zac is 21 ?
That ’s a joke …..
Boys in their 20s are a waste of time .
They have nothing to offer conversationally .
They ’re immature .

Krispy Kreme doughnuts go into production at the opening of the store at Harrods in London , October , 3 , 2003 .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts
Inc has reached a $ 40,000 fine settlement for violating immigration laws by hiring illegal immigrants , U.S. immigration police said Tuesday .
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency , or ICE , said an inspection revealed the company had employed dozens of unauthorized workers at a doughnut factory in Cincinnati , Ohio .
The audit found the firm did not have required paperwork for all workers at the plant .
The fine was settled last Friday , ICE said .
As part of the settlement , Krispy Kreme has taken measures to revise its immigration compliance program , and has agreed to begin implementing new procedures to prevent future violations of federal immigration laws , ICE said .
Immigration , particularly what to do with 12 million illegal immigrants living and working in the shadows , is a divisive topic in the United States .
Earlier this year , President Barack Obama ’s administration broke with a previous policy that targeted undocumented workers for deportation , and implemented instead a strategy to go after U.S. employers hiring illegal immigrants .
ICE announced last week , that 652 businesses around the country would be audited to establish if they were compliant with immigration laws .
The federal probe found that a third of American Apparel ’s factory workers in the Los Angeles area had supplied suspect or invalid records and were not authorized to work in the United States .
NEW YORK - The American Psychological Association declared yesterday that mental health professionals should not tell gay clients they can become straight through therapy or other treatments .
Instead , the APA urged therapists to consider multiple options , which could range from celibacy to switching churches , for helping clients whose sexual orientation and religious faith conflict .
In a resolution adopted on a 125 - to - 4 vote by the APA ’s governing council , and in a comprehensive report based on two years of research , the 150,000 - member association put itself firmly on record in opposition of so - called “ reparative therapy , ’’ which seeks to change sexual orientation .
No solid evidence exists that such change is likely , says the report , and some research suggests that efforts to produce change could be harmful , inducing depression and suicidal tendencies .
The APA had criticized reparative therapy in the past , but a six - member task force added weight to this position by examining 83 studies on sexual orientation change conducted since 1960 .
Its comprehensive report was endorsed by the APA ’s governing council in Toronto , where the association ’s annual meeting is being held this weekend .
The report breaks new ground in its detailed assessment of how therapists should deal with gay clients struggling to remain loyal to a faith that disapproves of homosexuality .
Judith Glassgold , a Highland Park , N.J. , psychologist who was chairwoman of the task force , said she hoped the document could help calm the polarized debate between religious conservatives who believe in the possibility of changing sexual orientation and the many mental health professionals who reject that option .
“ The religious psychotherapists have to open up their eyes to the potential positive aspects of being gay or lesbian .
Secular therapists have to recognize that some people will choose their faith over their sexuality , ’’ Glassgold said in an interview .
In dealing with gay clients from conservative faiths , the report says , therapists should be “ very cautious ’ ’ about suggesting treatments aimed at altering their same - sex attractions .
“ Practitioners can assist clients through therapies that do not attempt to change sexual orientation , but rather involve acceptance , support , and identity exploration and development without imposing a specific identity outcome , ’’ the report says .

A musical score handwritten by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is displayed in Nantes , western France , January 22 , 2009 .
The International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg , Austria , said it had discovered two new works by Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - The International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg , Austria , said it had discovered two new works by Mozart .
The foundation said in a statement that it had “ identified two works , which have long been in the possession of the Foundation , as compositions of the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . ”
Details of the two pieces written for the piano will be revealed at a press conference on August 2 .
The International Mozarteum Foundation was founded as a non-profit organization in 1880 to focus on the life and work of Mozart by holding concerts , running museums and promoting research regarding the composer .
Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and died in Vienna in 1791 at the age of 35 .
He began playing piano at an early age and was composing from the age of five , going on to write more than 600 works and becoming one of the most prolific classical composers .
It is not the first time in recent years that works by Mozart have resurfaced .
Last year a library in Nantes in western France said it had discovered that a musical score by Mozart that had been donated by a private collector at the end of the 19th century was an original rather than a copy as previously thought .
This chapter covers some of the general steps you can take to isolate the cause of a wide range of Ubuntu Server problems and work out their solutions .

Troubleshooting is a topic that is near and dear to me .
While there are many other areas of system administration that I enjoy , I do n’t think anything compares to the excitement of tracking down the root cause of an obscure problem .
Good troubleshooting is a combination of Sherlock Holmes–style detective work , intuition , and a little luck .
You might even argue that some people have a knack for troubleshooting while others struggle with it , but in my mind it ’s something that all sysadmins get better at the more problems they run into .
While this chapter discusses troubleshooting , there are a number of common problems that can cause your Ubuntu system to not boot or to run in an incomplete state .
I have moved all of these topics into their own chapter on rescue and recovery and have provided specific steps to fix common problems with the Ubuntu rescue CD .
So if you are trying to solve a problem at the moment , check Chapter 12 first to see if I have already outlined a solution .
If not , come back here to get the more general steps to isolate the cause of your problem and work out its solution .
In this chapter I ’m going to discuss some aspects of my general philosophy on troubleshooting that could be applied to a wide range of problems .
Then I will cover a few common problems that you might run into and introduce some tools and techniques to help solve them .
By the end of the chapter you should have a head start the next time a problem turns up .
After all , in many organizations downtime is measured in dollars , not minutes , so there is a lot to be said for someone who can find a root cause quickly .
General Troubleshooting Philosophy
While there are specific steps you can take to address certain computer problems , most troubleshooting techniques rely on the same set of rules .
Below I will discuss some of these rules that will help make you a better troubleshooter .
Divide the Problem Space
When I ’m faced with an unknown issue , I apply the same techniques as when I have to pick a number between 1 and 100 .
If you have ever played this game , you know that most people fall into one of two categories : the random guessers and the narrowers .
The random guessers might start by choosing 15 , then hear that the number is higher and pick 23 , then hear it is still higher .
Eventually they might either luck into the right number or pick so many numbers that only the right number remains .
In either case they use far more guesses than they need to .
Many people approach troubleshooting the same way :
They choose solutions randomly until one happens to work .
Such a person might eventually find the problem , but it takes way longer than it should .
In contrast to the random guessers , the narrowers strategically choose numbers that narrow the problem in half each time .
Let ’s say the number is 80 , for instance ; their guesses would go as follows : 50 , 75 , 88 , 82 , 78 , 80 .
With each guess , the list of numbers that could contain the answer is reduced by half .
When people like this troubleshoot a computer problem , their time is spent finding ways to divide the problem space in half as much as possible .
As I go through specific problems in this chapter , you will see this methodology in practice .
Favor Quick , Simple Tests over Slow , Complex Tests
What I mean here is that as you narrow down the possible causes of a problem , you will often end up with a few hypotheses that are equally likely .
One hypothesis can be tested quickly but the other takes some time .
For instance , if a machine can’t seem to communicate with the network , a quick test could be to see if the network cable is plugged in , while a longer test would involve more elaborate software tests on the host .
If the quick test isolates the problem , you get the solution that much faster .
If you still need to try the longer test , you are n’t out that much extra time .
Favor Past Solutions
Unless you absolutely prevent a problem from ever happening again , it ’s likely that when a symptom that you ’ve seen before pops up , it could have the same solution .
Over the years you ’ll find that you develop a common list of things you try first when you see a particular problem to rule out all of the common causes before you move on to more exotic hypotheses .
Of course , you will have problems you ’ve never seen before , too — that ’s part of the fun of troubleshooting — but when you test some of your past solutions first , you will find you solve problems faster .
Good Communication
Is Critical When Collaborating
If you are part of a team that is troubleshooting a problem , you absolutely must have good communication among team members .
That could be as simple as yelling across cubicle walls , or it could mean setting up a chat room .
A common problem when a team works an issue is multiple members testing the same hypothesis .
With good communication each person can tackle a different hypothesis and report the results .
These results can then lead to new hypotheses that can be divided among the team members .
One final note : Favor communication methods that allow multiple people to communicate at the same time .
This means that often chat rooms work much better than phones for problem solving , since over the phone everyone has to wait for a turn to speak ; in a chat room multiple people can communicate at once .
Understand How Systems Work
The more deeply you understand how a system works , the faster you can rule out causes of problems .
Over the years I ’ve noticed that when a problem occurs , people first tend to blame the technology they understand the least .
At one point in my career , every time a network problem occurred , everyone immediately blamed DNS , even when it appeared obvious ( at least to me ) that not only was DNS functioning correctly , it never had actually been the cause of any of the problems .
One day we decided to hold a lecture to explain how DNS worked and traced an ordinary DNS request from the client to every DNS server and back .
Afterward everyone who attended the class stopped jumping to DNS as the first cause of network problems .
There are core technologies with which every sysadmin deals on a daily basis , such as TCP / IP networking , DNS , Linux processes , programming , and memory management ; it is crucial that you learn about these in as much depth as possible if you want to find a solution to a problem quickly .
Document Your Problems and Solutions
Many organizations have as part of their standard practice a postmortem meeting after every production issue .
A postmortem allows the team to document the troubleshooting steps they took to arrive at a root cause as well as what solution ultimately fixed the issue .
Not only does this help make sure that there is no disagreement about what the root cause is , but when everyone is introduced to each troubleshooting step , it helps make all the team members better problem solvers going forward .
When you document your problem - solving steps , you have a great guide you can go to the next time a similar problem crops up so it can be solved that much faster .
Use the Internet , but Carefully
The Internet is an incredibly valuable resource when you troubleshoot a problem , especially if you are able to articulate it in search terms .
After all , you are rarely the only person to face a particular problem , and in many cases other people have already come up with the solution .
Be careful with your Internet research , though .
Often your results are only as good as your understanding of the problem .
I ’ve seen many people go off on completely wrong paths to solve a problem because of a potential solution they found on the Internet .
After all , a search for “ Ubuntu server not on network ” will turn up all sorts of completely different problems irrelevant to your issue .
Resist Rebooting
OK , so those of us who have experience with Windows administration have learned over the years that when you have a weird problem , a reboot often fixes it .
Resist this “ technique ” on your Ubuntu servers !
I ’ve had servers with uptimes measured in years because most problems found on a Linux machine can be solved without a reboot .
The problem with rebooting a machine ( besides ruining your uptime ) is that if the problem does go away , you may never know what actually caused it .
That means you ca n’t solve it for good and will ultimately see the problem again .
As attractive as rebooting might be , keep it as your last resort .
Scribd Will Let Writers Sell Their Own Books For Whatever
The document - hosting website Scribd is going to let you sell documents that you upload , turning them into one giant free ebook host that even has a pretty good profit - sharing deal .
Today is probably a very bad day at Amazon and Google .
Whereas Amazon will keep most of the profits when they offer the SAME EXACT DEAL ( except infinitely worse , because the only people who can buy Amazon products are those who bought Kindles or who have iPhones ) , Scribd is offering an 80 / 20 split in favor of writers , and are also letting publishers choose whether or not to encrypt their ebooks .
To make matters worse for Amazon , books available on Scribd can be read in .pdf form , meaning that you can read them on a Kindle , too , unless Amazon stops supporting .pdfs .
Publishers will also be able to set their own prices for Scribd books , giving them self - determination when it comes to value .
So , really , writers have absolutely no incentive to deal with Amazon anymore as their " bookstore , " especially since the next generation of ebook readers will surely be touchscreen netbooks , making the Kindle look like a Tiger handheld next to the future 's Game Boy .
Additionally , unlike the way Google will run their book selling project ( which will be the way they run YouTube ) , Scribd will not be censoring or removing " objectionable " content , and will be instead letting U.S. law dictate what is safe for people to read .
Since they are trying to create a SERVICE for publishers instead of REPLACING publishers , Scribd will be content - neutral , and will not be manipulating content in order to control the market .
Getting your books delisted or deranked from Scribd 's site will never be an issue , because there wo n't be a " ranking " or " listing " service , beyond a " best sellers " list .
Right now , the top Scribd best - seller is something called " New Zealand Adventure Guide . " From the New York Times " Scribd hopes its more open and flexible system will give it a leg up on Amazon , which has become the largest player in the burgeoning market for e-books .
Amazon sets the retail price for books in its Kindle store and keeps the majority of the revenue on some titles , which has publishers worried that Amazon is amassing too much control over the nascent market .
Amazon also allows those books to be read only on its Kindle devices and in Kindle software on the iPhone .
" One reason publishers are excited to work with us is that they worry that publishing channels are contracting as Amazon and Google are gaining control over the e-book space , " said Jared Friedman , chief technology officer and a founder of Scribd .
"
If Scribd is smart , they will do the following things : 1. Support audio files that people can also upload to go along with the ebooks2 .

In April 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars , H.M.S. Surprise , a British frigate , is under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey .
Aubrey and the Surprise 's current orders are to track and capture or destroy a French privateer named Acheron .
The Acheron is currently in the Atlantic off South America headed toward the Pacific in order to extend Napoleon 's reach of the wars .
This task will be a difficult one as Aubrey quickly learns in an initial battle with the Acheron that it is a bigger and faster ship than the Surprise , which puts the Surprise at a disadvantage .
Aubrey 's single - mindedness in this seemingly impossible pursuit puts him at odds with the Surprise 's doctor and naturalist , Stephen Maturin , who is also Aubrey 's most trusted advisor on board and closest friend .
Facing other internal obstacles which have resulted in what they consider a string of bad luck , Aubrey ultimately uses Maturin 's scientific exploits to figure out a way to achieve his and the ship 's seemingly impossible goal .

Simon Singh is a science journalist who last year wrote an article in the Guardian critical of the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) for promoting chiropractic treatment for certain childhood ailments .
Singh characterized these treatments as “ bogus ” because they lack evidence to back up claims for clinical efficacy .
The BCA responded by suing Singh for libel .
In the English court system the person being sued for libel is essentially guilty until proven innocent , and even successfully defending oneself can be ruinously expensive .
Therefore suing for libel in English court is a very successful strategy for silencing critics .
This case resulted in a bit of a backlash against the BCA , who were accused of silencing legitimate and very necessary public scientific debate regarding the safety and efficacy of medical interventions .
The BCA could have simply responded by providing evidence to back up their claims , and the Guardian even offered them space to do so , but instead they sued .
Part of this backlash is a movement , supported by many scientific organizations , to keep libel laws out of science .
Recently the BCA has responded to this backlash with a statement and a list of studies they claim provides the evidence Singh said was lacking .
I wo n’t address their attempt at damage control , but rather focus on their response regarding the evidence .
They write :
In the spirit of wider scientific debate , and having taken appropriate professional advice , the BCA has decided that free speech would be best facilitated by releasing details of research that exists to support the claims which Dr. Singh stated were bogus .
This proves that far from being “ not a jot of evidence ” to support the BCA ’s position , there is actually a significant amount .
They follow their statement with a list of 29 studies .
This is a short reference list to support several individual medical claims , but actually it is a bloated list that contains many references that do not provide evidence for the claims of the BCA that Sign was criticizing .
This is how the 29 references break down :
3 – Risks of NSAID medication
1 – Nature of evidence - based medicine
3 – opinion , chiropractic practice
1 – letter to editor
2 – review
2 – risks of chiropractic
8 – colic
3 – nocturnal enuresis
3 – otitis media
3 – asthma
Therefore , out of the 29 references , only 17 actually provide evidence for the efficacy claims for chiropractic for these four pediatric indications .
When each indication is considered , the list of supporting studies is embarrassingly thin .
They are also of very poor quality and , as we will see , cherry picked .
It should also be noted that the notion of spinal manipulation for medical issues , like a middle ear infection , is highly implausible .
Such implausible claims should require robust clinical evidence before putting them into practice .
The evidence presented by the BCA is far from robust , and when the totality of evidence is considered it is actually negative .
Colic
Of the 8 studies presented for colic , one is a preliminary assessment of cranial osteopathy for colic .
In the past chiropractors have complained that studies of non-chiropractic forms of manipulation cannot be used to dismiss the efficacy of chiropractic .
It is disingenuous of the BCA to pad their list of evidence for chiropractic by including a study of osteopathic manipulation .
Two of the studies were case reports .
One report is a response to a questionnaire , and there were three unblinded or single - blinded studies , and one uncontrolled study .
Therefore , not one prospective , double - blind , placebo - controlled study is presented .
All we are given is low grade evidence .
Also , the BCA left off the best designed study , which not surprisingly was negative .
Olafsdottir et al ( 1 ) studied 86 infants with colic in a randomized controlled trial and found :
“ Chiropractic spinal manipulation is no more effective than placebo in the treatment of infantile colic . ”
How does the BCA justify omitting this study from their list ?
Do they think that an open scientific discussion of evidence means presenting only the evidence that seems to support their position ?
The BCA also neglected to reference a review of the evidence for chiropractic for colic by Hughes and Bolton ( 2 ) which concludes :
“ The evidence suggests that chiropractic has no benefit over placebo in the treatment of infantile colic .
However , there is good evidence that taking a colicky infant to a chiropractor will result in fewer reported hours of colic by the parents . ”
Their conclusion was curious – chiropractic treatment for colic does not work but parents report that it does .
Ordinarily science - based practitioners would simply interpret such results as being consistent with a placebo effect alone .
What we see is the typical pattern of evidence for an ineffective treatment – low grade evidence showing an effect , but higher grade controlled evidence showing no effect above placebo .
The bottom line is that existing evidence suggests that chiropractic manipulation is not effective in the treatment of colic .
But the BCA cherry picked only the low grade evidence that supported their claim .
Asthma
Of the three asthma studies presented , two were of osteopathic manipulation and the third is a case series and pilot study .
The two osteopathic studies were looking at markers of pulmonary function , and not clinical outcomes .
Again , it is very telling that these three weak studies are all the BCA could come up with .
And again , the BCA left off their list the largest and most definitive study of chiropractic treatment for childhood asthma – the 1998 New England Journal of Medicine study ( 3 ) .
This was a large randomized controlled trial , which found :
In children with mild or moderate asthma , the addition of chiropractic spinal manipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit .
The pattern repeats again – the best data shows no effect from manipulation .
It is my sincere contention that if the exact same evidence ( even leaving out the lack of plausibility ) existed for a medical treatment , it would be abandoned as a worthless dead end .
At the very least , use would stop until further research were done .
There might even be concerns about the ethics of further research given the negative evidence and lack of plausibility .
The BCA and chiropractors in general have simply ignored or dismissed the negative evidence of chiropractic for asthma and instead cherry pick the very low - grade evidence that seems to support what they want to claim .
This makes chiropractic treatment for asthma “ bogus . ”
Otitis Media
There is precious little research into the treatment of acute otitis media ( middle ear infection ) with chiropractic adjustment .
The three studies cited are all retrospective or uncontrolled .
There are no double - blind placebo controlled studies – and therefore no reliable evidence upon which to base a clinical claim .
Nocturnal Enuresis
Again , we have three weak studies and nothing to defend the implausible claim that chiropractic treats nocturnal enuresis .
One of the studies cited is by Reed et al , which concludes :
“ The mean pre- to post - treatment change in the wet night frequency for the treatment group compared with the control group did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.067 ) . ”
In other words – this is a negative study .
The comparison of treatment to control showed no statistically significant difference .
There was a trend – but they are not reliable enough to serve as a basis for clinical conclusions .
That is the whole point of statistical significance .
This was a small study , so you can say that it was simply not powerful enough to detect an effect – but that still leaves us without evidence to support the claim for an effect .
A Cochrane review of the evidence regarding chiropractic and other alternative treatments for nocturnal enuresis concluded :
“ There was weak evidence to support the use of hypnosis , psychotherapy , acupuncture and chiropractic but it was provided in each case by single small trials , some of dubious methodological rigour . ”
Conclusion
The BCA ’s list of evidence for these four clinical claims is not impressive .
The best they have to offer is a few weak and poorly designed studies .
They also ignore larger better trials where available that are negative .
A more thorough assessment of the evidence for chiropractic treatment for asthma and colic reveals evidence for lack of efficacy .
For otitis media and nocturnal enuresis there is a lack of evidence for efficacy .
Despite the state of the evidence , the BCA feels they are justified in promoting chiropractic for these pediatric indications .
The reader can decide if the term “ bogus ” applies .

Brain metastases most commonly arise from lung and breast cancers Scientists believe they have found a potential way to stop cancers establishing themselves in the brain , and essentially becoming terminal .
A UK team discovered cancer cells hijack the brain 's blood vessels to get all the nourishment they need to seed themselves there .
Key to this is a protein on the surface of cancer cells called integrin which allows them to stick to the vessels .
Drugs that block integrin may stop cancer spread PLoS ONE journal reports .
A fifth of all cancer patients will eventually have disease that has spread to the brain .
Now we can try to come up with drugs to target this protein and stop metastatic cancer cells from taking hold in the brain
Lead researcher Dr Shawn Carbonell Indeed , brain metastases are the most common malignant tumours of the central nervous system , outnumbering by 10 times those that originate in the brain .
Once a cancer has spread to the brain the outlook is not good - even with maximal treatment the median survival is nine months .
Scientists at Oxford University , with funding from Cancer Research UK , the Medical Research Council and the US National Institutes of Health , wanted to investigate exactly how cancers spread .
New understanding Previously it had generally been assumed that tumour cells grew on the cells that make up the grey and white matter of the brain - the neurons and glial cells .
But Dr Shawn Carbonell and his team found that the metastatic cancer cells start to grow on the walls of blood vessels in the brain in over 95 % of cases , and not on the nerve cells .
They looked at samples of a range of cancer cell types from humans and mice .
From this they also discovered that the removal of the integrin stopped the cancer cells from attaching to the blood vessels and starting to grow .
Dr Carbonell said although this finding was still a long way from coming up with a new treatment for those with brain metastases , it was exciting .
" We have identified the protein that cancer cells use to anchor themselves to blood vessels in the brain .
Now we can try to come up with drugs to target this protein and stop metastatic cancer cells from taking hold in the brain . "
Dr Helen George of Cancer Research UK said the discovery was " an important part of the puzzle " and paved the way for new and much - needed treatments to tackle cancers that have spread to the brain .

Route 3265 is a major traffic artery in the southwest Hebron hills , linking villages in the area with the city of Hebron .
Over the years , it served the 45,000 Palestinians who live in the area .
In recent years , settlers from the unauthorized outposts Negohot and Mitzpeh Lachish have also used the road .
In 2000 , Palestinians shot at a vehicle driving along the road and killed a settler from Negohot .
Since 2001 , the army has completely prohibited Palestinians from driving along the road and even from walking along it .
The army is obliged to ensure the safety of residents in the Occupied Territories , including settlers ; however , this obligation must not be fulfilled by applying collective punishment .
Prohibiting Palestinians from using the road severely infringes basic rights and the quality of life of locals , who are dependent on social and economic ties with other villages and with the city of Hebron .
Two families have been especially harmed by the closing of the road to Palestinian traffic : as the route was the sole access road to their houses , they now live in isolation and are virtually imprisoned in their houses .
The only way they can reach other communities is by walking long distances through the surrounding mountains .
Even then , they are frequently attacked and threatened by settlers .
The video documents the reality of the Jadallah family , one of the two .
In 2006 , the Association for Civil Rights in Israel filed a petition , on behalf of the families and the heads of the councils in the southwest Hebron hills , against the blocking of the road and of its intersection with Route 354 , which connects the northern and southern parts of the area .
The petitioners contend that the prohibition on movement constitutes collective punishment on basis of national - ethnic origin .
Following the filing of the petition , the respondents opened the intersection to Palestinian movement , but stated that the road would remain closed .
The court finished hearing the petition in January 2008 and has not yet given its decision .
Due to technical restrictions , subtitles could not be added .
The translation follows :
Even in the weird reality of the occupation , some situations are particularly absurd .
Every morning , the Jadallah children cross the road on which their house is built .
A road on which they are forbidden to travel or walk along , and go by foot about 3 kilometers to school in the nearby village of Faqiqs , along a path full of sharp ascents and descents difficult for even good walkers .
The prohibited road , Route 3265 , used to take them directly to school , a maximum of two minutes from their home .
Hafez Muhammad Jadallah :
This road is forbidden .
The army forbids us to use it , I 'm not sure why .
They 're afraid of problems .
This road connects Beit ' Awwa , Dura , Hebron , the whole area west of Hebron .
We live here .
We reach it via the mountain .
The house is surrounded by mountains , and for the family , the road is the sole traffic artery .
To go shopping , the brother Khaled walks with his bags over the hills about three hours .
Meanwhile , the road stands empty , waiting for one of the 200 Israelis who live in the area , who are allowed to use the road .
There 's nothing to do .
The children hardly go out .
Where can they go ?
To wander in the hills ?
Nobody comes or goes .
If we have an important errand , I go out , but if not , I stay at home all day .
Samaher Jadallah :
We had a car , it took us where we needed .
Our own car .
But since we have n't used it , its fallen apart .
Now it 's behind the house , a wreck .
When we took the car , it used to be easy to do the shopping .
But now we haul our purchases by donkey .
Do you know why they closed the road ?
Security reasons , they said .
Adv. Limor Yehuda , ACRI : Several security incidents took place in the area .
In December 2000 , there was a shooting attack that killed an Israeli .
This is a major road in the area that served dozens of villages and small towns , some 45,000 people .
In comparison , the Israelis using the road are from the unauthorized outpost Negohot and from an authorized outpost that was built next to it a few years ago - Mitzpeh Lachish .
Less than 200 people , based on the known figures .
The illegality and basic wrongdoing in this case are outrageous .
It is a fundamental moral and legal principle that we are forbidden to prohibit people from using a road based solely on their ethnic origin .
This is certainly true when we 're talking about local residents in occupied territory .
The primary duty of the IDF is to enable Palestinians to travel on this road .
If it also wants Israelis to use the road , who , as we recall , are not residents of the occupied territory but were brought there by us , their safety must be ensured in ways that do n't harm the local residents .
This is a fundamental condition that cannot be compromised .
On 22 October 2009 , the High Court of Justice accepted the residents ' petition to open the road and gave the army three months to fimplement another solution .

RIMINI , Italy ( Reuters ) - The European Union will issue new immigration policy proposals by the end of October , Sweden ’s Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said on Sunday , responding to Italy ’s plea for more coordinated EU action .
Two of a group of 48 would - be immigrants are led barefoot from an Italian Guardia di Finanza patrol boat at the Sicilian city of Siracusa May 11 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Antonio Parrinello
“ We will have a first proposal from the EU with regard to distribution criteria for immigration flows among the 27 ( EU member states ) , ” Bildt said on the sidelines of a conference at the Italian seaside town of Rimini .
The foreign minister of Italy , a country where thousands of migrants land each year after perilous journeys across the Mediterranean from Africa , said earlier in the day the problem must not be left to countries on the bloc ’s edges .
“ We must consider this a European problem .
The EU has made many statements ... but has not yet said just what should happen when a group of migrants reaches the borders of Europe , ” Franco Frattini told a news conference .
On Thursday Italian authorities found a boat carrying five Eritrean migrants who said 73 others had died during the crossing .
“ All we Europeans , all 27 countries , must bear responsibility for these people , ” Frattini said .
Bildt said the European Commission would issue a policy draft in time for a scheduled EU foreign ministers meeting at the end of October .
This would only be a first step , he said , since “ such a big problem can not be solved in a single meeting . ”
Sweden assumed the 6 - month EU presidency in July .
Italy has asked Malta to let it take over sea rescues in some Maltese waters , saying the tiny EU island state was incapable of doing the job properly .
On Saturday Malta rejected the proposal .
Frattini said talks with Malta must continue , perhaps involving other countries .
“ We continue to believe the talks which have been going on for 10 years with Malta over that area of sea are indispensable for the whole international community , ” Frattini said .
Some 36,900 illegal immigrants arrived in Italy by boat last year , a rise of 75 percent from 2007 , according to the Interior Ministry .
Bats may have a clever way of catching prey , but it turns out the tiger moth has some tricks of its own to avoid becoming a bat ’s next meal .
According to a study published in Science , the tiger moth disrupts the sound waves the bat uses home in on prey by emitting its own ultrasound blasts .
Researchers knew that the tiger moth emitted ultrasound waves , but they were n’t sure why .
Previous studies indicated the moth ’s sounds might serve to startle the bats , or warn them that the insects were unpalatable .
The new research , however , tested both of these theories .
The scientists had so - called big brown bats hunt tiger moths in a chamber fitted with ultrasonic recording equipment and high - speed infrared video .
If the moth sound is used to startle bats , then in the chamber the bats should be disrupted on first attack , then learn to ignore the ultrasonic click , the team figured .
That did n’t happen .
If the moths ’ clicks are warnings that the insects taste bad , then the bats should hear the click , bite the moth — and never do so again whenever they hear the sound .
That did n’t happen either [ National Geographic News ] .
Instead , the bats tended to miss the tiger moths when the insects emitted the ultrasonic cry .
The scientists found that the tactic employed by the Bertholdia trigona tiger moth is the insect equivalent of electronic countermeasures used in modern warfare .
Like signals used to jam enemy radar , the moth sends out beams of high frequency sound which interfere with the bats ’ echo- location system [ Telegraph ] .
Over time , these bursts of sound significantly decreased the number of moths the bats were able to locate and catch .
When scientists further investigated the way these moths produce sounds , they found that they are especially well - adapted to emitting the type of ultrasound waves that make it difficult for bats to find them .
That ’s because the moths make up to 450 clicks in one - tenth of a second .
“ That ’s essential , because a bat ’s entire attack sequence can last just one second , maybe two seconds on the long end , and so the moths have to be quick , listen to the bat echolocation calls and then figure out the right time to make the right sounds to jam them ” [ LiveScience ] , said researcher Aaron Corcoran .

During the NACA project run by Publicitas Ltd. , 4 m lines of COBOL were automatically trans - coded ( migrated ) toward their Java equivalent .
The company claims that the recurrent annual savings in cash - outs amount to a total of 3 m euros and has released the tools from the NACA project under GPL .
Didier Durand and Pierre - Jean Ditscheid made a presentation about it at at Jazoon09 last week , which is available online .
Pierre described the architecture of the " transcoding compiler " :
many levels of cache to maximize performances of the new Java version of the old application .
Through them , our Java - transcoded transactions and batches have better performances than their Cobol ancestors used to have on mainframe .
pre-allocation of all program variable structures ( COMMAREA of COBOL ) to further improve performances but also to minimize garbage collection that freezes the system while running .
strongly object - oriented architecture of resulting Java objects in order to maximize the effect of all controls done by compiler .
As example , each old COBOL program becomes a Java class whose existence is checked at compile - time rather than at runtime .
Very useful when your application is 4 millions lines of code like ours and when you want to track down every typing mistake in a continuous integration architecture like ours
strong integration with Eclipse IDE for highest productivity for developpers : we even developed a plug - in to facilitate debugging and edition of old COBOL programs from Eclipse
line - by - line equivalence between old COBOL programs and newly transcoded Java classes .
The home developers do n't get lost : they receive afterwards a Java application with the exact same structure as the original COBOL version
support of IBM JVM as well as Sun JVM in order to also allow for the transcoding of stored procedures
support of distinct character sets and encoding schemes ( EBCDIC ) between mainframe & Linux .
Support of all resulting possibilities for data sorting .
full management of multi- level COBOL data structures in Java independently of the UTF encoding ( 2 bytes per char ) used by Java
transparency of wrapping framework ( raw JVM , Apache Tomcat , etc... ) for the application
etc ...
While Didier emphasized the key aspects of such a project :
economic motivation as core driver : move from a multi-million ( CHF or euros ) mainframe environment to an incredibly cheap and nimble farm of Linux Intel - based servers .
The massive savings ( 3 millions euros / year in our case ) allow for a quick auto - financing of the project far before its end .
The main virtue of Open Source for a company like us remains clearly its very very low price .
migrate people with technology : we believe that we succeeded in our project because we clearly demonstrated very early on to the people in place that they would find a new interesting job in the final constellation .
That generated their full commitment to the project !
iso - functionality as a must : migrating in such a manner prevents months of discussion about the final target .
But , mostly , it allows for 100 % automatic migration , a key factor for quality in the transcoding .
no big - bang but numerous reversible steps : such a total migration with ( tens of ) thousands of new steps can never successfully reach the ends if you try big steps .
Permanent incremental progress toward the goal is a much better approach .
The nice consequences : small steps generate smaller local trouble when problems arise .
Your users remain much more patient this way !

NacaTrans ( license GPL - approx .
83′00 lines of code code & 690 Java classes ) : our transcoder that allowed us to convert 100 % automatically the 4 millions lines of our PUB 2000 application in COBOL to Java .
It is very much based on compiler technologies .
It analyzes the structure of the initial COBOL programs ( supposed 100 % valid ) to bring them in an intermediate xml structure before generating the final Java code that extensively calls functions and uses classes of the runtime library NacaRT , itself depending on JLib .
This new Java source code was very carefully designed : each line of Cobol generates very intentionally a single corresponding line of Java .
The aim is to look like as much as possible like the original COBOL code in order to ease the maintenance by the original developers / maintainers who master the structure of their original Java programs .
The completeness of the accepted syntax for all variants of Cobol is of course not guaranteed .
But our own 4 millions of lines of code as well as additional tests on other external application tend to prove that the current coverage of Cobol by NacaTrans is already very high .
We want to improve this coverage through your feedback for valid constructs that we do n’t support yet .

Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) hat der Ansicht des Familienressorts widersprochen , wonach das spätere Inkrafttreten des umkämpften Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes nicht zu Verzögerungen bei den im Raum stehenden Web - Sperren führen könnte .
Im Hause Ursula von der Leyens ( CDU ) herrscht die Auffassung , dass die Blockaden pünktlich Mitte Oktober greifen .
Die fünf " wesentlichen Anbieter " hätten sich ja bereits vertraglich gegenüber dem Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) bis zu diesem Zeitpunk zum freiwilligen Sperren kinderpornographischer Seiten verpflichtet , lautet die Ansage .
Ganz anders sieht die Sache das Justizministerium : " Sie können in Grundrechte nur auf Basis eines Gesetzes eingreifen " , erklärte ein Sprecher Zypries ' gegenüber heise online .
Deswegen seien die wiederholten Anläufe von der Leyens zu Web - Sperren mit dem Gesetz auf eine " klare rechtliche Grundlage " gestellt worden .
Auslöser des erneuten Streits zwischen den beiden Ministerinnen der großen Koalition ist die Tatsache , dass das federführende Bundeswirtschaftsministerium das " Gesetz zur Erschwerung des Zugangs zu kinderpornographischen Inhalten in Kommunikationsnetzen " im Nachhinein zur sogenannten Notifizierung an die EU - Kommission gemeldet hat .
Somit konnte das Vorhaben nicht an den Bundespräsidenten zur Prüfung und Ausstellung weitergeleitet werden und auch nicht planmäßig am 1 .
August Gültigkeit erlangen .
Notifizierungspflichtig ist das Gesetz zwar nach Auffassung der Bundesregierung nicht , unterstreicht das Familienministerium .
Eine Anfrage der EU - Kommission im laufenden Gesetzgebungsverfahren habe allerdings vermuten lassen , dass die Brüsseler Behörde eine andere Rechtsaufassung vertreten könnte .
Zur " Vermeidung von Verzögerungen " habe sich die Bundesregierung daher " einmütig " entschlossen , den Gesetzesentwurf " vorsorglich " in Brüssel vorzulegen .
Dies sei " zügig " geschehen , nachdem der endgültige Entwurfstext feststand .
Zugleich habe Berlin auf die eigene Rechtsposition hingewiesen .
Die mit der Meldung bei der Kommission einhergehende Stillhaltefrist endet gemäß dem Bescheid des Familienressorts am 8 .
Oktober .
Die Bundesregierung werde deshalb das weitere Gesetzgebungsverfahren nach Ablauf dieser Frist veranlassen .
Für die Umsetzung der Sperrmaßnahmen habe das Intermezzo keine Folgen .
Beobachter , Experten und das Justizministerium sind anderer Meinung .
Laut dem Münsteraner Informationsrechtler Thomas Hoeren müssen aufgrund der " Schlamperei " der Bundesregierung bereits die Notifizierungsfristen neu berechnet werden .
Das Gesetz könne so frühestens zum 1 . November in Kraft treten .
Der Innenexperte der Süddeutschen Zeitung , Heribert Prantl , warf gar die Frage auf , ob das Regelwerk in der Zwischenzeit nicht verfalle .
Hintergrund ist die sogenannte Diskontinuitätsbestimmung .
Ihr zufolge wandern alle Bestrebungen des Bundestags in den Papierkorb des Gesetzgebers , die nicht vor dem Auslaufen einer Legislaturperiode in trockenen Tüchern sind .
Da das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz aber vom Bundestag bereits beschlossen ist sowie den Bundesrat passiert hat und nur noch die Unterschrift des Bundespräsidenten fehlt , gehen Rechtsexperten von einer " Mindermeinung " aus .
Horst Köhler könne das Vorhaben durchaus theoretisch auch im Oktober nach den Wahlen noch ausfertigen .
Das Familienministerium betont ebenfalls , dass das Vorhaben aufgrund der Notifizierung nicht der Diskontinuität unterfalle .
Weiter Bestand haben nach Angaben des Justizministeriums aber die " erheblichen verfassungsrechtlichen " Bedenken , die Zypries gegenüber den Vertragsentwürfen für Abkommen mit großen Providern im März vorbrachte .
Die mit den Blockaden unweigerlich einhergehenden Eingriffe etwa in das Fernmeldegeheimnis ließen sich auch nicht durch den Einbau einer Klausel zur Berechtigung von Sperren in die Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen ( AGB ) der Provider quasi wegzaubern , schrieb die SPD - Politikerin damals an Frau von der Leyen .
An diesen prinzipiellen Einwänden gegen eine privatrechtliche Lösung habe sich nichts geändert , stellte ihr Sprecher nun klar .
Zudem würden die europäischen Melderegeln grundsätzlich auch bei privaten Vereinbarungen wie den Sperrverträgen greifen , schreibt die Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ( FAZ ) am heutigen Mittwoch .
Sollte die EU - Kommission hier ebenfalls eine Notifizierung verlangen , müssten auch die vertraglich vereinbarten Blockaden drei Monate lang aufgehalten werden .
Nicht teilen will das Justizministerium die Zweifel an der Verfassungsmäßigkeit auch des Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes , die der frühere Bundesverfassungsrichter Wolfgang Hoffmann - Riem vergangene Woche geäußert hatte .
Zum einen hätten die Länder selbst keine Einwände vorgebracht , was die Zuständigkeit des Bundes betreffe , meinte der Sprecher .
Zum anderen halte die Bundesregierung die Initiative trotz aller Umgehungsmöglichkeiten für ein geeignetes Mittel im Kampf gegen die Kinderpornographie .
Das Gesetz sei daher verhältnismäßig .

When you have multiple computers on your desk , it can be very annoying to switch keyboard an mouse each time you want to do something on one of the other computers .
So , you can solve this by just using one keyboard and one mouse for multiple computers without buying a hardware switch .
Synergy is a package , available from the repository that lets you share the mouse and keyboard over a range of different computers .
When synergy is active , your keystrokes will be send to the machine where your cursor is currently positioned .
The cursor will slide from screen to screen just as if you are working on one single system with multiple screens attached .
As far as I know , it ’s not possible to drag windows from one machine to another .
Which would be nice .
So if you ’re a programmer and you ’re still searching for a useful project , then this is just your bit .
Here is how you can easily start sharing your keyboard and mouse between different computers and screens using synergy on Ubuntu :
First off , install the synergy package and the QuickSynergy packages on each machine you want to use your pointer on with the command :
sudo apt - get install quicksynergy
Note that apt will install the synergy package as it ’s required to run QuickSynergy .
( QuickSynergy is in fact just a gui for Synergy )
When it ’s installed , you ’ll find QuickSynergy under the category ‘ accessories ’ in the application menu .
On the server :
The server is the computer where the used keyboard and mouse are attached to .
In the Share tab fill in the names of the computers where you want your keyboard and mouse to be operational .
Do not fill in the IP address , it wo n’t work .
To find out the name of your computer (s ) , open a terminal and type :
hostname
If all the hostnames are put in the right place , start the service by clicking ‘ Execute ’
Note that the window becomes gray .
You can now just minimize it and let it do it ’s work .
On the client :
On the Client , fire up the QuickSynergy app and go to the Use tab .
Fill in the hostname of the server .
Note that you can also enter its IP , but know that when you ’re using dynamic IP adresses , you ’ll have to reconfigure this each time you fire up Synergy .
Then just hit execute and minimize the window .
Now you can remove your keyboard and mouse from this computer .
When moving the mouse outside the window to the side you ’ve configured the other computers position on the server , you ’ll see your pointer go ‘ troug ’ the space between the two computers and appear on the other screen .
Als handy to know is that the clipboard is shared .
So you can actually copy something on machine 1 and paste it on machine 2 . ( text that is , do n’t try this with data )
Note :
Synergy uses an unencrypted TCP / IP stream on port 24800 .
So if you ’re on a network you ca n’t entirely trust , do n’t use it unless you encrypt it .
I would even recommend ALL users using a wifi - network to encrypt the connection .
To Encrypt the Synergy data , you can simply follow the guide on their website .
One of the features of the latest crop of browsers is a ‘ private browsing ’ mode ( aka the porn mode ) in which cookies and URL histories form a browsing session are discarded at the end of the session , leaving ‘ no trace ’ .
Hmmm …
Whilst watching the BBC iPlayer last night , I got fed up with the programme stalling ( too many open apps , etc etc ) so I decided to move to another browser .
On going to the appropriate progamme page , I had the option to “ Resume ” the programme at the point I had just stopped watching it in the other browser .
A quick tweet asking how this might work was met with the response that iPlayer was probably making use of “ Stored Objects , Flash ’s equivalent of cookies ” , as confirmed ( I think ? ! ) by @dansumption .
That is : when you visit a website , most browsers are capable of storing a small amount of data ( known as a cookie ) specified by the website .
This might include a unique identifier that allows the website to recognise you when you visit the site again using the same browser , for example , or store personalisation information for you .
Third party cookies allow adservers to recognise who you are when you wander across different websites , too .
( A brief into to cookies can be found on the OpenLearn site : What are cookies ?. )
If you do n’t want a website to be able to recognise you if you revisit it , you can either block the cookies it wants to set , or delete the cookies it has set in a previous session .
Private browsing handles this for you automatically .
Another thing that browsers do is maintain a history of websites that you have visited .
Once again , private browsing steps in here to prevent the browser from remembering what sites you have visited during a private browsing session .
And finally , private browsing does n’t keep track of any searches you might have made in the private browsing session using the browser ’s built in search box .
Whilst there are still traces all over the place of the sites you have visited , from the firewall log on your computer or your broadband router box to your ISP , if you were browsing within a private browsing session , you might expect that at least your computer would remain ‘ free of evidence ’ about what you had been searching for , or which sites you had visited ( along with removing any tell tale cookies they may otherwise have left behind ) .
Well , as the BBC iPlayer cross - browser ‘ Resume programme ’ facility , suggests : no .
Many sites that use Flash , ( BBC iPlayer included ) make use of Flash Stored objects which sit outside the control ( for now at least , and as I understand it ) a browser ’s private history mode .
I ’m guessing it also sits outside the scope of a browser ’s ‘ clear cookies ’ and ‘ clear history ’ actions ?
If you ’re intrigued about what flash ‘ cookies ’ you might have set on your computer , you can inspect them ( and delete them ) using this Adobe tool : Flash Player : Website Storage Settings panel
Anyway , if you run info skills courses , it ’s maybe to one to remember …
PS we may not need Flash for much longer anyway , as Mike Ellis suggested when I pointed him to this rather wonderful site demoing the power of CSS in a modern browser : Text ShadowCSS effect ;-)

Have China 's population curbs helped the global environment
As the UN climate summit in Copenhagen approaches , exhortations that " we must get a deal " and warnings that climate change is " the greatest challenge we face as a species " are to be heard in virtually every political forum .
But if you look back to the latest definitive check on the planet 's environmental health - the Global Environment Outlook ( Geo - 4 ) , published by the UN two years ago - what emerges is a picture of decline that goes way , way beyond climate change .
Species are going extinct at perhaps 1,000 times the normal rate , as key habitats such as forests , wetlands and coral reefs are plundered for human infrastructure .
Aquifers are being drained and fisheries exploited at unsustainable speed .
Soils are becoming saline , air quality is a huge cause of illness and premature death ; the human population is bigger than our one Earth can currently sustain .
So why , you might ask , are the world 's political leaders not lamenting this big picture as loudly and as often as the climate component of it ?
Habitat loss , not climate change , is the biggest cause of extinction
Humans failing sustainability audit Has climate change hijacked the wider environmental agenda ?
If so , why ?
And does it matter ?
These are questions I 've been able to put to a number of leading environmental thinkers for a BBC Radio Four documentary , Climate Hijack .
Mike Hulme , who led the influential UK Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research until recently , believes the climate issue is rather enticing for the modern leader .
" The characteristics of climate change are quite convenient for politicians to use and to deploy both at a popular level but also at a political level , " he says .
He argues that climate change is seductive to politicians because it is a long - term issue - so decisive action is always posited for some time in the future , at a time that can always be made yet more distant - and someone else can always be blamed .
So Europeans used to blame the US , the US would blame China and India , and developing countries would blame the entire developed West .
" It 's very easy to pass responsibility for failure somewhere else and in the process of doing that , one is able to keep one 's own credibility and record , with the appearance of being much more progressive and constructive . "
According to this analysis - and in contradiction to Al Gore 's famous phrase - climate change has acquired its huge profile largely because it is a far more convenient truth than poor air quality or biodiversity loss or fisheries decline , where the actions needed are more likely to be national or local - and certainly more convenient than tackling the issues that underpin everything else , the size of the human population and our unsustainable consumption of the Earth 's resources .
Mindset monoculture ?
" I do n't think it 's a competition , actually , " says UK Environment Secretary Hilary Benn .
" We 're coming to see that we 've got a bit of a problem and we 've got to live within the Earth 's means . "
In an ideal world , he would surely be right - all of these issues would receive the appropriate amount of political time and action .
But as far as the UK is concerned , there is a widespread feeling among environment groups - hard to quantify , and not always something they are willing to say on the record - that the government is only really interested in climate change .
I think we 've got to be very blunt about it ; campaigning groups for the environment or anything else are in the marketplace
John Gummer
And some say the balance has been tipped further by the creation of the new Department of Energy and Climate Change ( Decc ) under Ed Miliband , which removed most climate responsibilities from Defra .
The head of one large UK environment group told me last year : " If we want to talk about climate change , we can get a meeting with the prime minister .
If we want to talk about biodiversity , we can't even get a meeting with the environment secretary . "
This is a picture that Hilary Benn rejects ; he says his department 's doors are very much open to people bringing concerns about biodiversity , or about any other issue within his remit .
Nevertheless : " Climate change is at the forefront of most politicians ' minds who are concerned about the environment , " says Graham Wynne , chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) , probably the UK 's most influential conservation group .
" I would obviously wish that our most senior politicians were able to hold two environmental thoughts at the same time - but there is a political reality ; climate change is sexy , so we get most traction there . " which means this is where groups such as the RSPB are likely to focus most of their lobbying .
Former UK Environment Secretary John Gummer is clear that concern about climate impacts on the natural world is not the only reason why conservation groups are increasingly taking up the climate banner .
" I think we 've got to be very blunt about it ; campaigning groups for the environment or anything else are in the marketplace .
" So if you want to raise money to do something about the marine world ( for example ) , you do it by campaigning on dolphins .
" It 's exactly like a business , and in that sense we have to realise that the choice they make is with mixed motives .
This is not a criticism , but they are as likely to be partial in what they choose as any business or any politician . "
To a large extent , environment groups set the concerns of the environmentally aware citizen ; so if they prioritise climate change , perhaps that means a loss of awareness of all the other things that people might be - or used to be - concerned about .
Earth 's loss
On the global stage , loss of biodiversity - in plain speech , loss of nature - is one of the issues you will rarely hear leading politicians lamenting - despite the fact that governments pledged to do something about it as far back as the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 , at exactly the same time that they were pledging to do something about climate change .
Population raises all these issues about religion , about culture , about male dominance in the world ; and ( people ) get very uncomfortable about that
Jonathon Porritt
How many children are enough ?
Deutsche Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev leads a UN - sponsored project aiming to quantify the economic costs of losing the " goods and service " that nature provides - something , he says , on which the evidence has been ignored for far too long .
" Work in this field has been going on for so long that it is a shame the idea of pulling this together and presenting it to the public and to governments as an issue was n't done earlier . "
Preliminary calculations indicate the cost of forest loss alone dwarfs the cost of the current banking crisis - a conclusion that has been met with resounding silence at the political level .
A much more comprehensive analysis is due for publication next year ; but he is not holding out too much hope that it will sway minds .
" Climate change is already occupying mind space and heart space , and for biodiversity to occupy the same space is going to be a challenge . "
Population concerns
Even more difficult than putting something like biodiversity loss on the agenda , says former government adviser Jonathon Porritt , is getting politicians and the wider environmental community to accept that underpinning everything are the unsustainable size of the Earth 's human population and our unsustainable ( and rising ) hunger for the Earth 's natural resources .
Recently he raised the population issue in his blog - only to be excoriated by columnist Melanie Phillips for having a " sinister and de-humanised mindset " - which is perhaps an indicator of why other contemporary environmental thinkers are so reluctant to raise it publically , despite admitting its importance in private .
Traffic pollution still causes thousands of deaths per year in rich countries " Too controversial , " he says .
" Population raises all these issues about religion , about culture , about male dominance in the world ; and ( people ) get very uncomfortable about that . "
Nevertheless , he argues , the logic is undeniable .
Speaking recently at Mr Porritt 's Forum for the Future , a Chinese government official described the one child per family policy as having led to " 400 million births averted " - which she then converted into the greenhouse gases those extra human inhabitants would have produced , and noted that no other country had done as much to curb climate change .
But , he continues : " You do n't have to accept the China route to that logic .
" You can look to all kinds of alternative ways of reducing human numbers which are n't done as coercively as the one child per family policy was done in the past .
" However , when I was director of Friends of the Earth , could I get our local groups or my colleagues to go along with that ?
I have to admit complete failure . "
Same tune
In contrast to the 1970s , the decade of the first global attempts to look at environmental decline , population is not now on the political radar .
Neither is the question of whether stopping that decline is possible without deep reform of the world 's economic system .
Biodiversity loss , desertification , unsustainable fishing where are the spaces at the top table for these ?
By singing the climate tune so loudly , have environmental groups unwittingly helped to create a situation where climate change is all that politicians and the public hear ?
Has the media contributed ?
A couple of years ago I added up the number of articles we had written on the BBC News website within the preceding nine months about various issues .
The scores were four for deforestation , four for desertification , 17 for biodiversity - and on climate change I stopped counting when I reached 1,000 .
In large part , what journalists report reflects what is going on in the big world ; but have we , too , forgotten the larger messages of the UN Geo - 4 report , the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , and other audits of a society whose environmental problems run much wider and deeper than climate change ?
None of the people I interviewed for the programme argue that man-made climate change is not real or not important ; there is no suggestion of a swindle here .
Some believe a narrow focus on climate is justified - either because they feel it is so much more serious than every other issue , or because they feel there is real political momentum to solve it now and time enough to deal with everything else once that is done .
But others argue there is no time ; that society needs , urgently , to see the wider picture of global decline in all its complexity - and that climate concerns have hijacked the broader agenda , to the detriment of us all .

Dear Straight Dope :
As you no doubt know , David Copperfield is a master illusionist .
Magic tricks are just that -- tricks .
However , there is one I just do n't understand .
David apparently made several hundred people not see the Statue of Liberty .
How the heck did he do that ?
He obviously did not make it disappear , it was , is , and always has been there -- but why could n't the crowd ( and the TV ) see it ?
Thanks , O Masterful Knowing One !!
erniel , via the Internet
Melis replies :
Magicians are a snotty lot .
Imagine , not wanting to reveal their secrets to their loyal fans !
How dare they ?
Of course , being one of Cecil ’s loyal followers , I first tried the David Copperfield Website .
After going through the introductory screens and being bombarded with far too many images of a “ mysterious ” David , I saw a few GIFs of this illusion .
Did he spill any secrets ?
Nope !
I next tried “ The Amazing Ralph ” , who promised to reveal the secrets of this magical feat .
His explanation ?
David palmed the Statue of Liberty .
OK , Ralph .
Thanks a lot .
Finally , racking my brain for the answer , it came to me … not in the night … not in an aural flash … but on my bookshelf !
Summoning all the skills Cecil had taught me , I reached out and grabbed my copy of William Poundstone ’s Bigger Secrets .
Way dustier and nowhere near as dogeared as my set of The Straight Dope books , I nevertheless looked through the crisp pages … and bingo !
There was the answer .
Poundstone wrote six pages on this trick and included a nifty illustration , but I ’ll just give you a basic summary : Copperfield had a setup of two towers on a stage , supporting an arch to hold the huge curtain that would be used to conceal the statue .
The TV cameras and the live audience only saw the monument through the arch .
When the curtains closed , David waxed poetic while the stage was … slowly … and imperceptibly … turned .
When the curtains opened , the statue was hidden behind one of the towers , and the audience was looking out to sea .
Voila !
The Statue of Liberty has disappeared !
Even if the stage had n’t completely hidden the statue , the towers were so brightly lit that the audience would be nightblinded .
Copperfield had also set up two rings of lights–one around Liberty , and another set up somewhere else .
When the trick “ happened , ” his assistants simply turned off the lights around the statue and turned on the other set for the helicopters to circle around .
Oh –the radar blip ?
It was simply video game animation .

TestSwarm , the project that I ’ve been working on over the past 6 months , or so , is now open to the public .
Mozilla has been very gracious , allowing me to work on this project exclusively .
At the beginning of April I moved from my old position as a JavaScript Evangelist on the Mozilla Evangelism team to that of a JavaScript Tool Developer on the new Developer Tools team ( whose other major project is Bespin ) .
For more information on Test Swarm I ’ve written up a detailed explanation of what Test Swarm provides and where it fits into the landscape of JavaScript developer tools .
I ’ve also recorded a screencast walkthrough of the TestSwarm site :
Test Swarm Walkthrough from John Resig on Vimeo .
Additionally , there are two previous posts that I ’ve made on TestSwarm :
There are some additional screenshots of Test Swarm in action on Flickr .
More Information :
If you ’re interested in using Test Swarm I strongly recommend reading the project overview first .
If you have any further questions please direct them towards the Test Swarm discussion Group .
TestSwarm ended up being a very challenging project to get to an alpha state ( and probably will be even more challenging to get to a final release state ) .
Dealing with cross - browser incompatibilities , cross - domain test suite execution , and asynchronous , distributed , client execution has been more than enough to make for a surprisingly difficult project .
It ’s mostly written in PHP and uses MySQL as a back end ( allowing it to run in virtually any environment ) .
Patches will absolutely be appreciated .
This project has been a long time coming now , the first inklings started back in 2007 .
Some of us on the jQuery team were discussing ways to distribute the test suite load to multiple browsers in an automated fashion .
Andy Kent came along and proposed a participatory application for testing visual code ( such as jQuery UI ) .
We worked on that code base for a while but it did n’t get off the ground .
Eventually I decided to re-tackle the problem early on in 2009 .
Even in its rough alpha state we ’ve already been able to make great use of TestSwarm .
For example , here ’s a view of jQuery commits run in TestSwarm :
The vertical axis is SVN commits to jQuery ( newer commits at the top ) , the horizontal axis are all the different browsers that we target .
Using TestSwarm we ’ve been able to easily spot regressions and fix them with a minimum amount of hassle ( especially since all the results are logged ) .
And this is only the beginning .
There are so many different directions in which Test Swarm can be taken .
For example :
A pastebin - like service where you can drop in code and see the results come back , from many browsers , in real - time .
IDE integration for sending minor changes out for quick testing .
Manual testing of user interface code .
Pushing manual tests , with instructions , to users for them to walk through .
Distributing tests to any number of browsers , rather than a specific sub-set .
( You could use this to embed a tiny iframe in your site to collect test results from a small sampling of our users . )
The ability to drive and test browser code or extensions .
And the list goes on .
I ’m definitely curious to see what directions the community is interested in driving the code base .
I ’ve gotten it to a level where it ’s particularly useful for me and the jQuery team – where should we go from here ?

The All England Club has admitted that it schedules matches between “ attractive ” female players for Centre Court at Wimbledon , reports the Daily Mail .
In the men ’s tournament , five - times winner Roger Federer and British hope Andy Murray invariably play on Centre .
But on Friday , after Federer left the court , the next match was Victoria Azarenka of Belarus against Romania ’s Sorana Cirstea .
While both 19 - year - olds have top form in the glamour department , Miss Cirstea was seeded 28 while Miss Azarenka , who won , is ranked and seeded eighth .
That same day , second seed Serena Williams was relegated to the new No 2 Court for her win over Italian Roberta Vinci .
The All England Club did n’t even bother to deny it :
Spokesman Johnny Perkins said : ‘ Good looks are a factor . ’
The Mail speculates that Wimbledon organisers are trying to cater to the BBC .
An unnamed “ BBC source ” said :
‘ No one has heard of many of the women now , so if they are pretty it definitely gives them an edge .
‘ Our preference would always be a Brit or a babe as this always delivers high viewing figures . ’
The tennis players have , unsurprisingly , noticed too , and are none - too - happy :
The fifth seed , who was knocked out on Saturday on No 1 Court , said : ‘ It ’s weird .
If you look at the schedule , it ’s not only about me .
‘ It ’s about Dinara on Court No 2 , Venus ( Williams ) on Court No 1 and the girls who are not very highly seeded they play on Centre .
‘ I respect them .
They ’re great players for sure .
But this is what ’s weird for me ; what ’s their strategy , what ’s their plan of making the schedule ?
‘ This is what surprises me a little bit . ’
Twice champion Serena Williams even got lost on the way to No 2 Court on Friday .
She was nearly ten minutes late for her match .
( Of course , the Mail , champion of women , took the opportunity to illustrate the story with huge photos of the players labelling who played on centre court and who did n’t , and captioning one with a reference to the “ Battle of the Babes ” . )
UPDATE : Reader Audrey emailed in with the info on how to complain – go here for details on how to write to the All England Club .
Do you remember last year , when a startup named Cuil that was founded by two ex-Googlers made huge noise when it launched its search engine with the claim of having the largest search index in the world ?
The result was a huge initial traffic spike .
But when it did n't " beat Google , " its traffic dropped like a whale being thrown out of an airplane .
While Cuil has been quiet - a non-story - for months , it has now suddenly reemerged with an array of new features based on bringing real - time news and search results .
Did Cuil just launch its own competitor to Twitter Search and Facebook Search ?
It 's Nifty , But ...
This feature is very simple , honestly .
If you search keywords that are generating real - time results ( i.e. Hurricane Bill , Obama ) , you will see a new bar on the right hand side with " # Realtime Results " indicating just exactly how many realtime results Cuil has found .
When you click on the bar , this is the popup you get :
The three features are ( 1 ) that you can scroll through real - time results , from blogs and news sources ( 2 ) that you can see the " hotness " of the real - time result , and ( 3 ) you can drag and drop the bar onto your desktop to monitor news about that subject at anytime .
Okay , so is this a competitor to Twitter Search ?
Maybe a little , but really it 's more like OneRiot in terms of real - time search .
And to be honest , OneRiot blows Cuil out of the water in this vertical .
While features like these are good additions , they still do n't make it a better search engine than Google or place it above the usefulness of Twitter Search .
Cuil 's losing more traffic every month , and the launch of Bing cannot help any either .
Real - time is a nice feature , but it does n't do anything that is n't already on the market .
Yesterday , a judge issued an injunction that , if it remains in force , would compel Microsoft to stop selling recent versions of its phenomenally popular program , Word .
The injunction is the latest round in an intellectual property battle that 's been brewing since May , when a jury found Microsoft guilty of infringing a patent held by a Canadian company called i4i .
Ironically , the patent in question covers a method of separating formatting information from runs of text when documents are written to files — something Microsoft itself received a patent for just this week .
Unfortunately , the folks in Redmond filed theirs six months behind the competition .
The i4i patent in question was filed in June of 1994 ( and granted in 1998 ) , whereas Microsoft 's dates from December of that year .
It describes a general method of handling the formatting information in documents by separating it out from the text that 's being formatted .
In this sense , it 's a superset of Microsoft 's new patent , which claims similar capabilities but is exclusively targeted to XML file formats .
The company that owns the patent , i4i , sells document management and publishing solutions , so ( as noted in the initial ruling ) , it has actually been using the technology in question .
That ruling , which came in the wake of a jury trial , set damages at $ 240 million and tacked on another $ 37 million of interest , and it noted that a separate injunction would eventually be issued .
That injunction was handed down yesterday , and it bars Microsoft from selling any form of Word that reads the formatting information out of a .DOCX or .DOCM file .
It could have been worse ; the original suit also claimed that .NET and Vista infringed the patent .
The injunction does allow Microsoft to sell a version of Word that strips out all the XML elements , or one that loads the XML as plain text .
At the time it was issued , Microsoft indicated it would fight the ruling that granted i4i damages .
The current injunction also gives the company 60 days to comply , which would be plenty of time to seek a stay of this ruling , pending its appeals .
It 's not clear whether the fact that Microsoft has since been granted a patent for the specific technology at issue here might influence further legal proceedings .
In any case , despite the fact that this case pitted a Canadian company against one based in Washington state , the legal action took place in the patent - friendly East Texas District Court ( though we hear that , thanks to the huge influx of patent cases over the last few years , East Texas is n't quite so " friendly " these days , nor is it the " rocket docket " of old ) .
At the time Microsoft 's XML patent was issued , we speculated that the company might have pursued it for purely defensive purposes .
It seems that the patent 's ability to shield Redmond will be put to the test very quickly .
I hate it when I 'm eating pistachio nuts and I find one that has only opened a tiny bit .
This quick technique , taught to me by my friend Lloyd , will open these problematic legumes every time without risking sore fingernails or broken teeth .

This fire season throughout California and the West is likely to be one of the worst on record as heat and drought persist through the fall , scientists monitoring the state 's vegetation predict .
The new forecast from U.S. Forest Service researchers is based on a survey of forests , underbrush , grasslands and farm fields throughout the region , including the Sierra Nevada , coupled with current climate models and long - term weather studies .
Much of the state - particularly the Central Valley , the Bay Area and the region north of Los Angeles - will remain " extremely dry , " the worst possible fire condition , or " severely dry , " through December , said Ronald Neilson , a Forest Service researcher and botany professor at Oregon State University .
Neilson , who studies the links between climate and vegetation , heads the group that has been updating its wildfire forecasts every month for more than 10 years .
" The forecasts have been almost surgically accurate , " Neilson said this week , " but they do n't know about lightning or people with matches . "
The vast majority of wildfires are caused by human activity , sparked by careless campers , arsonists or people inappropriately using equipment in dry areas , according to the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
Lightning causes roughly 5 percent of the wildfires in the agency 's jurisdiction , while 12 percent are caused by arson and 30 percent by improper use of mechanical equipment , Cal Fire records show .
So far this year , California 's largest blaze hit Santa Barbara County in early May .
The Jesusita fire burned more than 8,700 acres and destroyed about 80 homes .
There have been few large , destructive fires in Northern California so far .
Neilson 's regular reports are " very helpful " to the state , said Del Walters , director of Cal Fire .
" We use that kind of data to follow changing vegetation patterns and climate trends closely all the time . "
Neilson 's fire forecasts are based primarily on an area 's flammability as water in the ground dries and forests , crops and grasslands turn tinder - dry .
Fire hazards in California and the Pacific Northwest have been increasing year after year for more than 30 years , Nielson said , because of what he called " an incredibly rapid rate of climate warming . "
Beyond California , Neilson 's current forecast shows the worst drought conditions persisting in western Oregon and Washington , as well as in pockets of North Carolina and Northern Wisconsin .
For much of the northern Midwest and Northeast , however , the forecast for the rest of the year calls for " very wet " or " extremely wet " conditions .
Former White House political adviser Karl Rove was deeply involved in the sacking of a US attorney in New Mexico , according to emails and transcripts released by the House of Representatives judiciary committee .
The former White House counsel Harriet Miers testified that Rove complained to her about David Iglesias , but she could not recall whether he had said he should be dismissed .
Iglesias was one of nine US attorneys sacked in part for apparently not being sufficiently loyal to George Bush 's administration .
Iglesias said in an interview : " Over two years ago , I said all roads lead to Rove . "

Enlarge Microsoft
The logo for the Microsoft Office software suite , which includes Word .
LEGAL BATTLE LEGAL BATTLE
It might not be easy for Microsoft to get a federal appeals court to throw out the injunction requiring the Redmond , Wash .
company to stop selling Word .
That 's because back in 2006 the U.S. Supreme Court set forth four strict criteria for granting injunctions in patent cases , as part of the milestone case of eBay vs. MercExchange .
To convince Texas district court Judge Leonard Davis to issue the injunction , Toronto - based tech firm i4i had to produce evidence that Microsoft 's use of XML in Word caused irreparable injury ; that money damages alone will not fix the injury ; that there 's an imbalance of hardship between i4 i and Microsoft ; and that the injunction would not harm the public interest .
Davis ' 65 - page ruling , which came after a jury found that Microsoft had infringed on i4i's patent for a tool that enables use of " customized XML " in business applications .
I4 i's XML tool enables large pharmaceutical companies and big defense contractors to share inventory data and other business intelligence with suppliers and customers using disparate business applications , says i4i chairman Loudon Owen Davis ' post trial ruling came after Microsoft asked him to dismiss the jury verdict -- and i4i countered by asking for the injunction .
In denying Microsoft 's motion and granting i4i's , Davis awarded i4i $ 90 million more in settlement charges , on top of the $ 200 million awarded by the jury .
( Microsoft has more than $ 30 billion in cash reserves . )
" It 's a very strongly worded opinion , " says Pittsburg intellectual property lawyer Henry Sneath .
Sneath says that Microsoft 's strongest argument to the appeals court might be that the public interest will be disserved if it must stop selling Word 2007 -- or strip it of XML .
But i4i could make the counter argument that a viable alternative is readily available with the free and popular productivity suite , OpenOffice , which adopted XML as its standard format before Office 2007 did .
Yanking XML from Word will not be easy .
Microsoft weathered controversy when it tried to limit use of Office XML formats to licensees .
Many in the tech community complained that Office XML was n't sufficiently documented for companies other than Microsoft to use them reliably , says Rob Helm , analyst at Directions on Microsoft .
Helm says
Office XML licenses have had to become more liberal , and he credits Microsoft for coming around and making the documentation more complete -- at the behest of interventions by U.S. and European antitrust regulators .
The bottom line : Microsoft has two months to solve a big problem .
It must get the appeals court to issue a stay against what has the look of an iron - clad injunction , or " spend a lot of money to redesign this product because they can't sell it any more , " says Sneath .
SEATTLE  A federal district court judge has ordered Microsoft ( MSFT ) to stop selling Word in the U.S. — and the tiny company behind the lawsuit is digging in for a David vs. Goliath showdown .
Toronto - based i4i , which has 30 employees , claims that Microsoft violated an obscure patent related to Extensible Markup Language or XML .
It 's a key software component of many websites and computer programs , including Word .
Judge Leonard Davis agreed Tuesday , ordering Microsoft to pay $ 290 million in fines and stop selling Word in the U.S. in 60 days .
That could derail a core business for the world 's largest software maker .
As part of Microsoft Office , Word is used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide .
Office accounted for more than $ 3 billion in sales in the company 's last fiscal year .
" It 's not a question of fear or pride or anything else , " Loudon Owen , i4i chairman says .
" We 're very respectful of Microsoft , but when you 're in the right you have to persevere . "
Microsoft plans to appeal .
" We are disappointed by the court 's ruling , " said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz in a statement .
" We believe the evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid . "
I4i , which mainly makes software for drug and defense companies , obtained the patent for a " customized XML " tool in 1998 .
XML is a specialized alphabet that can capture any kind of computer file as a regular text .
Microsoft started using XML as an alternative way to save Word files in Word 2003 and made it the default format for all Office files in Office 2007 .
This made it easier for Microsoft and its partners to create programs such as accounting software that generates reports in Word formats , says Rob Helm , analyst at research firm Directions on Microsoft .
I4i sued Microsoft in 2007 , claiming that Word uses the patented process .
Now , " Microsoft is behind the eight ball and has 60 days to see if it can get the federal appeals court to stay the injunction , " says Henry Sneath , a Pittsburgh intellectual property lawyer .
No one expects Microsoft to actually pull Word off the market .
It 's a big company with deep pockets that has faced many legal challenges over the years .
It could win the appeal , settle with i4i , or even buy out the company .

Deaths , Missing Detainees Still Blacked
Out in New CIA Report Inspector general reportedly discovered three died , many unaccounted for by CIA .
August 25 , 2009  --
The CIA and the Obama Administration continue to keep secret some of the most shocking allegations involving the spy agency 's interrogation program : three deaths and several other detainees whose whereabouts could not be determined , according to a former senior intelligence official who has read the full , unredacted version .
Of the 109 pages in the 2004 report , 36 were completely blacked out in the version made public Monday , and another 30 were substantially redacted for " national security " reasons .
Watch Brian Ross ' full report tonight on " World News with Charles Gibson " at 6:30 pm ET .
The blacked - out portions hide the Inspector General 's findings on the circumstances that led to the deaths of at least three of the detainees in the CIA 's program , the official said .
Two of the men reportedly died in CIA in Iraq and the third died in Afghanistan .
The Inspector General 's findings about a fourth death involving a prisoner in Afghanistan were made public in the report .
A CIA contract employee was convicted of assault in that case and is now in prison .
The still - secret portions of the Inspector General 's report also describe fears that the waterboarding of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed came close to killing him .
Mohammed was waterboarded 183 separate times , according to the report .
The unredacted version of the report makes a reference to the " unsafe " nature of waterboarding but makes no mention of its actual effects on Mohammed or the two others who were subjected to the technique .
The ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , said he thinks more of the CIA 's blacked out information should be made public .
" If the sections of the report do n't talk about sources and methods , at this point in time , my bias would be toward transparency and toward releasing more information . "
Hoekstra , who has read the unredacted version of the CIA report , said he could not comment on its contents .
Also hidden from public scrutiny , according to the official , was the discovery by the CIA Inspector General that the CIA could not adequately account for several of the 100 al Qaeda suspects who were part of the detainee program that the CIA maintained had been well administered .
The official said " a few just got lost and the CIA does to know what happened to them . "
Other detainees , said the official , were transferred to other countries and their whereabouts are still unknown .
In other cases , " incomplete records " were to blame for the failure to account for the detainees ' status after leaving the program .
Missing Detainees
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told ABC
News , " The CIA will cooperate with the Department of Justice , as it always has , in this latest look at past detention and interrogation practices .
As the agency has noted previously , career prosecutors at Justice have already examined these cases .
That includes , in addition to the complete Inspector General 's report — which Justice has had since 2004 — other allegations of abuse , which the CIA itself referred to the Department . "
In his conclusions , Inspector General John Helgerson , found " the Agency — especially in the early months of the program — failed to provide adequate staffing , guidance and support to those involved with the detention and interrogation of detainees . "
Helgerson , who left the job in Mar. 2009 , said in a statement , " the primary common problem was that management controls and operational procedures were not in place to avoid the serious problems that arose , jeopardizing Agency employees and detainees alike . "
Even after the report was completed in 2004 , the problem of missing detainees continued , according to the former intelligence official .
One of the detainees who was put in the " missing " category was identified by the CIA as a top al Qaeda figure , Hassan Ghul , who officials had planned to waterboard until they determined he was " obese " and might lead to serious medical issues .
Ghul was turned over to Pakistan in 2006 and has since been released .
The CIA does not know whether he returned to fight with al Qaeda or simply disappeared from sight .
" The primary , common problem was that management controls and operational procedures were not in place to avoid the serious problems that arose , " said Helgerson , who served as CIA inspector general from 2002 to Mar. 2009 .

Tags : Health care , Health Insurance , Health reform
THE RAUCOUS right - wing protesters who have stormed congressional town hall meetings have thrust the debate over health care reform into the 24 - hour news cycle .
As a result , the effort to overhaul the U.S. ’s broken health care system has become bogged down in a surreal discussion about “ death panels , ” forced euthanasia and Big Brother government .
In this respect , the town hall meetings have the feeling of a reality show being acted out far from where the real “ debate ” is .
And that is in the back rooms of the White House and the Congress where health industry “ stakeholders ” are really shaping the policy .
To understand this , Chad Terhune and Keith Epstein ’s August 6 BusinessWeek cover story , “ The Health Insurers Have Already Won , ” provides essential reading .
In it , Terhune and Epstein describe how the major health insurance companies , such as UnitedHealth and Aetna , crafted a sophisticated and strategic approach to shape health care reform to their liking .
Oriented primarily on the so - called “ Blue Dog ” conservative Democrats , this strategy is n’t simply based on the crude legalized bribery by which industry lobbies buy off politicians in exchange for campaign contributions .
In fact , the industry has used its power to provide expertise and research to congressional staffers to assure that it has a major role in determining the problems that health reform is meant to address and the solutions that are being proposed .
Pro-industry research is driving the reform debate in Congress , and the end result will be a health care bill with an industry seal of approval on it .
If this kind of industry influence might be considered the soft touch , the health insurers are also willing to bring down the hammer if necessary .
Terhune and Epstein focus primarily on the role of UnitedHealth , the largest health insurer in the country , showing how the company has catered to members of Congress with seemingly reliable actuarial projections , and fact - filled PowerPoint presentations .
“ This puts a halo on us , ” Terhune and Epstein quote a United Health corporate flak as saying about one of its congressional outreach efforts .
“ It humanizes us . ”
These efforts are nothing like the nefarious role of the Lewin Group , an industry front group whose suspect research has abetted conservative propaganda against publicly funded health insurance , right ?
Liberal MSNBC cable show hosts Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow have called out the Lewin Group for producing corporate propaganda masquerading as research .
One problem with this picture , though : UnitedHealth owns the Lewin Group .
So there you have it : the health insurers , not to mention Big Pharma , the hospital lobby and the rest , have health reform coming and going .
In fact , one might even describe this as bipartisanship in action : while the Lewin Group provides the GOP with its talking points , UnitedHealth and their friends are supplying congressional Democrats with theirs .
Industry then uses the “ Astroturf ” ( i.e. fake grassroots ) pressure of rank - and - file right - wingers to create an atmosphere in which their insiders can more effectively bend congressional ears to accept more “ realistic ” goals .
As Terhune and Epstein note , the industry has too much invested in health care reform to simply walk away from it :
What people in Washington tend not to discuss , at least on the record , is the open secret that insurers are minimizing their forecasts of the eventual windfall they will enjoy from expanded coverage for Americans .
UnitedHealth has given certain key members of Congress details about its finances and tax liability –both historical numbers and figures projected under various cost - sharing scenarios .
But some on Capitol Hill are skeptical .
“ The bottom line , ” says an aide to the Senate Finance Committee , “ is that health reform would lead to increased revenues and profits [ for the insurance industry ]
… There will be [ added ] costs [ to the companies ] , but we ’re not sure the revenues and profits will be as low as they say . ”
And while taking this look behind the curtain , let ’s dismiss the idea that the Obama administration ’s and the Democrats ’ good intentions are simply falling victim to a multimillion - dollar campaign by medical industry lobbyists .
For one thing , as the New York Times reported on August 13 , Obama himself has been intimately involved in behind - the - scenes negotiations with lobbyists .
For months , the administration has pursued a strategy of trying to neutralize industry opposition by encouraging industry help in drafting the bills .
The poison fruit of one of those deals , according to a secret memo the Huffington Post obtained , was a commitment from the White House to the main pharmaceutical industry lobby that it would n’t press for any more than the $ 80 billion in savings that the industry pledged to implement over 10 years .
Off the table , therefore , was Obama ’s oft - made promise ( usually a sure applause - getter during his campaign ) to end the Bush administration ’s stupid policy of preventing Medicare from negotiating for lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical manufacturers .
Although both the White House and Big Pharma have denied that such a deal was struck , it would fit perfectly within the overall strategy that the White House is pursuing .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
WHAT IS likely to end up in the bill for “ health insurance reform ” ( as the White House recently rebranded the effort ) ?
We can get a good idea from looking at the common features of the bills that have so far cleared congressional committees .
They include features such as an expansion of Medicaid , new regulations to set minimum standards for health insurance and a requirement that all people who do n’t receive health insurance from their employers or from some other program like Medicare to buy insurance through an insurance “ cooperative . ”
For those at the lower end of the economic ladder , government subsidies would be available to help them .
Only through the insurance cooperative , a non-profit clearinghouse for different insurance plans , would the “ public option ” –publicly funded insurance –be available .
Only people who meet certain income requirements would be eligible to enroll in it .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated a maximum of 12 million enrollees in the public option plan–a far cry from the 100 - 130 million that its proponents initially proposed .
If the private insurance companies do n’t succeed in getting Congress to eliminate the public option altogether –something the Obama administration is signaling it may be planning to do–they have already succeeded in weakening it so thoroughly that it will pose little challenge to the big health insurers .
Former Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean has said that dropping the public option would make the bill “ not worth voting for , ” but he and many other liberals have left the door open to accepting a small - scale plan that will provide substandard coverage .
Still to be worked out are details such as who will be taxed , and for how much , to support the plan ; the rate at which individuals will be expected to share the cost of care with insurers ; whether and by how much Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals will be cut .
Although these sound like details that make one ’s eyes glaze over , how they are resolved will have a real impact on people ’s lives .
For example , the industry is pushing for individuals to be responsible for 35 percent of their bills , compared to 10 percent or 20 percent in most employer - provided plans today .
The Senate Finance Committee is currently looking at requiring $ 500 billion in “ savings ” ( aka cuts ) in Medicare as a way to help finance the health care expansion .
These are hardly trivial matters .
Whatever the outcome of these details , one piece is n’t really in dispute in the mainstream discussion–and that is the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance .
This is n’t the notion of all Americans having a “ right ” to health care .
It ’s a requirement that uninsured Americans must insure themselves–a reality that has yet to sink in amid the media cacophony .
The problem with forcing the uninsured to buy insurance was aptly summed up by Dr. Steffie Woolhandler of Physicians for a National Health Program :
Private health insurance is a defective consumer product , and Congress has no business forcing uninsured Americans to buy it .
Even Obama ’s promise that people with employer - paid plans will be able to keep them is n’t so assured , according to an August 16 Washington Post analysis of the House and Senate bills .
According to the bills , “ you ” may want to keep your heath plans , but your employer wo n’t be barred from dropping its plan–and forcing you to buy insurance on your own .
Already the voices of “ realism ” and “ moderation , ” starting with former President Bill Clinton ’s address to the liberal Netroots Nation conference in Pittsburgh last week , are urging liberals to accept a much less ambitious bill than they had hoped for .
But people who want genuine health care reform should ask themselves if a bill written to placate the health insurers , the pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals deserves any support at all .

We here at ZooBorns have been waiting for great shots of a baby takin to share with you for quite some time and we are happy to say that the LA Zoo has delivered !
On July 3rd they welcomed a baby female takin , a type of goat - antelope , like the serow we featured last week .
The takin share their mountainous habitat with the giant panda and both are protected by the Chinese government .
A first for the L.A. Zoo is the birth of a female Sichuan takin , born on July 3 , 2009 !
Though takin may look like a combination of various animals : the snout of a moose , horns of a cow , tail of a bear , body of a buffalo and a mountain goat ’s feet and agility , takins actually belong to a group of animals called goat - antelope .
This group also includes domestic sheep and goats .
In China takin share a mountain habitat with the giant panda , which has proven beneficial for the takin ’s preservation .
Pandas are an “ umbrella species , ” which means that protecting panda habitats also safeguards the other animals that share their habitats .
Like the panda , the takin is considered a treasure in its native land and is protected by the Chinese government .
The newest addition to the Zoo ’s takin herd is wandering the exhibit with its parents !

Overview
The image of the United States has improved markedly in most parts of the world , reflecting global confidence in Barack Obama .
In many countries opinions of the United States are now about as positive as they were at the beginning of the decade before George W. Bush took office .
Improvements in the U.S. image have been most pronounced in Western Europe , where favorable ratings for both the nation and the American people have soared .
But opinions of America have also become more positive in key countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia , as well .
Signs of improvement in views of America are seen even in some predominantly Muslim countries that held overwhelmingly negative views of the United States in the Bush years .
The most notable increase occurred in Indonesia , where people are well aware of Obama ’s family ties to the country and where favorable ratings of the U.S. nearly doubled this year .
However for the most part , opinions of the U.S. among Muslims in the Middle East remain largely unfavorable , despite some positive movement in the numbers in Jordan and Egypt .
Animosity toward the U.S. , however , continues to run deep and unabated in Turkey , the Palestinian territories and Pakistan .
Israel stands out in the poll as the only public among the 25 surveyed where the current U.S. rating is lower than in past surveys .
In contrast , in Germany favorable opinion of the U.S. jumped from 31 % in 2008 to 64 % in the current survey .
Large boosts in U.S. favorability ratings since last year are also recorded in Britain , Spain and France .
In its own hemisphere , America ’s image rose markedly in Canada , Mexico , Argentina and Brazil .
Improvements in U.S. ratings are less evident in countries where the country ’s image had not declined consistently during the Bush years , including Poland , Japan and South Korea .
Opinions of the U.S. remain very positive in the African nations of Kenya and Nigeria , while increasing significantly in India and China .
The new survey by the Pew Research Center ’s Global Attitudes Project , conducted May 18 to June 16 , finds that confidence in Barack Obama ’s foreign policy judgments stands behind a resurgent U.S. image in many countries .
Belief that Obama will “ do the right thing in world affairs ” is now nearly universal in Western countries , where lack of confidence in President Bush had been almost as prevalent for much of his time in office .
In France and Germany , no fewer than nine - in - ten express confidence in the new American president , exceeding the ratings achieved by Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel in their own countries .
In Asia , optimism about Obama is almost as extensive with 85 % of Japanese and 81 % of South Koreans expressing confidence in the American president , and only somewhat lower percentages expressing that view in India ( 77 % ) and China ( 64 % ) .
In Brazil , 76 % have confidence in Obama , as do most Argentines ( 61 % ) , despite their generally skeptical view of the U.S. as expressed in this and earlier surveys .
Even in some countries where the U.S. remains unpopular , significant percentages nonetheless say that they think Obama will do the right thing in international affairs .
In Egypt and Jordan , sizable numbers have confidence in him – 42 % and 31 % respectively .
This represents a three - fold increase compared with opinions about President Bush in 2008 .
But in Pakistan and the Palestinian territories , ratings of Obama are only marginally better than the abysmal ratings accorded Bush .
Again , Israel stands alone as the only country where Obama does not engender more confidence than did President Bush .
And only about one - in - three Russians ( 37 % ) voice confidence in the new president , although this is still a considerably better rating than Bush received in 2008 ( 22 % ) .
In most countries where opinions of the U.S. have improved , many say that Obama ’s election led them to have a more favorable view of the U.S.
This admission is most apparent in Western Europe , Canada and Japan .
In Indonesia , where opinion of America improved dramatically , no fewer than 73 % say that his election bettered their opinion of the U.S.
However even in countries where there was little or no upswing in the U.S. ’s ratings , many people say that Obama ’s election has led them to think more favorably of the U.S.
For example in Egypt and Turkey , where America ’s favorable ratings remain very low , as many as 38 % in both countries say they have better opinions of the U.S. because of Obama .
However , fewer than one - in - ten ( 9 % ) in Pakistan express that view .
More generally , analysis of the survey finds that views of the U.S. are being driven much more by personal confidence in Obama than by opinions about his specific policies .
That is , opinions about Obama personally are more associated with views of the U.S. than are judgments of his policies that were tested in the poll .
Obama ’s Cairo Speech
The polling in the Muslim world took place around the time of President Obama ’s Cairo speech .
In some countries , interviews took place both before and after the speech , providing some gauge of the effect of Obama ’s remarks on his image and opinions of the U.S. more broadly .
In Turkey a sufficient number of interviews were conducted before and after the speech to allow for an analysis of how much impact it had on public opinion .
This analysis suggests that the speech had little measurable impact on views of the U.S. or Obama himself .
However , the pre-post comparisons were rudimentary ones that could only have detected a major swing in public opinion .
In Israel and the Palestinian territories full surveys were conducted both before and after the Cairo speech .
A pre-post analysis among both publics suggests that Obama ’s June 4 speech had a more negative impact on attitudes toward America among Israelis than it had a positive one among Palestinians .
Before the speech , 76 % of Israelis questioned had a favorable view of the U.S. , but after the speech that rating fell to 63 % .
Similarly , confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs slipped from 60 % pre-speech to 49 % post - speech .
Among Palestinians , in contrast , overall ratings of the U.S. and Obama improved but only marginally ( +5 percentage points ) , a difference that is not statistically significant .
However , one apparently positive consequence of the speech on Palestinian public opinion was observed in the survey .
The number of Palestinians thinking that Obama would consider their country ’s interests when making international policy rose from 27 % to 39 % , following the Cairo speech .
Obama vs. bin Laden
More generally , there is little evidence that a more positively regarded U.S. president has spurred further declines in support for terrorism in Muslim countries .
Pew Global Attitudes surveys over the last few years have found many fewer Muslims than earlier in the decade saying that suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians are justified to defend Islam from its enemies .
However , support for suicide bombing has not fallen further over the past year .
Opinions about Osama bin Laden have followed a similar trend line among the Muslim publics surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project .
Views of him have been far more negative in recent years than they were mid-decade , but overall they have not declined further over the past year .
However , for the first time over the course of Pew ’s surveys , there is more confidence in the American president than in bin Laden in a number of countries with predominantly Muslim publics ; including : Turkey , Egypt , Jordan , Nigeria and Indonesia .
In 2008 , most Muslim publics rated bin Laden as high , or higher than they rated President Bush .
But in the current survey Obama inspires confidence in many more people than does the al Qaeda leader .
However , in the Palestinian territories and Pakistan , bin Laden ’s ratings still top Obama ’s by sizable margins .
( Lebanon is the only country in the survey where Bush ’s ratings had been higher than bin Laden ’s among Muslims in recent years ) .
Obama Runs the Table on Guantanamo and Iraq
Obama ’s overall approval rating for some of his current international policies is high in most countries .
This is especially so in Western Europe , where markedly more people than in the U.S. itself give a thumbs up to the new president ’s foreign policy .
Closing the military prison at Guantanamo and withdrawing troops from Iraq are the specific policies that engender the most public international support .
Supra majorities in almost all countries favor both measures – including nearly all of the publics of predominantly Muslim countries surveyed .
The one notable exception is the U.S. , where the public is now divided about closing the military prison at Guantanamo .
Sending more troops to Afghanistan is the only Obama policy tested that does not engender broad global support .
In fact , majorities in most countries oppose the added deployments .
This includes the publics of several NATO countries – such as Britain , Germany , Spain and Canada – most of which in recent years have called for removing troops from Afghanistan .
A majority of Pakistanis also oppose the call for more troops in Afghanistan , reflecting longstanding opposition to NATO operations in that country .
Opinions in the U.S. and Israel are exceptional – majorities in both countries favor Obama ’s request for more troops .
Afghanistan not withstanding , people around the world for the most part have high expectations for Barack Obama .
Majorities of the publics of America ’s traditional allies , who have thought the U.S. favors Israel too much think that Obama will be fair in his dealing with the Palestinians and Israelis .
In the Mideast , however , large majorities are dubious .
More than six - in - ten Jordanians ( 69 % ) , Egyptians ( 66 % ) and Lebanese ( 63 % ) do not expect Obama to be even handed .
In Israel , the number thinking Obama will be fair was 57 % prior to the Cairo speech , but just 47 % after Obama ’s address .
Among Palestinians , the view that the new American president will be fair rose marginally after the speech ( 25 % to 31 % ) .
The nearly 27,000 people questioned in the new Pew Global Attitudes survey are also generally optimistic that Obama will seek international approval before using military force and will take into account the interests of their country when making U.S. policy .
Western Europeans and Canadians are especially positive in these regards .
Publics around the world are also optimistic on another issue that has been a source of contention with regard to the U.S. : climate change .
Majorities or pluralities of people in almost every country surveyed believe that Obama will get the U.S. to take significant measures to control climate change .
While the image of the U.S. is much improved and expectations about Obama are high , there has been only modest change in opinion of the U.S. on two key issues : multilateralism and the impact of the American global footprint .
Expectations about Obama ’s multilateralism not withstanding , most still say the U.S. is not considering their country when making foreign policy .
Only in Germany , India , Israel , Kenya , Nigeria , China and Brazil do majorities think the U.S. is taking their country ’s interest into account when making foreign policy .
And overwhelming numbers of people around the world continue to see the U.S. as having a big influence on their country , with the publics of most nations surveyed describing that influence as bad , rather than good .
Exceptions are India and Kenya , where majorities say that the U.S. impact is positive .
Nonetheless , one concrete , positive sign for the new administration in the survey is a surge in support for U.S. - led efforts to combat terrorism .
The percentage favoring the U.S. effort among the nation ’s allies had steadily declined from 2002 to 2007 .
The new survey once again finds majorities of Western Europeans and Canadians approving of the U.S. anti-terrorism effort .
But increased support for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts is also apparent in Poland , Russia , Brazil and Mexico .
Among majority - Muslim publics , Indonesians are alone in supporting American anti-terrorism efforts .
In that regard , while the image of the U.S. has improved somewhat in many predominantly Muslim countries , majorities in most continue to fear that the U.S. could pose a military threat to their country someday .
It ’s Still the Economy
As in 2008 , most people surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project say they are dissatisfied with conditions in their country .
However , discontent increased sharply over the past year in Spain , Poland , Russia , Pakistan and Mexico .
As in previous polls , an overwhelming number of Chinese ( 87 % ) say they are satisfied with conditions in their country .
Majorities in Canada and India also express satisfaction with the way things were going in their countries .
For India , the current recorded level of national contentment represents a major increase over 2008 .
Overwhelmingly negative views of national economies underlie national discontent in most countries .
Overall , ratings of national economic conditions have grown more negative in the last year .
Among the 21 countries surveyed in 2008 and 2009 , the median percentage rating their economy as bad is 74 % this year , compared with 62 % last year .
Evaluations of economic conditions soured the most over the past year in Europe – specifically in Britain , Germany , Spain , Poland and Russia .
But in China , India and Indonesia , where GDP has continued to grow , opinions of economic conditions have improved since 2008 , especially in India .
Even though America ’s image has improved markedly over the past year , majorities or pluralities in 20 of 25 publics believe that the U.S. economy is hurting their own economies .
This was the prevailing view in most countries in the 2008 survey , as well .
It is slightly more prevalent in the new poll – especially in Russia and Nigeria .
In India most ( 55 % ) see the U.S. as having a positive effect on the economy , while the Chinese are divided about evenly on the American impact .
There is little consensus as to which of the major powers has the best plan to fix the economy .
In Europe , only the French and Germans express strong confidence in the European Union .
In Britain and Spain , where many favor the U.S. approach , confidence in the EU is lower .
Most Americans ( 60 % ) believe the U.S. has the best approach to dealing with the global recession , though the poll does find that Obama ’s economic stimulus plan is less popular in the United States than in Western Europe .
As in the United States , most Chinese ( 60 % ) say their country ’s approach to the global recession is best .
The 25 - nation poll finds a mixed message in responses to the global recession .
As in the past , majorities in most nations continue to endorse a free market economy and most people polled continue to endorse growing international trade ties .
However , still more people say their governments should take steps to protect their countries economically , even if other friendly nations object .
And as in previous surveys in this series , large percentages of people believe that their country needs to be protected against foreign influence and most favor greater restrictions and control on immigration .
While global recession concerns are clearly evident , huge majorities of the 25 publics questioned in the poll continue to see global warming as a serious problem .
As has been the case in past years , the intensity of concern about this issue is somewhat less among the Chinese and the Americans compared with people in other major nations .
But the current poll found the intensity of worry also slipping in Canada , Mexico , Britain , Spain , Poland , Russia and Turkey compared with levels in 2008 .
Stronger concern for global warming was recorded in Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Nigeria and China .
However , the Chinese continue to report far less intense worry about global warming than any of the other publics polled .
Notably , however , willingness to pay increased prices to combat climate change was much higher in China , and also India , than in other countries .
Close to nine - in - ten among these two publics , both of which have seen GDP growth in the past year , agree that people should be willing to pay higher prices to address this problem .
And support for higher prices to deal with climate change was also a good deal higher than average among the publics of two other major Asian economies – South Korea and Japan .
The poll found near universal awareness of swine flu among the 25 publics surveyed in late May and early June .
Pakistan is the only country polled where people were largely unaware of the disease .
Concern about swine flu was considerable : Majorities of those who have heard about the disease in most countries polled were very or somewhat worried about being exposed to it .
Concerns were especially strong in parts of Asia , but surprisingly modest in Mexico , despite the number of deaths from swine flu that have occurred there .
Also of Note :
Better make those park reservations now .
Ken Burns ’
“ The National Parks : America ’s Best Idea , ” a six - part , 12 - hour documentary celebrating the virtues of the country ’s nearly 400 federally protected spaces sets up camp on PBS on Sept. 27 and stays through Oct. 2 .
The country ’s most famous documentarian , who spoke this afternoon during TCA ’s summer press tour , is hoping to do for the national parks what he did for its battlefields after the airing of his landmark PBS series “ The Civil War ” when visits to sites like Gettysburg skyrocketed by as much as 300 % .
“ We want the superintendents angry at us because of all the Popsicle wrappers they ’ll have to clean up , ” Burns said .
“ It ’s a good problem to have . ”
Collateral nuisances like trash and traffic jams notwithstanding , large swells of visitors will help ensure the park system ’s vitality and transcendent importance to the country , Burns said .
Although with about 275 million annual visitors and the green movement on the rise , it seems unlikely the parks will go unnoticed anytime soon .
Without the shield of the national park system , Burns argued , places like Yosemite would be a gated community and Yellowstone would be an amusement park .
The American - born idea , which Burns characterized as the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape , spurred other nations to preserve some of their lands for the public as well .
Today , more than 200 countries have set aside more than 4,000 sites .
Asked if the lengthy series was a tough sell especially in comparison with many of his earlier works about sports , music and war , Burns said no .
“ The drama is as dramatic as anything else , ” he said .

Medical researchers from Addenbrooke ’s Hospital in Britain have developed an easy - to - use Alzheimer ’s Disease test .
This Test Your Memory ( TYM ) test is an Alzheimer ’s Disease exam that differs somewhat from the SLUMS ( download SLUMS exam ) and Mini-Mental exams in that it can be self - administered .
The TYM test , while it can be self - performed should be used in consultation with health professionals who are familiar with aging - related cognitive issues and diseases .
Any person seeking a true diagnosis of Alzheimer ’s Disease or related dementias must see a physician in order to rule out other potential reasons for cognitive impairments .
According to TYM
Test officials :
The exam has several features which should help the diagnosis and management of patients with memory problems :
The patient fills in the test themselves .
This saves time .
The TYM test is a permanent self - written record of a patient ’s achievement on a certain date and can be referred back to .
The TYM tests 10 different cognitive domains including anterograde memory , semantic knowledge and visuospatial skills which are typically affected early in Alzheimer ’s disease .
There is a very clear distinction between the scores of normal controls ( average 47/50 ) and patients with mild AD ( average 33/50 ) .
A cut off of 42 has a sensitivity of 93 % and specificity of 86 % in the diagnosis of AD in our study .
It is powerful in detecting mild Alzheimer ’s disease detecting 93 % of cases in our study .
Anyone using this exam should also stay mindful that while results of the test ’s accuracy appear promising , there are other tests also available for diagnosing Alzheimer ’s Disease and related dementias .

Anyone interested in more information about the test should visit www.tymtest.com.
There it is noted that the site is intended for health professionals only , which underscores the importance of administering exams with qualified individuals .
The craigslist team is n't interested in updating the site , so Wired asked leading designers to give it a user - interface lift .
Craigslist Today
Visitors arriving at craigslist are confronted by a confusing homepage cluttered with links most people will never click on .
Overall , the user interface is in dire need of an organizing principle that guides you to the details you seek while filtering out extraneous information .
It 's hard to know even where to begin : Should you start your career search under Jobs or Gigs ?
The right side of the screen is devoted to an exhaustive list of cities and countries , although most users care about only the one they live in .
Once you dive into a section , navigation requires more backtracking than a hedgerow maze .
Locations are n't sorted in sufficient detail , images are n't available until you click through to a listing , and items can't be flagged for side - by - side comparison .
And that 's just the desktop version .
On a mobile browser , craigslist is an interminable roll of links rendered in eye - crossingly minuscule text .
Make
It a Web App
Khoi Vinh , NYTimes.com
The NYTimes.com team retained craigslist 's basic look and feel while making the site work more like an app .
Since search is the most important feature , design director Khoi Vinh and his colleagues gave this function more real estate and placed it at the top of the page .
They moved the all - important Post to Classifieds link to the right side of the page and increased its visibility by bumping up the type size .
They made room for white space and eliminated the gray backgrounds , which they thought weighed down the site .
" It feels more open , more nimble , " Vinh says .
Information architecture Anh Dang , Design Paul Lau
In the design created by Vinh and his team , the listings themselves do n't stand alone but are framed by navigational aids that let you jump immediately to other parts of the site .
Buttons up top lead to the major sections ( the current one always appears front and center in light gray ) .
On the right side , the My Craigslist sidebar shows the ads you 've viewed most recently and the sections you browse most often , transforming Craig 's list into your list .
The calendar , fixed at the bottom right , is available on every page .
Make It Simple
SimpleScott " Craigslist is working , " says SimpleScott , former design director of BarackObama.com — why fix what is n't broken ?
Instead , he focused on making the site easier on the eyes .
On the front page , he aligned rows and columns in a uniform grid so they 're clearer at a glance .
Links you 've already visited leap out in blue so you can retrace your steps easily .
Displaying the site on a mobile browser , however , presents bigger challenges .
SimpleScott met them by dividing the pages into a series of screens .
A hierarchical menu makes it easy to navigate without accidentally clicking the wrong link .
A map page lets you browse listings by location .
Ads and photos each get their own screens .
Buttons along the bottom make common functions available at all times .
Make It Beautiful
Matt Willey , Studio8 Design " Craigslist is frustrating and claustrophobic , " Matt Willey says .
His layout has a contemporary look , a Web 2.0 feel , and plenty of breathing room .
He eliminated long lists in favor of two pulldown menus : one that lets you jump to various sections and another that sorts listings by price or date .
His design displays images in the category pages , so you do n't have to click through to the individual listings to see them .
Thumbnails load rapidly and blow up to full size with a mouseclick .
A button called Add to Watchlist marks favorites , while the Share button emails listings to friends or posts them to social networks .
Make It Personal
Luke Hayman and Lisa Strausfeld , Pentagram
Think the current homepage lacks personality ?
" We decided to do something about the cult of Craig , " Lisa Strausfeld says .
She and Luke Hayman highlighted the contradiction between Newmark 's interest in grassroots democracy and the reality that the site is , well , his list .
The arrangement of words is essentially random ; this design wo n't win awards for ease of use .
Numbers from the calendar outline Newmark 's head and glasses ; longer text strings form facial features .
Newmark is always in the background — this version brings him to the forefront .

Even members of the filmmaking team themselves have been disturbed by the film .
Composer Robert McNaughton could n't watch the film all the way through upon first seeing it , and Tom Towles ( Otis ) has only ever seen the film once , at the Splatterfest Film Festival in 1990 .

Alternate Versions
In 1992 , the uncut version was originally refused classification ( RC ) in Australia .
To obtain an R rating , approx .
90 seconds of footage had to be edited out .
The footage edited out for an R rating was as follows : Approx .
15 seconds of the close up of the dead woman on the toilet including the sounds of the bottle smashing and Henry shouting " Die Bitch Die ! " .
Approx . 25 seconds of the close up of the dead woman on the couch including the sounds of her struggling .
Approx . 50 seconds is edited from the home invasion scene consisting of approx .
15 seconds of Otis sitting down with the mother on top of him .
Henry telling him to remove the mothers bra and skirt .
Approx . 15 seconds of the mother struggling and pleading .
Approx . 15 seconds of Otis kissing the dead mother and the sound of Henry killing the father off camera and approx .

The Service Employers International Union has vowed to help stand up against the GOP backed Astrobirthers who are being sent in to disrupt the town hall meetings of Democratic members of Congress .
Since the union announced it 's intentions , well - funded right wing groups and media outlets ( see Fox News ) have orchestrated call in campaigns accusing them of plotting violence against them -- one of the calls ( audio and transcript in the video above ) contained a not - so - veiled threat of armed violence :
One of the country 's largest unions has been hit by a wave of hostile calls and even death threats from people upset with its involvement in town - hall health care debates .
The Service Employers International Union was , as one aide put it , " deluged " with calls on Friday after several conservative media outlets accused the organization of trying to assault demonstrators who had showed up to protest Obama 's health care agenda .
Making it even scarier for union employees , the address of the union 's St. Louis headquarters was mentioned on air by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh .
Callers who reached both the front desk and the communications department compared the union officials to Nazis , union aides say .
On Twitter , organizers of the town hall protest urged people to take pictures and write down the license plate numbers of attending SEIU officials .
More alarming than anything else , angry callers and protesters pledged to take up arms against the union .

I believe the time has come for Attorney General Eric Holder to get involved .
Right wing violence is on the rise in America and the threat of bloodshed at the hands of a Fox News / GOP inspired extremist at one of these town hall meetings is real possibility .

Torture : it is an ancient practice that still goes on today .
In the middle ages torture was used for punishment , interrogation , and deterrence .
It is easy to consider ourselves more humane these days , but while some of the devices listed here would lead to death , we have , in modern times , mastered the ability of inflicting extreme pain for indefinite periods of time – something which is , perhaps , worse .
SEE ALSO : 10 Torture Murders That Will Curdle Your Blood
10 Head Crusher
With the head placed under the upper cap and the chin placed above the bottom bar , the top screw of this awful device was slowly turned , compressing the skull tightly .
First the teeth are destroyed , shattering and splintering into the jaw .
Then the eyes are squeezed from the sockets – some versions had special receptacles to catch them .
Lastly , the skull fractures and the contents of the head are forced out .
In earlier stages , the torturer could keep the head firmly clamped and strike the metal skull cap periodically ; each blow echoing pain throughout the victim ’s body .
9 Cat ’s Paw
The Cat ’s Paw ( or Spanish Tickler ) was oftentimes attached to a handle ; in size and appearance it was an extension of the torturer ’s hand .
In this way it was used to rip and tear flesh away from the bone , from any part of the body .
8 Knee Splitter
A popular torture device during the Inquisition , the knee splitter does what it says : split victims ’ knees and render them useless .
Built from two spiked wood blocks , the knee splitter is placed on top of and behind the knee of its victims .
Two large screws connecting the blocks are then turned , causing the two blocks to close towards each other and effectively destroy a victim ’s knee .
This device could also be used to inflict damage on other parts of the body such as the arms .
7 Scavenger ’s Daughter
The Scavenger ’s Daughter was invented as an instrument of torture in the reign of Henry VIII by Sir William Skevington ( also known as William Skeffington ) , Lieutenant of the Tower of London .
It was an A - frame shaped metal rack to which the head was strapped to the top point of the A , the hands at the mid-point and the legs at the lower spread ends ; swinging the head down and forcing the knees up in a sitting position so compressed the body as to force the blood from the nose and ears .
The Scavenger ’s Daughter was conceived as the perfect complement to the Duke of Exeter ’s Daughter ( the rack ) because it worked the opposite principle to the rack by compressing the body rather than stretching it .
6 Judas Chair
This procedure has remained essentially unchanged from the Middle Ages until today .
The victim is hoisted up and lowered onto the point of the pyramid in such a way that his weight rests on the point positioned in the anus , in the vagina , under the scrotum or under the coccyx ( the last two or three vertebrae ) .
The executioner , according to the pleasure of the interrogators , can vary the pressure from zero to that of total body weight .
The victim can be rocked , or made to fall repeatedly onto the point .
The Judas cradle was thus called also in Italian ( culla di Giuda ) and German ( Judaswiege ) , but in French it was known as la veille , “ the wake ” or “ nightwatch ” .
Nowadays this method enjoys the favour of not a few governments in Latin America and elsewhere , with and without improvements like electrified waist rings and pyramid points .
Similar to the Judas Chair – but probably worse , is the Spanish Donkey :
5 Spanish Donkey
The Spanish Donkey was a device which consisted of a main board cut with a wedge at the top fastened to two cross -beams .
The naked victim was placed astride the main board as if riding a donkey , and various numbers of weights were attached to his or her feet .
The agony could be ‘ fine - tuned ’ by using lighter or heavier weights .
Sources relate that on occasion , the wedge would slice entirely through the victim as a result of the immense weight attached to his or her feet .
4 Choke Pear
These instruments were used in oral and rectal formats , and in the larger vaginal one .
They are forced into the mouth , rectum or vagina of the victim and there expanded by force of the screw to the maximum aperture of the segments .
The inside of the cavity in question is irremediably mutilated , nearly always fatally so .
The pointed prongs at the end of the segments serve better to rip into the throat , the intestines or the cervix .
The oral pear was often inflicted on heretical preachers , but also on lay persons guilty of unorthodox tendencies ; the rectal pear awaited passive male homosexuals , and the vaginal one women guilty of sexual union with Satan or his familiars .
Pictured above is a version of the choke pear called the “ Pear of Anguish ” .
3 Lead Sprinkler
The lead sprinkler was essentially a ladle on the end of a handle .
The top half of the sphere could be removed and the lower half was filled with molten metal , boiling oil , boiling water , pitch or tar .
The perforated top half was then re-attached .
Shaking or flicking the sprinkler towards the victim showered him or her with the boiling contents of the ladle .
The victim had , of course , been pinioned in advance .
2 Breast Ripper
This item was used both as a punitive and an interrogational device .
Punitively , it was used red - hot to mark the breast of unmarried mothers .
In an inquisitory nature it was used on condemned women – convicted of heresy , blasphemy , adultery , self - induced abortion , erotic white magic and any other crime that the inquisitors selected .
The claws were used , either cold or heated , on a female ’s exposed breasts – rendering them into bloody pulps .
A variation was called the Spider .
This consisted of clawed bars which protruded from the wall .
A woman was pulled alongside the bars until her breasts were torn away .
1 Crocodile Shears
The crocodile shears was an instrument of torture used in late medieval Europe and typically reserved for regicides – those who attempted ( and , perhaps , succeeded ) to assassinate the king .
The shears were made of iron and were based upon the concept of pincers , but — instead of standard jaws or blades , crocodile shears ended in a pair of hemicylindrical blades that , when closed together , formed a long , narrow tube .
The insides of the blades were generously lined with teeth or spikes .
After being heated red -hot , the crocodile shears were applied to the erect penis , which — once exposed to sufficient tension — was torn from the prisoner ’s body ; or at the very least leading to severe arterial bleeding .

Funny thing : I was at Netroots Nation last week , but I do n’t recall a panel discussion onto help the White House collect a ginormous database of conservatives one email address at a time .
In fact , I ’ve still got my copy of the events schedule , and try as I might I cannot find the session Ihave missed .
Faux Noise is playing a truly pernicious fear card .
I ’m not the first to point out that Breitbart and company were not inclined to don their tinfoil hats when Bush was collecting massive amounts of electronic data on Americans and infiltrating anti-war groups , but I ’ll point it out anyway — because , once again , what we ’re seeing here is psychological projection .
If Faux Noise wants to talk about spying , they could give me a call .
While at Netroots Nation , I came across a pair of pasty , black - clad infiltrators with badges reading : “ RIGHT ONLINE . ”
One had theirs turned around , but it did n’t help ; they both stuck out like sore thumbs .
Observing their movements , it became clear they were checking out the Westin Hotel to see if they could access the event center across the street through the elevated walkway between the buildings .
( They could n’t . )
After a few queries , I learned that Right Online is a conference of conservative bloggers and activists , and has been shadowing the Netroots Nation conference for a long time .
Every year , they hold their convention simultaneously in a nearby location .
Disturbing ?
Yes .
There ’s a word for this kind of behavior ; it ’s the word you use for a person who obsesses over your schedule , follows you around , and tries to sneak into your house : STALKER .

This is a peninsula mainly for fishing in a public park in Eau Claire , WI .
The middle is covered with trees , with roads surrounding the tree patch .
I was able to frame it just right so it looks like a small part of a massive forest , where this is really all you 'd see if you were actually there .
HDR , of course .
In hindsight , I wish that I aimed my camera downward a little bit so that one branch was n't in the way .

Hi again , and welcome to our next technical article .
This is a mix of technical and legal , but as I know many of us in the open source community are very serious about the licences we work under , I thought you would like a little background reading to lead you up to a really neat and little - known feature of the GNU linker ( ld ) that we have just adopted .
For years , LGP has been working with libraries such as SDL , ffmpeg , and others that are licensed under the LGPL ( GNU Lesser General Public License ) .
Without these invaluable tools from the open source community , LGP would not exist , and nor would hundreds of open source projects .
The LGPL states that an application that links against an LGPL library is not bound by the LGPL itself , but then goes on to qualify this , and make exceptions , and even itself states that the boundaries between what counts as simply linking against a library , and what counts as a derivative work , are ‘ not precisely defined by law ’ .
The problem we have always faced is finding a way to make sure the game is portable .
To do this you MUST make sure that you are using a known version of as many libraries as you possibly can .
There is no point in exhaustively testing a game against SDL 1.2.12 when next week SDL 1.2.13 comes out , changes a few of our assumptions , and means the game crashes .
Multiply the problem by the number of versions a library has , multiplied by the number of libraries a game links against , and you can see why this is a big problem .
And so , we like to make sure we build the game , test the game , and run the game , all against exactly the same libraries as the end user will use , in as many cases as is possible .
Since the beginning of commercial Linux games , the common practice has been to create a release of each game such that there was a static and a dynamic linked version of the game in each release .
The dynamic version of the game would be completely in compliance with the word and spirit of the LGPL , using the users own system libraries , while the static linked version of the game was released because linking the libraries directly into the game ensured we knew which libraries were being used .
The statically linked executable though , was really not very much in the spirit of the LGPL .
We always got away with it because we included the exact same game in full LGPL compliance , and because of the wording of the LGPL , it was fairly ambiguous as to whether this was allowed .
But even so , we were never happy with it .
Loopholes are not something to be proud of using .
There was another method of course .
The other method involved forcing the game , via the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use libraries in a certain directory .
However that had issues of its own .
To do this you either have to tell the user ‘ before you start your game type this long command into the commandline ’ or you start the game from a shellscript .
Shellscripts are all well and good , but they bring problems of their own , such as ( for security ) making changes to the euid , resetting values from /etc / profile , and of course , assuming that the shell in use has exactly the same syntax as the shell at the time of release .
It was decided that because of this , and many other issues , starting from a shellscript was too much of a risk for portability and was ruled out .
And so , we were left with the method that has been being used for the last 12 or so years .
That is until recently , when we found a nice new way to fix this problem once and for all .
Most people are probably unaware of the linker option , - rpath .
Most of you do n’t ever need to be .
This option lets you tell an application where to look for libraries .
It works just like adding a new path into the LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
Great , but it does n’t really help like that .
It is set at compile time and so we would need to restrict installation to a known directory on everyone ’s machine .
Obviously unacceptable for most users .
And so the problem remained until one of our devteam discovered a neat little trick that is n’t even documented in the manual for the linker .
You can use a special keyword $ ORIGIN to say ‘ relative to the actual location of the executable ’ .
Suddenly we found we could use - rpath $ ORIGIN / lib and it worked .
The game was loading the correct libraries , and so was stable and portable , but was also now completely in the spirit of the LGPL as well as the letter !
For those of you a little newer to compiling under Linux , some of you may not even be aware you use the ld linker .
It is done automatically by gcc for you .
If you are simply using gcc in a Makefile , it is a little more difficult in syntax , but as a hint you would change an example Makefile line that started like this
gcc ob j1.o ob j2.o -o my_application
to be
gcc - Wl , - rpath , \$ $ ORIGIN / lib / ob j1.o ob j2.o -o my_application
So , that ’s the neat little trick I thought I ’d like to share with you , maybe it will help some of you out there to organise the way your projects run , as of course it is n’t just useful for closed source , this is useful for any project that has to use a specific library version in order to work properly !

What Laid - Off Dads Want This Father 's
Day think about what 's best for that unemployed dad .
June 18 , 2009  -- With Father 's
Day within putting distance , it 's nearly impossible to tune into the national news without hearing what laid - off dads want .
Unfortunately , many of these reports try to shove the wants and needs of unemployed fathers into a neat , little gender - specific box .
Either we 're told that men are the new women , content to cook , clean and referee the kids .
Or we hear that , despite today 's blurring of once - traditional gender roles , deep down , men will be men , emasculated without the ability to play financial provider , adrift and depressed when stripped of their professional identity .
But talk with a dozen - plus unemployed dads as I have this month , and you 'll find their stories are far more complex .
Their financial situation , marital status , kids ' needs and own upbringing have as much to do with how they respond to a layoff as any deep - seated notion about what it means to be a family man .
Sure , there are your retro " men should n't have to grocery shop or shuttle the kids to school " guys .
But there are also guys who revel in their newfound diaper - slinging status as manny of the house .
" There is n't just one story here , " said Heather Boushey , senior economist at the Center for American Progress .
It 's too early for any hard data on how the recession may be causing families to redistribute the household labor and what men think of all this , said Boushey , who 's studied working families and U.S. labor trends extensively .
But , she said , since most men now grow up expecting their partners will work , if a family man gets laid off , " It 's not the trauma of the 1950s - style guy . "
" There are so many families where it 's tough if the man loses his job , but it 's not going to be a life - altering role reversal , " Boushey said .
" Why should n't he watch the kids ?
People do that all the time . "
Identity Crisis , Schmidentity Crisis Take Scott Skibell , 46 , from Overland Park , Kan. , who 's been laid off and thrust in the role of stay - at - home dad twice since 2007 .
" Two years ago I took a severance package from my then - employer , " he said .
" I had the best summer ever .
My girls were 6 and 8 at the time .
We went biking , hiking , canoeing and took several little vacations where they got to go boating , tubing and jet skiing .
I was getting paid my regular salary , had full benefits and even had two job offers waiting for me .
It was a summer we 'll always remember . "
Needless to say , his wife , a part - time dental hygienist , was green with envy .
Since getting laid off this February though , things have been very different for Skibell , who 's worked in the training industry for nearly two decades .
With only a month 's severance and his wife working just three days a week , his family 's done the requisite belt - tightening .
And with no job offers in sight , he 's trying to making a go as a home - based consultant -- easier said than done with two young daughters out of school and underfoot for the summer .
But while Skibell would love to see his new financial reality turn around quickly , you wo n't find him sulking about being knocked off his provider pedestal .
" These days it 's not just the male 's responsibility , " he said .
" My wife and I have both worked , and it 's more of a partnership .
I do n't see it as a male - female role .
It truly takes two incomes to pay for the insurance , the mortgage , retirement and college . "
Happily Housekeeping , But Frazzled by Babysitting
For Victor Alfieri , 36 , a casualty of the financial services industry , unemployment has been a bit more of a shock to his system .
" As a man , and especially as a father , you are supposed to be the breadwinner , the supporter , the one that takes care of all of that stuff , " said the Greenville , S.C. , father of three children ages 3 , 5 and 6 .
And although Alfieri tried to put a positive spin on it , telling himself he'd have more time for his kids and those neglected projects around the house , " Life has been very humbling these past few months , " he said .
" I have learned that I can be a ' house husband ' but not necessarily a ' house dad , ' " he explained .
" Cooking , cleaning and laundry are no problem .
It 's the daily parenting that has totally brought me to my knees .
How do women do this ?
The fighting , the bickering , the messes , the not listening … the stress and frustration levels are through the roof ! "
Currently , Alfieri and his wife , who works full - time but does n't make enough to cover all the family 's expenses , are squeaking by thanks to a little financial help from relatives .
With his current profession up in smoke , Alfieri 's trying to pursue a freelance writing career .
Still , he 's not dead - set on working outside the home , provided he could get some help with his daddy daycare duties .
" If we had a financial situation where I was home taking care of everything at the house and my wife was fine with it , I would be fine , " he said .

This attitude goes back to Switzerland ’s founding in the 13th century .
The original Swiss communities ’ resentment of what they saw as the Hapsburgs ’ oppressive taxes helped push them to claim their independence in 1291 .
Today , Swiss citizens continue to vote on any tax increases in referendums ( and sometimes even accept them ) .
These healthy curbs on government contrast with the Orwellian concept of the “ transparent citizen ” whose every act is known to government .
We see our system as a social pact between citizens and the state .
Swiss privacy laws help preserve basic property rights .
Bank secrecy was introduced in 1934 , most notably to protect the identities and assets of Jews in Nazi Germany .
( Unfortunately , those same rules made it difficult for some heirs to gain access to these accounts without proper documentation , leading to an out - of - court agreement in 1998 by Swiss banks to pay $ 1.25 billion to settle Holocaust - related lawsuits . )
Corruption , expropriation , crime and the persecution of various minorities remain risks in most of the world .
For people threatened by such risks , financial privacy can protect their legitimate property .
Some would argue that Swiss bank accounts offer the same protections to criminals , but in fact Swiss provisions against money laundering are tough .
Swiss bankers are required to know their clients and the origin of the funds they accept .
They must alert the regulators if they suspect criminal behavior .
Banking confidentiality enjoys overwhelming support in Switzerland .
According to the latest annual survey by the polling firm M.I.S.
Trend , 78 percent favor maintaining the laws as they are , and 91 percent are shown to value their financial privacy .
This is especially relevant since Swiss citizens are expected to vote eventually on the renegotiated tax treaties in a referendum .
If the government fails to convince a majority of voters , the treaties wo n’t enter into force .
But if they are ratified as planned , the Swiss government should agree only to an exchange of information in individual cases with reasonable suspicion of tax fraud .
Other governments should see this as a fair compromise .
We will not solve the global problem of tax evasion by punishing honest depositors and destroying Swiss traditions .

As they grumble about how rap music is destroying civilization , what they do n't mention is that the blues they were listening to in the 30s and 40s could be every bit as violent , sexually explicit and sometimes just downright insane as the worst gansta rap has to offer .
Compared to some of these vintage lyrics the members of N.W.A are levelheaded concerned citizens , and Eminem 's a regular damned feminist .

It ’s a Pizza Pie !
When I saw Bake at 350‘s announcement for the Flavor of the Month blogging event , I knew I wanted to participate .
It has been a while since I participated in a blogging event .
I ’m not much of a pie person myself , so I was trying to think of other non-pie foods that have the word pie in them .
I decided on a whim that I ’d make a pizza for the event .
Now I ’ve never called a pizza a pie myself , but I know it ’s been done .
So I ’m counting it ( hope that ’s ok with Bridget of Baker at 350 ) .
I even cheated on the dough .
I have to admit , while I ’ve been tackling my fear of yeast over the past year or so , homemade pizza dough just has n’t happened at our house yet .
I used store bought dough * gasp * and decided to make my pizza into a breakfast pizza .
Eggs seem to be the latest trend in condiments lately .
I ’ve seen them pop up as a topping on burgers , sandwiches and pretty much anything else .
So I thought I ’d give it a shot and make a breakfast pizza .
I just used what I had in the house to make my pizza .
I went with goat cheese , fresh tomato , bacon , and egg .
Then I sprinkled some freshly ground pepper , Kosher salt , and Parsley on top when it came out of the oven .
Can I just say I do n’t know why I did n’t try this before .
This is seriously AMAZING .
I wanted to eat the whole pizza in one sitting .
I baked mine a little long so the eggs would completely set up .
I do n’t like runny eggs .
I know when I make this again ( most likely this weekend ) , Hubby will want it with runny eggs .
So we ’ll see how that turns out .
Whether you like runny eggs or not , you have to make this as soon as possible .
Breakfast pizza – from ME ! – serves 4
pizza dough – I used an 8 ″ Mini Boboli Crust
1 fresh tomato , seeded and diced
3 slices cooked bacon , crumbled
2 Tbsp goat cheese
3 eggs
parsley
salt and pepper
Heat oven to 450 ( this is what the pizza dough instructions said ) .
Mix the diced tomato and goat cheese in a bowl to combine .
Spread onto pizza dough , leaving holes for where your eggs will go .
Sprinkle bacon over entire pizza .
Bake in oven for about 5 minutes or until dough is mostly cooked .
Crack eggs over pizza .
I used one of my new round cookie cutters ( thanks Dad ! ) to crack the egg into .
The egg white still spread all over , but I think it helped keep the yolk where I wanted it .
Cook for another 5 - 10 minutes depending on how done you want your eggs ( I cooked mine 9 minutes more ) .
Take the pizza out before the eggs are completely set .
They will still be jiggly when you take the pizza out .
Make a foil tent over the pizza and let set for about 5 - 10 more minutes .
The egg will continue to cook .
Sprinkle with freshly ground pepper , Kosher salt , and fresh parsley .
Enjoy !

Ms Harman has launched a new Equalities Bill One of Labour 's top two posts should always be held by a woman , Deputy Leader Harriet Harman has told a paper .
She does " not agree with all - male leaderships " because men " cannot be left to run things on their own " she told the Sunday Times .
A balanced team of men and women make " better decisions , " she added .
The MP reportedly tried to change the party 's rules to ensure a female was always in a top job shortly after winning the deputy leadership contest .
In an interview with the paper , Ms Harman said she thought there would never be a men-only team of leadership in the Labour Party again .
" People would look at it and say , ' What ?
Are there no women in the party to be part of the leadership ?
Do men want to do it all themselves ? ' , " she told the paper .
A team of women and men in Labour - which is the party of equality - are fighting to win the next election
Harriet Harman
Mandelson urges Labour fightback
Send us your comments
She said the party " owed it to women " to have a female in one of the two top jobs , to makes sure the concerns of women voters were properly taken into account when decisions were being made .
Female political leaders were " coming of age " internationally , she added .
' Insufferably arrogant ' Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show , Ms Harman said the government had a " team of women and men ministers making sure this country gets through this economic crisis " .
She said comments Labour had already lost the next election were " insufferably arrogant " and " a team of women and men in Labour - which is the party of equality - were fighting to win " .
Her remarks follow Lord Mandelson 's call for Labour to " roll its sleeves up " and take the fight to the Conservatives .
Former Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe dismissed the idea of reserving one of Labour 's top posts for a woman as " remarkably silly " and said jobs should be handed out on merit .
" As long as women are in Parliament , and are good , then I do n't have a view on whether the entire Cabinet is male or female , " she said .
Special processes to encourage females to get to the top were " demeaning , " particularly if the processes " involved positive discrimination " or " unjustified over - promotion , " she added .
Ms Harman has led a campaign to promote more women to top jobs , particularly in the City .
Under her controversial new equality bill , women will find it easier to demand equal pay and employers will be given a legal right to discriminate in favour of female candidates .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - British boy wizard Harry Potter conjured his magic at box offices again , as the sixth film in the highly popular movie series earned a record $ 22.2 million at Wednesday midnight showings in the United States .
“ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ” from Warner Bros. beat the old record for Wednesday midnight screenings of $ 18.5 million held by 2008 Batman movie “ The Dark Knight , ” said Hollywood.com Box Office President Paul Dergarabedian .
The debut “ portends a huge and potentially record - breaking number for a single - day ( box office ) gross and best first five - day gross , ” among movies , Dergarabedian said .
The highest one - day U.S. box office record belongs to “ The Dark Knight , ” which debuted on a Wednesday last summer to $ 67.1 million and went on to $ 203.7 million in its first five days .
It earned $ 1 billion worldwide throughout its run in theaters .
The five previous “ Potter ” movies about the adventures of Harry and his friends at the Hogwarts school , based on the best - selling kids books by author J.K. Rowling , have raked in $ 4.5 billion worldwide since the first film in 2001 .
But in recent weeks , some media reports have suggested the movies ’ fan base of teenagers and pre-teens may now be too old for the movies and that other franchises , such as the popular “ Twilight ” films , may steal some of Potter ’s audience magic .
Still , “ Half - Blood Prince ” hits theaters a full two years after the most recent “ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , ” causing box office watchers to see a good deal of pent - up demand for the movie .
“ Order of the Phoenix ” also opened on a Wednesday and took in $ 140 million in its first five days , on the way to $ 938 million in total global ticket sales .
Warner Bros. is a unit of Time Warner Inc .

This past week a woman was murdered in an apparent honor killing in the Gaza Strip .
She was beaten by her father who thought she was having an affair .
May Allah have mercy on the soul and forgive the sins of the woman , named Fadia , and may there also be justice for her death .
Unfortunately , CNN ’s coverage of Fadia ’s murder was a big FAIL .
The first reason was the picture accompanying the piece .
The article did n’t even need a picture , but if the editors felt that they needed a picture to accompany the article , why not have a picture of the victim or one of the women interviewed for the piece ?
Instead , the editors and / or the author felt it was better to put up an AFP / Getty Images file photo of two Palestinian women walking in a mall with the caption “ Palestinian Muslim women walk past a shop displaying Western clothes in Gaza City . ”
What does this have to do with the article ?
There is absolutely no relevance to the subject matter at all .
Is the picture supposed to relay some subconscious message that shopping for Western clothes will help Palestinian women ?
Maybe shopping in malls prevents honor killings ?
The photo is bizarre and out of place for an article dealing with honor killings .
It actually makes light of a very grave and tragic issue .
The second reason why the article does n’t convey the seriousness of the matter is because they refer to honor killings as “ killings ” :
“ They said the killing ‘ was carried out on grounds related to ‘ preserving ’ the honor of the family . ’ ”
“ The Palestinian Center for Human Rights said nine people have been killed in honor crimes in 2009 , five of them women .
This represents a two - fold increase from 2008 in such killings . ”
“ The killing highlights fears among human rights organizations about an increasing marginalization of women ’s rights in Gaza under the Hamas - controlled government . ” ( emphasis added )
Each time a murder committed in the name of “ honor ” is referred to as a killing , it glosses over the brutality of the murder .
These are not women who were killed in the line of duty or killed by a bus on the way to work .
These are women who died as a result of someone intentionally murdering them .
Referring to these murders as killings also insinuates that the murdering of women is somehow more normal , more part of Palestinian culture .
Lastly , I was disappointed with the association of Hamas to this issue .
The article jumps from a discussion of honor killings to a discussion of the erosion of women ’s rights under the Hamas regime .
Women ’s rights under Hamas is definitely an issue that needs to be talked about , but I do n’t see how that issue is connected to honor killings .
Honor killings are also carried out in areas under secular rule , such as the West Bank and Jordan .
Honor killings are not connected to “ radical Islamic movements ” any more than they are connected to secular movements .
Misogyny is the root cause of honor killings , not Islamic movements .
CNN ’s article serves as more of a lesson in how not to cover this sensitive issue than an informative piece of a tragic murder that is the result of misogynistic views of women , their sexuality , and its place in society .

Recitation # 24 - Lost Loves
And by the way , if you forget to say where you 're from , you 'll now be from Aberdeen .
If you 've got a query , send it in with " Recitation Question " in the subject line .
Using tiny crystals called quantum dots , Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a highly sensitive test to look for DNA attachments that often are early warning signs of cancer .
This test , which detects both the presence and the quantity of certain DNA changes , could alert people who are at risk of developing the disease and could tell doctors how well a particular cancer treatment is working .
The new test was reported in a paper called " MS - qFRET : a quantum dot - based method for analysis of DNA methylation , " published in the August issue of the journal Genome Research .
The work also was presented at a conference of the American Association of Cancer Research .
" If it leads to early detection of cancer , this test could have huge clinical implications , " said Jeff Tza - Huei Wang , an associate professor of mechanical engineering whose lab team played a leading role in developing the technique .
" Doctors usually have the greatest success in fighting cancer if they can treat it in its early stage . "
Wang and his students developed the test over the past three years with colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center .
Stephen B. Baylin , deputy director of the center and a co-author of the Genome Research study , said the test represents " a very promising platform " to help doctors detect cancer at an early stage and to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from a particular therapy .
The recent study , which included the detection of DNA markers in sputum from lung cancer patients , was designed to show that the technology was sound .
Compared to current methods , the test appeared to be more sensitive and delivered results more quickly , the researchers said .
" The technique looks terrific , but it still needs to be tested in many real - world scenarios , " Baylin said .
" Some of these studies are already under way here .
If we continue to see exciting progress , this testing method could easily be in wide use within the next five years . "
The target of this test is a biochemical change called DNA methylation , which occurs when a chemical group called methyl attaches itself to cytosine , one of the four nucleotides or base building blocks of DNA .
When methylation occurs at critical gene locations , it can halt the release of proteins that suppress tumors .
When this occurs , it is easier for cancer cells to form and multiply .
As a result , a person whose DNA has this abnormal gene DNA methylation may have a higher risk of developing cancer .
Furthermore , these methylation changes appear to be an early event that precedes the appearance of genetic mutations , another precursor to cancer .
To detect this DNA methylation , the Johns Hopkins team found a way to single out the troublesome DNA strands that have a methyl group attached to them .
Through a chemical process called bisulfite conversion , all segments that lack a methyl group are transformed into another nucleotide .
Then , another lab process is used to make additional copies of the remaining target DNA strands that are linked to cancer .
During this process , two molecules are attached to opposite ends of each DNA strand .
One of these molecules is a protein called biotin .
The other is a fluorescent dye .
These partner molecules are attached to help researchers detect and count the DNA strands that are associated with cancer .
To do this , these customized DNA strands are mixed with quantum dots , which are crystals of semiconductor material whose sizes are in the range of only few nanometers across .
( A nanometer is one - billionth of a meter , far too small to see with the naked eye . ) .
These dots are usually employed in electronic circuitry , but they have recently proved to be helpful in biological applications as well .
Quantum dots are useful because they possess an important property :
They easily transfer energy .
When light shines on a quantum dot , the dot quickly passes this energy along to a nearby molecule , which can use the energy to emit a fluorescent glow .
This behavior makes the cancer - related DNA strands light up and identify themselves .
In the Johns Hopkins cancer test , the quantum dots have been coated with a chemical that is attracted to biotin - one of the two molecules that were attached to the DNA strands .
As a result , up to 60 of the targeted DNA strands can stick themselves to a single quantum dot , like arms extending from an octopus .
Then , an ultraviolet light or a blue laser is aimed at the sample .
The quantum dots grab this energy and immediately transfer it to the fluorescent dyes that were attached earlier to the targeted DNA strands .
These dye molecules use the energy to light up .
These signals , also called fluorescence , can be detected by a machine called a spectrophotometer .
By analyzing these signals , the researchers can discover not only whether the sample contains the cancer - linked DNA but how much of the DNA methylation is present .
Larger amounts can be associated with a higher cancer risk .
" This kind of information could allow a patient with positive methylation to undergo more frequent cancer screening tests .
This method could replace the traditionally more invasive ways for obtaining patient samples with a simple blood test , " said Vasudev J. Bailey , a biomedical engineering doctoral student from Bangalore , India , who was one of the two lead authors on the Genome Research paper .
" It 's also important because these test results could possibly help a doctor determine whether a particular cancer treatment is working .
It could pave the way for personalized chemotherapy . "
In addition , because different types of cancer exhibit distinctive genetic markers , the researchers say the test should be able to identify which specific cancer a patient may be at risk of developing .
Markers for lung cancer , for example , are different from markers for leukemia .
###
The other lead author of the Genome Research paper was Hariharan Easwaran , a cancer biology research fellow in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine .
Along with Wang and Baylin , the other co-authors were Yi Zhang , a biomedical engineering doctoral student at Johns Hopkins ; Elizabeth Griffiths , an oncology clinical fellow in the School of Medicine ; Steven A. Belinsky , of the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque , N.M. ; James G. Herman , a professor of cancer biology in the School of Medicine ; and Hetty E. Carraway , an assistant professor of oncology in the School of Medicine .

MacGyver works hard , no doubt , and likes to enjoy the days and nights off as much as he can .
So when professional or consumer - grade cameras threaten to wash out party photos , he 's prone to using a converted cigarette pack , reversing the lining foil to channel an SLR flash into a manageable beam .

Minutes after escaping certain death in the Pacific woodlands , MacGyver finds himself completely covered in itchy , concentration - breaking mosquito and chigger bites .

Should he instead reach for the aspirin , vinegar , or toothpaste ?
All of them are slightly more non-obvious than reaching for the off - label use of Bengay for bug bites , but any of them need to be applied real quick , before Murdoc 's henchmen break through his makeshift lock jam and catch him scratching away .

6 . Dry a doused cellphone

The Phoenix Foundation 's star agent successfully disarmed the bio-agents set to be released into the city 's water supply , then escaped from a third - story window using makeshift suction cups .
His helicopter pick - up is only a phone call away .
He reaches into his pocket and — drat !
That brief dive into the reservoir killed his phone !
Or so we all thought , until MacGyver noticed the Indian buffet restaurant just down the road .
Using all his Richard - Dean - Anderson - like charm , he talks his way into the kitchen , borrows some rice and a bowl , and waits until the gadget - killing moisture has been sucked out .
Why did n't he just make the call from the restaurant phone , you ask ?
It 's a secret number !
The encryption only works on a MacGyverBerry !
If the All - Night Tiger had n't been open , Mac 's next best bet would have been to find a house with some kitty litter , or locate some rubbing alcohol , neither of which is all that difficult in the world MacGyver lives in .

5. Boost a Wi -Fi antenna with a drinking straw
There 's a hacker with a laptop who can hack the violent dictatorship 's mainframe , but he 's been locked in a secret room that MacGyver and a fairly attractive spy can't get to .
The hacker can't make a solid wireless connection for more than a few seconds .
Luckily , MacGyver has located a small bit of copper wire , a drinking straw , a single wood screw , and a Crème brûlée torch to stand in as a soldering iron .
General Tigerfang , your days are numbered .
If you find yourself stuck in a similar , perhaps less dangerous scenario without access to , say , drinking straws and copper wire , try one of our top 10 Wi-Fi boost , tweaks , and apps to give Sergei , or your spouse , the network juice they need .

4 . Start a fire without matches

Out in the countryside , MacGyver and the son of an esteemed diplomat are tired , exhausted , and hungry after dismantling a tank and escaping a military prison with corrugated cardboard , vanilla extract , and a magnet - tipped screwdriver .
They have no matches or fuel to start a fire , but they did ransack a few items from the galley kitchen on the way out .
With a 9 - volt battery or cellphone sparked against some steel wool , or a pop - top can and chocolate , they 're well on their way to getting a little flame built .

3. Smooth a scratched CD or DVD

Wherever MacGyver goes , he 's amazed by the limitations of product marketers ' minds .
When you have a product that works perfectly well at filling gaps and polishing — like toothpaste , Pledge , or Brasso — why not market them to the owners of terribly scratched CDs and DVDs ?
But whenever he needs to get the codes to halt a missle launch from a damaged disc while in the jungle , supermarket , or monkey cage , MacGyver simply grabs a banana and some glass cleaner and gets to work .
Assuming , of course , there 's a downed plane with glass cleaner in the jungle , and that they 'd happen to be cleaning the windows in the monkey cage .

2 . Bind paper without clips or staples

Not every single day at the Phoenix Foundation was spent at this or that reactor or helping unfortunate kidnapped souls .
Somebody 's got to expense report all those hardware store purchases , after all , but MacGyver occasionally ran out of staples and paper clips .
Rather than run for the supply closet , he 'd creatively fold and cut the edges , keeping up to 15 sheets of paper together with their own resistance .
As a result , Amos in accounts payable always knew when a certain secret agent was expensing his latest shipments of wood glue , pipe cleaners , orange juice , tinfoil , Mountain Dew , and paper towel tubes .

1 . Fix a dent with canned air and a hair dryer
Click to viewNow that MacGyver 's settled into married life , he 's decided to sell the Jeep Wrangler that saw him through so many trips to and from the Department of External Services and the Phoenix Foundation .
Two hours away from an interested Craigslist buyer inspection , his wife points out a dent picked up during that quick exit from a nuclear reactor .
He does n't panic or call off the showing — he grabs a can of compressed air and a hair dryer , and uses the extreme cool of the canned air and the heat from the dryer to force the dent to return to its original shape .
His wife points out that the buyer might still ask about all the duct tape hidden in various break - away pieces and hidden pockets .
MacGyver smiles , slowly retracts the hair dryer cord , and remembers the day he once powered a trolley with an electric whisk , rubber bands , and a battery pack to fool an automatic weapons system .
Now that was a challenge .

We ’re spiraling down a profound systematic crisis of a magnitude rivaling , if not exceeding , the Great Depression of 30’s .
In the last century we ’ve also seen the utter failure of the two most popular populist political ideologies – Revolutionary State Socialism and Reformist State Socialism – to achieve their goals and thus the utopianism of expecting either of them to bring us out of a capitalist crisis and into an egalitarian future becomes obvious .
We ’ve also seen ( and see currently ) how xenophobic , hateful ideologies of the likes of Fascism can feed on human desperation caused by such a crisis and rise to power with disastrous consequences for the world .
It ’s thus not difficult for an a socialist , a radical leftist or any egalitarianist in general to despair about the future as their “ representatives ” fail to act or betray them outright while the “ revolutionaries ” sit and wait for the “ coming revolution ” which they can then attempt to “ lead ” as the vanguard .
Fortunately , there is a way to avoid such a despair , to manage to keep up the hope in a world which seems to be going in the opposite direction of what you ’d like .
It ’s the way of walking your path as much as possible , of making part of the future society come true even within one ’s lifetime by living and acting as close to the ideal as structurally possible .
In short , it is the path of Direct Action .
Why is this the key to hope ?
Because through it we can both make our lives easier and know that this also undermines the Capitalist system , and thus bring a social revolution closer .
It is the good feeling of not only improving one ’s life but also that any success in such an endeavor will inspire others to do the same , while any failure can serve as a learning experience .
And this is where the hope that Anarchists will always feel , comes from .
It is the hope we get by not relying on anyone to act for us .
Unlike reformists waiting for the state to act for them , or begging the politicians to do their job for once , Anarchists take matters into their own hand and do what needs to be done .
And if or when the capitalists and / or their personal gendarme ( ie the state ) trip us , block us , jail us or kill us , it only serves to show their true nature to those not yet convinced of it .
It only serves to boost our ranks .
It is the hope we get by not being Utopian .
Because we know that every libertarian action brings the world a bit closer to anarchy whatever form that might take .
We do not then have to despair that we may never live in a “ perfect society ” , for we know that ’s impossible .
Nevertheless our actions , as long as they stay within the spirit of libertarian socialism , will always leave the world a bit better , a bit more tolerable for those who come after us to step on and push further .
It is the hope we get from knowing that our actions push the world towards the direction we wish , with a visible and practical result .
Unlike academic “ revolutionaries ” or vanguardists we build the society of the future in the decaying corpse of the old .
Co-operatives , Mutual Banks , Syndicates , Community unions , Councils and all other forms of Mutual Aid are what can turn people socialist en mass , not dry rhetoric .
Anyone who acts like this , is a friend to Anarchists , regardless of their political affiliation .
While anyone who denigrates , disrupts or attacks such initiatives is no ally , regardless of what radical name they choose for themselves .
I wrote before about “ the hope that Anarchists will always feel ” and you might wonder how true that might be .
In fact , I ’d argue that you ca n’t be an Anarchist without having any hope left , as then it ’s much easier to simply submit to the system we ’re in as something unbeatable , and embrace one of the many palliatives .
From trying to polish the rough edges ( reformism ) to simply passively joining the system and praying for deliverance by God or Glorious Leader , to outright nihilism .
But for those of us who still retain it , Anarchism is its expression and it is self - fulfilling by every libertarian act one makes .

When Apple discussed the new features of the forthcoming iPhone OS 3.0 , SVP of iPhone Software Engineering Scott Forstall said that the iPhone would be capable of streaming video and audio directly over HTTP .
Apple also advertised HTTP streaming as a feature of QuickTime X , the update of its media architecture coming in Snow Leopard .
What it failed to explain , at least publicly , is how this streaming would be accomplished .
Fortunately , Apple submitted its proposed protocol last month to the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) in the hopes that it will become a ubiquitous standard .
Apple identified what it considers a few issues with standard streaming , which generally uses the Real Time Streaming Protocol originally developed by Netscape and Real in the late '90s .
The biggest issue with RTSP is that the protocol or its necessary ports may be blocked by routers or firewall settings , preventing a device from accessing the stream .
As the standard protocol for the Web , though , HTTP is generally accessible .
Furthermore , no special server is required other than a standard HTTP server , which is more widely supported in content distribution networks , and more expertise in optimizing HTTP delivery is generally available than for RTSP .
Enter HTTP Live Streaming .
The basic mechanics involve using software on the server to break an MPEG - 2 transport stream into small chunks saved as separate files , and an extension to the .m3u playlist specification ( .m3u8 ) to tell the client where to get the files that make up the complete stream .
The media player client merely downloads and plays the small chunks in the order specified in the playlist , and in the case of a live stream , periodically refreshes the playlist to see if there have been any new chunks added to the stream .
This is in contrast to real - time streaming , as there would necessarily be a minimum latency of whatever duration the server slices the stream into ( Apple refers to 10 seconds as an example ) .
As the server encodes the video and slices it into 10 second clips , for instance , it creates or updates a playlist for the stream with the URL of the next clip .
The client begins by downloading one or more of the clips , playing them in order .
As one clip plays , the client begins downloading the next specified clip until it reaches a tag in the playlist that signals the end of the stream .
The protocol offers a way to specify alternate streams by pointing to separate playlists for each alternate stream .
These generally would be of different quality and bandwidth requirements , so the client can request an appropriate stream for whatever network conditions allow .
The client can also change to any of the alternate streams as needed , " such as when a mobile device enters or leaves a WiFi hotspot , " according to Apple .
So if your iPhone moves out of WiFi range and switches to 3G , the QuickTime player could request a lower bandwidth stream and begin downloading the alternate , smaller chunks instead .
Further , the protocol allows for the individual media clips to be encrypted so that broadcasters can limit access to paid subscribers , for instance .
In this case , key files for decoding the encrypted clips are referenced in the playlist , and the client uses the key files to decrypt each one before playing .
There is also a flag that broadcasters can set to disallow caching of individual media files as they are downloaded .
The only requirement is that the media must be formatted as an MPEG - 2 transport stream , program stream , or audio elementary stream .
Apple 's current implementation uses ( unsurprisingly ) H.264 video with AAC audio , though audio - only streams can use AAC , MP3 , or the MPEG - 2 elementary stream .
The version of QuickTime in iPhone OS 3.0 is compatible with these formats , as is the version of QuickTime that will ship with Snow Leopard .
Apple also has a beta version of a stream segmenter — currently only available to Apple Developer Connection members — to slice up a stream into individual files , create .m3u8 playlist files , and handle encryption and key generation .
Since the entire method works with standard HTTP transport and essentially any off - the - shelf software or hardware encoder can make the necessary MPEG - 2 stream , it opens up streaming to nearly anyone .
What Apple does n't say explicitly is that its protocol can negate the need for proprietary solutions such as Adobe 's Flash or Microsoft 's Silverlight to deliver remotely hosted or encrypted content .
And since neither of those are likely to appear on the iPhone anytime soon , it 's one of the few ways to stream live video reliably to Apple 's mobile platform .
Currently the standard is an Internet - Draft , and we 've yet to see any evidence that others are ready to jump on Apple 's bandwagon .
But given the issues Apple has identified with RTSP , the proprietary nature of other common solutions , and the inclusion of support for encrypted streams , it has potential to appeal to a wide swath of content providers .

I ’ve been reading a lot of Rakefiles lately , and it ’s obvious that the folks writing them think of Rake as An Engine For Encapsulating Tasks .
That ’s fine , but it ’s only part of what Rake can do .
I Do Declare
Rake is all about resolving dependencies .
It ’s about being declarative , not imperative .
Especially when dealing with files and directories , this can make a huge difference .
Here ’s an example of a imperative task :
desc
" Make sure your database. yml is in place " task :wheres_your_database_yml do unless File . exists ?
File . join ( " config " , " database.yml " ) puts " Where 's your database . yml , dude ? " if File .
exist ?
File . join ( " config " , " database.yml.example " ) puts " ( elided ) ... so I 'll make a copy of it for you . " cp File . join ( " config " , " database.yml.example " ) , File . join ( " config " , " database.yml " ) abort " ( elided ) ... rerun the last command . " else abort " ( elided ) ... There 's no config/database.yml.example ... " end end end
( This is from technicalpickles ’ dude - wheres - your - database - yml , a nice little Rails plugin for automatically installing a database .
yml file the first time a new contributor runs Rake .
I ’ve shortened a few of the messages , but that ’s it . )
This says , “ Hey , if there ’s not a config / database .yml file , create it by copying config/database.yml.example .
If THAT does n’t exist , complain . ”
Here ’s how to write this in a more declarative way :
file " config/database.yml " => " config/database.yml.example " do | t | sh " cp #{ t . prerequisites .
first } #{ t . name } " end
( This does n’t abort or talk to the user , but you get the idea . )
This says essentially the same thing .
file declarations in Rake behave just like tasks – they can have prerequisites , be dependencies , and be invoked via rake – but they only run if the target does n’t exist or the prerequisites are newer than the target .
There ’s also a shortcut for creating directories :
directory " foo " # ... is the same as : file ( " foo " ) { | t | mkdir t . name }
It ’s also possible to declare a transformation for a set of files , not just a single file .
Let ’s say that you have a directory of Markdown files , and you want to be able to transform any of ‘em into HTML .
Easy :
rule " .html " => " . markdown " do | t | sh " markdown #{ t . source } > #{ t . name } " end # in your shell $ rake foo .
html
Yay !
Again , this will only run when the dependencies are unresolved , that is , if the target is missing or the source is newer .
Picking Nits
A grab - bag of other bad usage I ’ve seen recently :
Prerequisites
task : mystuff do # ... end task : something => : mystuff
This is n’t necessary .
Unless you want to be able to use your mystuff task independently , just define something again :
task : something do # my stuff ...
end
“ Redefining ” an existing task in Rake appends the new actions ( and prerequisites ) to the original .
Do n’t add new tasks unless you actually need them .
Explicit Invocation
Sometimes it ’s necessary to run Rake tasks imperatively .
That ’s fine .
Run them with invoke , not with execute :
task : mine do # some setup stuff Rake :: Task [ " theirstuff " ]. invoke end
invoke uses the same rules as normal Rake execution :
If the task has run already , it wo n’t run again .
execute runs the task no matter what .
Make sure you know which one you want .

Hormones are an underlying cause of most cases of excess hair growth Excessive hairiness in women is not just a cosmetic problem but is likely to be a sign of an underlying medical condition , say UK doctors in a report .
Five to 15 % of women have excess hair , and a hormone disorder is the most likely cause in many cases , they said .
Women with the problem should not be afraid to seek medical advice , the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists report urged .
Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is the cause in 70 % to 80 % of cases .
Report author , Dr Rebecca Swingler , a specialist registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at St Michael 's Hospital in Bristol , said the condition , known as hirsutism , is distressing and can be particularly upsetting for young women .
Estimates of how many women are affected are likely to be underestimated because women can be reluctant to seek help , she added .
Often women have spent many years trying to cope with their hirsutism before they seek professional help
Dr Rebecca Swingler
In addition to PCOS , which is a major cause of fertility problems , rarer causes of excessive hairiness include certain tumours and thyroid dysfunction , as well as the use of certain drugs .
Mild cases can be treated cosmetically , she said , but in moderate to severe cases , hormone therapy , such as the oral contraceptive pill and other treatments are available .
Weight loss , especially in obese women , may also help reduce high levels of the male hormone testosterone which can be an underlying factor in cases of excess hair .
" Often women have spent many years trying to cope with their hirsutism before they seek professional help , " said Dr Swingler .
" Women need to look at themselves in the context of their family and ethnicity and what is ' normal ' for them .
" If they notice a change in the pattern of hair growth or they notice they having to wax more often then they should seek help , " she said .
Reluctance Professor Stephen Franks , an expert in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London , said the condition could be very embarrassing and women might be reluctant to seek medical advice .
They may also not realise hirsutism could be linked to a condition like PCOS because symptoms such as irregular periods are not present , he added .
" It 's always worth getting it investigated .
Even if it 's a benign condition . "
Professor Franks said how much hair growth was considered excessive was subjective , but that women should not be afraid to seek help .
Rachel Hawkes , chairwoman of PCOS charity Verity , said many women with excess hair growth did not actively seek treatment because they were embarrassed .
" The effect that excess hair can have on a woman 's self - esteem and how she views herself as a woman - and therefore her quality of life - can be extremely distressing .
" We recommend women with PCOS who suffer with excess hair growth seek the advice of their GP , or ask to be referred to an endocrinologist or dermatologist . "

Staying cool , or keeping warm ?
It is one of the simplest , but most enigmatic mysteries of nature : just why do flamingoes like to stand on one leg ?
The question is asked by zoo visitors and biologists alike , but while numerous theories abound , no - one has yet provided a definitive explanation .
Now after conducting an exhaustive study of captive Caribbean flamingoes , two scientists believe they finally have the answer .
Flamingoes stand on one leg to regulate their body temperature , they say .
Matthew Anderson and Sarah Williams are comparative psychologists based at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia , US who are interested in the studying the evolution of behaviour .
" Flamingoes captured my attention for a variety of reasons , " says Anderson .
" Scientifically speaking , their highly gregarious nature makes them an ideal species for investigating social influences on behaviour .
" Aesthetically speaking , they are large , beautiful , and iconic .
" Perhaps most importantly , I was very surprised to discover how little systematic , hypothesis - driven empirical research had been conducted on flamingoes . "
Lateral thinking Anderson and Williams 's research began by studying laterality in flamingoes : whether they show any preference over which side of their bodies they use for various tasks , just as a human may be right or left - handed .
They found that flamingoes prefer to rest with their heads on one side more than the other , and that which side a flamingo rests its head determines how aggressive it is toward others in the flock .
TO THE LEFT , OR RIGHT ?
Flamingoes do not prefer to rest on one leg more than the other However , most flamingoes do prefer to rest their head to the right
Those that prefer to rest their heads to the left are more likely to be involved in aggressive encounters with other birds
That lends support to the idea that being right - handed , or right - headed , in this way , helps promote social cohesion in flamingoes
That led the researchers to investigate whether flamingoes also prefer to stand on one leg more than the other , and from there , why they stand on one leg at all , empirically testing the question for the first time .
To investigate , Anderson and Williams spent several months observing the habits of captive Caribbean flamingoes ( Phoenicopterus ruber ) at Philadelphia Zoo , Pennsylvania , each of which carries a leg band that allows individuals to be identified .
At first , they examined whether standing on one leg helps reduce fatigue in the birds ' legs , or helps flamingos escape from predators more quickly , by shortening the time to take flight .
Both are commonly proposed as reasons for unipedal resting in flamingoes .
The scientists ruled out each as a benefit of standing on one leg , as their research showed it took flamingoes longer , and therefore more energy , to move forward after resting on one leg than after resting on two .
The birds also showed no preference for which leg they stood on .
Nor did standing on one leg help the birds balance when conditions were windy , another proposed idea .
Cool wading
However , the researchers did find that flamingoes prefer to stand on one leg far more often when they are standing in water than when standing on land , they report in the journal Zoo Biology .
" As water invariably draws away more body heat , this result supports the thermoregulation hypothesis , " says Anderson .
In short , the birds stand on one leg to conserve body heat .
If they put two legs in the water , rather than one , they would lose more heat than is healthy , particularly as they spend so much time wading .
" The results provide definitive evidence that thermoregulation is a principal function of unipedal resting in flamingoes , " Anderson confirms .
The birds also likely alternate which leg they stand on to avoid one leg becoming too cold .
" If they stood on one leg consistently , they would risk greater loss of body heat and potential tissue damage in the cold , " says Anderson .
The researchers also discounted some other more outlandish theories , such as one that suggests standing on one leg helps flamingoes circulate blood better by limiting the Effects of gravity on their circulatory systems .
But they do n't eliminate the idea that there may be added benefits as well as conserving body heat .
" Given the wading lifestyle of flamingoes , perhaps unipedal resting helps reduce fungal or parasite load as well , " says Anderson .
Others birds , such as herons , storks , ducks and many others also often stand on a single leg in water , perhaps for the same reasons as flamingoes .
But as flamingoes tend to spend much longer filter feeding in water than these other birds , this remains speculation , Anderson says .

Solar startup BrightSource will build a solar thermal plant in California for oil giant , Chevron .
Chevron is n't using the solar plant for electricity , it 's using it for steam generation , which will be used for getting oil out of the ground .
Reuters explains it :
The second - largest U.S. oil company said the solar thermal plant , which will collect reflected sunlight from thousands of mirrors at a 323 - foot ( 98 - meter ) tower where the water boils , will replace some steam production now powered by natural gas .
Steam is injected into wells to heat up heavier oil and thus lower its viscosity to make it easier to extract .
... Although [ Sergio Hoyos , a business developer at Chevron Technology Ventures ] said solar thermal could never replace natural gas in steam production , it is an opportunity for Chevron to save energy while championing a technology pegged by some as a winner in the long run .
It 's also an opportunity for Chevron to reduce its carbon emissions .
If the cap and trade bill is passed , Chevron might even get big carbon rebates for investing in this technology .
This being the 100th anniversary of the first American edition of “ Huckleberry Finn , ” it is the perfect time to ask an essential question :
Are you a Narrative or an Episodic personality ?
In other words , do you believe that your life tells a meaningful story ?
Or do you think that you live , like Huck Finn and every other picaresque hero , from isolated minute to isolated minute — episode to episode — and that far from adding up to a coherent tale , your life is “ a tale told by an idiot … signifying nothing ” ?
Hemingway was correct when he said that all American literature comes from Mark Twain ’s classic tale of the runaway boy and the fugitive slave .
Hemingway ’s own “ In Our Time , ” a collection of interrelated short stories that portray the episodic adventures of a young boy named Nick Adams , is a model of the genre .
Picaresque novels define our national literature : Henry Miller ’s “ Tropic of Cancer , ” William Faulkner ’s “ The Reivers , ” Saul Bellow ’s “ The Adventures of Augie March , ” Ralph Ellison ’s “ Invisible Man , ” John Barth ’s “ The Sotweed Factor , ” Jack Kerouac ’s “ On the Road , ” J.D. Salinger ’s “ Catcher in the Rye , ” Kurt Vonnegut ’s Slaughterhouse - Five ” — the list goes on and on .
Even non-fiction has been influenced by the episodic style .
The so - called “ gonzo ” journalism of a writer like Hunter Thomson , with its adventurous protagonists passing through random events , is the non-fiction equivalent of the picaresque .
But episodic fiction has been dealt a sorry hand of late .
Our most popular critically acclaimed novels are pure narratives .
Their straightforward storytelling style connects events together in one continuous thruline whose fundamental purpose is to reveal the Big Fated Meaning of life .
In the war between Narratives and Episodics , the former are winning hands - down .
A few years ago , the British philosopher Galen Strawson took up those battling world views in an essay that caused quite a stir in philosophical circles — the distinction between Narratives and Episodics is , in fact , his .
Mr. Strawson came down heavily on the side of the Episodics .
He believes the idea that “ human beings typically experience their lives as a narrative or story of some sort ” is an insult to the endless possibilities of existence .
What really gets his goat is the accompanying notion that you have to be a Narrative to be good , that “ a richly Narrative outlook on one ’s life is essential to living well , to true or full personhood . ”
In Mr. Strawson ’s eyes , the idea that one ’s life is a story is the equivalent of wearing a blindfold and living in a prison cell .
He has a strong point .
Episodics do seem to have a firmer grasp of reality ’s fluid nature .
Rather than experiencing life as a continuous thread of related experiences , Episodics consider their “ self ” to be in a state of continuous flux .
What happened to them a year ago happened to a different person than the person they are now — the past has no bearing on present experience .
( “ I actually said that ?
I could n’t have ! ” )
In this view , Episodics are sober , disenchanted beings , alive to the principle of ceaseless change that drives human existence .
Another bogus poll , NY Times / Siena
By Dr. Orly Taitz , ESQ
Just earlier today I wrote an article about St. Pete university poll in Florida , where they polled 10 % more women than men and came up with Biden lead by 3 % .
It is a well know fact that more women vote for Democrats and more men vote for Republicans , so gross over - polling of women leads to bogus lead for Biden .
Now , I reviewed some other polls and the tricks are similar .
NY Times / Siena college came up with a poll showing Biden leading in Arizona by 9 % .
I was surprised , as in reality most polls show them to be tied in Arizona and Trump won Arizona in 2016 , and the state a Republican governor and most state - wide officials are Republicans .
I decided to look closely at the makeup of the poll .
This poll has 44 % people who voted for Hillary in 2016 and only 36 % of people who voted for Trump .
Keep in mind that Arizona has more Republican voters and Trump won Arizona in 2016 .
So , by including in the sample 8 % more people who voted for Hillary than people who voted for Trump , NY Times / Siena college are grossly over - polling Democrats and producing bogus results .
It is time for AG Barr to start filing criminal charges against pollsters who engage in fraud in order to affect the presidential election and to depress Republican voters .
Siena NY
Times AZ poll has 44 % who voted for Clinton and 36 % who voted for Trump in 2016
Dr. Orly Taitz , Esq. @DrOrlyTaitzEsq
Level 1 : @realDonaldTrump more evidence of bogus polls , women are over - polled by 10 % in FL , Hillary Clinton 2016 voters are over - polled by 8 % in AZ .
Time for AG
Barr to bring criminal charges against pollsters who release bogus polls to affect the election http://orlytaitzesq.com/another-bogus-poll-ny-times-siena/

I am looking at the latest polls and see glaring problems .
Some pollsters openly overpoll Democrats , some do it through other means .
Here is one of the examples of overpolling .
Women tend to vote more for Democrats , men more for Republicans .
Here is St. Pete university poll in Florida which was published today .
This poll shows Biden leading in Florida with 3 % margin .
Respondents ’ Demographics :
However , when you look deeply into the methodology and breakdown of the voters by party , race , gender and so on , you see that they polled 1585 women and only 1277 men .
Women tend to vote more for Democrats .
When pollster includes 308 more women than men or roughly 54.5 % women and only 43.9 % men , the results will show that the Democrat , Joe Biden , is leading , which means that in proper distribution of people polled , the result would show that the Republican , Donald Trump , is leading , and by a lot .
I am urging Attorney General William Barr to file criminal charges for fraud against pollsters who release bogus polls like this in order to affect the federal election by means of fraud .
These bogus polls are used to depress the Republican vote and encourage the Democrat vote .
It is also time for the federal government to establish a proper licensing of pollsters , just as there is licensing in other professions in order to stop this flagrant fraud of voters .
See the summary of the poll below .
Summary of the demographic breakdown of the Likely voters who responded to this survey :
Political Party :
Democratic 1113 = 38.3 %
Republican 1118 = 38.5 %

Are Democrats intentionally postponing for political reasons Ruth Bader Ginsburg funeral which was supposed to take place according to the Jewish tradition within one day ?
By Dr. Orly Taitz ESQ
09.21.2020
Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke up repeatedly of her Jewish religion , of her pride to be a Jew .
It is a Jewish Biblical commandment to bury one ’s deceased immediately after passing , and it is forbidden to leave the deceased unburied overnight unless it is for his honor ( i.e. to perform a proper Tahara , obtain shrouds , arrange for a burial plot , gather family , etc. ) .
One may not put off the burial unnecessarily , for our sages state that the soul is in turmoil until the body is properly buried in the ground .
Therefore , there needs to be a great sense of urgency to complete the burial as quickly as possible .
If the passing occurred in the morning , one should try to ensure that the deceased is prepared for burial and buried before dusk of the same day .
If this is not possible , the burial should take place on the following day .
Ruth Ginsburg passed away on Friday , September 18th .
Her funeral was supposed to take place by Sunday .
https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/367836/jewish/Basic-Laws-of-a-Jewish-Funeral.htm
I am shocked and sickened that her Jewish soul will be in turmoil for a week as it appears the Democrats want to postpone the funeral for a week in order to postpone the nomination of her replacement .
It is shocking to me that the Democrats are talking about her wish for her replacement to be put on the court after the election , even though the nation needs the ninth tie - breaker vote on the court before the election , as this promises to be a contentious election similar to Bush v Gore and the ninth vote is essential to prevent a National quagmire and a constitutional crisis .
However , the Democrats are not talking about Ginsburg ’s life - long desire to live a Jewish life and follow the Jewish tradition .
Postponing her funeral for a week and leaving her Jewish soul in turmoil for a week is unforgivable .
Addition to the article .
Now the “ intellectual pillars ” of the Washington Post are calling for a large memorial for Ginsburg - political rally to be held in the Washington Cathedral .
Yet again , a complete idiocy and insensitivity .
This woman was Jewish and proud of her faith .
Washington Cathedral is a Christian cathedral .
Doing a memorial there is a slap in the face of Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Politicizing her death and turning the memorial into a campaign rally is yet another slap in her face .

Two types of bubonic plague have been found in Northern and Southern China
Ray 5:09 AM ( 15 minutes ago ) to You think we have enough to worry about and now this ……..
And there are now reports that two types of bubonic plague have been found in Northern and Southern China .
After original reports of a case in Inner Mongolia , a new case was confirmed on the evening of September 27 in Yunnan .
The local government launched a level four emergency response to prevent the spread of the plague soon after it was confirmed .
It was allegedly found after authorities conducted screenings for the disease across the whole county , after three rats were found dead in a village .

Sexual performance may be linked to marijuana smoking ( Image : Lindsey T/ theogeo )
Stoners may be trading sexual highs for the chemical kind .
Males who smoke marijuana daily are four times more likely to have trouble reaching orgasm than men who do n’t inhale , finds a new study of 8,656 Aussies .
Other smokers had the opposite problem , experiencing premature ejaculation at nearly three times the rate of non-smokers , find a team led by Marian Pitts at La Trobe University in Melbourne .
Her team analysed data collected as part of a 2005 telephone survey of 16 to 64 - year - olds .
Overall , 8.7 per cent of respondents said they had gotten high in the last year , with twice as many men ( 11.2 per cent ) admitting to marijuana use as women ( 6.1 per cent ) .
People under 36 were more likely to smoke marijuana than older participants .

Even though many male smokers experienced sexual problems , they reported more partners than non-smokers .
Marijuana users were twice as likely to have had two or more sex partners in the previous year than men who did n’t smoke pot .
Smoking in bed
Pitts ’ team found an even stronger trend for increased sexual activity among female smokers , who were also seven times more likely to have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the last year than non-smokers .
However , female smokers had no more problems in the bedroom than abstainers , Pitts ’ team found .
Her team ’s results generally back up prior studies connecting increased promiscuity and sexual problems to marijuana use .
For instance , a 2007 study led by Marie Eloi -Stiven at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York found that marijuana users were far more likely than others to take sildenafil ( Viagra ) recreationally .
This is presumably to counteract the perceived libido - sapping effects of marijuana , her team concluded .
Complicating factors
However , the new study does n’t establish a cause - effect relationship between marijuana and sexual performance , notes Sharon Johnson , an epidemiologist at the University of Missouri St. Louis , who has also found associations between drug use and sexual problems .
Many of the correlations between marijuana and sexual performance became apparent only after accounting for other factors , such as age , tobacco and alcohol use and occupation .
“ Why does it appear that the more marijuana you use the more sex difficulties you have , ” Johnson asks .
“ There is a more complicated relationship out there somewhere . ”

For many cable TV customers , their service is indistinguishable from the cable box that provides it .
Although it is possible to purchase this hardware from third parties , most service providers push their customers into renting the box from them , which ensures an additional revenue stream that easily surpasses the volume pricing they pay for it .
Not surprisingly , a number of consumers have objected to this practice , filing lawsuits against the cable companies .
But efforts to divorce the service from its receiver may have gotten a big boost last week when the state of West Virginia filed a similar suit , alleging it 's an illegal tying of services .
The suit was filed last week in the Circuit Court of Marshall County by the state attorney general .
Although it specifically targets Comcast , the details of the suit could clearly apply to just about any cable TV service provider .
Although Comcast allows the use of CableCard hardware or third - party devices for some of its packages , premium service apparently requires the rental of Comcast - provided hardware .
The AG alleges that these practices run counter to both state antitrust law and consumer protection legislation .
Although there are clearly some cases where renting cable hardware makes more sense than purchasing , the average cable box quietly goes about its business for years after the rental fees add up to more than the hardware was worth .
The practice at issue here is the requirement for the use of Comcast hardware in order to receive some of its premium services .
A spokesperson from Comcast declined to comment on this case in particular , but told Ars that her company does not view the cost of the hardware as a separate charge from the fee for the premium service .
From that perspective , there 's nothing bundled here , so there can't be any illegal tying .
More generally , the spokesperson noted that Comcast is complying with the FCC 's order and is deploying boxes that rely on the CableCard standard , and that tens of thousands of its customers are already accessing its services through TiVo boxes and other third - party hardware .
Regardless of Comcast 's policy , the history of lawsuits here suggests that the FCC 's promotion of the CableCard standard has n't left consumers satisfied with their ability to use the hardware of their choice to receive cable service ( it can be difficult even to locate third - party cable boxes , for one thing ) .
So far , however , those suits have n't done much to simplify the policies and market approaches , which can vary among service providers and geographic regions .
That 's why the entry of a governmental entity may represent a significant shift .
The West Virginia AG could establish a statewide precedent that will apply to all service providers .
At publication time , the West Virginia attorney general 's office had not responded to our request for comment .
Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support a federal health insurance plan for those who ca n’t afford or ca n’t get private insurance , but only 37 percent define “ public option ” correctly , a new national poll found .
The majority of people polled — 86 percent — say insurance should be available to everyone regardless of health history .
The poll was conducted over the Internet by Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates .
It was released in conjunction with an AARP forum at the Tattered Cover Book Store with Charlie Cook , publisher of The Cook Political Report .
Cook told a crowd Tuesday that President Barack Obama ’s biggest mistake may have been passing off health care reform to Congress , which polls show the public does n’t trust as much as the president .
“ I think the proposal is full of caricatures , ” he said .
“ It almost does n’t matter what ’s in it .
Perception in politics is important .
. . .
It ’s become so badly damaged , it ca n’t float . ”
Among the 1,000 Democrats , Republicans and independents surveyed on Aug. 12 and 13 , 79 percent say they believe a federal government health insurance option should be available for people to buy .
Yet about one - fourth of those polled believe the “ public option ” is a national health care system , similar to the one in Great Britain .
“ These two words have become radioactive , they have been swift - boated , ” said William Mann , senior vice president of Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates .
“ There is a real misunderstanding . ”
The margin of error for the Internet survey is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
“ There is so much more educating that needs to be done across the board on various health care reform options , ” said Morie Smile , interim director of Colorado ’s AARP office .
“ Nobody seems to have a firm grasp on the vocabulary .
It ’s either a sacred cow or a punching bag . ”
Other poll findings include :
• More than half of those polled want health insurance reform , but 64 percent do n’t want to pay more taxes to expand health coverage to the uninsured .
Among those with health insurance , 74 percent say they are not willing to pay higher premiums .
• Almost three - quarters of people polled believe employers who do n’t provide health insurance should be required to make a contribution to a fund to help uninsured employees purchase their own plan .
• Almost 70 percent of those polled believe in looking for savings in Medicare to pay for health care reform .
Vicki and Jerry Alpiner of Centennial , who attended the AARP forum Tuesday , said they believe everybody deserves health care .
After following the issue on television this summer , they feel people are n’t getting the whole story .
Vicki Alpiner , 69 , says she does n’t know why “ old people are so gullible . ”
Jerry , 77 , agreed .
“ Half the country thinks Grandma will be euthanized , ” he said .
“ And that ’s a sad state of affairs . ”
Overwhelmingly , those polled believed in getting more people covered and reducing costs , Mann said .
“ People do n’t want reform for reform ’s sake , ” he said .
“ If they ( Congress ) want to pass reform , they need to make clear in their community that they have two priorities and our package will address them . ”

The dreaded Conficker botnet may have been an April Fools Day bust , but months later it is still an active threat according to security researchers .
At the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas , Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer at security firm F - Secure , told attendees why Conficker represents an unprecedented threat .
Hypponen also revealed some details on the current number of active Conficker nodes and where the hotspots are .
The final analysis is that Conficker is still something that IT users and administrators need to be concerned about , while the true motives and culprits behind the botnet remain at large .
Hypponen showed the audience some data to prove his point .
As off July 24th , his data ( from the Conficker Working Group ) showed that there were over 5.5 million active unique IPs that had Conficker , with most of the infections in Brazil , China and Vietnam .
" The gang behind Conficker are no fools , " Hypponen said .
" They know their stuff , they know coding , development cycles , crypto and they are clever and they are watching us , their enemy in the security industry . "
Hypponen said that there were a number of techniques , first seen in Conficker , that make it a unique threat .
Among them is that on infection it shut down the wireshark open source packet sniffer , which is a tool that many security researcher use to monitor traffic .
As well the virus that carries Conficker had its own cryptographic signature , using the most advanced MD6 hash .
" Conficker was using MD6 , " Hypponen said .
" The first time I saw it ( MD6 ) anywhere and this was a goddamned virus . "
Tricking users
Conficker was also unique in how it spreads via USB sticks .
Hypponen detailed how Conficker 's code triggered an autorun on Windows , even when a user might have had autorun disabled for USB media .
What Conficker does is the binary code actually tricks the user by getting Windows to show the icon for , open folder  to actually run and execute the code .
Hypponen noted that particular technique debuted with Conficker .
In terms of how he knew the Conficker gang was watching the security industry 's response , Hypponen gave one solid example .
The initial Conficker virus was set to not deploy on the IP space of a number of security vendors , including F - Secure .
Additionally , the virus , once it infects users , blocks a victim 's machine for accessing security Web sites , including F- secure.com .
In response , F - secure published an FAQ telling users to go to a different Web site  fsecure.com .
Hypponen noted that worked a few days and then the new address got blocked by Conficker .
Who is behind Conficker and what do they want ?
That 's one question that Hypponen wanted to talk about but was n't permitted to do so .
" The whole point of my talk was to drill down into what we know about the Conficker gang and what we know about their motives , " Hypponen said .
" But I got called last week and was asked that because it was an ongoing investigation , that I should end my talk here .
Thank you very much , I will not be taking any questions . "
While Hypponen might not have been willing to talk about the authors of Conficker , Roel Schouwenberg , senior anti-virus researcher at security firm Kaspersky , was able to shed a little more light .
" The botnet is currently growing , but the authors do not seem to be doing much of anything with it , " Schouwenberg told InternetNews.com .
In April , Schouwenberg noted that the botnet was leased out to the Waledac spam bot and it also installed fake anti-virus software .
Beyond that , Schouwenberg said nothing much has happened .
" The Conficker botnet is autonomous , that is very strange in itself that they made Conficker replicate by itself , " Schouwenberg said .
" Now it seems like the authors have abandoned the project but because it is autonomous it can do whatever it wants and it keeps on trying to find new hosts to infect . "
The multi-vendor Conficker Working Group is currently making sure that no one can take over the botnet from a command and control point of view , according to Schouwenberg .
" The latest variant have a peer - to - peer functionality and in that way commands can be passed from one machine to the next , " Schouwenberg said .
" But for the moment nothing is happening except that the botnet continues to grow . "
Canadian Internet watchers may recall a controversy in late 2007 when Rogers began experimenting with adding its own content to webpages that its subscribers visit .
The company used the technology to alert customers about their data usage .
Google was one of the targets of the experiments and the company reacted angrily :
We are concerned about these reports .
As a general principle , we believe that maintaining the Internet as a neutral platform means that carriers should n't be able to interfere with Web content without users ' permission .
We are in the process of contacting the relevant parties to bring this to a quick resolution .
According to one of my blog readers , the Rogers content substitution approach is back .
The image below shows Rogers warning a customer about the expiry of some parental controls .
The warning is included in a Flickr page .
This approach again raises concerns about Rogers interfering with the delivery of content without permission of the end user .
When combined with its ongoing policy of redirecting web pages that do not resolve to a company - sponsored paid search page , Rogers own content seems to show up unasked on a regular basis .

Under the central part of the San Andreas fault , the deep seismic whisperings known as tremors have increased after two recent large earthquakes , and a surge in tremors appears to have foreshadowed one of them , according to a study to be published today in the journal Science .
“ It reaffirms the need to be ready , ” said Robert Nadeau , a research seismologist at UC Berkeley who led the study .
“ The San Andreas fault is changing down deep and it ’s changing down deep in places where large earthquakes have happened in the past . ”
Among the findings was an unusually strong tremor episode three weeks before the magnitude - 6.0 Parkfield earthquake in 2004 .
If these types of signals are found before other large earthquakes , they could provide a kind of early warning , said Greg Beroza , a seismologist at Stanford University who was not involved in the study .
“ There have been plenty of tremor episodes that have not triggered earthquakes in other places , ” he said .
“ This one might make the strongest case . ”

Predicting large quakes with precision is the elusive Holy Grail of seismology .
Scientists have only been able to calculate probabilities for quakes in certain areas by analyzing a timeline of ruptures and calculating the amount of stress building on a fault .
The latest study may potentially inch us closer to having an actual predictor , scientists said .
Earthquakes typically generate clear seismic waves with sharp onsets , tailing off after a minute or two , seismologists said .
Tremors vibrate quietly and can continue for days .
Tremors also tend to happen in a deeper , softer part of the Earth ’s crust , rather than in the upper part typically thought to generate earthquakes .
Seismologists used to ignore tremors because they looked like noise in the data caused by wind or cars .
Until recently , scientists also had difficulty storing the enormous amounts of data required to detect tremors .
Advertisement
About 10 years ago , Japanese seismologists discovered deep tremors when they took a closer look at the background noise .
Since then , scientists have detected tremors in the Pacific Northwest and below the San Andreas .
Nadeau ’s study focused on the San Andreas fault in the Parkfield region , about 170 miles northwest of Los Angeles .
Nadeau and graduate student Aurelie Guilhem combed through seismometer data from July 2001 to February 2009 .
That period included two strong earthquakes : the magnitude - 6.5 San Simeon earthquake of 2003 and the Parkfield temblor the following year .
Even though the San Simeon quake originated on a fault about 40 miles away from the San Andreas fault in Parkfield , the quake appeared to set off stress changes under the San Andreas , Nadeau said .
Advertisement
The tremor activity in the Parkfield area 45 days after the San Simeon quake more than doubled compared with the 45 days before the quake .
About eight months later , there was a five - day spike of tremors about 10 times more active than the average before the San Simeon quake , Nadeau found .
The tremors quieted , but the Parkfield earthquake hit about three weeks later on the San Andreas .
This surge can be considered a “ foretremor ” of the Parkfield quake because the events were close together , Nadeau said .
But , he added , “ we do n’t have enough resolution to say there ’s a mechanical connection between the two . ”
The Parkfield quake appeared to stimulate the tremors again , raising the activity level to about six times the level before the San Simeon quake .
Since then , tremor activity has remained high , varying from 1.5 to two times the level before the San Simeon quake .
Advertisement
Scientists still do not understand the exact relationship between tremors and quakes , Nadeau said .
But more tremors probably means more stress on the fault , he said , and that suggests “ an increased probability of an earthquake coming sooner rather than later . ”
Southern California has a huge stake in watching this part of the San Andreas fault , said Susan Hough , a seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena who was not involved in Nadeau ’s study .
While the 2004 Parkfield earthquake ruptured northward away from Los Angeles , the massive Fort Tejon earthquake in 1857 , estimated to have a magnitude of 7.9 , appeared to start just south of Parkfield and roar down to the Cajon Pass , Hough said .
That quake sent long , rolling ground motions into the San Fernando Valley and collapsed a number of houses , she said .
It was preceded by two moderate quakes in the Parkfield area .
Advertisement
“ We do n’t know for sure , but there ’s pretty good evidence that the last Big One started up there , ” Hough said .
“ So it ’s always been in the back of people ’s minds that maybe a moderate quake at Parkfield could be the foreshock to the next Big One . ”

* Failure would be biggest bank failure this year
* Deal approved by FDIC on Thursday , report says ( Adds background )
BANGALORE , Aug 14 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Southeast regional bank BB&T Corp BBT.N will buy deposits and branches of Colonial BancGroup Inc CNB .
N following a move by regulators to take the struggling lender into receivership , media reports said , citing people familiar with the matter .
The deal was approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) on Thursday night and is expected to be announced later on Friday , Dow Jones news agency reported .
BB&T shares soared as much as 10 percent on the New York Stock Exchange , while trading in Colonial shares was halted .
“ BBT is trading up on the news as they would likely be able to assume the deposits at an attractive price , ” analyst Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients .
“ Given Colonial ’s risky loan portfolio , we would expect significant FDIC loss - sharing to be involved . ”
Colonial officials did not respond to repeated calls seeking confirmation .
The FDIC said it does not comment on open and operating institutions .
A BB&T spokesman declined to comment .
Colonial , based in Montgomery , Alabama , operates 355 branches in Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Nevada and Texas and has more than $ 25 billion in assets .
Its failure would be the largest bank failure since Wachovia 's near collapse last September .
Last year Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N won an FDIC - brokered deal to buy Wachovia after a brief but acrimonious battle with rival bidder Citigroup Inc C.N , which initially had agreed to buy Wachovia 's banking assets with government assistance .
Colonial was organized as a bank - holding company in 1981 with $ 166 million in assets .
It website says it provides “ the strength and stability of a Top 30 commercial bank . ”
BB&T ended June with $ 152.4 billion of assets .
It operates 1,505 branches in 11 states and Washington , D.C .
In June , BB&T repaid the U.S. government the $ 3.1 billion it received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program after regulators determined the bank was well capitalized .
“ We would view the transaction as a big positive for BBT , ” Miller said .
“ It would be very accretive to net interest margin . ”
Earlier this week , the Alabama State Banking Department had said it might appoint the FDIC as receiver or conservator for its banking unit after Aug. 12 .
On Wednesday , however , Alabama banking regulators canceled a scheduled meeting with Colonial to discuss the bank ’s fate , without giving a reason .
[ ID :nN8C121593 ]
Colonial has been battered by the credit crisis and faces a U.S. Justice Department criminal probe into alleged accounting irregularities at its mortgage lending unit .
NO IMMEDIATE PANIC
At one of Colonial Bank ’s main branches in downtown Montgomery , Alabama , business appeared to continue as normal but there was no immediate sign of panic from customers .
“ As long as it does n’t mess with my money , I ’m fine , ” said Dawn Williams , a 24 - year - old mother of two .
But another customer told Reuters she was worried and wanted to withdraw her money .
“ I am freaking out .
It does n’t makes sense to play with people ’s money .
They work hard for it , ” said retired nurse Deborah Burney , 53 , who has an account with husband at the branch .
“ I had asked my husband to take the money out of this bank when I heard something on the TV the other night , ” she said .
“ I have been married 35 years , and that hardhead can take the money out or say goodbye . ”
In July , Colonial posted a $ 606 million second - quarter loss , its fifth loss in a row , as higher charge - offs and rising foreclosures in the bank ’s Florida construction - loan portfolio continue to strain its balance sheet .
BB&T shares were 7 percent higher at $ 27.58 by midafternoon after trading as high as $ 28.41 , while Colonial shares remained halted .

Our second favorite Star Wars bounty hunter , Greedo , gets shortchanged by that retcon that he shot first , because we know Greedo would never have missed .
So what would have happened if Greedo had shot ( and killed ! )
Han Solo ?

Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles / Thor writer Ashley Edward Miller was tweeting about showing his newborn son " both Star Wars movies , " and teaching his son — just a few days old — the importance of knowing that Han shot first .
This started us thinking , once again :
What would have happened if Greedo had shot first instead ?
With all the thousands of comics and books and cartoons related to Star Wars lately , there really should be a miniseries set in the alternate universe where Greedo shot first .
And killed Han Solo , before Han could ever embark on his awesomely redemptive journey with Luke and Obi-Wan , leading to him becoming a General in the final battle against the Empire .

So what would have happened if Greedo had shot Han ?
Shot him DEAD ?
This is the sort of question to which we give far too much consideration , until we realize we have failed to leave the house for three days straight .
Clearly this is an alternate universe story that must be told .
So everyone who has seen Star Wars : the colon - less movie will know that Greedo makes a profound impression in his few moments on screen .
His latex face is more expressive than all the other masked aliens in the Cantina , and he radiates a peevish self - respect .
Our favorite Rodian is a master thug and the son of the legendary hustler Greedo the Elder , who kicked Anakin 's ass in a Phantom Menace deleted scene :
Okay , so Anakin is on top for a while there , but watch the clip again — Greedo flips him over and is just about to bring the rain of pain , when Qui-Gonn Jinn shows up and breaks it up .
Anakin was three seconds away from being unable to eat anything but blue Bantha milk , through a straw .

Anyway , we 're confident that if Greedo shot first , he would have been the only one to get off a shot .
We 've always had a soft spot for Greedo , ever since he had the kick - ass action figure .
So what happens if Greedo kills Han ?

At this point , Han has already made his deal to give Luke , Obi-Wan and those pesky droids passage to Alderaan on the Millennium Falcon , and Chewbacca has gone off to prep the ship .
So there 's Greedo , standing over Han 's messy corpse , and he needs to take Han 's head back to Jabba to collect his bounty .
That means going to the spaceport , where Chewbacca 's tending the Falcon , and Wookiees do n't take kindly to seeing their friends ' heads dangling from a bounty hunter 's scaly hand .
So Greedo has to get rid of the Wookiee somehow — he 's never heard of the " Let the Wookiee win " principle .
Luckily , if you go by the remastered edition of the original Star Wars , Greedo knows Boba Fett is hanging around the spaceport , along with Jabba .
So all Greedo has to do is maneuver the Wookiee and the Mandalorian into each other 's crossfire , and the problem takes care of itself .
Good thing he's got the severed head of Han Solo .
Turns out Cameron Diaz is n't the only one who can make a crowded room stop with a mere toss of the head — only it 's Han Solo 's head that Greedo tosses , to Chewy , who catches it with an anguished growl .
Chewy pulls his bowcaster , but he 's still holding the head of his beloved captain in one paw , making his reaction time considerably slower .
Chewy does get off one shot , but Greedo ducks behind Boba Fett , who catches it square in his unprotected neck area .
Greedo shoots Chewbacca before he can get off a second shot , and it 's all over .
Advertisement
All in all , it 's been a good day for Greedo so far .
He 's got the reward money for killing Solo , he 's got the money Obi-Wan paid for passage to Alderaan , and I 'm guessing Jabba lets Greedo keep the Millennium Falcon .
There 's just the matter of what to do about those annoying passengers .
Advertisement
Obi-Wan and Luke show up , droids in tow , for their passage to Alderaan .
Greedo informs them the ship 's had a change of captain , and he 'll be taking them to Alderaan instead .
Once they 're aboard and on their way , Greedo seriously considers keeping his end of the deal — after all , an additional 15,000 once they get to Alderaan seems pretty sweet .
But the longer he spends on board with the perky kid and the skeevy old guy and their holo - chess , and their weird , unsavory blindfold games , the less he likes it .
And then he figures out that these guys do n't really have any money :
They 're bringing something to Alderaan , which they 'll get paid for .
The droids , maybe ?
If there 's one thing Greedo believes in , it 's cutting out the middlemen .
Luckily , the Millennium Falcon has a button to depressurize the rear passenger areas , while keeping air on the flight deck .
( Although Greedo keeps a helmet on , just in case . )
One press of a button later , and the young hero and his mentor are floating in space , turning a nasty shade of cyan .
The droids are fine , they can hang on when the air all gets sucked out , and they do n't need to breathe anyway .
Sure , the droids are n't happy , but what are they going to do ?
Advertisement
With the humans out of the way , the Rodian rogue has time to tinker with those droids and find out what 's so valuable about them .
The gold humanoid one , he quickly realizes is worthless , so he disassembles him and uses bits of him as bling on his favorite vest .
But the dome - shaped one ?
A different story .
Soon , Greedo's watching the " Help me , Obi-Wan Kenobi " video , and thinking maybe Greedo is her only hope .
At least , for 15,000 , he can be anybody 's only hope .
Advertisement
But of course , Greedo does n't quite make it to Alderaan .
The planet gets wiped out before he reaches it , and soon he 's being yanked by something that 's not a moon , it 's ... something different .
The Falcon goes flying into the Death Star , and Greedo sees all his dreams of insane profit in danger of being incinerated just like Alderaan .
Time to lose the C - 3PO bling , and go ninja on these Imperials .
Greedo slips out of the Falcon and starts exploring the massive Death Star , his head buzzing with how much that tractor beam would be worth if he could disassemble it .
Not to mention the reactor .
And then Greedo finds the lady in white , from the robot 's holo - recording .
He got her message !
And he 's here to rescue her , he tells her in Huttese .
The other guy could n't make it , sorry .
She 's both lippy and suspicious .
So when she and Greedo get trapped in a trash compactor , he slithers out , nimble as a gecko , and leaves her there to get squashed like a ripe muja fruit .
No real loss , since he 's still got the R2 unit with all the secrets on it .

But then ...
Greedo runs face to face with Darth Vader , the Dark Lord Of The Sith .
The hulking , asthmatic figure that nobody ever talks back to and lives .
Greedo freezes , in total panic , ninja mode failing him completely .
And then Darth Vader looks at Greedo and howls , " Noooooo ! "
For a moment , Vader is once again the young Anakin , the little boy whom Greedo ( the elder ) tormented and punished .
Vader is face to face with the one man ( other than Watto ) who haunts his childhood dreams , the person whose mistreatment helped start him on the path to the Dark Side .
Unable to tell the difference between Greedo the Elder and Greedo the Younger , Vader forgets all his Jedi training , all his Sith lore , and for a moment he 's just a scared little boy once again .
" I did n't cheat in that pod race ! "
Vader howls .
Advertisement
Greedo does n't know what 's going on here , but he knows he only has one chance .
And if there 's one thing Greedo 's good at , it 's taking chances .
He jumps the Dark Lord , aiming to put a blaster bolt in his breathing apparatus before Vader can crush his throat or use Force Lightning on him .
And in Anakin 's twisted mind , for just a second , they 're two little kids scrapping in the dirt .
Then Vader gets a grip on himself and pulls his light saber , just as Greedo lands on his stomach .
The light saber goes just slightly wrong , slicing off Vader 's own arm and plunging into his chest .
Greedo jumps off the Sith Lord and lands on his feet like a cat , barely believing that he 's standing over the dead body of the most feared man in the galaxy .
There has to be some way Greedo can make a profit off this .
Advertisement
Stripping the armor off Darth Vader 's dismembered corpse is a messy , painstaking job , and the armor 's big enough to fit three Greedos inside .
But he knows a guy in Cloud City who would pay a small fortune for the Sith Lord 's real armor , just to have propped up in his vestibule ... maybe with a drinks tray .
There 's no way to carry the armor , so Greedo has to figure out how to wear it .
He stuffs the light saber ( carefully deactivated ) and some junk into the boots , so he can stand up in it .
Greedo can just about walk around in Vader 's suit , but he constantly looks like he needs to pee really bad , and the arms just sort of flop around like Vader 's having an embolism .
And forget talking , not that anyone would understand why Vader 's suddenly speaking Huttese anyway .
Advertisement
Good thing the Stormtroopers are n't paid to ask questions .
They ask if Lord Vader needs an escort , and Greedo tries to shake the big black helmet — no , no escort required ! — but he makes Vader nod instead , by mistake .
Soon , the shambling Dark Lord has a dozen Troopers following him around , and Greedo really does feel like pissing himself .
That light saber in the right boot keeps digging into Greedo 's foot , and Greedo 's paranoid that it 'll switch on by accident .
Still , you do n't get to be one of Jabba 's hand - picked ( flipper - picked ? ) bounty hunters by lacking brio .
So Greedo marches all of his entourage to the home of the tractor beam , and leads them to that bridge thingy that leads to the control panel .
With a series of spasmodic twitches to that herculean black torso , black - gloved arms flopping around , Greedo conveys that he wants them to extend the bridge to the tractor beam .
Then it 's just a matter of stumbling across the bridge without falling into the bottomless pit .
None of the stormtroopers notices when a tiny green hand snakes out of Vader 's armor to fiddle with the tractor beam controls — stormtroopers are n't paid to notice stuff — and anyway , Greedo wraps his big black cloak around himself as best he can .
Advertisement
Greedo almost gets away with it , too — except the Emperor has felt a disturbance in the Dark Side .
His counterpart , the only other Sith lord and the most promising apprentice of them all , has died .
Darth Sidious knows this as well as he knows that Force Lighting stings .
Greedo does n't even get back to the Millennium Falcon before the Emperor appears , surrounded by his red-helmeted Royal Guard .
" That 's not Vader ! " the Emperor cries .
" Stop him ! "
Advertisement
Greedo stops dead still , arms flopping .
What to do ?
What to do ?
Greedo tries to raise his hands , but he can't .
The Royal Guard surrounds him , and they grab his arms to lead him away .
And the arms come off .
So does the helmet .
The Emperor is standing , aghast , staring at the headless , armless shell of Darth Vader .
Was this merely Vader 's armor come to life ?
A ghost animating the Sith lord 's armor ?
One of those Death Trooper thingies ?
For the first time in many years , the Emperor does not know what to think .
Advertisement
So he 's even more surprised when a green head pops out of Vader 's neck , and a green arm flies out of the shoulder socket , blaster clutched in a green fist .
Greedo spies the Emperor and does what Greedo does best .
Greedo shoots first .
We 'll spare you the details of Greedo 's coronation as Emperor — it goes on for weeks , and the Cantina Band gets flown in , and there are whole planets flooded with namana liquor for Greedo to drink from .
He actually quite likes the big robe thing , and having the red helmet guys following him around is actually quite cool .
The most important thing is , the galaxy enters into decades of peace and prosperity .
Greedo turns out to be surprisingly good at keeping the hyperspace lanes open , and letting people go about their business .
All hail Emperor Greedo !
The setting is Camp Firewood , the year 1981 .
It 's the last day before everyone goes back to the real world , but there 's still a summer 's worth of unfinished business to resolve .
At the center of the action is camp director Beth , who struggles to keep order while she falls in love with the local astrophysics professor .
He is busy trying to save the camp from a deadly piece of NASA 's Skylab which is hurtling toward earth .
All that , plus : a dangerous waterfall rescue , love triangles , misfits , cool kids , and talking vegetable cans .
The questions will all be resolved , of course , at the big talent show at the end of the day .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
An Australian senator whose crying toddler was ejected from parliament during a political vote has prompted a review of chamber rules and sparked a heated debate over child - friendly work practices .
Australian Greens Senator Sarah Hanson - Young said she was “ humiliated ” when Senate President John Hogg ordered her teary 2 - year - old daughter removed from the parliamentary chamber before a vote , in accordance with parliamentary rules .
“ It shows that parliament is still based on a very male model and I just think it ’s absolutely ridiculous , ” said Women ’s Electoral Lobby Chairwoman Eva Cox .
Hogg said he was responsible for “ proper conduct ” in the upper house , but supported a review of rules which bar children and other outsiders from the Senate during votes .
The Senate leader of the conservative Nationals party Barnaby Joyce said Hanson - Young had staged a stunt and could have avoided being caught out during a locked - door vote , with bells alerting all lawmakers beforehand .
“ Within that Senate are votes for things that might send people to war , that might get people killed .
This requires certain sacrifices , ” Joyce said .
“ The child is a prop and the Senate has become a stage . ”
Greens Leader Bob Brown said he would push for the Senate ’s procedures to be changed to give parents more flexibility .
Hanson - Young said the four minutes apart from her daughter Kora , who was placed in the care of a staffer , were “ longest few minutes I ’ve ever had . ”
She won backing from a lawmaker in Victoria state who was ejected from parliament several years ago for breastfeeding a child in parliamentary chamber .
“ I think it ’s just ludicrous .
She was required in her capacity in her job as a senator to vote , therefore she was being denied that opportunity based on the fact she had some responsibilities as a parent , ” Kirstie Marshall said .
But a television poll of public opinion found most people had little sympathy , with 88 percent of respondents backing Hogg ’s exclusion order .

Where Is the Web Revolution Taking Us ?
published : 2009.08.24
Today I read an article on happyworm.com titled " HTML 5 - The Revolution will not be Televised . "
It reminded me of some of the concerns I 've been having lately with developments in the web industry .
They are concerns I spoke about briefly at the end of my presentation on Web Human Interface Guidelines at MinneWebCon 2009 , and now feels like a pretty good time to dust the subject off and say some more about it .
Specifically , I did not share the happyworm article 's optimism about these points :
" It seems that it 's not so much about the corporations anymore , more about the community . " " ... a seismic shift in power towards the community and away from the browser vendors , the consequences of which cannot be underestimated . "
First , let me start by saying I 'm assuming by " community " the author meant web developers .
It is important to note that Apple , and even more so Google , were heavily involved in the HTML5 spec and thus , if only by association , the demise of XHTML2 .
I ask if maybe the power has moved away from browser vendors towards content - provider corporations , and not towards the community ?
( It is worth noting that this is a very common trend now in America for decades . )
The W3C ceding some control strikes me as perhaps further evidence that the community may actually be losing ground .
Google entering the browser vendor market only serves to muddy the waters .
Some fraction of the web developer community was very excited by Google pushing HTML5 .
Some fraction was very disappointed .
Can the community have the power if the community is divided ?
Maybe Google and Apple are listening only while it is convenient for them and their bottom line .
Maybe the HTML5 supporters think they have power because Google 's use of power just happens to line up with some of the web development community for the time being .
Personally , I 'm very much a supporter of community - based web standards .
I 'm glad for now that we have Google and Apple blazing ahead with roughly standards - based HTML5 , CSS3 , and JavaScript .
I certainly do n't think we should give Microsoft the keys to the car .
They 've already shown us where they would drive it , if not deliberately then by incompetence or lack of vision .
And I think we also must give credit to Opera and Mozilla .
They seem to embrace community driven development .
I think they 've got our backs .
I do think we probably have little to fear on the CSS and HTML fronts .
I think the illusion of community derived standards will continue , with the corporations that actually make the decisions acting mostly benevolently .
Occasionally they may err on the side of progress over standardization , but the benefits of that will probably outweigh the problems .
I am much more concerned about JavaScript ( JS ) , especially with how Google is positioning itself .
We ( web developers ) enjoy fairly standardized JavaScript language for the moment , with a lush pasture of JS libraries , user interface ( UI ) toolkits , etc to choose from .
Google has entered the browser market and is fully intending to create a browser - based operating system .
I 'm not so sure we can trust Google to act in the web development community 's interests over its own corporate money - making interests in regards to web applications , specifically client - side JavaScript applications and web applications UI .
I think there is a real possibility that Google may create a proprietary JavaScript web applications platform and lure many developers in via a " web standards " carrot , custom ( read : proprietary ) application toolkits with pre-built functionality , a captive audience , and a clear path to individual app monetization .
I think this could create some real fractures in the JavaScript language and potentially even web development as we know it .
I will give a simpler example for my concerns for the future of community driven decisions in the realm of JavaScript and Web Applications UI .
There has been some talk of incorporating jQuery as part of HTML5 / JavaScript .
If you are a Dojo , YUI , or Mootools fan , how would you feel about jQuery being selected as an early winner ?
What are the chances people will want to use some other JS framework , or Web App UI widgets built for some other JS framework , when jQuery would perform dramatically better because it is actually built into the browser ?
It is far from certain , but we may soon find ourselves with far fewer choices as web developers than we have now .
Or , maybe Google will " do no evil " and blow all of our minds with great stuff while having a ear in the web development community .
I , for one , am watching carefully .
Controversial Strikeforce welterweight Nick Diaz watched his August 15 title fight against Jay Hieron go up in smoke after missing his scheduled pre-fight drug test on August 7 and again today ( August 10 ) .
The California State Athletic Commission ( CSAC ) made arrangements with Strikeforce to reschedule Diaz for today after last Friday 's no -show ; however , Diaz failed to arrive at the testing facility .
He had until 3 p.m. PT to appear .
The CSAC was unable to accept a sample any later than this afternoon if it was to be processed and reported in time for Saturday 's " Carano vs. Cyborg " event .
Therefore , Diaz has been removed from his scheduled bout against Hieron and former Ultimate Fighter ( TUF ) 7 contestant Jesse Taylor will step up to replace him .
From Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker :
Caesar Gracie told me Diaz [ missed his Aug. 7 drug test because ] he was in the mountains training .
He 's supposed to be on his way ( right now ) to Los Angeles to take his drug test with the California State Athletic Commission .
He has until 3 pm to get it done .
We 're hoping he makes the right decision .
[ If he does ] we should have the results by Thursday .
We have a contingency plan in place if necessary .
Regardless , Jay Hieron will be fighting on August 15 .
Apparently that contingency plan was " JT Money . "
Despite testing negative earlier this year after whooping Frank Shamrock on April 11 , Diaz does not exactly have a squeaky - clean history .
Diaz tested positive for marijuana after his surprising and sensational win over PRIDE FC 160 - pound champion Takanori Gomi at Pride 33 back on Feb. 24 , 2007 .
That win was quickly overturned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission ( NSAC ) and Diaz was suspended for six months .
Because of that suspension , Diaz was unable to secure a corner ’s license for his brother Nate ’s fight against Manny Gamburyan at The Ultimate Fighter Finale 5 .
Prior to the Shamrock fight , Diaz told the LA Times he was able to beat drug tests with the help of herbal cleansers and 10 gallons of water per day and that marijuana keeps him " consistent . "
If Diaz arrives today and passes his drug test ( results will be available Thursday ) , then Friday 's no -show can be chalked up to a matter of poor scheduling .
However , if Diaz fails to show or the result is positive , he 'll likely have an uphill battle to get back into the hunt for a title shot in Strikeforce ... or perhaps anywhere else .

Bruno arrived in Leicester Square wearing his own take on the Queen 's guardsman uniform
Sacha Baron
Cohen 's latest alter ego , Austrian fashionista Bruno , arrived for the premiere of his film to a trumpet fanfare of disco classic I Will Survive .
Dressed in a bearskin and his own take on the Queen 's guardsman 's uniform - including a sleeveless jacket and frighteningly tight hot pants - he told the crowd : " This is the most important movie starring a gay Austrian since Terminator 2 . "
Inside the cinema , he greeted the audience and said he hoped the film would undo " all the negative stereotyping of the gay community done by Milk " - referring to Sean Penn 's Oscar - winning turn as gay rights activist Harvey Milk earlier this year .
His controversy - baiting comments set the tone for the film , which is clearly intended to shock and amuse in equal measure .
Like Cohen 's previous hit , Borat , the film shows Bruno interacting with " real " people , unaware they are the stars of the show - a feat which must be difficult considering how well - known the comedian is now .
In pictures : Bruno premiere Bruno finds himself shunned in Austria when , reporting from a fashion show , the character 's Velcro suit becomes stuck to a rail of clothes and he falls on to the stage wrapped in a curtain .
So in a bid to turn himself around , he goes to Los Angeles to try to become the " the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler " .
And that is it , as far as plot is concerned .
The rest of the film goes from one stunt to the next , following all of Bruno 's failed attempts at trying to get famous .
Among other things , we see him try his hand at acting ; adopting an African baby ; becoming a chat show host ( complete with unsuspecting celebrities ) ; trying to get kidnapped by terrorists ; becoming heterosexual and going to a swingers party .
There are some very funny moments , including a brilliant scene where , while trying to bring about peace in the Middle East , two rival camps have to explain to Bruno that Hamas and hummus are not the same thing - but both agree at the same time that hummus is a good thing .
Elsewhere , the reaction of a test - screen audience to the pilot of his US TV show will have you watching through your fingers if you feel uncomfortable about full - frontal male nudity - or conversations about bleaching your intimate areas .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Throughout , Cohen is almost heroically reckless with regard to his own personal safety .
In one scene , he is chased down the street by a crowd of people in the Middle East after dressing like a Hassidic Jew in hot pants .
And , at an anti-gay cage fight in Arkansas , he ends up in an all - male love scene performed to an increasingly angry mob who end up throwing metal chairs at him .
The comedian has obviously come away unscathed from all of these incidents , although producer Dan Mazer says Cohen was arrested in three continents while making the film and saw " some things no heterosexual male should ever have to see " .
Bruno pushes the boundaries further than Borat ever did .
Sometimes you question whether he has finally crossed the line into offensive bad taste - and , latterly , whether you were right to laugh at it - but the audience all seemed to guffaw and groan in the right places .
They even gasped in horror when they were supposed to .
It 's not going to be everyone 's cup of tea and if you are easily shocked this certainly wo n't be for you , but some will find it outrageously hilarious .
Bruno is released in UK cinemas on 10 July

Yes , conservative Senator Johnny Isakson ( R - GA ) called Palin , " Nuts " .
I have no idea .
I understand -- and you have to check this out -- I just had a phone call where someone said Sarah Palin 's web site had talked about the House bill having death panels on it where people would be euthanized .
How someone could take an end of life directive or a living will as that is nuts .
You 're putting the authority in the individual rather than the government .
I do n't know how that got so mixed up .
Isakson fully CLARIFIES that the end of life directive is about aSomething both of my parents have , decisions they made for end of life .
Many Americans have these wills and the Republican Party and all these insurance operatives have distorted and hi-jacked this phrasing for " killing seniors " .
Democrats , get the message out and CLEAN THIS MISINFORMATION , UP .

Twitter employees can be a target , said Biz Stone
The microblogging service Twitter is taking legal advice after hundreds of documents were hacked into and published by a number of blogs .
TechCrunch has made public some of the 310 bits of material it was sent .
It posted information about Twitter 's financial projections and products .
" We are in touch with our legal counsel about what this theft means for Twitter , the hacker and anyone who accepts ... or publishes these stolen documents , " said Twitter 's Biz Stone .
In a blog posting he wrote that " About a month ago , an administrative employee here at Twitter was targeted and her personal email account was hacked .
" From the personal account , we believe the hacker was able to gain information which allowed access to this employee 's Google Apps account which contained Docs , Calendars and other Google Apps Twitter relies on for sharing notes , spreadsheets , ideas , financial details and more within the company . "
Mr Stone , Twitter 's co-founder , went on to stress that " the attack had nothing to do with any vulnerability in Google Apps " .
Beyond the issue of journalistic ethics , the whole incident also raises interesting questions about the security of cloud computing
Rory Cellan- Jones
Read Rory 's blog in full
He said this was more to do with " Twitter being in enough of a spotlight that folks who work here can be a target " .
In his blog post , Mr Stone underlined the need for increased online security within the company and for staff to ensure their passwords are robust .
It is believed a French hacker who goes by the moniker " Hacker Croll " illegally accessed the files online by guessing staff members ' passwords .
" News value " A number of technology blogs were offered the documents for publication in what is now being dubbed " Twittergate " in some online forums .
TechCrunch , one of the most respected blogs in Silicon Valley , has set off a firestorm of criticism and debate over its decision to post some of the material .
Sensitive documents were hacked
It started things off with what it called a " softball " and published details about a reality TV show involving Twitter .
Details of such a programme were made public in May .
That was followed by documents relating to an internal Twitter financial forecast that the company said is no longer accurate .
" There is clearly an ethical line here that we do n't want to cross , and the vast majority of these documents are n't going to be published , at least by us .
" But a few of the documents have so much news value that we think it 's appropriate to publish them , " wrote TechCrunch Editor and founder Michael Arrington Mr Arrington noted the site received a deluge of comments on the issue and said " many users say this is " stolen " information and therefore should n't be published .
We disagree .
" We publish confidential information almost every day on TechCrunch .
This is stuff that is also " stolen , " usually leaked by an employee or someone else close to the company . "
The TechCrunch founder cited examples of stories it has covered in the past that involved information it had acquired and also those covered by newspapers like the Wall Street Journal that had done a similar thing .
Mr Arrington said that he has also consulted lawyers about the laws that cover trade secrets and the receipt of stolen goods .
" Embarrassing "
Many in the technology industry said this latest episode points to the potent reminder of how much information is stored in the cloud and the vulnerability or otherwise of that data .
The hacker has claimed to have wanted to teach people to be more careful and in a message to the French blog Korben , wrote that his attack could make internet users " conscious that no one is protected on the net . "
Twitter needs to force users to wise up , said one analyst " The security breach exploited " an easy - to - guess password and recovery question , which is one of the simplest ways to make a username and password combination really insecure , " said Phil Wainewright of ZDNet.com " Unfortunately , users wo n't wise up until the cloud providers force them to . "
In a study last year the security firm Sophos found that 40 % of internet users use the same password for every website they access .
The affair has put Google on the defensive because the information was stored in Google Apps , an online package of productivity software that includes email , spreadsheets and calendars .
The company issued a blog post .
While it highlighted the need for strong security , it said it could not discuss individual uses or customers .
Twitter 's Mr Stone tried to play down the importance of the information being touted around the web .
" Obviously , these docs are not polished or ready for prime time and they 're certainly not revealing some big , secret plan for taking over the world .
" This is " akin to having your underwear drawer rifled : Embarrassing , but no one 's really going to be surprised about what 's in there . "
That is an apt apology , " Mr Stone said .
At the social media blog Mashable , Adam Ostrow agreed .
" It 's another embarrassing moment in Twitter 's torrid growth , but nothing that 's likely to bring the house down . "

So last night I arrive home from seeing a zombie movie and I am all by myself , except for the fish , which is usually the way I like it .
I grabbed a beer from the fridge and I wanted to sing some songs or make interesting conversations with shadows but then I remember the fish .
I am a fish person now , a man of great responsibility .
" C'mon Arnold , we 're going out ! "
By this point I have renamed the fish Arnold .
So it 's just the two of us on the front porch and already past midnight .
I 'm smoking and telling the fish about the wonders of beer .
" You see Dwight ( I had renamed the fish Dwight ) ; you drink this , and all of a sudden all your problems melt away like a hound in a kennel fire .
Wait , that 's not a good example , but just take my word for it Enson . "
( I had renamed the fish Enson )
The highlight of the night must have been when that guy walking his dog walked by and I challenged his dog to fight my fish .
He did not accept , therefore he must have been scared .
Me and the fish felt good about that .
I renamed the fish Champ .
And the beer was cold .
Mornings catch up too soon for me these days .
35 missed calls , two text messages and three voicemails .
The girl always made me pay for it when I leave my phone all by itself .
And 5 minutes later she is already walking up my stairs .
" Whattup shnookums "
She has a vicoden haze in her movements and every word is pained .
She is searching my room for contraband .
I am a victim in my own home !
" Where 's the alcohol ? ! " she screams .
" I drank it all , the fish told me too ! "
I made a mental note to rename the fish ' Button ' .
" How much ? ! " " Eighteen gallons ! "
I may have exaggerated , but I was angry .
Where was my peace if not in my own room ?
" Get in bed , you look like shit . " " I took too much vicoden last night . " " Just get in bed .
" So she did , and that was nice , searching once again for the peace which I had before her arrival .
But she 's stubborn as hell , and demands she cannot rest at my place , so against my better judgment I let her go home again .
But she 's on the phone , as always , and we 're fighting again , as always .
I was trying to break plans with her so I could spend some time with my family and she is flipping out .
My aunt and uncle are going back to Florida in two days and I wanted to see them .
But she is crazy , and making up crazy words , and I was beginning to feel a panic attack .
" Calm down ! " she tries to tell me , but I do n't want to calm down .
She had worked me into hysterics .
She wants to talk about everything and I can't stand all the meaningless words , they just frighten and mock me .
" Everything is going to be fine , " she says trying to sooth me .
" I do n't want everything to be all right .
I want buildings to collapse and planes to crash !
I want there to be more orphans and homeless people !
I am so upset now and you wo n't leave me in peace !
" Luckily she was already home and passing out from medication and sickness , so that got me off the hook for spending like a zillion more hours with her on the phone .
" Fuck this shit Freddy , " ( I renamed the fish Freddy ) .
I did n't want to have a girlfriend or a family or even a single friend in the universe after that .
I was so upset and dizzy , and screw everything else .
Out came the whiskey .
Just me , the bottle , and the fish .
Drinking makes me a shitty thinker , so I have forgotten the fish 's name very early into this latest episode of binging , but that did n't stop him from making turns in his little plastic cube .
He swam up , he swam down , he was wonderful .
The drink was wonderful .
My air conditioning was wonderful .
Everything was so wonderful , and then my eyes closed .
The events that happened next are not so clear .
But even a person in a completely sober state or reckoning would have a hell of a time keeping up with this tornado .
I remember screaming , absolute bottom of the throat shrieking .
And I thought , well this is n't peaceful at all .
She had come back , found me and the bottle .
I was the only one in bed though .
There was no snuggling or kisses , or any of that good stuff .
She was screaming , and pouring my wonderful bottle of whiskey all over everything !
My floor , my clothes , my bed .
Then in a dramatic
Tour de ' force she flips open the window and hurls the bottle out the window .
" I can't believe you threw out that good drink . "
I was getting up and stretching out after my initial blast of adrenaline had wretched me from bed .
"
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING THIS TO YOURSELF ! "
She screamed .
" Why are you doing this to me ? " I asked back .
Then she hit me in the face , twice .
Later she admitted that she really hurt her hand doing so , and that kind of made me proud .
I asked her to hit me again , she obliged .
It kind of felt nice , I have n't been physically assaulted in a long time .
Naw , but I did n't hit her , I came close to later on , but I have n't gotten to that part yet .
So we 're screaming , and she is throwing everything she can get her hands on at me .
But I just keep on telling her things she does n't want to hear on purpose because I was getting deeply disturbed .
" Do n't you love me ? " she asks , " Less and less every day ! " I scream .
Which really is n't true , because in hindsight this fight was pretty fun .
Usually we argue , just talking , and that is so draining .
Now things were airborne , I was getting bruises on my arms , and my face was still sore ; it all seemed so much more productive like this .
For some reason I think she could pick up that hurting me really was n't doing the trick to hurt me enough .
She ran off and I found her in the kitchen cutting up my license .
" This is so you ca n't buy any more alcohol ! " " Dammit woman , you 're nuts absolutely nuts . "
I admired her thinking , but any of the places I buy alcohol from already know me from frequent visits , nice try though honey .
Now my wallet is a mess , and I have to go stand in line at the RMV .
I think I will take her , just so she has to go through that torture with me .
But I am trying to put back my wallet , and my hung over mind , just trying to get an understanding of what the fuck was going on .
Everything was so perfect only 15 minutes earlier .
Now everything was a mess , and everyone was yelling .
I got back to my room and I noticed among the missing and wrecked , that there was no water in the fish bowel .
" Baby , where 's the fish ? "
" I flushed him down the toilet ! " " YOU FLUSHED HIM DOWN THE TOILET ?!?!?
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING CRAZY BITCH ARE YOU ?!?
HOW CAN YOU FLUSH A FISH DOWN THE TOILET ?!?!? "
Sure enough , I checked , and there was heaps of fish gravel still at the bottom of my toilet bowel .
Now I was ready to hit her .
That was my companion , my amigo .
Let it be said that I believe his last name before death was Samson .
But I 'm too much of a pushover , I can't hit her , what the heck is that going to solve .
Even though she looked like she was having a good time when she hit me .
" I 'll be back at six , ( it was five at the time ) sleep and sober up . " " I 'll let you hit me again if you agree to come back at seven . " " I 'll be back at six ! "
And then she was gone .
What the hell had happened ?
It was like a thunder strike , or some other act of god that came down to destroy my little room in my little life .
It 's all I really want , just a little room all to myself , I do n't want to bother anyone else , just mind my business and go on trying to save my sanity like the rest of everyone .
I locked every damn door and window in the place .
I was still wearing my pajamas , and I just threw on an old shirt , probably soaked in whisky along with everything else .
I grabbed a pillow and just walked out of there , I walked all the way down to the park .
" Why is everyone else so crazy ? " I thought .
Why are there younger brothers , and clouds with letters in them ?
Why is a tree only a tree ?
And what if a tree was more than a tree ?
Why can't the ice - cream man deliver ?
And where was my peace ?
I looked for it under a small tree in the park .
Just me , the pillow and no crazy woman around making noises and flushing friends down the toilet .
When Lord of the Flies appeared in 1954 it received unprecedented reviews for a first novel .
Critics used such phrases as " beautifully written , tragic and provocative ... vivid and enthralling ... this beautiful and desperate book ... completely convincing and often very frightening ... its progress is magnificent ... like a fragment of nightmare ... a dizzy climax of terror ... the terrible spell of this book ... "
E.M. Forster chose it as the Outstanding Novel of the Year .
Time and Tide touched upon perhaps the most important facet of this book when it said , " It is not only a first - rate adventure story but a parable of our times , " and articles on this and subsequent Golding novels have stressed these twin aspects of Golding : a consummate control of the novel form , and a superb all - encompassing vision of reality which communicates itself with a power reminiscent of Conrad .
AR Level 5.0 , 9 Pts .
An interview with Andrew Flood about the impressions of the North American anarchist movement he formed during his 2007 / 2008 44 city tour of the US and Canada .
The interviews ends with questions about the comparison of the movement in Ireland with that in Britian and the promotion of anarchism via the internet .
This was submitted and published in Black Flag .
Q. Which places did you visit in your tour ?
Did any local anarchists groups host events ?
If so , which ones ?
In total I spoke in 44 North American cities scattered across 2 Canadian provinces and 18 US states .
These were on the east and west coasts and from the east coast across the mid-west as far as Minneapolis - St Paul’s .
There were lots of organizations , infoshops and organizations in formation involved on putting on the dates .
Around one third were organized through the North East Federation of Anarchist Communists ( NEFAC ) while some local groups just organized a meeting in the one city they were active in .
In the vast majority of cases I ’d never met any of the organizers , everything was done over email , the entire Florida tour for instance was initated by one student who was on the Crimthinc mailing list and saw an announcement for my tour which was apparently posted there .
He contacted me and then proceeded to contact email addresses he found in Florida and managed to get four dates together that way .

Q. Were the meetings well attended ?
Does there seem to be much interest in libertarian ideas ?
Attendance varied from around 60 to around a dozen , perhaps giving a total close to 1400 people who attended a meeting during the tour .
In quite a few stops it was the first public anarchist meeting organized in quite a while so apart from city size and local politics there would have been a good deal of variation in how experienced the local organizers were at putting together and promoting events like these .
The people who turned up certainly seemed to be interested but they were rather a small fraction of the local population .
Q. What was the theme of the meeting ?
Were they well received ?
The theme was ‘ Building a Popular Anarchism in Ireland . ’
Basically I was telling the story of the growth of the Irish anarchist movement in the period from 1997 - 2007 and in doing so making an argument for an outward looking , organized movement capable of working in alliances .
Generally there seemed to be a very high level of interest , it was a great help that the subject matter contained loads of interesting anecdotes that reflected a decade of positive anarchist organization in Ireland .
Note you can now view the talk below
Q . What is the US movement like from a class - struggle perspective ?
Better than I expected .
I think on arrival in North America I shared any of the prejudices that you find in the British anarchist movement towards North America , prejudices that are often based on a failure to try and understand conditions there .
I expected a lot of North American anarchists to be liberal idiots but the reality I found was huge numbers of people doing quite solid local organizing , in particular when you considered their weak numbers and relative lack of experience .
And a good few of the positions that seem a little odd from Europe make a lot more sense when you can put them in the contest of local conditions and North American history .
Q . What are , if any , the tactical and political priorities / differences in the US compared to Ireland / UK ?
Actually from my experiences I ’d say the movement in Britain is closer to the movement in North America then either of those movements is with Ireland .
Chiefly compared to the number of self - declared anarchists the level of national or regional organization is very , very weak in North American and Britain in comparison with Ireland .
Beyond that there are people who like riots and people who like workplace organising there just as there are in most places , there is n’t really a single tactical direction
Q. Did anything in particular stand out and impress you about the American movement ?
I think the sheer number of people involved in local projects was very impressive .
At a simple level about 2/3 of my meetings ( about 30 of them ) took place in radical social spaces of one form or another .
And I probably visited at least another twenty or more .
That is a fair greater level of infrastructure ( and the commitment that implies ) much more then I had expected to find .
Q . And on the other side of the coin , did anything stand out and / or depress you about it ?
The acceptance of primitivism as a legtimite part of the anarchist movement and even the left in general .
I was amazed for instance to discover that some union locals had sponsored the speaking tour of Derick Jensen whose primitivist writings amount to an argument for mass murder .
He was charging in the region of 2000 dollars an appearance in Ontario , it was quite extraordinary to me that unions would spend their members money on such a huckster .
Q. What are the major tendencies in the American movement ?
Which ones seem to growing and which ones declining ?
My tour coincided with and fed into a wave of anarchist communist organizing across many of the regions I was visiting which meant I got to play some role in the formation process of five or six new organizations .
But I would n’t overstate this , as is true of the North America in general these organizations are tiny in comparison with the population of the areas they operate in .
The positive news on the primitivist front is that apart from the couple of celebratry gurus who are very visible on the internet there is very little primitivist organization anywhere , even in Eugene , Oregan .
I have the general impression that many of the people who might formly have been primmies had drifted into some form of insurrectional anarchism although again there are almost no organizations ( formal or otherwise ) outside of a couple of cities .
Some of the insurrectionalist stuff is really stupid , taking no account whatsoever of local conditions and acting out a weakass version of what is seen on Greek youtube riot porn .
But there is nothing uniquely North America there either
The IWW remains by far the largest network for anti-authoritarians in the US but it did n’t really strike me as having any real existence as a union outside of what were pretty small struggles in a couple of cities .
Many social anarchists join it as a way of meeting up with like minded folk and of distancing themselves from the nuttier end of the local anarchist scene .
Q . What do you think are the main problems ( internally and externally ) facing the growth of anarchism in America ?
Internally issues like the high rate of transience which means its hard to accumulate collective experience in any city as people are always moving in , in particular when organizational problems are encountered .
Related to this is the very low level of intergenerational contact which means the movement today which is mostly under 30 , if not 25 does n’t easily benefit from the lessons learned the hard way by the movement in the 60’s , 70’s and 80’s .
Externally the North American cult of the rugged individual and the American dream not only make popular organizing difficult but seeps into the anarchist movement like a poison .
Couple this with the historic success of the US state in smashing radical oppositional movements in all their forms and the current high degree of repression of anything that steps over the limited boundaries of protest allowed and you have a very difficult atmosphere in which to build anything that goes beyond lobbying .
The number of police are extraordinary , their constant use against the ‘ civilian population ’ is striking , I saw more people being arrested on the streets in the 16 weeks of my tour as I have in nearly 40 years outside North America .
And finally in the US in particular there is an extraordinary level of state infiltration and the use of agent provocateurs to tempt fresh young activists into doing stupid stuff that can lead them to very long jail sentences .
Q . What do you think are the main good points ( internally and externally ) for the growth of anarchism in America ?
Class divisions , although sometimes camouflaged by race are very , very visible in the USA and almost as visible in Canada .
Workers , particularly outside the coastal cities , are being fucked over in a very , very visible way .
So ‘ rugged individualism ’ aside North America should be fertile ground for class struggle politics , it certainly has been in the past .
Also the left does not really exist , the few far left groups that exist are much smaller than their equivalents in Britain despite the much greater population , they do n’t really exist outside a few colleges in a few towns .
With the exception of Canada there is no social democracy and no viable green party .
In short it would not that hard for anarchists to become ‘ the ’ opposition .
Internally there is actually a huge amount of individual experience of grassroots organising within the anarchist movement .
If you had the emergence of a coherent movement this individual experience could be turned into some pretty powerful collective organization .
Q. How do the American and European anarchist movements compare in terms of struggle and organisational aspects ?
The US and Britain are very similar in that most anarchists are not part of region wide organizations or often even local organizations .
The region wide organizations in reality really only exist as more than isolated individuals in a very small number of cities although they often have a scattering of individual members outside of these .
This means that in terms of struggle the vast majority of activity is around individual anarchists involved in local community , environmental or workplace struggle as militant individuals who happen to be anarchists rather than as part of a collective anarchist effort .
From time to time there are a variety of social / political gatherings at which people can exchange experiences but which apart from the occasional spectacular event like summit protests these do n’t formulate collective action .
As with Britain the biggest of these are bookfairs but the sheer scale of North America means there is no single equivalent to the London bookfair but rather a range of bookfair and conference events across the continent .
There is no equivalent to the anarchist influenced revolutionary unions on the European mainland .
The IWW would like to be that but the reality is that its membership density is less than that of the WSM in Ireland so its more of a network of anti-authoritarian workplace militants that occasionally tries to act as a union when the opportunity arises at a particular location or at a particular time .
There are no also equivalents of the sort of regional anarchist political organizations that are found in some countries that have a real presence across a large number of cities but this is a product of the small size of the movement as well as not talking the organizational question seriously enough .
Q. Did you get much chance to see working class parts of America ?
How do they compare to what you see in the media ?
I ’d question this question .
What exactly would be ‘ non- working class ’
America outside of very small strips of the super rich in New York , Miami , LA or the other global cities .
The vast majority of the US population is working class so it follows that most of the urban geography is working class . , including of those cities already listed .
I guess this question may come from the way the US is portrayed in the TV that makes it over here , after all workers are pretty absent from ‘ Sex & the City ’ except when they are pouring drinks for or being targeted by the main characters .
Beyond that perhaps this is a question about the industrial working class ?
A good part of the trip was in cities that would have been associated with large scale industry , particularly those cities in the mid-west , places like Detroit .
I saw 8 - mile , Detroit seemed to be close enough to that but considerably more run down then at the time of that story .
I ’ve also seen all the episodes of the Wire and that seems like an accurate enough portrayal of life in Baltimore .
Miami on the other hand was nothing like what is portrayed in CSS Miami , there is a very narrow strip of really rich folk but behind that , away from the beach are mile after mile or ordinary workers and patches of extreme poverty and deprivation .
My New York did n’t look much like that of Sex & the City or even friends , but then I was staying in Jersey city .
Q. Any anecdotal tales ?
Dozens – I talk about some of them in my blog and I ’m in the process of extending this as I have time .
Riots in Olympia , broken down buses and the strange smell of an anarchist conference in DC all feature .
Q. Do American anarchists really smell that much ?
Nope – I only hit that smell once , in DC .
There is a fringe of lifestylist types , very often students , for whom smelling is something occasionally adopted to give them kudos .
It ’s really not very important even if on that one occasion it was annoying .
Most of the anarchists I met were ordinary folks that only differered from the people around them by their politics .
Q . You are now back in Ireland , have things changed much during you time in the states ?
Ha .
At the time of writing they certainly have .
I left the Celtic Tiger and returned to an economy that has collapsed month after month since my return .
Now that is a long story and one that is far from over .
But I first saw the collapse when I arrived in Miami around the start of April , loads of condo skyscrapers hand been abandoned after 20 floors of construction after the banks had stopped loaning money to the developers .
Crossing the Atlantic was a bit like getting a flight that was running a little ahead of the sunset , you had seen what was coming .
Q. How do the Irish and British anarchist movements compare in terms of struggle and organisational ?
The Irish movement is smaller both because the island has a 1/5th of the population and in real terms .
But for its size it ’s a lot more organised .
I would guess there are 3-400 anarchists in Ireland who have some level of activity and 20 - 30 % of these are in one of the two national organization , mostly in WSM .
I ’d guess there would be maybe 4,000 anarchists in Britain but only 4 - 8 % of that number are in national organizations .
Anarchism here is also pretty much always class struggle in flavor even if a particular struggle happens to be one around what might be seen as environmentalism .
Q. Has the Irish movement got anything to learn from the UK , and visa versa ?
Try to avoid extreme sectarianism posioning the ability to work together although in reality that is easier to say than to do .
On the local level there are loads of things we see and would seek to learn from although the question of what can be transferred to the different conditions here is not always an easy one .
And of course we nicked the idea of doing a bookfair and that has been a strong success , the Dublin one is around ¼ the size of the London one now which is pretty good given the population difference .
Q. The WSM always have a stall at the London bookfair .
Do you think it , and by extension , the British movement changed much over the years ?
For the better ?
I ’m not sure it has changed very much , at least it has n’t changed in any consistent direction over those years but ebbed and flowed throughout the period .
Even apart from the bookfairs many of our members have lived in Britain for periods and been active in the movement there , from the late 1970 ’s to the current day .
The bookfair itself seems to have changed for the better , not only is it bigger but it ’s a lot less counter cultural than it used to be .
Q. The WSM was at the forefront of putting an anarchist presence on the net , starting back in the 1990s .
Do you think that has paid off ?
No question about that although really it was an individual rather than an organizational effort up to the late 1990 ’s when the internet really started to take off .
I worked in IT from the early 1990 ’s and basically just grabbed electronic versions of anything we printed , for most of that time I think the others were inclined to view my online activity as a rather odd and nurdish hobby .
Nowadays we are working on lots of ways of developing a collective online presence and probably a dozen members are actively involved in that in a regular way , in the last months we ’ve been putting a lot of video and audio online as well as working on social networking sites like Facebook .
Q. How has the internet changed how anarchists get their message across ?
Has it affected how the WSM work in Ireland ?
Obviously the net is now far more important than the scattering of local radical bookshops used to be .
But there are negatives to that , people are probably reading a lot fewer book length texts for instance .
The growth of indymedia here in Ireland , which we played quite a central part in , was extremely useful to us .
It got our ideas out to huge numbers of people who may never have visited our own site .
And it generated a very useful debate , particularly at the time of the 2002/3 anti-war movement .
But the internet has changed a lot in the last few years , the indymedia model may well be on the way out and we need to keep looking at how we can turn aspects of the new stuff to our use .
Anarchists are nervous about stuff like Facebook , and rightly so , but remember the origins of the internet lie in the military wanting a common and control system that could survive a major nuclear war , if that can be used for good anything can
Q. Can you tell us something about your latest project , Anarchist Writers ( http://anarchism.pageabode.com/)?
I ’m terrible at managing to file anything I write so for years I ’ve used the internet to store my public writings and often as not I use google to locate old stuff .
For years this was on a variety of manually edited pages but these are a lot of work to maintain .
When I moved to Canada and became involved in Common Cause we needed a web site and from the start we wanted to make this a collective project .
So along with someone else I forced myself to learn enough Drupal ( an opensource CMS system ) to put it together .
When that was done I realized that creating a new site would be an easy way not only to store my own material but that it would also be almost no extra work to create accounts on it for other anarchists to do the same for theirs .
Then when I was organising the tour I realized creating a blog on the site would be an easy way for people ( including my parents ) to keep track of how things were going .
I found I quite liked the freedom of blogging ( as people do n’t expect the same level of editorial care as they do with articles ) so I ’ve kept going .
As of now I ’m starting to expand the number of people with accounts on the site , basically through offering accounts to people I know and those who agree with the Anarkismo statement .
So over time the site may build to quite a useful resource in its own right .
But it also functions as training for me , I may work in IT but I ’ve never done any formal training outside of the equivalent of a YTS course , I tend to learn new stuff by starting off a project that I think should exist and pick things up as I go along .
Q. Any final comments or suggestions ?
We ’ll build a successful movement by always looking outwards , taking risks and trying new things .
Traditionalism and too much concern with purity are a recipe for inaction .
This is the interview as submitted to Black Flag , I presume the version they actually published would have been edited but I have n't seen it yet .
I conducted interviews with individuals and groups of anarchists in 17 cities I visited , they are listed at http://anarchism.pageabode.com/andrewnflood/interviews-with-anarchists-i...

The US space shuttle Endeavour launched from its base in Florida last night .
It is due to deliver and install an outdoor platform for science experiments on the International Space Station .
Endeavour blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 6:03 pm ( 11.03 pm Irish time ) , carrying a crew of seven astronauts on a 16 - day mission to the $ 100bn orbiting research outpost .
The six US citizens and one Canadian on board are scheduled to reach the ISS tomorrow .
They will install a platform for astronauts to conduct experiments 350 km above the Earth 's surface .
Eight minutes after launch the shuttle entered orbit 225 km above Earth , and a few moments later the shuttle could be seen successfully separating from the external fuel tank .
A US space agency official played down the potential damage caused by debris that peeled off from Endeavour 's external fuel tank during liftoff and could be seen hitting the shuttle about two minutes into the flight in images broadcast on NASA TV .
The debris could be ice or foam that broke off from the external fuel tank , said Bill Gerstenmaier , NASA associate administrator for space operations .
NASA has been cautious about conditions for the space shuttle 's exit and return since the shuttle Columbia blew apart some 20,000 m above the Earth in 2003 as it was returning from a 16 - day space mission to land in Florida .
Endeavour 's launch had been scrubbed three times since Saturday due to inclement weather .
Two earlier attempts in June were aborted after potentially hazardous leaks to the shuttle 's external fuel tank were discovered .
The aborted attempts left the US space agency footing $ 4.5 m in extra costs .
Coincidentally , today marks the 40th anniversary of NASA 's first Moon landing mission , Apollo 11 .

Medical Heroin Found Effective for Treatment - Refractory Opioid Addiction Fighting fire with fire ?
Medical heroin may beat methadone for some addicts .
Aug. 23 , 2009  --
Injectable diacetylmorphine , the active ingredient in heroin , was shown to be an effective alternative to oral methadone in treating opioid addiction that had not responded to previous treatment .
Compared with methadone , a commonly used drug used in heroin addiction treatment , diacetylmorphine led to 67 percent less illegal activity and illicit drug use after one year of treatment , compared to a 47.7 percent reduction with methadone , according to Dr. Martin Schechter of the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health in Vancouver and colleagues .
In addition , patients receiving diacetylmorphine had higher rates of retention in addiction treatment programs at one year -- 87.8 percent versus 54.1 percent -- the researchers reported in the Aug. 20 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine .
Schechter said methadone should remain the standard treatment for most patients with opioid dependence , with diacetylmorphine reserved for the 15 percent to 25 percent who do n't respond .
" Methadone remains a pretty good first - line treatment , " he said , " but either the switch to heroin or using heroin as an adjunct obviously has increased effectiveness for this difficult population . "
Dr. Joshua Lee of New York University said the findings validate those from European studies -- that medical heroin is a valid approach to treating addiction .
" Generally , " said Lee , who was not involved in the study , " it is a very positive development when a new treatment approach ... brings drug users into a medicalized , therapeutic environment where further treatment can be established and related problems like cocaine use can begin to be addressed . "
Dr. Daniel Angres , psychiatrist and author of Healing the Healer : The Addicted Physician , questioned the usefulness of both diacetylmorphine and methadone as treatment options when an alternative with less abuse potential , bupronorphine , is available .
The drug is less likely to be abused , he said , because the naloxone would block the opiate effect of bupronorphine if the drug were injected .
Heroin vs. Methadone Trial Yields Interesting Results
To explore diacetylmorphine treatment in a North American population , Schechter and his colleagues initiated the North American Opiate Medication Initiative ( NAOMI ) , an open - label , phase III trial conducted in Montreal and Vancouver .
The trial could not be conducted in the United States because of difficulty obtaining funding and regulatory permission to inject heroin , Schechter said .
Participants had been heroin users on average for 16.5 years on average , and they had at least two failed treatment attempts , one of which had to be methadone .
About three - quarters had participated in illegal activities other than drug use in the month before the study began .
The researchers assigned 111 participants to methadone and 115 to diacetylmorphine , which was self - administered up to three times daily with a maximum daily dose of 1,000 milligrams .
Treatment lasted one year .
By the end of treatment , composite scores for drug use and illegal activities on the European Addiction Severity Index improved significantly in both groups .
Patients who received diacetylmorphine had significant improvements on six of the seven remaining subscales .
Those who received methadone improved on two -- economic status and employment satisfaction .
The gains in the diacetylmorphine group were greater than those in the methadone group for drug use , psychiatric status , employment satisfaction , and social relations .
There were more serious adverse events in the diacetylmorphine group -- 51 versus 18 .
None of the adverse events in the methadone group was attributed to the study treatment .
The most common serious adverse events with diacetylmorphine treatment were potentially life - threatening overdoses in 10 patients and seizures in six .
None of the patients died .
" Our safety data suggest that diacetylmorphine should be delivered in settings where prompt medical intervention is available , " the researchers said .
Schechter added , however , that " we consider the results to show it 's very , very safe . "
Politics , Cost May Get in Way of Heroin Treatment
Diacetylmorphine treatment is more expensive than methadone , Schechter said .
A year of treatment costs about $ 6,300 to $ 7,300 for prescribed heroin and about $ 2,700 to $ 3,600 for methadone .
But , he said , with the cost of an untreated person with heroin addiction estimated at about $ 50,000 a year -- including costs associated with medical care , imprisonment , and legal proceedings -- both treatments appear highly cost - effective .
A formal cost - effectiveness analysis is ongoing , he said .
In an accompanying editorial , Virginia Berridge of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , pointed out that European countries that have conducted similar trials have had different responses to the results , partly because of the politics and controversial nature of the treatment .
For example , she said , Switzerland and the Netherlands have begun prescribing heroin as part of their medical system , whereas Germany and Spain have balked at the idea .
" We will now wait to see what political or professional factors will support or oppose the conclusions of this study in its home territory , and whether the historical legacy of heroin will matter , " she said .
Isabel Garcia , a Tucson , Ariz. , attorney whose work on behalf of immigrants has earned her international acclaim , has received a death threat from an individual claiming to offer a half million dollars to anyone who might assassinate her .
Written in broken Spanish , the threat arrived by e-mail at the offices of Coalición de Derechos Humanos , or the Human Rights Coalition , in June .
Garcia is the co-chair of the organization , which monitors the growing militarization of the border , tracks border patrol abuses , and promotes community education about rights when encountering law enforcement officials .
Written in broken Spanish , the unsigned e-mail warns Garcia , " We know where you live and we watch and follow you and your compatriots . "
Death threats are nothing new to Garcia , but this one is particularly chilling :
It arrived the same month that a break - away faction of the Minutemen , an armed , anti-immigrant vigilante group , murdered a Mexican - American father and his daughter in their home in the border town of Arivaca , Ariz .
It also arrived shortly after the June 10 murder of a guard at the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington by a rifle - wielding white supremacist — a reminder of the growing numbers of hate crimes taking place throughout the United States .
I had the privilege of working with Garcia as a member of Derechos Humanos in the 1990s when I lived in Tucson .
Her passion for justice has made her a mentor to many .
As one of the founders of the 15 - year - old Derechos Humanos , she has helped build a formidable organization , privy to information about border militarization that the government has tried to keep from the public .
Her work has angered both anti-immigrant groups in the United States and the Mexican government .
In 2006 , the Mexican government awarded Garcia its National Human Rights Award for her work as the Pima County Legal Defender ; this was the first time the award went to a person not born in Mexico .
Garcia requested five minutes to speak at the ceremony in Mexico :
She was hoping to talk about the deaths of immigrants crossing the border into Arizona on foot — and about the complicity of President Felipe Calderon 's government in its refusal to address the problem of economic justice .
The Mexican government denied her request .
She was later given the award with little fanfare in Tucson .
Most recently , in 2008 , the Lannan Foundation awarded her its Cultural Freedom Award .
According to Kat Rodriguez , coordinator of Derechos , there has been no response to date from the FBI , who was notified of the threat the day after it was received .
When Rodriguez attempted to follow up , she was told that a customary five to seven business day waiting period was to be expected for " all complaints . "
When it was reiterated that this was a death threat , the FBI staff person asked , " Well , did they give a time frame ? "
Rodriguez responded that the letter states that a half - million dollars has been offered for " Garcia 's head , " to which the staff person responded , " Well , I still think we should wait the five to seven business days . "
This conversation , explained Rodriguez , happened June 11 , the day after the murder of the guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum .
To date , there has been no contact made by the FBI to either Garcia or the office of Derechos Humanos .
Meanwhile , Garcia continues to be in the spotlight because of her work with Derechos Humanos .
The group 's mission centers on bringing attention to the human cost of militarizing the U.S. - México border .
Since the 1990s when border policies began to change and the numbers tracked , the remains of more than 5,000 men , women and children have been recovered on the U.S. - México border .
For more than five years , Derechos Humanos has compiled data on the human remains recovered on the Arizona - Sonora border , where more than half of all border crossing attempts are made .
Data from the medical examiner shows that the remains of at least 29 individuals were recovered in June -- nearly one per day .
Since Derechos Humanos began collecting data in 2002 -- that is when U.S. border policies shifted migration into the deadly and desolate Arizona desert -- the remains of at least 1,769 people have been recovered .

Utah Governor Gary Herbert , who took over for moderate Governor Jon Huntsman after Huntsman resigned to become Ambassador to China , has spoken out against anti-discrimination laws which include sexual orientation :
" In his most definitive comments yet on gay rights , Herbert told
reporters he does n't believe sexual orientation should be a protected
class in the way that race , gender and religion are .
' We do n't
have to have a rule for everybody to do the right thing .
We ought to
just do the right thing because it's the right thing to do and we do n't
have to have a law that punishes us if we do n't , 'Herbert said in his
first monthly KUED news conference .
In Utah , it is legal to fire
someone for being gay or transgender .
The gay rights advocacy group
Equality Utah has been trying to change state law for several years but
has always been rebuffed by the Republican - controlled Legislature .
Last
year , the group got Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman 's support for
extending some rights to gay people , although none of the bills it
backed became law . "
Unfortunately , that 's why we have anti-bias laws .
Because people do n't do the right thing .

The violence at Tuesday 's match between West Ham and Millwall was a " disgrace to football " , the sports minister says .
Gerry Sutcliffe said : " We have made great progress in tackling hooliganism in this country and will not tolerate a return to the dark days of the 80s . "
Investigations are being held into the fighting involving hundreds of fans that marred the Carling Cup game .
A 44 - year - old man is stable in hospital after being stabbed in the chest .
Police said 13 people were arrested .
West Ham and Millwall fans have been involved in rivalry going back decades .
Mr Sutcliffe continued : " I completely back the FA 's call for any person identified as involved to be banned for life .
" The scenes last night were a disgrace to football . "
Justice Secretary Jack Straw said the FA needed to take " strong measures " to prevent a repeat .
And Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : " Anyone who thinks thuggery has a place in modern - day football is living in the dark ages , and will bring only shame upon the teams they support .
" We have very tough football legislation in place and are confident that the police will ensure offenders are brought to justice . "
Jeremy
Hunt , shadow culture secretary , said : " Wider questions need to be answered as to how the situation was allowed to get out of hand in the first place . "
Fights thought to have been planned started near the east London stadium at about 1800 BST and continued for five hours .
About 200 riot police with at least 20 mounted officers were at the scene .
One pub reportedly had its windows broken as running battles continued across several streets up to half - a- mile from the stadium .
Eyewitnesses said hooligans ripped out bollards and lit fires .
By 2300 BST several hundred West Ham fans had congregated outside the stadium where they chanted and bombarded police with beer cans and bottles .
The Met says the violence that erupted during the match was planned
Officers are scanning video to identify hooligans .
Inside the stadium the pitch was invaded on three occasions .
West Ham won the game 3 - 1 .
Andy Holt , the Association of Chief Police Officers ' football policing expert , said : " Last night is an unwelcome reminder of violence once commonplace at grounds .
" Football hooliganism is still a lingering menace , albeit among a small minority of supporters and we will not tolerate it .
" Over 20 years the UK has made steady progress in eradicating football - related violence .
' Deplorable violence '
" All genuine football fans will be concerned at last night 's scenes and the police service is determined to ensure that such events remain the exception . "
In a statement , West Ham United Football Club said it would fully investigate the " deplorable violence " and take the strongest action against anyone involved .
A Football Association spokesman said anyone found to have taken part in the violence would be banned from football for life .
He said : " We absolutely condemn the disorder .
" We will be working with all parties , the police and clubs , to establish the facts surrounding these events . "
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- A Georgia man who spent a year in jail for nonpayment of child support -- despite the fact he has no children -- has been cleared of the debt , his attorney said Tuesday .
Frank Hatley was ordered to make back payments even after he learned a teenager was n't his son .
Frank Hatley , 50 , spent 13 months in jail for being a deadbeat dad before his release last month .
A judge ordered him jailed in June 2008 for failing to support his " son " -- a child who DNA tests proved was not fathered by Hatley .
Last week , Cook County Superior Court Judge Dane Perkins signed an order stating , " defendant is no longer responsible for paying any amount of child support . "
The order permits the state 's Office of Child Support Services to close its file on Hatley .
" We 're satisfied with the result for Mr. Hatley , but still troubled by the state 's monumental lapse of judgment in this case , " attorney Sarah Geraghty with the Atlanta - based Southern Center for Human Rights told CNN in a written statement .
Hatley did not immediately return a call from CNN Tuesday .
His story dates back to 1986 , when Hatley had a relationship with Essie Lee Morrison , who gave birth to a son .
According to court documents , Morrison told Hatley the child was his , but the two ended their relationship shortly after the child was born .
The couple never married and never lived together , the documents said .
When the child turned 2 , Morrison applied for public support for the child .
Under Georgia law , the state , can recoup the cost of the assistance from a child 's non-custodial parent .
For 13 years ,
Hatley made payments to the state until learning in 2000 that the boy might not be his .
A DNA test that year confirmed the child was not fathered by Hatley , court documents said .
He returned to court and was relieved of any future child support payments , but was ordered to pay more than $ 16,000 he owed the state before the ruling .
Since 2000 , Hatley paid that debt down to about $ 10,000 , Geraghty said .
Court documents showed he was jailed for six months in 2006 for falling behind on payments during a period of unemployment , but afterward he resumed making payments , continuing to do so even after he lost another job and became homeless in 2008 .
But last year he became unable to make the payments and was jailed .
The argument for keeping Hatley liable for the back payments , according to the attorney who represented him in 2000 , was that he signed a consent agreement with the Office of Child Support Services .
The court agreed that Hatley had to comply with the consent agreement for the period he believed the child was his son , said attorney Latesha Bradley .
But many , including Cook County Sheriff Johnny Daughtrey , did n't think Hatley 's incarceration was fair , given that the child was not his .
" I knew the gentleman 's plight and did n't know how to help him , " Daughtrey told CNN last month .
When the Southern Center for Human Rights visited the jail earlier this year , Daughtrey told them about Hatley 's case .
Hatley was released from jail last month after Perkins ruled he was indigent and should not be jailed for failing to make the payments .
The Georgia Department of Human Services , which includes the Office of Child Support Services , plans to propose legislation in the next session of the state Legislature that would prevent similar situations in the future , said agency spokeswoman Dena Smith .
Two things still remain to be cleared up for Hatley , Geraghty said -- lifting the child - support holds on his driver 's license and his income tax .
It remains unclear whether he will be reimbursed for the $ 6,000 in payments he made since 2000 , she said -- so far , he has not been .
Cook County , Georgia , is in the south - central part of the state , about 200 miles south of Atlanta .

At JavaOne 2009 , Sun released Java SE 6 Update 14 , which included a version of the much - anticipated Garbage First ( G1 ) garbage collector .
G1 is a low - pause , low - latency , sometimes soft real - time , collector that allows you to set max pause time goals and collection intervals through suggestions on the Java VM command line .
Although it cannot guarantee it , G1 will attempt to meet your goals , and hence introduce as little latency as possible into your application .
This in turn may also make the VM run more predictably as it attempts to meet the pause time goals you provide .
What Is Garbage Collection ?
Many dynamic languages , such as C , C++ , Pascal , and so on , require you to manage memory explicitly .
This includes memory allocation , de-allocation , and all of the accounting that occurs in between .
In this time frame , you must be sure to not lose track of the memory ( thereby failing to ever free it ) , or the result will be a memory leak .
Just as dangerous is the attempt to use an object ( or access memory ) after it has been de-allocated , through what is called a dangling pointer .
Either one of these situations can result in undefined behavior , the accidental overwriting of other data , a security hole , or an abrupt crash .
Automatic memory management ( garbage collection ) removes the likelihood that these issues will occur since it's no longer left up to you to account for memory allocations .
In C++ , the concept of smart pointers is one solution , and in other languages , such as Lisp , SmallTalk , and Java , a full - featured garbage collector tracks the lifetimes of all objects in a running program .
The history of garbage collection can be traced back to John McCarthy , who invented the concept as part of the Lisp programming language [ McCarthy58 ] .
In short , a garbage collector works to reclaim areas of memory within an application that will never be accessed again .
At the most fundamental level , garbage collection involves two deceivingly simple steps :
Determine which objects can no longer be referenced by an application .
This is done either via object reference counting , or object graphs ( tracing ) .
Reclaim the memory occupied by dead objects ( the garbage ) .
Until recently , Java SE came with two main collectors : the parallel collector , and the concurrent - mark - sweep ( CMS ) collector -- see the sidebar Parallelism and Concurrency .
As of the latest Java SE 6 update release , the G1 collector is another option .
The plan is for G1 to eventually replace CMS as a low - pause , soft real - time collector .
Let 's take a look at how it works .
One of the most frustrating aspects of the health care debate is that the people who most want reform are the most apathetic about it .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research poll released on Wednesday , nearly 8 in 10 Democrats said that they favor “ Barack Obama ’s plan to reform health care , ” compared with just 19 percent of Republicans .
Yet , according to a Gallup poll released last week , only 47 percent of Democrats said that they had a good understanding of the issues involved in the current health care debate .
Fifty - eight percent of the Republicans polled said that they understood .
Furthermore , a Pew Research Center poll released on Thursday found that Democrats were the least likely to say that they were following the debate over health care reform “ very closely . ”
Only 42 percent of Democrats said that they were , compared with 45 percent of the independents and 56 percent of the Republicans polled .
Study :
Most key fishing spots in state polluted ENVIRONMENT

Most key fishing spots in state polluted 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
The most comprehensive survey ever of pollutants in California 's lakes and reservoirs has found that only a few of the most popular fishing spots are free of mercury , PCBs and other contaminants .
Of 152 lakes tested statewide , 21 were clean while 131 showed one or more pollutants at levels above state health guidelines , according to the study released Monday by the State Water Resources Control Board .
In Northern California , some of the cleanest were the high - elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada and the Trinity Alps .
The only Bay Area body of water free of contaminants found was Lago Los Osos in Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area in Fremont , where fishing is n't allowed .
" This study is helping to define the scope of the statewide problem of contaminants accumulating in sport fish , " said Jay Davis , lead author and toxicologist at the nonprofit San Francisco Estuary Institute in Oakland .
Results of the two - year study of California lakes , rivers , reservoirs and coastal waters will be used to develop cleanup plans in watersheds that feed the lakes and to establish guidelines for consuming fish to protect anglers and their families from health risks , Davis said .
In addition to the 100 popular lakes tested in 2007 , the survey included 50 other lakes picked at random .
Next year , 2008 sampling results from 100 additional lakes will be released , bringing the total to 250 lakes out of 9,000 in California .
Some 12,000 fish are being collected and tested , including bass , trout , catfish and carp .
Popular lakes were those that appeared in fishing guides and were known to state fish and water officials .
The lakes were considered clean if all concentrations of pollutants in all the tested species were below thresholds set by the state .
Toxic chemicals under scrutiny were mercury , most of which comes from past mining activities ; PCBs , chemicals once used in electrical equipment ; and the banned pesticides DDT , dieldrin and chlordane .
Fish were also tested for selenium , which is discharged as waste from oil refineries and seeps from irrigated land in the Central Valley .
Methylmercury , the potent form of mercury that taints fish , is the most widespread potential health risk , the study said .
Inorganic mercury , used as an ingredient in gold mining or washing out of crushed rock and natural rock formations , transforms to methylmercury in rivers and lakes , where it accumulates in ever - higher concentrations as it moves up the food chain to larger fish - eating species , such as large - mouth bass .
About one - fourth of the lakes surveyed had at least one fish species with a mercury level high enough that state health officials would consider prohibiting it for the most sensitive humans - pregnant and nursing women , women between 18 and 45 years old who might conceive and children .
PCBs , or polychlorinated biphenyls , are the chemicals that caused the second - most concern among health officials .
In Northern California , more than one - third of the lakes had a fish species with a concentration about the state 's threshold .
Concentrations of banned pesticides and selenium were generally low , and they infrequently exceeded the state 's thresholds , the study said .
The study will be used to identify the lakes where state health officials should return to gather and test more fish and establish safe - eating guidelines , officials said .
The strictest limits will be set for pregnant and nursing women because they can pass pollutants onto fetuses and infants , who are most vulnerable to poisons .
Mercury and PCBs can impair mental and motor development , while PCBs and the pesticides are believed to increase cancer risks .
Curtis Knight , Mount Shasta manager for California Trout , a 7,500 - member conservation organization , said the new information is important for knowing which fish are safe to eat .
" A big part of fishing in a lake is fishing with your kids .
That 's how they learn to fish .
You certainly want to know what you 're feeding your kids , and you want that to be safe , " Knight said .
Knight said the lakes and the fish in them are indicators of watershed health .
" Lakes are collecting bodies for what 's coming out of the streams , and that gives a sense of the watershed 's history , " he said .

Forget Apollo and Sputnik : How a Briton launched the space race in the 1640s
Heroic possibility : John Wilkins drew up plans to send a chariot to the Moon
Forget Sputnik and Apollo 11 - the space race really began almost 400 years ago , according to an academic .
John Wilkins , a British inventor , drew up plans in the 1640s to send a manned wooden ' chariot ' to the Moon propelled by gunpowder , feather wings and springs .
Convinced the Moon was inhabited by a race of people called the Selenites , he was determined to visit them to set up trade links .
Records show that Wilkins , who was Oliver Cromwell 's brother - in - law , experimented with flying machines in the gardens of Wadham College , Oxford , around 1654 .
Allan Chapman , an academic based at the college , claims Wilkins should be acknowledged for establishing the ' Jacobean space programme ' .
' His ingenuity was enormous , ' he said .
' He saw his flying chariot as being the space version of Drake 's , Raleigh 's and Magellan 's ships .
' This was a honeymoon period of British science .
The vacuum had not yet been discovered .
In 1640 , flying to the Moon was a heroic possibility . '
Wilkins , who was initially a vicar on the Northamptonshire village of Fawsley , before becoming warden of Wadham College , Oxford , outlined his theories in ' A Worlde in the Moone ' .
Discussing his belief that the moon was inhabited , Wilkins said : ' I must needs confesse , though I had often thought with my selfe that it was possible there might be a world in the Moone , yet it seemed such an uncouth opinion that I never durst discover it , for feare of being counted singular and ridiculous .
' But afterward having read Plutarch , Galilæus , Keplar , with some others , and finding many of mine owne thoughts confirmed by such strong authority , I then concluded that it was not onely possible there might bee , but probable that there was another habitable world in that Planet . '
John Wilkins proposed using gunpowder and springs to send the ' space chariot ' to the moon
He proposed many theories , or ' prepositions ' , including the moon had no light of its own , instead reflecting sunlight .
Some were later proved wrong , including that the celestial body had seas and an atmosphere .
Wilkins is the only person to have headed a college at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge .
He is also credited with designing the first airgun , a mileage recorder , a prototype for the pneumatic tyre and a ' rainbow machine ' .
By 1670 , scientists knew a Moon landing was way off .
' They 'd made so many discoveries in physics and astronomy in 30 years that they could see that flying to the Moon was not on , ' said Dr Chapman .
As it turned out , Wilkins was a little over 300 years ahead of his time - Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in 1969 - an anniversary celebrated on Monday .

Facebook is moving to address concerns raised by Canada 's privacy commissioner and will soon implement measures that give users better control over their personal information .
The popular social - networking website , which has about 12 million Canadian members , will be filing its intended plan with commissioner Jennifer Stoddart by the end of Monday .
The plan will address four key issues outlined by the commissioner last month .
Along with Stoddart 's recommended actions , they are :
Facebook does n't have enough safeguards to prevent 950,000 third - party developers around the world from getting unauthorized access to users ' personal information , nor does it ensure users have given " meaningful consent " to allow their personal information to be disclosed to the developers .
Recommendation : Developers should only get the information needed to run the application .
Users would have to specifically consent to the release of that information after being told why it is needed .
Information about anyone other than the user would not be disclosed .
Facebook keeps information from accounts deactivated by users indefinitely .
Recommendation : Facebook should have a policy to delete the information after a reasonable length of time , and users should be informed of the policy .
Facebook keeps the profiles of deceased users for " memorial purposes " but does not make this clear .
Recommendation : Information about use for memorial purposes should be in Facebook 's privacy policy .
Facebook allows users to provide personal information about non-users without their consent .
For example , it allows them to tag photos and videos of non-users with their names , and provide Facebook with their email addresses to invite them to join the site .
It keeps the addresses indefinitely .
Recommendation : Facebook should only keep non-users ’ email addresses for a reasonable , specific length of time and should make its users aware that they need to seek consent of non-users before posting information about them .
It is not yet clear to what extent Facebook will address these issues but David Fewer , acting director of the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic — which first brought the complaint against Facebook in May 2008 — said he was under the impression that the website will comply with the recommendations .
" They 're going to satisfy , not just address , the privacy commissioner , " he said .
The plan will be made public by the end of the month , Fewer said .
Facebook had 45 days starting from July 16 to come up with a plan and implement it .
After that period , the commissioner could choose to pursue legal action against the website if unsatisfied .
Facebook said it intends to satisfy the commissioner 's concerns with its proposed plan .
" From our many discussions ... it is clear that we share the same goals of ensuring people have control over their information and that they are able to make informed choices about privacy , " the California - based company said in a statement .
" Many of the recommendations in their report provide an excellent opportunity to clarify and enhance our privacy practices in a way that is consistent with our company 's values and our users ' expectations . "
Fewer said CIPPIC will be turning its attention to other social - networking websites such as MySpace once Facebook 's implementation period is up in 15 days .
" Without a doubt , the other social - networking sites are offside , " he said .
MySpace has so far been ahead of Facebook on some privacy concerns , such as how it limits third - party developers ' access to user information , but it has been considerably less transparent with its policies , Fewer said .
The brown paper bags that McDonald ’s hands out along with Happy Meals and fries are an unlikely art medium , but artist Yuken Teruya has managed to turn the grease - stained vessels into beautiful , delicate paper forests .
In the Notice - Forest series , Teruya cuts one side of a paper bag in a tree shape .
The cut - out tree is folded down so that it appears to be part of a diorama to onlookers who look inside the bag .
According to Teruya , the diorama is meant to look like a real tree positioned against the shadows of other trees in a forest .
In other words , Teruya reclaims paper bags back into what they once were–trees .
Teruya is n’t the only artist of late to take disposal fast food items and turn them into unexpected pieces of art .
Designer Scott Jarvie ’s Clutch Light uses hundreds of plastic drinking straws to create a vibrant multi-colored lamp .
Jim Stewart poured $ 24 million –which he earned writing calculus textbooks ( ?! ) –into building his dream home .
It curves at nearly every point , and is nestled on a hill outside Toronto .
But that ’s not what makes the house special .
Stewart , a math professor , one - time world class concert violinist , and inveterate party host , wanted to build a home that would suit his every need , so the house doubles as a concert hall , seating 150 people with standing room for 50 more .
Stewart makes ample use of the feature , throwing 11 parties in a recent six week span .
He ’s named the house the “ Integral House , ” after the twisting sign for the calculus operation .
The house was n’t designed by a name - brand starchitect like Rem Koolhaas or Frank Gehry , although both of them were in the running for the job .
Rather , it was created Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe .
The duo were given no time limits ( the build started in 1999 ) and no design contraints –in short , the commission of a lifetime .
As a result , expensive touches abound , such as a 24 - foot glass wall that disappears into the floor with the push of a button , and custom curved hardware .
Check out a slideshow of the house ( with pictures taken by the famed Edward Burtynsky ) and read more about it here .

Press conference on Air Force
One this afternoon in which Robert Gibbs says he 's baffled by all the uproar :
Q Public option -- is it dead or not ?
MR. GIBBS : I got to tell you , this is one of the more curious things I 've ever seen in my life .
I was on a Sunday show , I said the same thing about a public option that I 've said for I do n't know how many weeks .
The Secretary reiterated what the President said the day before , and you 'd think there was some new policy .
Q The language appeared to be --
MR. GIBBS : The language " appeared " to be ?
Q Well , the language on Saturday -- the President made -- saying that the public option was only a sliver , and whether it's in it or it is n't in it seems to move the ball a little bit from where you guys were .
No ?
MR. GIBBS : No .
I think you can go back and find the President saying -- look , the President has said that 's his preference , but the President has also said I do n't know how many times if the goals are choice and competition , right , the reason you have a public option is because you have an insurance market that does n't have choice or competition .
If somebody is trying to seek private insurance on -- private health insurance on a private market and only has -- because this happens in some areas or in some states where there 's one insurance company that does business in that region , that that is -- that does n't ensure the type of affordability and quality that you 'd want to see in a health insurance system .
So you have some competition that provides some choice , so that if a family of four might have different insurance needs than a single person or a couple that 's married with no children or what have you .
The goals are choice and competition .
His preference is a public option .
If there are other ideas , he 's happy to look at them .
Because I think his -- I think this is true not only for the issue of health care , but for virtually every other issue that he 'll ever deal with in public life is he has goals about what he wants to accomplish and he's not necessarily wedded to one -- only one way of getting there .
I think he 's said that a hundred times .
Q Just to be completely clear , has anything changed on the public option ?
MR. GIBBS : No .
I challenge you guys all to go back and see what we 've said about this over the course of many , many , many , many months , and you 'll find a boring consistency to our rhetoric .
Q The rhetoric , as you say , might be consistent , but the movement on the ground , so to speak , toward legislation has n't been .
Is there any recognition now that a public option is looking less likely to be part of a final deal ?
MR. GIBBS : Let me make sure I understand your question , because I want to know if it's -- is this predicated on legislative developments since Congress has been out of session , or are we trying to match the stampede of a series of stories to if not the consistent language that we 've all been saying to some now legislative vote ?
Q It 's just looking more and more likely that a public option is not going to be part of the final bill .
I 'm wondering if the White House is --
MR. GIBBS : I do think -- can I just -- I want to point out the -- how do I phrase this -- massive irony that I do n't know that I saw any of your stories denote the fact that this might be -- that you 're surmising now this was a political reality rather than --
Q That 's what we 're asking .
MR. GIBBS : I understand , but did you think from the phrasing of Julianna 's question that we might be coming to justify a series of stampeding stories in one direction based on something different than what we 've always said ?
Q But you guys have -- you have n't exactly come out publicly since Sebelius ' statement yesterday , come in front of the cameras to speak to us , to downplay --
MR. GIBBS : Because nothing has changed .
Q But you have n't downplayed the remarks and the coverage either .
MR. GIBBS : No , no , I think many people talked to you all yesterday .
I think people sent e-mails .
David Axelrod called people .
Q ( Inaudible . )
MR. GIBBS : I did n't get an e-mail from you .
Nothing has changed .
I mean , we can go out and say nothing has changed , but that seems sort of silly since nothing has changed .
Look , in terms of the political realities , obviously there 's a public plan -- or public option in the House bill .
There is a public option in the HELP bill .
I do n't know what the Senate Finance Committee will come out with .
About six or seven years ago I was referred to you by a friend of mine who had Lasik done at your facility .
She was very impressed so I came to see you .
When I had my consult with another doctor I decided to have my eyes done because with the vision I had , I was miserable .
Thank you for being a great guy .
Are Newsdemon deliberately misleading new usenet customers ?
( Update : not intentionally )
Rumors are spreading that former Alaska Governess and failed Vice - Presidental candidate Sarah Palin and husband Todd are getting a divorce .
Is it true ?
And if it is , was this why Palin resigned from office ?
Updated : Palin 's camp denies it .
Blog Alaska Report , who 's reporting on this , asserts the rumor as truth , in addition to noting that Sarah Palin has purchased land in Montana , and possibly plans to move her family there .
AlaskaReport has learned this morning that Todd Palin and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin are to divorce .
Multiple sources in Wasilla and Anchorage have confirmed the news .
A National Enquirer story exposing previous affairs on both sides led to a deterioration of their marriage and the stress from that led to Palin 's resignation as governor of Alaska .
The Palins were noticeably not speaking to each other at last Sunday 's resignation speech in Fairbanks .
Sarah ditched Todd ( MSNBC ) right after the speech and left without him .
Sarah removed her wedding ring a couple of weeks ago .
Sarah has recently purchased land in Montana and is considering moving the family there .
Sarah Palin is originally from Idaho .
They 're citing a Blogspot Blog , a National Enquirer story , and the tensions between Sarah and Todd at her final press conference as the basis for this report .
Not exactly the most credible sources they 've got there , but the Enquirer 's certainly been right about some things , and Alaska Report also qualifies their story by writing that they were the first to announce Palin 's candidacy for Governor and her status as the Vice Presidential nominee .
So , there 's that .
If any of this turns out to be true , it would explain a great deal : Palin 's book deal signing / cashing in , all the talk about tending to her family regarding her resignation , her The - Media 's - Been - Mean media offensive , all of it .
But most likely : the resignation .
Which , in and of itself , is the revelation that she was telling the truth , and bearing down for what 's likely to be the hard media rain / scrutiny that 's about to be comin ' .
UPDATE : It looks like Meg Stapleton , Palin 's spokeswoman , responded to these rumors on , uh , Facebook :
Yet again , some so - called journalists have decided to make up a story .
There is no truth to the recent " story " ( and story is the correct term for this type of fiction ) that the Palins are divorcing .
The Palins remain married , committed to each other and their family , and have not purchased land in Montana ( last week it was reported to be Long Island ) .
Less than one week ago , Governor Palin asked the media to " quit making things up . "
We appreciate that the more professional journalists decided to question this story before repeating it .

SUPPLEMENT I : FUNCTIONS DEFINED BY IMPROPER INTEGRALS SUPPLEMENT
II : THE METHOD OF LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
The plugin in action
by Shyam Seshadri Before I jump into how exactly you can perform super fast and easy JS testing , let me give you some background on the problem .
Javascript is a finicky language ( Some people even hesitate to call it a language ) .
And it can easily grow and become a horrible and complicated beast , incapable of being tamed once let loose .
And testing it is a nightmare .
Once you have decided on a framework ( of which there are a dime a dozen ) , you then have to set it up to run just right .
You need to set it up to actually run your tests .
Then you have to figure out how to run it in a continuous integration environment .
Maybe even run it in headless mode .
And everyone solves it in their own ways .
But the biggest problem I have with most of these frameworks is that executing the tests usually requires a context switch .
By that , I mean to run a JSUnit test , you end up usually having to open the browser , browse to a particular url or html page which then runs the test .
Then you have to look at the results there , and then come back to your editor to either proceed further or fix your tests .
Works , but really slows down development .
In java , all it takes is to click the run button in your IDE to run your tests .
You get instant feedback , a green / red bar and details on which tests passed and failed and at what line .
No context switch , you can get it to run at every save , and proceed on your merry way .
Till now , this was not possible with Javascript .
But now , we have JS Test Driver .
My colleagues Jeremie and Misko ended up running into some of the issues I outlined above , and decided that going along with the flow was simply unacceptable .
So they created a JS Testing framework which solves these very things .
You can capture any browser on any machine , and when you tell it to run tests , it will go ahead and execute them on all these browsers and return you the results in your client .
And its blazing fast .
I am talking milliseconds to run 100 odd tests .
And you can tell it to rerun your tests at each save .
All within the comforts of your IDE .
And over the last three weeks , I have been working on the eclipse plugin for JS Test Driver , and its now at the point where its in a decent working condition .
The plugin allows you to , from within Eclipse , start the JS Test Driver server , capture some browsers , and then run your tests .
You get pretty icons telling you what browsers were captured , the state of the server , the state of the tests .
It allows you to filter and show only failures , rerun your last launch configuration , even setup the paths to your browsers so you can launch it all from the safety of eclipse .
And as you can see , its super fast ..
If thats not fast , I do n’t know what is .
For more details on JS Test Driver , visit its Google Code website and see how you can use it in your next project and even integrate it into a continuous integration .
Misko talks a little bit more about the motivations behind writing it on his Yet Another JS Testing Framework post .
To try out the plugin for yourselves , go add the following update site to eclipse :
For all you IntelliJ fanatics , there is something similar in the works .
The application is already available for a number of smartphones US telecoms giant AT&T has admitted that it struck a deal with Apple to prevent iPhone applications from using its network for VoIP .
VoIP allows voice calls to be routed over mobile internet but reduces a network operator 's voice call revenue .
Apple and AT&T both responded to a federal inquiry into Apple 's failure to approve Google Voice , a VoIP application for the iPhone .
Apple said that the app had not been rejected but is still under review .
In July , Apple rejected Google 's application for the Google Voice app to be sold in its App Store , and removed several third - party applications that employed the same technology .
The app is already available on Blackberrys and phones that run both Google 's Android and the Symbian operating system .
Apple 's move prompted an inquiry from the US 's Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
In AT&T 's response to the FCC , the firm said that " AT&T and Apple agreed that Apple would not take affirmative steps to enable an iPhone to use AT&T 's wireless service ( including 2G , 3G and Wi -Fi ) to make VoIP calls without first obtaining AT&T's consent " .
However , it added that the firms had agreed that " if a third party enables an iPhone to make VoIP calls using AT&T 's wireless service , Apple would have no obligation to take action against that third party " .
AT&T argued that the deal was struck because " both parties required assurances that the revenues from the AT&T voice plans available to iPhone customers would not be reduced by enabling VoIP calling functionality on the iPhone " .
In its letter to the FCC , Apple said that several VoIP applications such as Skype had already been approved for use over wi-fi wireless networks , rather than over the cellular network .
However , it added that the Google Voice app was still under scrutiny because it could " alter the iPhone 's distinctive user experience " , but added that Google Voice could be accessed via the iPhone 's web browser .
In its reply to the FCC inquiry , Google argued that " the Google Voice features accessible by the mobile website are more limited than those features found in the App Store version " .
Those features include direct access to the phone 's contact list , or dialling directly from the application .

Different ways of seeing stats
If a screening test is 90 % accurate , and your result comes back positive , what are the chances it is a false positive , asks Michael Blastland in his regular column .
Browsing the web recently , I found a fascinating article about screening for terrorists and it's made me think about accuracy and uncertainty .
Imagine you 've invented a machine to detect terrorists .
It 's good , about 90 % accurate .
You sit back with pride and think of the terrorists trembling .
Conventional lie-detector or polygraph accuracy has been claimed to be 90 % but this is doubtful .
Most independent experts think it 's more like 60 % - not much better than tossing a coin .
But your invention is the real deal , it really is 90 % accurate .
It 's quick , light , portable and works by detecting patterns of brain activity and facial movement known to match terrorist intent .
You 're in the Houses of Parliament demonstrating the device to MPs when you receive urgent information from MI5 that a potential attacker is in the building .
Security teams seal every exit and all 3,000 people inside are rounded up to be tested .
The first 30 pass .
Then , dramatically , a man in a mac fails .
Police pounce , guns point .
How sure are you that this person is a terrorist ?
A. 90 %
B. 10 %
C. 0.3 % The answer is C , about 0.3 % .
Think about screening all the non-terrorists for innocence - and being wrong about 10 people in every 100
If 3,000 people are tested , and the test is 90 % accurate , it is also 10 % wrong .
So it will probably identify 301 terrorists - about 300 by mistake and 1 correctly .
You wo n't know from the test which is the real terrorist .
So the chance that our man in the mac is the real thing is 1 in 301 .
That a good test can leave us so uncertain about any individual is a head - spinner to many .
The problem is the false positives : tests that say you 've found what you are looking for but are wrong , and which wreak particular havoc with the results when what you are looking for is rare .
That means most of your mistakes apply to those you are not looking for .
Go Figure has been puzzling over how to make all this more intuitive and invites readers to send their own ideas , using the form at the bottom of this page .
Here are a couple of suggestions .
The first is to visualise the numbers .
In the picture below , four pixels = 10,000 people .
The whole area is the population of the United States - about 300 m people .
The dark blue area is roughly how many would be suspected of terrorism by a screening process with 90 % accuracy - about 30 m .
On this scale , the area representing the number who are real terrorists - let 's say 300 people , of whom 30 would be missed - is too small to see on screen so we 've blown up one pixel to show the proportion .
The second suggestion is that whenever we discuss screening , be it of terrorists , HIV , cancer or anything else , we should try to refocus .
Any mention of screening for terrorists causes all our attention immediately to zoom into those who really are terrorists .
We think of the individuals and how a 90 % accurate test would work on one of them .
We zoom into the white area and forget the blue .
Refocus .
Get into the habit of also thinking about screening the light blue area too .
How would this work in practice ?
Whenever we hear what 's being screened for , we should switch it around to think about the opposite .
So , screening for terrorists with 90 % accuracy ?
Think about screening all the non-terrorists for innocence - and being wrong about 10 people in every 100 .
Imagine them all , virtually the whole population , 10 % of whom might become suspects .
Screening for HIV with 99.9 % accuracy ?
Switch it around .
Think also about screening the millions of non-HIV people and being wrong about one person in every 1,000 .
For another , visually - captivating method , try the brilliant animations on the Understanding Uncertainty website - read the first page then click on " testing " - which encourages us to think of real people rather than percentages .
See too data - viz guru Howard Wainer 's discussion of false positives .
• " We do n't know . "
It has become a refrain , the answer to almost every question .
I 'm discussing swine flu with someone who is looking at how it 's spreading .
Based at one of our leading medical institutions , highly experienced and capable , this is someone who might have been expected to know quite a lot .
" We do n't know . "
SWINE FLU SYMPTOMS
If you have a temperature and two or more of the following , it may be swine flu : Cough Sore throat Body aches Chills Fatigue I 'm not asking for clairvoyance , this is not about what will happen in future .
All I want to know - all this researcher wants to know but can't find out - is simple stuff : how many people who had swine flu in the first few months since it emerged are believed to have caught it abroad ?
What proportion of people with reported swine flu have been hospitalised ?
Do they tend to be younger or older ?
How soon after the first symptoms do they start antiviral treatment ?
Someone , somewhere might have a slightly better idea of some of this , but my academic friend , whose job it is to try to understand the illness , is exasperated by the difficulty of finding out the basics .
Statistical models of the spread of disease are never perfect , but they can help .
If they are to be remotely useful , they need some reasonable numbers to start with .
Otherwise , as the old adage has it : rubbish in , rubbish out .
Although there 's a rough total of reported cases , we do n't know how many there have really been , and how often these are serious , because we have little idea how many people have sub-clinical symptoms .
Little idea how many treat themselves without reference to the health service .
Little idea what proportion of the total finish up in hospital .
Little idea how accurate the diagnoses are now that diagnosis is no longer confirmed with a blood test .
The numbers you see quoted in the media are bound to be crude .
How crude , we do n't know .
As so often with data , it is the simple business of counting things and keeping consistent , accurate records that turns out to be where the glitches occur .
That 's just a lot harder than it seems .
Not only do we not know where we are going to be with swine flu in a few months time , we do n't really know where we are .
But there 's also a perverse comfort in some of this .
If there is a huge amount of mild swine flu we do n't know about , the proportion of cases that are serious is correspondingly reduced .

The way I like to explain false positives to people is by what effect it would have on them - for 90 % accuracy it means that everyone could have someone in their immediate family ( parents , children , siblings ) labelled as a terrorist .
Make it personal and people start to really comprehend the problem .

You could try the visualisation method from slide five of this presentation which deals with forecasting extreme rain events .
Of course , if your event is rare enough , the most accurate forecast available will simply be to say " no " every time ( e.g. no - one is a terrorist ) .
More usefully , your forecasting method should be as accurate as the probability of NOT finding the event ( e.g. 90 % accurate is fine for finding something which has a probability of 10 % ) .
Candy Spillard , York , UK Ninety per cent accuracy means that 90 times in 100 , the machine will be correct ABOUT ANY ONE PERSON , 10 times in 100 it will be incorrect .
Jelani Crue , UK
You discuss the problems around using a detection system with a 90 % accuracy .
It should be noted that these problems diminish rapidly if you have a second independent system with a similar level of accuracy , and obviously concentrate on the double positives .
Lawson G , Taunton
Of course in reality you let the MPs , staff , families etc. go home , then just test the people that are left ( the guys in the macs ) .
Just as you do n't subject random members of the public to lie detector tests , nor do OAP nuns seek HIV tests .
Finn , London , UK
The very term 90 % accurate is the sort of thing that might get trumpeted in a media headline but is actually meaningless .
Does this mean it catches 9 out of 10 terrorists ?
Or does it mean it catches 1 out of 10 innocent people ?
You have assumed the latter to make your point , but in real world situations the chance of false positives is not the same as the chance of false negatives .
In fact great effort goes into minimising one and maximising the other .
Did n't you make this point in a very early column , in a medical context ?
It should be made again here .
Ian Nartowicz , Stockport , England Tests used in medicine often have a specificity and sensitivity rather than just " accuracy " ; I think on the whole this is more useful , and reflects the trade - offs inherent in many such tests between being too sensitive ( finding all your terrorists , but picking up a lot of innocent people ) and too specific ( only finding terrorists , but missing a few of them ) .
Matthew , Coventry , UK
The concept of false positive and false negative ( and true positives and negatives ) results from any test is hugely important and needs to be better explained to the general public .
Only then can discussions about e.g. breast cancer screening or any mass testing process can be properly understood .

A corporate identity theft ring that exploited the identities of local corporations , religious institutions , hospitals and even schools to run a cheque fraud scam has been busted in New York .
Investigators reckon the gang of 18 suspects made millions by impersonating workers from an estimated 350 New York - based organisations .
Data purchased from corrupt bank insiders was used to lay the groundwork for the scam , which relied on cashing thousands of counterfeit payroll cheques .
The fraudsters also plundered the bank accounts of individual victims , using data obtained from corrupt bank insiders to transfer funds to banks under the control of the gang .
Mules were recruited as payees on the counterfeit cheques , which were forged using scanners , cheque stock , magnetic ink , company logos and specialist software .
The scam ran between October 2007 and February 2009 .
One bank alone lost $ 1.4 m through the scam .
The gang was led by alleged masterminds Jasper Grayson , 25 , and James Malloy , 26 , according to an indictment unsealed this week .
Renece Razor , a former teller at a JP Morgan Chase Bank branch in Manhattan , Ilaura Walker , a former worker at a TD Bank branch in Manhattan , and Keisha Polonio , a former clerk at an HSBC Bank branch in the Bronx , are all charged with stealing the personal data of identity theft victims before supplying the details to other members of the gang .
Police are investigating the possible involvement of other suspected bank workers in the scam as part of the ongoing investigation . ®
City leaders in Oxford , Ala . have approved the destruction of a 1,500 - year - old Native American ceremonial mound and are using the dirt as fill for a new Sam's Club , a retail warehouse store operated by Wal - Mart .
A University of Alabama archaeology report commissioned by the city found that the site was historically significant as the largest of several ancient stone and earthen mounds throughout the Choccolocco Valley .
But Oxford Mayor Leon Smith -- whose campaign has financial connections to firms involved in the $ 2.6 million no -bid project -- insists the mound is not man-made and was used only to " send smoke signals . "
" The City of Oxford and its archaeological advisers have completed a review and evaluation of a stone mound that was identified near Boiling Springs , Calhoun County , Alabama , and have concluded that the mound is the result of natural phenomena and does not meet the eligibility criteria for the Natural [ sic ] Register of Historic Places , " according to a news release Smith issued last week .
In fact , the report does not conclude the mound is a result of " natural phenomena " but says very clearly it is of " cultural origin . "
And while the University 's Office of Archaeological Research does not believe the site qualifies for the National Register of Historic Places , the Alabama Historical Commission disagrees , noting that the structure meets at least three criteria for inclusion : its " association with a broad pattern of history , " architecture " embodying distinctive characteristics , " and for the information it might yield to scholars .
The site is also significant to Native Americans .
The Woodland and Mississippian cultures that inhabited the Southeast and Midwest before Europeans arrived constructed and used these mounds for various rituals , which may have included funerals .
There are concerns that human remains may be present at the site , though none have been found yet .
United South and Eastern Tribes , a nonprofit coalition of 25 federally recognized tribes from Maine to Texas , passed a resolution in 2007 calling for the preservation of such structures , which it calls " prayer in stone . "
Native Americans have held protests against the mound 's demolition , and last week someone altered a sign for the Leon Smith Parkway that runs past the development to read " Indian Mound Pkwy . "
A local resident named Johnny Rollins told the Anniston Star how his Native American grandmother taught him that when she died he could " go to that mountain " to talk to her :
" It seems like it 's taking part of you away , " he said of the demolition .
" I always felt I had ties to that there . "
Since the media began reporting on the site 's demolition , city officials have revised their story and are now claiming that dirt from the mound is not being used as fill , despite earlier statements to the contrary .
But eyewitnesses say they have seen workers hauling dirt from the mound to the Sam's Club development .
" I mean really , I went there , saw the giant trucks deliver the earth straight from the mound to the construction site , and I still can't believe what they are doing , " writes the seventh - generation Alabamian behind the blog Deep Fried Kudzu .
She shared the photo above showing roads for construction vehicles now cut to the top of the mound and has other photos and her story of visiting the site at the website .
' More prettier ' than an Indian mound
Deepening the development 's controversy is how the contracting has been handled .
The force behind the project is Oxford 's Commercial Development Authority , a public board that uses taxpayer money to lure businesses to the area .
The CDA owns the land where the mound is located .
Alabama law exempts CDAs from bid requirements , which means contracts can go to whomever the board chooses .
A recent Anniston Star investigative series about the CDA revealed among other things that the group has awarded nearly $ 9 million in contracts since 1994 but has taken bids for none of them .
The newspaper also detailed the financial ties between the CDA , firms it does business with , and Mayor Smith 's political campaign .
For example , the $ 2.6 million contract for preparing the Sam's Club site went to Oxford - based Taylor Corp. , with the money for that coming in part from the sale of city property to Georgia - based developers Abernathy and Timberlake .
Taylor Corp. owner Tommy Taylor , who has received thousands of dollars in city contracts for non-CDA work , donated $ 1,000 to Smith in 2004 and $ 1,000 in 2008 , while Abernathy and Timberlake donated $ 1,000 to Smith 's re-election campaign in 2004 , the paper reports .
The Anniston Star also found that the CDA paid engineering firm Goodwyn , Mills and Cawood of Montgomery , Ala .
$ 45,000 in engineering contracts for the Sam's Club project , with part of that money paying for the archaeological study .
The firm contributed $ 500 to Smith in 2004 .
An Alabama Ethics Commission official said the relationships could violate state law " depending on facts , " but the mayor said he 's done nothing wrong .
Meanwhile , the controversy over the damaged mound 's fate rages on .
After getting an earful from alarmed preservationists , Alabama Gov. Bob Riley ( R ) forwarded their concerns to the state Historical Commission -- but said his office has no intention of getting involved .
According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics , Tommy Taylor contributed $ 1,000 to Riley 's 2006 gubernatorial campaign , while Goodwyn , Mills and Cawood contributed $ 1,500 .
For now , it appears Oxford officials are pressing ahead with the project .
As Mayor Smith said in its defense , " What it 's going to be is more prettier than it is today . "
Town - hall meetings .
A great American tradition !
Too bad it is n’t being followed .
What was once a way of connecting with those that represent us to our government , has now become a mob scene highlighted by angry protesters with no desire at all to hear facts or for that matter to allow opposing views to be heard .
The issue Du Jour is healthcare .
Or is it ?
More and more it looks as if the issue to these people is Barack Obama himself .
They simply can't accept him as president .
A great deal of disinformation is being pushed , mainly from talk radio that the bill being constructed in congress provides for ; among other things , the promotion of euthanasia .
In other words , this is all about killing your grandpa or grandma .
After all , they ’re old and had their turn at life .
It ’s time they got out of the way so we can provide health care to those with more time left .
The fact of the matter is that the new healthcare bill provides coverage for those people that want to see a doctor for advice on end of life care , and the preparation of a living will .
And how is this being spun ?
A government bureaucrat will be coming to your door periodically telling you that it ’s time for you to go and that the euthanasia center will be glad to set up an appointment for you .
When would you like to go ?
I ’m sure they can squeeze you in next week .
How about Tuesday ?
Say ....10 AM ?
This is the world of the " deathers " .
You ’ve heard of the " birthers " ?
Those are the people that ca n’t accept that we have a black president and that he must have been born in Kenya .
58 % of those that do n’t believe that Barack Obama was born in the United States just happen to live in the South .
A recent poll says that 74 % of Republicans in North Carolina do n't believe he was born here .
Imagine that !
They BELIEVE that he was born in Kenya , because they ’ve seen the forged birth certificate that say ’s so , and once they believe something , well , you are n’t likely to get them to question their beliefs regardless of all the factual evidence to the contrary .
Now we have the " deathers " .
They believe that the government wants to throw granny from the train .
And who is ginning up this fear and hatred ?
Well , there is a very strong profit motive in this healthcare issue that is at stake .
United Healthcare , which happens to be my very own insurance provider , is spending $ 12.6 million to defeat this measure .
Stephen Hemsley , the CEO for United Health Group received 13.2 million in 2007 .
$ 3.25 million in 2008 .
The total value of his unexercised stock options comes to $ 744,232,068 .
In 2009 Hemsley exercised $ 127,001,281 .
Mr. Hemsley is clearly a billionaire , and I ’m sure his healthcare comes at no cost to him .
It ’s likely part of his compensation package .
There is obviously a financial incentive to deny people payment for needed medical care .
With United Health , there is a deductable which varies with each plan .
That will depend on the plan your employer is using .
The less they have to pay out , the greater the profit .
The Minnetonka , Minnesota - based company reported second quarter net income of $ 859 million , or 73 cents per share , compared with only $ 337 million , or 27 cents per share , in the year - ago period .
Last year ’s results included a pretax charge of $ 922 million , or 47 cents per share , however .
That ’s a 155 % profit !
Revenue jumped 7 % in the latest quarter to $ 21.66 billion from $ 20.27 billion , helped by higher premiums and price increases .
My premiums went up .
They will continue to go up .
So will yours .
The more profitable his company is , the more money Mr. Hemsley receives for making it so profitable .
My own representative has received $ 3.3 million in campaign contributions from the Finance , Insurance , and Real Estate lobbies .
He is n't representing me .
He 's a paid representative of the insurance companies .
Frankly , I ’d like to be able to have the option of taking the profit motive out of my health needs .
The idea of somebody making tons of money off of my or anyone else ’s illness is repugnant to me .
It kind of makes me think of a vampire sucking your blood for his own benefit .
Does this make me a socialist ?
If you do n’t like vampires , you ’re a socialist ?
According to Rush Limbaugh , it ’s worse than that .
It makes me the equivalent of a Nazi .
A woman protesting Democratic plans for health care reform was captured on camera holding up a sign of a Swastika , with the president 's name below it , encircled and crossed out by a red line .
The implication is that Obama is a Nazi .
Where did she get this idea ?
Real people suffered unspeakable horrors under the Nazi regime .
Comparing Obama to Hitler and the Healthcare bill to the Holocaust is insane .
It completely diminishes what was done to people under the Third Reich .
The AFL - CIO is now planning on sending out their people to counter the demonstrators at the town - hall meetings .
In New Hampshire where the president was speaking , a man went to a town hall meeting with a loaded gun strapped to his leg .
What happens when these emotionally charged opponents come face to face ?
I can only hope that if you ’re planning on attending one of these town –hall meetings , that you have a good health care plan
My new Democratic congressman , who barely bested an entrenched Republican , has disappointed .
Rep. Eric Massa , NY - 29 , has parted with his most cherished , pre-election promise .
He has gained power ; now , like all members of Congress , he wishes to keep it .
Now he ’ll take the “ tainted ” money other politicians do and fabricate a specious reason for doing so .
Flip , from 2007 :
I promise that when I am elected to Congress , I will always put the American public above everything else .
Unlike 99.9 % of Congressional Candidates , I have never accepted a single cent of Corporate PAC money … [ emphasis added ]
Flip , from 2007 :
I believe if you ’re going to talk about campaign finance reform , you have to be willing to do it to prove your point .
And I did and I would not be able to look myself in the mirror if I took money from ExxonMobil .
My opponent gets over 70 % of his money from PACs …
Of all the issues we face , the core issue has to be campaign finance reform because nothing will change til we get the Board Room out of the voting booth .
[ emphasis added ]
Flop , from 2009 :
I ’m not going to go to the working families of the 29th Congressional District and ask them to fund a congressional campaign when my opponents are n’t willing to do the same thing .
I believe in playing on a level playing field [ emphasis added ] .
Rep . Massa argues that he must accept corporate PAC money because the GOP does .
He hides behind the “ level playing field ” argument .
Why now ?
He beat the GOP incumbent without it .
His only announced Republican opponent , Corning Mayor Tom Reed , has yet to be offered serious money from the National Republican Congressional Committee — which heavily funded the incumbent he defeated .
Rep . Massa knows the GOP wants this seat back .
He wants a fat war chest and he wants it fast to deter any serious GOP challengers ( and , perhaps , a Democratic primary one ) .
That ’s what incumbents do .
That reflects his swift , dramatic shift from principled challenger to Beltway insider .
To disguise this , he suggests he does not want to return to hitting up district voters who are hard - pressed economically , “ the working families , ” as he labels them .
But that argument is disingenuous .
He did n’t depend heavily on the “ suffering middle class , ” those he now says he wishes to protect from being dunned for contributions .
Federal Election Commission records , aggregated by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics , show that Rep. Massa raised $ 2,151,657 for the 2008 election cycle , $ 600,000 more than the GOP incumbent .
He did not rely as heavily as he claims on the “ suffering middle - class ” district residents :
His top 29 contributors gave him nearly $ 680,000 .
And ActBlue contributed nearly half of that .
The list of these 29 contributors is dominated by labor unions ponying up $ 10,000 each .
Sliced another way — by industry totals — $ 1,292,621 of his total $ 2.1 million came from the usual suspects of campaign finance : Democratic and liberal organizations ; leadership PACs ; retired individuals ; other candidate committees , lawyers and law firms ; industrial , building trade , public sector and transportation unions ; the securities and investments community ; real estate and health professionals ; and others .
As of the June 30 FEC quarterly filing deadline , Rep. Massa has raised $ 515,119 for the 2010 election cycle .
More than half — $ 284,975 — has come from PAC contributions .
His leading contributor is , again , ActBlue , with $ 73,000 .
The list of top industries for 2010 is similar to that for 2008 .
Those industries have given $ 310,772 so far .
Rep .
Massa will need much more than the $ 2.1 million he raised for 2008 .
The national GOP wants that seat .
And 2010 will be the year that New York state loses one seat in the House due to redistricting .
Rural districts like the 29th are always convenient targets to be cut .
If the 29th gets whacked , he ’d have to run against , perhaps , longer - term New York congressional incumbents .
Perhaps that influenced his change of financial heart .
Rep . Massa has said that he would not take corporate PAC money from harmful interests , such as cigarettes and Big Oil .
Perhaps he ’ll post a clear definition of “ harmful ” on his re-election website — if and when he announces for 2010 .
Congress is taking a vacation from its hard work of fixing health care ( yes , sarcasm intended ) .
All the members are town - halling like mad , trying to divine the will of the electorate .
Which Rep. Massa will tour District 29 this month ?
This one , from June 2007 :
I believe that we also need to address the problem of lobbyists in Washington , and as such , I do not accept Corporate PAC money .
Thus I am reaching out to all of you to support my grassroots campaign .
I am asking for 1000 people to step up and donate $ 100 to my campaign so we can tackle the issue of global warming in Washington .
I need you to join me .
Together , we can change the world .
Or this one , from February 2009 :
[ GOP critics ] want to attack me for taking legitimate political action money that they are taking 10 times more of .
I do n’t quite get why the pot is calling the kettle black .

Walmart is adding five more stores to its solar - energy pilot program - but not because management 's turned into a bunch of tree - hugging Arkansas hippies .
The megastore multinational is going green for the sake of green - money , that is .
The five latest stores in Walmart 's pilot program , which now totals 20 stores , Sam ’s Clubs , and distribution centers in Hawaii and California , will all be located in sunny Puerto Rico .
Their solar installations will be provided by SunEdison , described by Walmart as being " North America ’s largest solar energy services provider . "
Walmart , however , wo n't be buying the solar systems from SunEdison .
Instead , that panel punter will finance , own , build , and operate them itself , and sell the generated juice to Walmart .
The systems will provide the stores with 25 to 35 per cent of their electrical needs , and are projected to produce 90 million kWh of power over the 15 - year life of the project .
Walmart is dead serious about solar power , stating in their most recent Solar Power Fact Sheet that " our goal [ is ] 100 percent renewable energy . "
The company 's current 20 installations are expected to produce 16 to 18 million kWh this year - and there are more to come .
This April , Walmart forged a deal with BP Solar to install panels on an additional 10 to 20 Walmart facilities in California by 2011 , which the company says will generate between 8 and 16 million kWh annually .
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency 's calculations , this expansion will prevent more than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from mucking up the atmosphere each year .
Those are hefty numbers , but they 're a mere drop in the proverbial bucket compared to what Walmart might eventually achieve .
Jason Mick over at DailyTech estimates that if Walmart were to solarize all of its facilities , the resulting installations would total 35 square miles of panels that would produce a cool three gigawatts of power .
However , while Walmart 's dedication to solar power may seem impressive , the EPA ranks them only 15th among the US 's top 25 green corporations .
At the top of that list is Intel , which buys offset credits equivalent to 1.3 billion kWh , or 46 per cent of its total power needs .
Will Swope , Intel 's VP for corporate sustainability , told Scientific American that Intel shareholders support the offset - credit program .
" Economics have shown , " he says , " that companies that maintain a more sustainable footprint have done better - even in economic meltdown - than those that do n't . "
Intel , by the way , is also spending a chunk of its cash reserves on green tech .
At this Wednesday 's Technology Summit in San Francisco , Steve Eichenlaub of the company 's Intel Capital investment group announced investments in five " cleantech " companies .
Eichenlaub also described the group 's cleantech focus as " meant to embrace how Intel has appreciated how what we do from a technology , architecture , and solutions standpoint can have a major role in making the policy , the efforts of the industry , and enabling new business models to address issues such as global warming . "
Make no mistake , however - neither Walmart , Intel , nor any of the other companies in the top - 25 list are moving to sustainable energy or investing in cleantech out of the goodness of their corporate hearts .
They 're doing so either to save money - Walmart - or to make money - Intel .
Some of those green greenbacks will be realized immediately , and some down the road .
Intel 's strategic cleantech investments , for example , are helping build an industry that will require massive IT investments - investments that will help fatten Intel 's bottom line .
Intel thus benefits doubly : on a pure cash basis when they buy into a company early and then sell their stake when its value rises , and on an indirect basis when its entire cleantech portfolio births an industry sector with a ravenous hunger for compute power .
Walmart 's benefits are more immediate .
The company 's energy director , David Ozment , recently told USA Today that Walmart was already enjoying " moderate savings " in its pilot projects , paying less than or equal to market - rate prices for its solar juice .
And those savings are coming at a time when energy costs are depressed due to the Meltdown and other factors .
When utility costs rise - as most observes believe they will - Walmart will be sitting pretty . ®

Monetary policy is important because it has an immense impact on financing conditions in the economy .
It influences prices , the availability of credit , bank ’s willingness to assume risk , inflationary expectations and ultimately consumption and investment .
The People ’s Bank of China , China ’s central bank , has committed to the “ moderately loose ” monetary policy that has helped the economy recover from the global economic slump .
Over the next two quarters , the central bank will pay attention to the increase in domestic asset prices and inflation expectation by fine - tuning its monetary policy , according to a recent article by Zhang Xiaohui , the director or the PBOC ’s monetary policy .
In its quarterly monetary policy report , the PBOC said , “ In the period ahead , the People ’s Bank of China ( PBOC ) will unswervingly implement the appropriately loose monetary policy while fine - tuning policy with market - oriented tools in line with economic changes at home and abroad . ”
Liu Yuhui , the director of the Center for Chinese Economic Evaluation at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences told China Daily that the bank has already initiated some micro-tightening measures like open market operations .
In addition , China ’s top banking regulator urged lenders to limit lending and focus on strengthening the credit markets instead .
When the central government wants to tighten monetary policy it tries to absorb excessive liquidity .
The bank is currently selling more bills to mop up cash , since M2 , the broadest measure of money supply rose a record 28.5 percent in June 2009 compared to a year earlier .
Furthermore , the central bank has kept interest rates and reserve requirements for banks unchanged this year after cutting them at the end of 2008 to combat the global credit crisis .
These actions hint that stricter monetary policy is on its way , causing investors to worry .
The expectation of higher borrowing costs will result in lower investment activity and lower purchase of consumer durables .
The Effect on Consumers and Investment :
Tighter monetary policy means that the cost of borrowing will increase .
Recently , China ’s central bank decided to keep its interest rate at the same level after slashing interest rates at the end of 2008 .
China cut its interest rate from 6.66 % in October 2008 to 5.31 % in December 2008 .
Since then it has remained at the same level .
The bank ’s decision to keep interest rates at 5.31 % for the time being is a way the central bank is moderating its loose monetary policy and transitioning to a tighter monetary policy to support the economy as it recovers .
Investors and consumers are worried about the effect a tighter monetary policy will have on the economic recovery .
Interest rates may affect consumer spending .
When interest rates are higher , consumers will spend less and save more , weakening demand in the short run .
They will want to spend less on illiquid assets when their financial situation worsens and thus invest less in consumer durables , such as cars , business equipment , etc .
Weak demand is a threat to any recovering economy .
A contraction in the money supply by the central bank is achieved through an increase in short - term market rates through interest rates .
As a result , the real interest rate and capital costs increase , which decrease investment .
Tight monetary policy will reduce banks ’ assets either directly or indirectly , by limiting credit creation when tighter reserve requirements are imposed .
This will lead to reduction in loans , thus in investment .
Consumers are worried that central banks will increase the reserve ratio , according to Wang Zheng , a fund manager at Jingxi Investment Management Co .
The increase in reserve ratio will influence commercial banks ’ refinancing cots .
If finance costs increase ( as they will with higher interest rates ) banks will pass on the costs to consumers and investors ( borrowers ) which will discourage many from borrowing and thus decrease investment and consumer spending .
Also , an increase in interest rates may increase the risk that some borrowers cannot pay back their loans .
Banks might become reluctant to give out more loans to those borrowers ( consumers or investors ) and they will be forced to cut back on planned expenditures .
“ In the first half , we had excessively loose monetary policy and now , in the second half , we ’re moving into appropriately loose monetary policy , ” Zuo Xiaolei , Galaxy Securities Co. chief economist said Xiaolei added “ The central bank is doing the right thing , ” Xiaolei said , without specifying how it may tighten policy .
“ China needs stable economic growth .
China does n’t need big ups and downs . ”
The PBOC has already begun absorbing excessive liquidity through open market operations in order to ease inflationary threats .
By withdrawing money from circulation and raising the cost of financing .
In Wednesday , August 5th , the central bank released a report where they promised to “ use market oriented methods to carry out dynamic fine - tuning taking into consideration domestic and international economic conditions and price changes ” .
“ As the recovery becomes more solid in the third quarter , we expect an orderly winding down of stimulus policies beginning in the fourth quarter or early next year .
The key move will be the first hike in the reserve requirement , ” said a report from Standard Chartered Bank .
While investors and consumers worry , others , like strategist Jerry Lou , from Hong Kong thinks the government may not go in for a tight monetary policy yet .
“ We assume there would be two rate increases in the second half of 2010 , ” he said .
First of all , you 're welcome .
I had to jump through some serious douche hoops to earn this organization 's trust and I even put my precious gmail at risk to get a firsthand look .
But I did it all for you .
My loves .
So you know how MySpace has that weird part in the profile where you can say how much you make in a year ?
And since kids and bands do n't have real jobs everyone ironically puts " Over $ 200,000 , " right ?
Some guy took that one metric really seriously and decided to make that the sole basis for his very own social circle jerk known as
This place has it all , motherfuckers .
Networking , little desserts , front desk bells , more networking ... fuck .
These are all things I want .
I know you 're jealous but I 'm gonna be blunt :
You need $ 3 million to join this elite team .
See .
Oh , I applied for free all right .
But not as regular Patrick Fitzgerald Hosmer .
I'm a Master of Internet Disguise so I breezed right past the virtual velvet rope as my rich - as - fuck alter ego , John Money .
You think John Money the Billionaire is scared of an online form ?
Btch Plz .
Seeing the word Billion in a drop - down menu is really weird .
Drop - downs are so middle - class .
But it was n't that easy .
Affluence.org had a few tricks up its French - cuffed sleeves .
They started off easy with the bio stuff and then they dropped these on me to see if I was for real .
Thank you , Pirates of the Caribbean .
Thank you , Streetboners .
Thank you , my actual Bourgeois taste .
And that was basically it .
I passed the test and now I have all this at my disposal :
Wait , what ?
Who wrote this , MySpace ?
Do they think rich people do n't read ?
" Receive access to the hottest new trends ? "
Like what , Digimons or some shit ?
Headbands ?
We 're top of the food chain , baby , I make the trends .
I e-mail you and say , " Pod Racing .
Tai Chi. Vampire Baseball .
Make that bitch a trend . "
Fax it around the world .
I am John Money .
The Wallstreet Journal wrote this about Affluence.org :
The problem with Diamond Lounge , A Small World and other " elite " social - networking sites is that they tout themselves as high end but can't verify people 's wealth or income .
Inevitably , the online riff - raff spoil the party of the elites .
Riff - Raff , Street Rats .
Sultans Only !
TechCrunch had this to say :
Affluence is the latest company to take a crack at building a community site exclusively for the rich and famous among us instead of the petty riff - raff that make up the bulk of internet users .
JESUS .
It 's like all the non-millionaires became thieving vagrants just loitering about .
Listen , I share my stolen bread loaves with little kids , asshole .
Oh wait , no I do n't .
I 'm John Money , Goldmeister .
In Robert Frank 's interview with Affluence founder Scott Mitchell , this was said :
Robert Frank :
How can you really determine someone 's income or net worth ?
Scott Mitchell :
We have algorithms developed where we go out to public - record providers like Axiom , Equifax and others .
We 'll enter the first and last name of the applicant , their birthdates and state they live in .
We 'll get records back on what they might be worth and what the applicant has said they are worth in marketing surveys .
RF : But people lie on those marketing surveys all the time .
Are there other backstops ?
SM : Sure .
Equifax can give us things like income - generating assets , checks on liens and litigation and tell us how much their home is worth .
Using those records we come up with a " confidence coefficient , " which tells us how likely it is that your net worth matches your application .
We also use a service called Intelius that tells us how much your home may be worth given your neighborhood or what you paid for it .
Thank goodness John Money is an actual guy with real estate in his name ( ?? ) .
Liars .
Wanna see my Affluence.org Wall ?
They call it a " Mantle . "
It 's totes cutesies , guys .
RF : How did you get the idea to start the site ?
SM : When I sold my internet business ( Tunes. Com ) for $ 180 million in 2000 , I had what you might call sudden wealth syndrome .
Despite our wealth , my wife and I thought Olive Garden was Italian cuisine 's panacea .
We thought Apple vacations was how you book travel .
We did n't have friends who could recommend travel to the French Riviera .
It took me years to build up that network .
So the site was created to give people a network of other wealthy people who are facing the same unique decisions and challenges every day .
One Million Strong for Sudden Wealth Syndrome .
If you wanna live like I 'm living , all you gotta do is tell these clowns what your home is worth .
If you 're too good for that , well , sorry buster .
The view 's mighty fine from over here , though !
Being rich on the Internet is extremely pointless .
David Broder has a column this morning calling for bipartisanship .
I know , you ’re shocked .
But what struck me was this bit about Al Franken :
Franken , the loud - mouthed former comedian , will be the 60th member of the Senate Democratic caucus …
Two points .
First , implicit in this characterization of Franken is the notion of the Senate as a decorous gentlemen ’s club .
I doubt that club ever existed in reality ; but in any case , these days the World ’s Greatest Deliberative Body is , not to put too fine a point on it , chock full o’ nuts .
James Inhofe : I rest my case .
Second , Al Franken ’s dirty secret is that … he ’s a big policy wonk .
I used to go on Franken ’s radio show , all ready to be jocular — and what he wanted to talk about was the arithmetic of Social Security , or the structure of Medicare Part D .
In fact , the only elected official I know who ’s wonkier than Al Franken is Rush Holt , my congressman — and he used to be the assistant director of Princeton ’s plasma physics lab .
( The campaign ’s bumper stickers read , “ My Congressman IS a rocket scientist . ” )
So what will Franken do to the level of Senate discourse ?
He ’ll raise it .
When a spiffy , $ 621 - million visitors center opened at the U.S. Capitol last year , a number of lawmakers were taken aback by what they did n’t see : the words “ In God We Trust . ”
Doing what members of Congress do when they ’re upset , Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - Gold River ) introduced legislation to get the words , along with the Pledge of Allegiance , etched into the walls of the complex .
But the effort has drawn a legal challenge from the Freedom From Religion Foundation , which asserts that such an action would amount to a government endorsement of religion -- in violation of the Constitution .
The Wisconsin - based group describes itself as a national organization of atheists and agnostics .
Rep. J. Randy Forbes ( R - Va. ) , founder of the Congressional Prayer Caucus , condemned the lawsuit as an effort to “ silence our nation ’s history . ”

“ I ’m never surprised anymore by any lawsuit , ” said Lungren , a former California attorney general .
“ I will say that I was surprised that they would suggest that the national motto or the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional .
. . .
I think the historical significance is well established . ”
It is the latest row over the place of God in federal government .
In 2002 , Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law a bill reaffirming references to God in the pledge and the motto after the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found the pledge ’s “ under God ” phrase to be in violation of the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state .
And in 2007 , the architect of the Capitol caused a furor when he balked at a teen ’s request for a certificate noting his grandfather ’s “ love of God , country and family ” to accompany a souvenir flag that had flown over the building .

Even before the visitors center was finished , lawmakers raised objections to the omission of “ In God We Trust , ” noting in a letter to the architect of the Capitol : “ None of us should want to construct a $ 621 - million shrine to political correctness that does not accurately reflect a significant part of American history . ”
Rep. Jo Bonner ( R - Ala . ) complained that a replica of the House chamber in the visitors center omitted the motto , even though “ In God We Trust ” is inscribed above the speaker ’s rostrum in the real chamber .
The words were added to the replica , but a number of lawmakers said they should appear more prominently elsewhere in the center .
Lungren introduced a resolution to make that happen , and all but 10 House members supported it .
Rep. Michael M. Honda ( D - San Jose ) , one of eight lawmakers who voted no ( two others voted “ present ” ) , said : “ To preference , on federal property , the words of one religion over another subtly serves to undermine our great nation ’s religious freedom and diversity and contravene our Constitution ’s principle of separation of church and state . ”
Advertisement
Also voting no was Rep. Pete Stark ( D - Fremont ) , who has said that he does not believe in a supreme being .
“ As our nation ’s founders did , I support separation of church and state , ” he said .
The addition of the words to the visitors center could cost as much as $ 100,000 .

When a business decides to outsource , it is looking for a solution .
It has a pressing project but lacks the internal resources to do it itself .
Chances are , some poor marketing director has walked out of a boardroom meeting , faced with a recurring problem : the deadline has been set , the work laid out in front of him and he has no way to get it done .
At this point , our poor marketing manager does n’t want to spend hours searching the Internet for the right web designer , review another pile of résumés for the perfect copywriter and plow through stacks of portfolios for a graphic designer …
In this article we ’ll review 5 useful tips that you can use to harness the power of partnering .
Our marketing director wants to pick up the phone , find a solution and put his mind at ease .
As the independent freelancer , you want to be the guy at the other end of the phone .
Solve the marketing manager ’s problem this time , and chances are he ’ll call you again .
But how can you be sure he chooses you for the job ?
Odds are you ca n’t do everything .
You ’ve spent years honing your skills as a graphic designer , and the last thing you want to do is write web copy .
The same goes for the copywriter , who does n’t want to waste time struggling with HTML code .
1. Be the Solution
Even though you ca n’t do it all , you can provide a complete solution by partnering with others to fill in the blanks .
For example , a web designer who partners with a copywriter can offer a turnkey solution that moves a website from initial concept to finished product .
When providing a turnkey service , you suddenly make the jump from “ freelancer ” to “ consultant ” .
You are no longer providing a service , but rather are providing a solution .
The more problems you solve , the easier you will find work and , ultimately , the higher your fee will be .
2. The Process in Action
Let ’s suppose our marketing director suddenly finds out he needs a website for a new product launch .
He ’ll need artwork , web design and compelling copy to sell the product .
Unfortunately , due to a recent “ corporate restructuring ” , he has no in - house staff to turn to in order to get the job done .
He picks up the phone and calls a local web designer , who tells him he’d be glad to take on the project , but that he ca n’t help with the logo ’s design and that the marketing manager will need to provide the copy .
Sure , our marketing manager has solved part of his problem , but he still has his work cut out for him .
So he calls a second web designer and describes the project .
The web designer tells him that he ’d be glad to help .
He asks the marketing manager if he needs web copy and graphics .
When he says that he does , he replies , “ No problem .
I partner with a number of graphic designers and copywriters .
If you ’d like , I can contact them and put together a bid for the entire project .
When we ’re finished , you ’ll have a complete website , ready for your product launch . ”
Who do you think will get the job ?
At this point , the second designer is in control and in a position to make a much higher bid .
3. Form Partnerships Now
Do n’t wait until you need partners to seek them out .
Otherwise , you ’ll be in the same position as the first web designer .
Instead , seek them out in advance .
Determine who you can trust , who you can afford and who will help you deliver the best product possible .
Even more importantly , be sure you are comfortable working with these partners .
As you look for partners , ask yourself some basic questions .
Is this person reliable ?
Will he or she respond to the client ’s needs or fight every edit and revision ?
Does this person complement my services ?
Do we communicate well ?
Can I rely on him or her to meet deadlines ?
Ascertaining these details in advance will help prevent many headaches when working with clients .
4. The Win-Win- Win Situation
Ideally , a partnership creates a mutually beneficial relationship .
For example , if a copywriter were to form a partnership with a web designer , he now solves a problem for the web designer .
The web designer wants her websites to look as good as possible , which is difficult if clients provide poor copy .
Thanks to this new partnership , our web designer can use the copywriter ’s services to improve the client ’s copy .
The copywriter picks up a new client , the web designer delivers a better product and the client gets a much better website with little or no extra effort .
A win - win - win situation for all .
5. Be Everything You Want in a Partner
When you work with a partner , consider it like working for a client : do your best work every time .
Provide the level of service you would want to receive , and chances are you ’ll be working with them again .
Provide a “ solution ” for your partner , and that partner will return again .
Do that often enough and work will start seeking you out , rather than the other way around .

Dick Cheney rolls in his grave /
Of course , he 's not actually dead .
He just wishes you were
Did you feel that ?
That sickly sort of rolling wave , that disquieting , genital - shriveling temblor of seething grumpiness that swept through the land and made dogs spasm , trees shudder and giant SUVs spit oil and misfire ?
You might 've missed it .
It happened just after Bill Clinton returned from his rather astonishing rescue mission to North Korea , two exhausted , grateful , grinning , tearful young American female journalists in tow , Al Gore standing by with a giant smile and President Obama and much of his administration off in the wings , nodding approvingly , as the entire nation found itself a bit dumbfounded at the calm and rather effortless brand of new , intelligent , humble , hugely effective humanitarian patriotism on display here .
The churning , teeth - grinding rumble of disquiet ?
It was coming , of course , from Dick Cheney .
( Author note : From here on out , the phrase " Dick Cheney " shall hereby refer not merely to the former vice - president himself , but also to the sour , clenched worldview he so perfectly encapsulated and still so lovingly represents .
Dick Cheney is a lexical wonder .
He can be a violent action verb : " Dude I just Dick Cheney'd that squirrel with my F - 150 . "
He is a dark intention : " Let 's pull a Dick Cheney on that queer kid in the locker room . "
He is , most of all , a state of being , a mindset , a fixed position of general disgust .
" Sorry lady , I can't save you from this burning building .
I 'm far too Dick Cheney to give a damn . "
Clear ?
Excellent .
Let 's continue ) .
See , I 'm guessing Dick Cheney the man / mindset was none too pleased at the recent turn of news events .
I imagine Dick to be right now re-watching the various video clips of the North Korea fiasco , scowling deeply at the silly / surreal photos of Clinton seated next to -- and towering over -- little Kim Jong
Il , the former a natural statesman and the latter trying like hell not to look like some sort of scruffy hunk of semicomatose lint .
Dick is right now hurling his razor - filled oatmeal at the TV screen , wondering just what the hell happened to the true - blooded , trigger - happy , America - as - a - clenched - fist country he worked so hard to devolve and decimate and turn into a giant itchy shotgun .
Sending a former president to talk with this pipsqueak terrorist ?
Giving a nuke - happy dictator a face - saving photo op on the NYT ?
Dick despises every goddamn liberal hippie second of it .
See , what Dick would 've done is , Dick would 've marched right in to Pyongyang -- or rather , let some unlucky Marines march over there -- with a few nukes , about 50 tons of C4 and a squadron of fighters , and shown that wobbly pipsqueak tyrant the what what .
Oh sure , an insane , intractable pseudo war with a destitute , pathetic country like North Korea would 've been a disaster in roughly 1,000 ways .
Who the hell cares ?
Dick would 've made a fortune .
He and his hawk buddies would 've never let America look so weak in the eyes of dismal tyrants the world over as Obama and Clinton just did -- no matter how well it worked , no matter that it might lead to renewed talks about shutting down N. Korea 's nuke program , no matter that the two reporters are now home safe and happy , and it did n't cost the U.S. hundreds of billions , waste soldiers lives and earn us the hate and disrespect of the planet .
Dick wants none of that crap .
Former U.N. Ambassador and noted hunk of anger meat John Bolton was quick to parrot the Cheney worldview in a hissing little Op - Ed in the Washington Post , saying the entire rescue reeked of American wimpiness , of dangerous , kowtowing diplomacy , when what we should be doing is saber rattling and making macho threats and maybe bombing a few hundred thousand innocent civilians to death to make some sort of point .
Hey , it worked in Iraq !
Oh wait .
Dick Cheney reminds us of one thing : this is a perfect moment to reflect .
It is a moment to pause , take a look around and offer a giant heap of gratitude and a huge dose of awe for just what it is that Barack Obama hath wrought .
It is a moment , mainly , to compare governing styles , dominant political attitudes , the directions and worldviews of two very , very different Americas :
The one Dick so brutally represented and drove like an ice pick so deeply into the national heart , and the one President Obama is now working to unravel , redirect , heal .
The difference is staggering .
See , right now the kill - ' em - all - and - let - God - sort - 'em - out crowd is utterly disgusted that President Obama clearly has zero qualms about taking a notch or five out of bedpost of American machismo bulls - -t , about swiping the cancer stick from the mouth of the long dead Marlboro Man and replacing it with something like integrity , calm words of wisdom , tact .
To the Cheney metaverse , this is a disgusting and shameful way to do America 's business .
With the North Korea situation , we did n't come out looking like sweaty , bulbous titans .
There was no red - faced screaming , no flag - draped caskets .
Most of all , America did n't get to thump its chest .
And if America can't thump its chest and pull out the biggest gun and let the world know who 's still boss , well , America has no power whatsoever .
Who the hell wants to be known for demonstrating peaceful , effective humanitarianism and calm diplomacy , and saving human lives if it makes us look like a bunch of weak - kneed pansies ?
Where is the glory ?
Where 's the firepower ?
Image is everything .
Strut the plumage .
Carry the biggest stick .
In Cheneyland , sneering intimidation is not only useful , it 's vital .
There is nothing else .
Or maybe not .
Maybe the Obama Way is already turning out to be far more effective , more subtle and intriguing , and much more in America 's favor , as tyrannical psychopaths like Kim Jong
Il are stupefied into compliance by even the pretense of being taken seriously by the Great Satan , and sane world leaders across the globe finally see a country they can deal with intelligently on pressing matters instead of merely joining them at the gun range to blast stuff to hell .
You might say Dick is not pleased .
In fact , Dick Cheney -- and the entire hawkish , antagonistic worldview he embodies -- is downright furious at this country 's dangerous new direction .
Which , in its way , just might be the best news I 've heard all year .

A person with IA - KRaTTe nickname came into our IRC Channel today and told us a really disturbing story .
Read this to find out more :
“ Gifting Company of Heroes to an United States citizen leads to language problems and even after my friend from the USA made a Steam Support ticket , they refuse to change his Company of Heroes to English language .
Why the hell do I gift a game to a friend in USA when he can’t play it in his language ?
Why does Steam Support refuse to change the game into his language ?
I ’m from Germany .
The German version , like the US , does not have Swastikas , nor is the gore cut .
It is the SAME damn thing , except that everything is written and voiced in German .
So , now what ?
My American friend is stuck with a German version of the basic Company of Heroes , and I bought it during the Weekend Deal .
There go my 5 Euros .
He ca n’t use the game because it ’s in the wrong language and Steam Support does n’t want to change the language for a reason that does n’t make sense at all .
My friend wrote me this over Steam :
Unfortunately , due to German federal law , German accounts can only buy games in the German language as gifts .
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS ?!
WHY IS THERE NO WARNING .
Because of THIS I cannot play Company of Heroes with him . ”
What do you guys think ?
Is this really the German law ?
Or is Valve just being too cautious ?

SOMETHING NEW .
EVERY DAY .

Gail Collins : David , your writing on health care has been incredibly thoughtful , so I ’m going to take this opportunity to poke you a little .
Then I ’ll shut up so you can talk .
The other week I said I agreed with you about the critical importance of cost controls .
Then I asked — O.K. , I sort of demanded — that you denounce the Republican leaders in the Senate who were flinging around proposals to make it illegal to investigate cost controls at all .
You basically said that was a stupid thing to do , but that the Republicans were n’t really the problem since they are n’t in charge .
A single - payer system would be far and away the most cost effective answer .
But actually , they are .
And so are we .
The reason the country can’t solve the health care mess is because the people with the biggest bullhorns do n’t speak honestly and clearly about it .
Nobody understands the Democratic plan , and that scares the public .
The irresponsible Republicans are just waiting to make whatever comes out sound terrible .
The responsible Republicans are working to come up with a compromise that ’s going to be even more incoherent than the Democratic version .
My version of reality is that :
A. )
Since something like a third of the cost of health care is in administration , and the problem with reorganizing health care has to do with all the multitudinous plans and policies , a single - payer system would be far and away the most cost effective answer .
We do n’t talk much about it because it is n’t politically possible .
But it is n’t politically possible because we do n’t talk about it .
The opponents of a public plan are afraid that people would all gradually migrate toward it , causing the insurance industry as we know it to wither away .
Would n’t that be a good thing ?
B. )
There have to be limits on what doctors can prescribe .
The president pretends the only limit will be on useless tests and drugs that have an equally good , cheaper alternative .
But useless and equally good are in the eye of the beholder .
There are already limits unless you have a really , really good insurance plan , but a lot of the country either has very good coverage or imagines their coverage is good because they have n’t really tested it .
They ’re afraid of change .
Yelling “ rationing ” every three seconds totally poisons the discussion .
And that is no little matter .
I ’ve already gone on longer than I promised , so there ’s no C .
David Brooks : Gail , as you know , I begin and end my days by reciting Congressional Budget Office reports .
I even put on tefillin , just to make it seem holy .
So let me begin my reply with the sentence from the latest report .
It ’s from a section in which the C.B.O. analyzes what the House plan , with the strong public program and all the rest , would do to health care inflation :
The net cost of the coverage provisions would be growing at a rate of more than 8 percent per year in nominal terms between 2017 and 2019 ; we would anticipate a similar trend in the subsequent decade .
This is devastating .
The plan was sold as a way to bend the cost curve , to reduce the rate of health care cost growth .
Instead , the cost of the plan to the federal budget would rise by 8 percent a year , and there would n’t be anything close to offsetting revenues to pay for it .
I ’m not crazy about the public plan , but I ’m not vociferously against it either .
This is a loud trumpet for all health care reformers .
Start over .
Get serious about costs .
We can either pass this kind of reform and bankrupt the country or we can pass another kind of reform .
End of story .
Now that I ’ve got that out of my system , let me say I admire your get - serious list ( though my sixth grade teacher once said that if you have an A and B , you should also have a C ) .
I ’m not crazy about the public plan .
I dislike the idea of the government competing in a marketplace it regulates .
I think the temptation to subsidize the public entity will be overwhelming .
But I ’m not vociferously against it either .
That ’s because :
A. ) I ’m not that thrilled with the insurance companies .
B. ) I think it will save money , but not that much ( the C.B.O. agrees ) .
C. ) (!)
I think it will produce small administrative efficiencies .
Democratic politicians throw around statistics claiming that Medicare has much , much lower administrative costs than private insurers .
I ’ve been told by various economists that this claim is three - quarters trickery .
It ’s a lot cheaper to administer a targeted population that uses a lot of care than it is to administer a large population that uses little care per capita .
Plus you can save a lot of administrative costs if you do n’t actually regulate treatments that much .
As for your second point , that there should be limits on what doctors can prescribe , I say : “ Amen to that . ”
If I had to add a few other items to the list , I ’d say putting a serious cap on the tax exemption is the way to measure the seriousness of a reform proposal .
Without that , it ’s not serious .
And finally , I ’d say that there have to be cost conscious consumers within a closely regulated market .
Unless you get proper incentives for both providers and consumers , I doubt you ’re going to get very far .
In the current plans , all the emphasis is on the providers .
There ’s a group called the Fresh Thinking Project , which has a sensible list of reform ideas .
I ’d only add in closing that the health care system is as big as the entire British economy .
There is no way something that big and complex and dynamic can be run out of Washington .
We have to try to set up a dynamic system , not trying to establish a set of rules to be imposed by fiat .
The smart reformers at the Office of Management and Budget are aware of this .
I ’m not sure the congressional staffs are .

The US military has admitted that the Afghan resistance is spreading across the country .
US General Stanley McChrystal , who is presenting a strategic assessment of the occupation , warned that the insurgency has spread from its traditional areas to other parts of the country .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , McChrystal said , “ We ’ve got to stop their momentum , stop their initiative .
It ’s hard work . ”
His warning came as fighters stormed a government building Pul - i - Alam , near the Afghan capital , Kabul .
McChrystal said that the occupation needs a “ very significant expansion ” of the Afghan army .
There are currently some 100,000 foreign troops in the country .
But the occupation needs to build the Afghan army to 400,000 troops — four times its current size .
The US military is now demanding an extra 45,000 troops , on top of the 62,000 it currently has in Afghanistan .
The US announced that some 4,000 troops would be launching an offensive on the Kandahar province .
A similar offensive in the Helmand province last month resulted in heavy casualties .
Other soldiers will be posted to remote bases around the country , making them easy targets for guerrilla - style attacks .
Over 1,300 foreign troops and countless thousands of Afghans have been killed since the 2001 invasion — with the death toll rising month on month .
In July , 76 soldiers died and hundreds were badly wounded — 22 were British soldiers .
Now McChrystal is warning that the August will be as bloody as July .
The announcement of a new offensive came as the future head of the British army , General Sir David Richards , told the Telegraph newspaper that Britain could be in Afghanistan for the next “ 30 to 40 years ” .
Richards said that “ the end will be difficult to define — it wo n’t be neat and clear - cut like the end of some old - fashioned inter - state war might have been . ”
He added , “ There is absolutely no chance of Nato pulling out .
We made this mistake once .
Our opponents are banking on us doing it again , and we must prove them wrong . ”
The Tories have made it clear that they want to send more troops if they get elected .
Shadow defence minister Gerald Howarth said that leaving “ would not be fair to those who have given their lives for this conflict ” .
Occupation forces in Afghanistan announced that they have issued a “ kill or capture ” order for 367 “ drug traffickers ” as part of their war against the Taliban insurgents .
The death list has raised alarm about “ mission creep ” , with foreign troops launching a campaign of assassinations against those they suspect of supporting the insurgency .
A similar campaign in Iraq resulted in the killing of thousands of people suspected of supporting the resistance .

Dems ' break looking like a bad trip
Angry protesters shouted down Democrats at public events from Texas to Pennsylvania over the weekend , leaving the party only one real hope for getting its message out over recess : a backlash .
In Austin , Texas , Rep. Lloyd Doggett was drowned out by a group of noisy , sign - waving demonstrators who shouted , “ Just say no ” as he tried to talk about health care reform .
Advertisement
In an e-mail to POLITICO Monday , Doggett called the group a “ mob , sent by the local Republican and Libertarian parties ” that “ came not just to be heard but to deny others the right to be heard . ”
In Morrisville , Pa. , Rep. Patrick Murphy was forced to scrap plans for a one - on - one meet - the - congressman session when people in the crowd started shouting .
Murphy switched to a town hall format mid-event and even then had to ask the audience at times to “ be respectful . ”
And at a health care event in Philadelphia , Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius were repeatedly interrupted by booing and heckling .
“ We can shout at one another , or we can leave the stage , ” Sebelius said at one point .
“ It ’s up to you . ”
For Democrats , that ’s precisely the problem :
Their ability to make their case on health care at public events during the August recess is mostly in the hands of the people who turn out for the events .
And if those people want to be disruptive — especially en masse — there ’s not much the Democrats can do about it .
“ Town halls have become town hells , ” said Mark McKinnon , a former adviser to President George W. Bush .
“ Special interests and opponents have figured out how easy it is to disrupt town halls and get their own message out .
The days of the truly free - form town halls may be over . ”
Democratic leaders are n’t quite ready to say that yet .
Doug Thornell , a spokesman for Assistant to the Speaker Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) , said House leaders are urging their members to continue holding public sessions , even if it means they ’ll be shouted down and have it all replayed on YouTube .
“ We have encouraged our members to use everything in their arsenal to communicate with their constituents , ” said Thornell .
“ They know what works best in their districts .
More than anything , they have to stay on the offense and not get distracted by stupid Republican gimmicks . ”
The Republicans are n’t exactly apologetic .
“ As some members of Speaker Pelosi ’s party are already learning , it ’s hard to heed her orders to ‘ go on offense ’ when you ’re busy defending such unpopular policies , ” said Paul Lindsay , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Lindsay said the NRCC would begin circulating a regular e-mail to reporters highlighting the protests at Democrats ’ town halls .
The title : “ Recess Roastings — Washington Democrats Feel the Heat at Home . ”
Democrats are trying to push back , casting the town hall disrupters as right - wing extremists affiliated with anti-tax “ tea parties . ”
“ The last place Republicans ought to be moving their party is even more to the fringe of the political spectrum , ” said Eric Schultz , a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
Added a senior Democratic strategist : “ It may be out of necessity , but for Republicans , relying on the fringe elements of the party to be the face of opposition on health care is a dangerous game .
The birthers and the tea party folks are n’t controllable , come off as angry and out of control and could n’t care less about the issue at hand . ”
But communications experts say it would be a mistake to demonize the protesters .
“ The more intelligent alternative is to take the extensive network the Obama campaign developed and send all of those people to town halls , ” said University of Pennsylvania political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson .
“ If this comes down to vocal individuals , the Obama campaign ought to be able to always outnumber their opponent .
And if they ’re not , then that ’s a problem . ”
Democrats are n’t the only ones taking town hall heat .
Republican Rep. Mike Castle was smacked down by the crowd at a town hall in Delaware last month when he would n’t agree with an angry inquisitor who insisted that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya .
McKinnon suggested that lawmakers handle noisy crowds by asking “ the rabble to provide a spokesperson , and give them the microphone for one question and comment . ”
“ Just give them a platform to have their say and let the air out of the balloon , ” he advised .
“ If they continue to harass , then they really look like partisan hacks . ”
One thing on which everyone agrees :
The protests are likely to continue .
The insurance lobby has urged the public to turn out for town halls , as have members of the tea party movement and the group Conservatives for Patients ’
Rights , which is providing a list of upcoming public events on its website — together with videos of events that have already been disrupted .
“ I think that it ’s going to happen at a lot of the town halls , ” said Rick Scott , chairman of Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights .
“ What you ’re seeing is a change . ”
Specter , who was booed in Philadelphia over the weekend , told The Associated Press that it ’s “ highly likely ” other senators will soon meet the same fate .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- New York collaborators at Columbia and Rockefeller Universities have identified cells in the stomach that time the release of a hormone that makes animals anticipate food and eat even when they are not hungry .
The finding , which has implications for the treatment of obesity , marks a landmark in the decades - long search for the timekeepers of hunger .
The work reveals what the stomach “ tells ” the brain .
Rae Silver , head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology and Behavior at Columbia University and Helene L. and Mark N. Kaplan Professor at Barnard College , Joseph LeSauter , senior research scientist at Barnard , and their colleague Donald W. Pfaff , at Rockefeller University , are the first to show that these cells , which release a hormone called ghrelin , are controlled by a circadian clock that is set by mealtime patterns .
They also show that the hormone ’s release whets the appetite of mice , spurring them to actively search for and consume food , even when they are not hungry .
“ Circadian clocks allow animals to anticipate daily events rather than just react to them , ” notes LeSauter , first author of the paper .
“ The cells that produce ghrelin have circadian clocks that presumably synchronize the anticipation of food with metabolic cycles . ”
The scientists show that the stomach cells release ghrelin into the general circulation before mealtime .
The hormone triggers a flurry of food - seeking behavior such as digging in the bedding around the food hopper , and it also stimulates eating .
These behaviors are part of the subjective experience of hunger .
LeSauter , who spearheaded the project , studied genetically engineered mice that lack the receptor that recognizes ghrelin and compared them with normal mice on identical feeding schedules .
He found that the mice that lack the ghrelin receptor had normal overall activity throughout the day but began to forage for food much later and to a lesser extent than their normal counterparts .
However , when foraging and other anticipatory behaviors actually began , foraging increased in a remarkably predictable manner in both sets of mice .
Pfaff believes that ghrelin , which is released from stomach cells and travels through the bloodstream to the brain , influences a decision - making process in brain cells .
These brain cells are constantly deciding whether or not to eat and , as mealtime draws near , the presence of ghrelin increases the proportion of “ yes ” decisions .
“ We applied mathematics to precise behavioral data and then interpreted them in the context of neurobiology , ” says Pfaff .
“ And that ’s very , very rare . ”
Previous studies have shown that people given ghrelin injections feel voraciously hungry and eat more at a buffet than they otherwise would .
The new research suggests that the stomach tells the brain when to eat , and establishing a regular meal schedule will regulate the stomach ’s release of ghrelin .
“ If you eat all the time , ghrelin secretion will not be well controlled , ” says Silver .
“ It ’s a good thing to eat meals at a regularly scheduled time of day . ”
The research also suggests that ghrelin , the only known natural appetite stimulant made outside the brain , is a promising target for drug developers .
Unlike drugs that focus on satiety , those that target ghrelin could help curb appetite before dieters take that first bite .

Last night I was up at 4 am in my recliner , holding my baby while he slept after a feeding .
I was playing Mass Effect , going through the game to get ready for the upcoming sequel .
I had been playing for around two hours , and I was into the story , more than awake , and ready to go for another two .
Then ... death .
A few bad decisions in a gun fight , and that was that for our Commander Shepard .
When I saw where the game reset me — I had foolishly assumed after a long section in the Mako and a set - piece battle it had autosaved — I just sighed and turned the console off .
I did n't want to go through the somewhat annoying vehicle section again , and I just was n't in the mood to go back over the ground I had already covered .
When this happens , when you go from being drawn into a game to walking away , something in the design has failed .
So why do we quit ?
What makes us walk away from a game ?
Developers are aware of it , and at E3 I talked to a developer from Turn 10 about why they had added a rewind feature into Forza 3 , allowing you a mulligan after a bad crash .
" If you 're at the end of a five - lap race , and you make one mistake , that 's when you decide to turn the game off and go to bed , " he explained .
" I do n't want to lose people at that point . "
DiRT 2 , in our preview code , likewise had a " Flashback " feature that gave you the limited ability to take back bad decisions .
The impact of this feature was something I felt immediately : it made me play more , and the sessions I played were longer .
Racing games are easy to walk away from : a single mistake during a twenty - minute race and you 're back at square one .
The Flashback feature allows you to practice turns , and it decreases the stakes while keeping the fun factor of the game .
You 're free to try a few different approaches into turns , and the gut - wrenching fear that comes with being in first place is somewhat alleviated .
Of course , for the big - money races , that feature disappears .
For those of us who do n't mind taking slightly longer to level up , it 's a godsend .
Badly spaced check points are another easy way of booting the player out .
As I found , oftentimes you 'll simply not want to redo a section of the game that you did n't find enjoyable , especially when you had assumed you had bested that particular section of the game .
You can alleviate this problem by saving more often , but you should n't have to ; badly placed checkpoints are insanely obvious when they occur .
After a big set piece , the game should auto - save .
The quiet after a long firefight ?
Autosave .
Progressing through a Bioware - style RPG , you know where the " beats " are , and this sort of annoyance at having to replay a long stretch of grinding game play is hard to excuse .
It 's bad when you quit for the night ; it 's even worse when the game goes back onto the shelf , never to be finished .
It 's not that games should be made easier , or the player given more tools to " cheat " or squeak through — the best games still provide a thrill when you finally best a challenging area — it 's more like there should be much more attention paid to the moment when a player goes from " one more round " to " okay , time for bed . "
The best games understand this balancing act , and those are the titles that rob our sleep and haunt our dreams .
The games fail when we sigh and turn the console off , suddenly losing interest in seeing where the story would have taken us .
So I ask you : what takes you from thinking you can give a game another hour or two to quitting for the night ?
What makes you walk away from an otherwise good game completely , and how should it be fixed ?
The best games are the ones we finish because we never hit these snags , but those are few and far between .
What games handle this challenge well ?
I 'm interested in your thoughts .

Intel ’s next - gen Pineview CPU “ not validated ” for Windows 7 Home Premium
Intel is not validating its next - generation of processor , dubbed Pineview , for Windows 7 Home Premium or higher according to a spokesman .
What this basically means is that the Pineview processor will only be intensively tested with the Windows 7 Starter and Home Basic Editions .
Intel claims that Home Premium is not “ the right solution ” for netbooks , so you ’ll you have to install it at your own risk when the new Pineview CPUs appear in netbooks at the end of the year .
“ We are not going to validate it with Home Premium because we do n’t believe it ’s the right solution ( for a netbook ) ” says Mooly Eden , VP of Intel ’s Mobile Platforms Group .
The process of validation involves rigorously testing compatibility of the processor with the operating system and its applications .
“ If somebody wants to do Premium he can do Premium , we do n’t forbid it .
It just means that we did n’t validate it , if there ’ll be a bug or there will not be a bug …if you want to take responsibility then the responsibility is yours , ” Eden said .
Seems like a strange decision to me , although I do wonder how bad the bugs will be , if any .
Many people are currently running Windows 7 Ultimate ( through the RC1 ) on their netbooks , without problems on their Atom processors .

Mayweather
Jr boasts one of the most impressive boxing records in history , a 6 - time 5 weight world champion with a 39 - 0 perfect record .
This 143 pound contest is going to a bit of an unknown for both fighters .
Mayweather has not fought at this weight since 2005 .
Marquez has never fought at this weight and is moving up 8 pounds to take on Mayweather .
This is Mayweather first outing in the ring since he knocked out Ricky Hatton in December 2007 then surprisingly announcing his retirement shortly afterwards .
Mayweather is said to be delighted and relieved that doctors have cleared him to fight again .
There are numerous reasons why Mayweather Jr has been tempted back in to the ring , some suggest he is struggling financialy , many boxing pundits have Manny Pacquiao as the best pound for pound boxer and this has riled Mayweather or maybe call of the sport was just too strong .
Mayweather
Snr is back in the camp helping his on prepare for this huge fight and although they may not be the closest of family , together they are one of the most formidable partnerships in the sport .
Mexican Marquez , has a ring record to envy most , 50 - 4 with 1 draw , which happened to be against Pacquiao .
He also suffered a loss to in a close split - decision to him .
Marquez should be confident going into the fight after becoming the first fighter to knock out former unified lightweight champion Juan Diaz .
That win also gave Marquez the WBO & WBA belts after the contest in February 2009 .
Marquez has also been world champion at Featherweight and Super - Featherweight , which elevates him to the group of only 4 Mexicans to win world titles at 3 different weights .
The other men being Marco Antonio Barrera , Erik Morales and Julio Cesar Chavez .

Think you remember every single television version of the Transformers ?
There may be a couple that fell off your radar …
The +Transformers +( 1984-1987 )
Optimus+was+known+to+horde+the+majority+of+the+red+paint+among+the+Autobots
Let 's face it , this is the Transformers series for the majority of the fans of the characters , and certainly for those who grew up during the 1980s .
Unlike Hasbro's other huge toy line at the time , G.I. Joe , where the comic book incarnation is probably considered the most " genuine " version of the story , it 's the cartoon that stands out most of all for Transformers fans .
Many central conceits simultaneously introduced on the cartoon and in the comic became core elements of the characters in most of the later incarnations .
Some of the most notable of these elements are the Transformers ' home planet Cybertron ; their crash landing on Earth millions of years ago ; and the Autobots ' friendship with a teenage boy with the last name Witwicky ( " Spike " in the cartoon , " Buster " in the comic ) .
The original cartoon also served to make icons out of many of the main characters of the series , including Bumblebee Ravage and more .
However , the standouts were probably Megatron Starscream and of course , Optimus Prime .
Megatron and Starscream made for a terrific villainous pairing , with the ruthless and evil Megatron ( voice over veteran Frank Welker ) constantly fending off the power hungry plotting of Starscream ( voiced by Chris Latta , who would also become very familiar as the voice of Cobra Commander on G.I. Joe ) .
As for Optimus Prime , as silly as it sounds , the giant robot who could transform into a truck became a huge hero for kids , who loved to see his brave acts and hear the comforting voice of Peter Cullen intoning " Autobots , transform and roll out !
"
The impact of this series can be seen in echoes throughout the current live - action Transformers movies , which are filled with a ton of recognizable elements , including Shia LeBouf 's character Sam Witwicky , a variation on the cartoon 's Spike Witwicky .
And fan demand went a long way towards ensuring that the man who is Optimus Prime to most Transformers fans , Peter Cullen , would reprise his role in the films .
If nothing else , you have to treasure a TV show that has the line " Grab onto your crankshaft , I 'm shifting into overdrive . "
Japan + Only : +The + Headmasters+and + Beyond +( 1987-1990 )
The+only+time+Americans+ever+dared+use+the+name+Super-God+Masterforce+for+a+kids+series+was+with+the+animated+Punky+Brewster+series
Following the end of the U.S. Transformers series in 1987 , a new animated series entitled Transformers : Headmasters began airing exclusively in Japan .
The series picked up where the third season left off -- the U.S. show 's abbreviated fourth season , " The Rebirth " story arc , did n't air in Japan .
The titular Headmasters in the Japan series differed from the ones introduced in the U.S. series ' fourth season ; in the Japan version the Headmasters were made up of Cybertronians who left Cybertron years ago and settled on a planet called Master .
To survive in Master 's harsh climate , the Cybertronians built large bodies called Transtectors , to which they attached themselves as heads .
Transformers : Headmasters aired for 35 episodes , completing its run in 1988 .
Fun fact :
This series took place in 2011 .
Welcome to now , suckers !
A month after Headmasters completed its run , a new Transformers series started up with the rather ridiculous ( when translated to English ) title of Transformers : Super - God Masterforce .
The series reimagined the Headmasters as human beings who combine with Trastectors to become Transformers , and oddly used recognizable robots from the previous series -- such as the Powermaster version of Optimus Prime -- but making them different characters .
In Optimus Prime 's case , he was known as Ginrai , a human trucker who would transform into a Prime - like Transformer .
Transformers : Super - God Masterforce ran for 42 episodes , ending in 1989 .
The ' 80s Japanese Transformers series continued to diverge from the U.S. series in style and story , and hit an apex of totally crazy titles with the 1989 series Fight !
Super Robot Lifeform Transformers Victory .
Drawn in much more of an anime style and utilizing loads of stock footage and a large number of clip shows , the animation quality of Transformers : Victory ( as the series is commonly referred to by fans ) left a bit to be desired .
The series ran for 38 episodes , finishing its run in December 1989 .
The Japanese - exclusive run of late ' 80s animated series ended in 1990 with the extremely short - lived ( and disappointingly boring - named ) Transformers : Zone , which aired just one episode before being cancelled .
Zone focused mainly on the Micromasters Transformers .
Although it is pretty widely known that most of the youth do not vote , their importance cannot be understated since what they have to say matters a lot .
This is also reflected in the fact that most of the key issues that are raised during the elections are brought to the fore by people between the ages 18 to 29 .
It is believed that half of the voter population consist of millennials .
Let us look at why it is important for the youth to start voting more .
1. Each and every vote is valuable
A very popular reason among the youth is that they feel as though their vote does n’t count and cite this as a strong reason as to why they do not vote .
But what they do not account for is the fact that the youth constitute among the largest voting groups .
2. The Great Recession
The Great Recession that took course in the late 2000s caused many young voters to lose jobs and as a result not be able to pay off their college loans on time .
Although the unemployment rates among the millennials have improved , they still have n’t found a footing when it comes to having policies made according to their needs .
This can only be achieved if they start voting and take decisions into their own hands .
3 . The diversity
There is so much diversity among the youth that many feel like the two - party system in America will soon be challenged in order to accommodate said variety .
This is to be more inclusive as liberals of the modern age find it hard to relate with Democrats .
In fact , a huge percentage of the youth have connected better with independent politics rather than relate themselves with democrats or republican .
This has happened in three different elections .
4 . The ease
Such is the state of the world we live in that it is technically impossible to not form political views since your mobile phone , TV and other devices keep alerting you with updates .
The candidates have also realized this and have started their own presence on social media websites to keep supporters up to date .
This could even be extremely important messages .
The social media platforms also help them form a different approach .
UK Supermarket Turns 5,000 Tons Of Meat Into Energy
August 7th , 2009 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
It ’s an odd week for fuel sources .
On the heels of a Mountain Dew powered engine , UK supermarket Tesco is getting flack for turning meat into energy –yah , you read that right .
The food chain is burning 5,000 tons of inedible meat for fuel .
The biomass processing is being handled by the Cheshire - based PDM Group .
The meat - energy is then used to power UK homes via the National Grid .
In fact , Tesco says they dispose of enough old meat to power 600 homes a year !
While other supermarkets have expressed following suit , as you can imagine this does n’t sit well with animal rights groups .
Justin Kerswell , campaigns manager for Viva ( Vegetarians International Voice for Animals UK ) , explained in an interview to the Daily Mail UK “ It ’s a sad indictment of modern life that not only hundreds of millions of animals are killed each year in the UK , but so much meat is left over from greed and indifference . ”
Tesco says the practice is better than sending it to a landfill .
I tend to agree …with both .
If we have enough meat waste to power 600 homes a year , that simply has to end .
But these changes do n’t happen over night , unfortunately .
I am also concerned that this effort could lead to even more complacency about the waste .
Recycling meat is just not efficient .
Producing a burger is a hugely carbon intensive process–and kinda gross .
Sorry , I ’m a veggie folks .
Livestock makes up about 18 % of all greenhouse gasses , more than all forms of transportation combined .
We are n’t going to offset that buy burning our burgers .

PITTSBURGH , May 27 , 2009 — A student who wants to form a gun-rights group at the Community College of Allegheny County ( CCAC ) has been threatened with disciplinary action for her efforts .
Student Christine Brashier has turned to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) for help after reporting that administrators banned her informational pamphlets , ordered her to destroy all copies of them , and told her that further “ academic misconduct ” would not be tolerated .
“ CCAC has demonstrated a shocking lack of respect for the rights of free speech and free association , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ Across the country , students are increasingly denied the First Amendment right to debate the Second Amendment .
At CCAC , this censorship trend has reached a new low . ”
In April , CCAC student Christine Brashier created pamphlets to distribute to her classmates encouraging them to join her in forming a chapter of the national Students for Concealed Carry on Campus ( SCCC ) organization at CCAC .
The handbill states that the group “ supports the legalization of concealed carry by licensed individuals on college campuses . ”
She personally distributed copies of the flyer , which identified her as a “ Campus Leader ” of the effort to start the chapter .
On April 24 , Jean Snider , Student Development Specialist at CCAC ’s Allegheny Campus , summoned Brashier to a meeting that day with Snider and Yvonne Burns , Dean of Student Development .
According to Brashier , the deans told Brashier that passing out her non-commercial pamphlets was prohibited as “ solicitation . ”
They told Brashier that trying to “ sell ” other students on the idea of the organization was prohibited .
CCAC also told Brashier that the college must pre-approve any distribution of literature to fellow students , and that pamphlets like hers would not be approved , even insisting that Brashier destroy all copies of her pamphlet .
Brashier reports that she was also interrogated about why she was distributing the pamphlets , whether she owned a licensed firearm and had ever brought it to campus ( she has not ) , whether she carries a concealed firearm off campus , and whether she disagrees with the existing college policy banning concealed weapons on campus .
When Brashier stated that she wanted to be able to discuss this policy freely on campus , she was told to stop doing so without the permission of the CCAC administration .
Dean Burns reportedly said , “ You may want to discuss this topic but the college does not , and you cannot make us . ”
Brashier was then told to cease all activities related to her involvement with SCCC at CCAC and that such “ academic misconduct ” would not be tolerated .
FIRE wrote CCAC President Alex Johnson on April 29 about these violations of Brashier ’s First Amendment speech and association rights , pointing out that her free speech in no way constituted solicitation , that CCAC is obligated to permit students to distribute literature and may not ban it on the basis of viewpoint or content , and that if CCAC recognizes student organizations at all , it must recognize an organization that supports concealed carry on campus .
FIRE requested a response by May 13 , and CCAC responded only by promising a reply from either CCAC or the Allegheny County Solicitor ’s office at some “ reasonable ” future time .
Two weeks have passed since that promise , leaving the First Amendment in jeopardy at CCAC .
“ If it is true that trying to ‘ sell ’ students on an idea is prohibited as a matter of solicitation , virtually the entire enterprise of the college is prohibited , ” said Robert Shibley , FIRE Vice President .
“ All persuasive speech would have to be pre-approved by the college .
CCAC must end this unjustified assault on its students ’ rights immediately . ”
This incident is the worst and latest in a significant trend of punishing students for debating the Second Amendment in the wake of the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings .
At Central Connecticut State University , after a student gave a class presentation about concealed firearms on campus , his professor called the police .
At Hamline University , a student was suspended , pending a mental health evaluation , after he advocated in an e-mail for concealed weapons on campus .
The SCCC chapter at Tarrant County College in Texas has been prohibited , two years in a row , from holding an “ empty holster protest . ”
At Lone Star College near Houston , the Young Conservatives of Texas were censored and threatened with de-recognition when they distributed a humorous flyer listing “ Top Ten Gun Safety Tips . ”
Lone Star ’s general counsel suggested that even a “ mention of firearms and weapons ” is inherently a “ material interference ” with the school ’s operations .
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process , freedom of expression , academic freedom , and rights of conscience at our nation ’s colleges and universities .
FIRE ’s efforts to preserve liberty on campuses across America are described at thefire.org .

Six months since taking the reins , the Barack Obama administration has met its primary objective .
It has swiftly ramped up the murderous imperial agenda inherited from Bush - Cheney while the masses , pacified and deceived by the appeal of the Obama image , pay no attention to realities .
No attention to the fact that the Obama administration ’s global war strategy , which puts Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Latin America , and other regions into new military - intelligence crosshairs , promises the expansion of global instability , resource conquest , and “ war on terrorism ” ruin .
No attention to the fact the Obama administration is loaded with elites who are as dangerous and corrupt as those of the preceding administration .
No attention to the fact that nothing has “ changed ” except that there is a “ rock star ” figurehead sitting in the Oval Office who is smart and not stupid ; calculating rather than blatant .
The destabilization of Iran , a product of massive US covert operations ( and overt political manipulation ) continues unabated , built upon the pretext of “ restoring democracy ” — a “ stolen election ” hoax , and an aggressive “ color revolution ” spearheaded by Anglo - American surrogates , aspiring puppets , and hordes of intelligence assets and so - called “ liberals ” touting “ democracy ” .
The Iranian corridor remains critical , for the control of Central Asian and Middle East energy , and the Anglo - American empire is intent upon controlling it .
A blatant coup in Honduras has been carried out in the classic fashion , according to the same intelligence playbook that has been at the core of US - Latin America policy since the Iran - Contra era ; the same destabilization tactics used in recent years to topple the governments of Venezuela and Haiti .
Domestically , Obama has endorsed the continued surveillance of the American people , and an even more ironclad electronic police state .
While the average American is distracted by the pipe dream of believing that its corporate - controlled government will reform health care , the larger world health care system is being militarized , upon the pretext of a conveniently unstoppable swine flu pandemic .
The massive economic meltdown crisis begun under the orchestration of Bush - Cheney economic “ gurus ” such as Wall Street insider Henry Paulson continues under the management of Obama ’s gang of Wall Street insiders , led by Timothy Geithner .
Cooked books and false profit reports have sparked new Ponzi stock market rallies , and new pronouncements that the “ worst financial crisis since the Great Depression ” is about to end , just a few months later .
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve continues to funnel trillions in taxpayer TARP funds to banks ( not to lend ) , and ordinary people continue to suffer massive unemployment and misery .
Tellingly , Obama continues to refuse to support the prosecution of any members of the Bush - Cheney administration for its eight years of blatant law - breaking .
In fact , Obama has promised to protect Dick Cheney , despite the fact that the former Vice President oversaw assassins and saboteurs .
Obama clearly understands his true role .
It is to mask the agenda of the world order with iconic appeal that is so powerful , that the masses willingly support , and even militantly advocate their own destruction .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
A flurry of subsidiary closures in Georgia and a failure in New York state on Friday brought the U.S. tally of shuttered banks to 64 for the year , as the credit crunch continues to overwhelm financial institutions .
Six subsidiaries of Macon , Ga.- based Security Bank Corp. were closed by regulators , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a statement , collectively triggering an $ 807 million dent in the federal deposit - insurance fund .
If you ’re ever trying to balance being productive with hanging out with your kids , it ’s time to reevaluate how you ’ve framed ‘ productivity ’ .
Being a good parent is one of the most meaningfully productive things you can do .
Now , it ’s a different thing entirely to feel some tension because you have to choose between two different important activities , i.e. doing the things that put food on the table and hanging out with your kids .
The distinction here is important because it ’s not forking “ being productive ” from “ being a good parent ” ; it ’s just reflecting the reality that being a good parent entails providing for your children and spending time with them , among other things .
Let ’s hang out here for a moment .
When we ’re thinking about it from a higher perspective , we all instinctively know that our children need our time , attention , and love more than they need anything else .
But in the daily trenches , we forget this and make choices that end up trading that time , attention , and love for material things .
Your kids can wear clothes longer than you think they can .
They can wear stuff from second - hand stores .
If they could , they would ask you to spend more time with them instead of buying them more stuff .
They do n’t have to go to Disneyland .
They ’d give it up for you , if they had a say .
Sure , teenagers will grow tired of you and rebel at some point .
They may choose to go Disneyland or Space Academy rather than spend time with you .
But when your son ’s girlfriend dumps him , he needs you – not more stuff .
When your daughter scores the winning goal , she wants you to see it .
Your relationship with your kids will grow and change .
They react to how you interact with them .
Cherish them as the sacred little beings they are from the time they ’re born to the time they decide they need to do their own thing , and they ’ll react accordingly .
If you view spending time with them as a distraction and / or something you have to do , they ’ll also react accordingly .
Kids are far more intuitive and intelligent about social dynamics than most people realize .
You love them .
Show them , with three understandings :
They need your time , love , and attention more than anything else .
You need and want to nurture your children .
Being a good parent is being productive .
There ’s no real tension between the two .
That said , it ’s okay if you need some time away from them , too .
Your wants and needs are important , and if you neglect your wants and needs for too long , you wo n’t be able to tend to theirs without resentment .
Yes , mothers , I ’m talking to you .
In their waning years , no parent ever wishes they had worked more , but most wish they had spent more time with their kids .
What will you do today and tomorrow to give your kids the presents that matter most ?

Library : Modern Documents : James Still : Virgin Birth
The Virgin Birth and Childhood
Mysteries of Jesus
Biblical scholars have long ago dismissed the literal interpretation of the miraculous virgin - birth of Jesus .
Also , many liberal Christian denominations have either quietly purged the curious piece of teaching from their body of philosophy , or conveniently ignore the issue altogether .
Despite this , the allure of such an intriguing concept is still very powerful and Jesus ' virgin birth continues to enjoy the unquestioning belief of millions of people .
The purpose of this essay is to explore the mythological connections between prodigal children in history with an emphasis on the meaning and symbology of virgin birth as it particularly relates to Jesus .
In this way Jesus ' virgin birth and the mysteries surrounding it will be fully explored in the mythological context from which it derives .
We know very little about the desert nomads and goddess worshippers who settled the fertile Tigris - Euphrates river valley .
Mesopotamia , situated as it was between the ancient lands of Ur and Sumer , was almost constantly at war in the three millennia preceding the Common Era .
What we do know comes down to us through the Ashurbanipal library .
King Ashurbanipal ( fl. 620 BCE ) of Nineveh ruled the Assyrian empire just prior to its decline .
His brutal accomplishments on the battlefield were tempered only by a driving passion for letters and learning so that , over time his spoils included the religious texts and history books of all of his conquered neighbors including the Mesopotamians .
After his death , his empire collapsed and in a few short years Nineveh itself was utterly destroyed by Persian invaders .
The invaders were only interested in destroying Nineveh 's military might ; they ruined the city 's walls , but completely ignored the Ashurbanipal 's library , perhaps considering it a mere whimsical endeavor .
The library was soon swallowed up by the shifting sands of the desert .
Finally in 1845 British archaeologists rediscovered Nineveh and the wealth of books which lay buried there .
The pre-civilized world of ancient Mesopotamia , consisted of small farming settlements whose people worshipped Ishtar , a fertile , mother goddess .
Ishtar caused the rains to fall and the crops to grow in a continuous cycle of birth , life , and death .
Over time , Ishtar - worship began to wane as the warlike male gods of neighboring tribes emerged in positions of prominence .
The warrior - kings of neighboring desert tribes continually invaded the fertile lands of Mesopotamia , eventually seizing the land and incorporating it into their own rising and falling empires .
One of the first warrior - kings to rise up among these early peoples was Sargon of Akkad , who established his kingdom in 2200 BCE .
Ishtar was by now fully absorbed into the stronger cults of the patriarchal deities and she became a lesser deity who was subservient to the new male gods of the warrior - kings .
Sargon is perhaps the first Babylonian king who was said to have a larger - than - life birth and childhood .
He was born in secret to a mother of lowly birth and a father who was a mountain god .
In a motif which would later be borrowed and attributed to Horus and Moses , Sargon 's mother placed the child in a basket of rushes and sent him down a river to protect him from the god 's enemies .
The babe was rescued downstream by simple folk and the goddess Ishtar loved and guided Sargon through his early childhood and to his final destiny : the ascension of the throne .
Sargon 's biography started a " tall tale " tradition that subsequent kings felt the need to match .
The attribute of divine birth and predestination became an important vehicle whereby a mortal king was said to be god - favored ; gaining recognition and power during his life which often continued into posterity long after death .
By 1000 BCE , we find this tradition improved upon so that the biography of kings and important men insist that they were not only divinely born , but said to have transcended death to become gods themselves .
Zoroaster , the Persian prophet and patriarch who lived and preached in ancient Babylon , was said to have been God-begotten and virgin born .
Virgin - birth was the responsibility of the Ishtar priestesses , who conducted fertility rites , prophesied and performed elaborate rituals in the temples throughout Babylon .
The priestesses who administered the temples also managed a lucrative prostitution business that provided a steady stream of financial support for temple activities .
Upon their return to Palestine , Hebrews of the Babylonian captivity brought back to the Mediterranean peoples wondrous tales of the priestesses and their blasphemous sexual ministries to the men who visited them .
The role of the Ishtar priestess was to act as both mother to the prospective man 's child and minister to the child 's divine needs :
" Holy Virgin " was the title of harlot - priestesses of Ishtar ( and ) Asherah .
The title did n't mean physical virginity ; it meant simply " unmarried . "
The function of such " holy virgins " was to dispense the Mother 's grace through sexual worship ; to heal ; to prophesy ; to perform sacred dances ; to wail for the dead ; and to become Brides of God . " [ 1 ]
The Hebrews called the children of these priestesses bathur , which meant literally " virgin - born " as in those children who were born of the holy harlot - priestesses of the temple .
The Hellenic world had no equivalent to the bizarre rituals of Ishtar , and mistranslated and misunderstood the literal Hebrew 's bathur as parthenioi , also " virgin - born " but in the sense of physical , not spiritual , virginity .
The Zoroastrian cosmology told of the world lasting for twelve thousand years in four , three - thousand year blocks of time .
The last block of time began with the divine birth of the prophet and would end by ushering in the apocalyptic end of the world and the restoration of good over evil :
[ Zoraster 's ] birth and teaching in the world marked the opening of the final three thousand of the world span of twelve thousand years -- at the end of which term his spritual sons Saoshyant , " the Coming Savior , " the World Messiah , would appear , to culminate the victory of Truth over the Lie and establish forever the restoration of the pristine creation of God .
As the legend tells , the birthplace of Zoroaster . . . was beside the river Daiti , in the central land of the seven lands of the earth , Eran Vej. . . .
Angra Mainyu [ Demon of the Lie ] rushed from the regions of the north , crying to his horde , " Annihilate him ! "
But the holy babe chanted aloud . . . and the demons were dispersed . [ 2 ]
In the Hellenic empire carved out by Alexander the Great during the third century BCE , these eastern beliefs and myths mingled with those of the Greeks , Egyptians , and Semitic peoples .
Alexander was anxious to connect the Mediterranean world with the strange ways and customs of the Orient and sought to connect his two empires culturally as well as politically .
The Greeks had already devised well - developed concepts of divine impregnation .
The savior - god Dionysus was said to have been born after Zeus visited Persephone in the form of a serpent .
The Persian contribution to these Hellenic myths was to bring the fascinating idea of the virgin ( parthenioi ) birth to the old Dionysus and Herakles stories .
Eventually the pagan mysteries had fully incorporated the virgin - birth ceremonies of the Ishtar priestesses into their own beliefs and religions as each savior - god took on the divine attribute themselves .
The Greeks related that Persephone was hidden in a cave by her mother , the goddess Demeter .
While there , Persephone began weaving a great tapestry of the universe out of aweb of wool .
Zeus learned of her presence and approached Persephone in the guise of a serpent .
She conceived a son for Zeus and named him Dionysus , whom she cared for and nurtured in the cave to protect the young child from other jealous wives of Zeus .
Eventually Herakles , whom the Romans would rename to Hercules , was said to have been born of a god as well .
In due time Perseus , Minos , Asclepius , Miletus , and many others , were all reputably born of a specially selected mortal woman and a god in the manner of the Ishtar virgin priestesses .
Often the god would impregnate the woman as a spirit in special ceremonies .
Zeus was said to have impregnated Danae by visiting her as a ray of sunlight and the dove , sacred to Ishtar , manifests itself as a Holy Ghost to impregnate Mary and announce Jesus as the son of God . [ 3 ]
One result of the Persian - Hellenic blend of myths was Mithras .
Mithras was a Persian deity , but other than his name used " to give itself an exotic oriental flavor , " [ 4 ]
Hellenic Mithraism wasdistinctly pagan .
Mithraism began and flourished at the same timeas did Christianity .
The cult gained enormous popularity and bythe third century hundreds of mithraeum -- underground temples where Mithras was worshipped -- were spread out across Asia Minor , Africa , Italy , Greece , and the German and Scottish frontiers where Romansoldiers were stationed .
Mithras is the most recognizable of the Mediterranean gods that was said to have been physically virgin - born ; a flattering imitation of the Ishtar priestesses of Babylon .
Mithras was depicted as a " bull - slayer " and stone - carved reliefs display a tauroctony where Mithras plunges a knife into the neck of a great bull , while the blood spills down to the ground .
The bull - slaying scene always takes place inside of a cave , symbolically represented by the mithraeum 's locations in caves and underground grottos .
To understand this symbolic bull - slaying , we must first look briefly at the Greco - Roman world 's understanding of the universe .
The ancients believed that the sun , the moon , " wandering " stars ( planets ) , comets , and other celestial bodies were heavenly gods who were in motion about a stationary earth .
Since the sun ( Sol invictus ) seemed to be the most influential of the celestial gods , it was especially worshipped and regarded as annually " reborn " at its lowest point in the sky during the winter solstice of December 25th .
[ 5 ]
Since the plane of the ecliptic -- the path that the sun travels in the sky -- traces out the band of the twelve star - patterns that make up the zodiac , the sun was considered a god that gave " birth " to , or was a father of , the twelve zodiacal gods .
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus made the astounding discovery in 128 BCE that the zodiac of constellations slowly drifted backward over time so that they appeared , with respect to the suns position at winter solstice , in a new location in the heavens .
Every 25 thousand years these constellations slowly moved ; a phenomenon we know today to be the precession of the equinoxes which is caused by the " wobble " of the earth on its axis .
To the ancients , it was a frightening and astounding event :
Hipparchus , who assumed that the earth was immovable and at the center of the cosmos , could only understand the precession as a movement of the entire cosmic sphere .
In other words , Hipparchus 's discovery amounted to the revelation that the entire universe was moving in a way that no one had ever been aware of before .
. . .
[ The precession ] had profound religious implications .
A new force had been detected capable of shifting the cosmic sphere :
Was it not likely that this new force was a sign of the activity of a new god , a god so powerful that he was capable of moving the entire universe ? [ 6 ]
At the time Hipparchus made his discovery , the spring equinox , which signaled the resurrection of the sun-god , appeared in the constellation of Aries the Ram .
Before Aries , it was seen that the equinox fell on Taurus the Bull .
This celestial movement taking place among the heavenly gods and the " death " of Taurus the Bull made a tremendous impact .
Mithras became that celestial force who was strong enough to slay the bull and was able to command the very heavens to do his bidding .
In Mithraism , just as in Christianity and Zoroastrianism before them , the world was a constant battleground of good and evil ; a bitter dualistic struggle between the hosts of demons and the elect who serve God .
Spirituality warred against the physical , and darkness imperiled the good fortune of light .
Mithras represented the divine son of the sun-god and the savior of good against darkness in the universe who battled against the minions of evil to save mankind .
Because Mithras could move the celestial sphere at will , he was seen as outside of the universe .
Carvings of Mithras reflect his birth as a naked child bursting from an egg - shaped petra genetrix , or " Generative Rock . "
The rock caves where the mithraeum were located symbolize the " womb " from which Mithras emerged .
His escape from the confines of the rock , attest to his extra-universal power to escape the celestial sphere and command the heavens :
[ Mithras ' ] birth is said to have been brought about solo aestu libidinis , " by the sole heat of libido .... "
The earth has given birth -- a virgin birth -- to the archetypal Man . [ 7 ]
Mithras was born on December 25th , the eve of the winter solstice when the sun is at its lowest point in the sky .
With the dawn of light on Mithras ' birth " the priest emerged from the temple to announce triumphantly : The God is born ! " [ 8 ]
When Christianity gained power in the fifth century , Mithraism was declared heretical and ruthlessly scourged .
Before that time , Christianity and Mithraism coexisted and were undoubtedly influencial upon each other .
This mingling and influence are apparent in the manner with which Christianity overtook Mithraism .
The former had no trouble incorporating Mithraism 's followers into its own ranks and many former mithraeums were converted to churches .
Many Roman churches today , the Church of San Clemente in Rome most notably , still contain well - preserved mithraeums in their vaulted burial crypts .
The lines that divided Mithraism from Christianity were understandably blurred due to this slow and steady absorption of Mithraism by Christianity during the centuries that the two existed side - by - side .
This process led to the similarities that we now see shared between the two religions :
[ Mithras ] was said to have been sent by a father - god to vanquish darkness and evil in the world .
Born of a virgin ( a birth witnessed only by shepherds ) , Mithras was described variously as the Way , the Truth , the Light , the Word , the Son of God , and the Good Shepherd and was often depicted carrying a lamb upon his shoulders .
Followers of Mithras celebrated December 25th ( the winter solstice ) by ringing bells , singing hymns , lighting candles , giving gifts , and administering a sacrament of bread and water .
Between December 25th and the spring equinox ( Easter , from the Latin for earth goddess ) came the 40 days ' search for Osiris , a god of justice and love .
The cult also observed Black Friday , commemorating Mithras ' sacrificial bull - slaying which fructified the earth .
Worn out by the battle , Mithras is symbolically represented as a corpse and is placed in a sacred rock tomb from which he is removed after three days in a festival of rejoicing . [ 9 ]
Jesus ' virgin - birth was probably attributed to him during this time .
Matthew and Luke write that Jesus was born of a virgin in 1:18 - 25 , and 1:26 - 35 , respectively .
Mark , the earliest of the synoptics , makes no such claim and the Gospel of John would never think of reducing Jesus , the divine Logos , to mere flesh and blood .
The Gospel of Mark aligns itself closely with the earlier Q-- the forty or so oral tradition sayings that are believed to be derived from Jesus ' teachings directly -- and does not think to concern itself with the biography of Jesus prior to his baptism by John .
To early Christians , the childhood or place and manner of the birth of Jesus was irrelevant .
The Kingdom of God was at hand and Jesus the messenger had warned them of that fact and that they should prepare for the new heaven and earth that was to come in their lifetimes .
Given Jesus ' apoclyptic message and instructions to repent and prepare for the Lord , a posterity - driven biography would seem absurd .
If the Kingdom of God was at hand , as Jesus taught , then there would be no future generations to read anything that was codified in the present .
Thus , the oral tradition preserved Jesus ' teachings in short , concise pericopes ( short sayings ) and Jesus ' followers gave little thought to writing them down at first because of the very nature of the apocalyptic movement that had sprung up around them .
As time went by it could be seen that the Kingdom of God was delayed .
Among the Hellenized Jews and the Greek pagans who were considering conversion to Christianity , this delay posed more questions than answers .
Additionally , Greek pagans , from which Christianity was to draw its converts and eventually thrive , were naturally skeptical of any new savior and the heavenly rewards they might promise .
These Greeks had to pick and choose among the dozens of mystery cults and gods that had sprung up , each promising riches and eternal bliss in a heavenly afterlife .
Jesus had little to offer these Greeks .
He was , by all accounts , a mortal Jewish messiah , speaking only to the sons of Abraham and telling them to prepare the way of the Lord who would build a new Jerusalem especially for his chosen people .
The Marcan Jesus that was known to his followers during the middle - to - late first - century ( before the gospels of Matthew , Luke , and John ) shared none of the attributes of the time - honored moral - savior deities of Dionysus or Herakles .
Jesus ' later - added attribute of virgin - birth necessary if Jesus was to be made acceptable to the pagans of the Hellenized world .
Hebrew teachings do not specify that the Messiah would be born of a virgin ; the very idea is alien to Jewish expectations of who the Messiah would be .
Quite contrary to the Hellenized Jesus " there is nothing in the Jewish sacred books to suggest that the Messiah or anyone else was , or was to be , born of a virgin . " [ 10 ]
Jesus had been thoroughly rejected by the Jews who had decided that he was not the messiah that would usher in the new Kingdom .
Early Christians had no choice but to turn away from Palestine and introduce Jesus to the Gentiles .
The Gospel of Mark begins with the Baptist in the River Jordan and the baptism of Jesus there .
Early versions of Matthew and Luke , which were circulated among Greek Christians , began with the Baptist as well .
At some point , these Christians felt the need to tailor their savior after the Greek savior - gods that they were familiar with and felt that it would be necessary to write a biography of Jesus to fill that need and make him as powerful and honorable as the pagan gods .
The Gospel of Mark ( 70 CE ) was already too well known and circulated , but the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were perfect for inserting the childhood biography of Jesus :
The first two chapters of Matthew and the first three chapters of Luke were added in the second century by Hellenizers who would accept only a divinely born savior - god like those of the pagan mystery - cults . . . . " [ 11 ]
By the close of the first century it became necessary to codify the origins of Jesus so as to defend him from the pagan critics who hesitated at following a new god when their current ones , like Herakles and Perseus , were well known to have been born by the union of a god and a virgin mother .
Writing independently of each other , the authors or interpolators of Matthew and Luke proceeded to elevate Jesus to the status of the Greek savior - gods by inserting at the front of their gospels , the birth narrative of Jesus .
The end result however created another problem :
Although Matthew and Luke , who deal with the Virgin Birth story , are considered " inspired " writers . . . they yet disagree on minor details .
It was to Joseph that the angel appeared to according to Matthew ; it was to Mary according to Luke .
And the Annunciation ( the angel Gabriel 's announcement of the Incarnation ) took place before Mary 's conception , if Luke is the authority ; and after , if Matthew is the authority . [ 12 ]
At the time of Matthew and Luke 's interpolation , Christianity deeply rooted itself in the Graeco - Roman world and had completely separated itself from its mother religion Judaism .
Former pagans were converting en masse and brought their religious beliefs with them to the new religion .
Even the Hebrew 's Tanakh was forgotten , having been replaced by the Greek Septuagint which translated the Old Testament books into Greek terms and concepts that often were misleading , innacurate , or mistranslated from the Hebrew texts .
The Greek - speaking author of Matthew , relying on the faulty translation of the Septuagint , rendered the Hebrew word almah ( young woman ) into Greek parthenos ( virgin ) when he wrote :
Behold , a parthenos shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us . [ 13 ]
The Septuagint had retained the Ishtar - worshipping virgin - temple practices in part by insisting on the physical virgin - birth of Isaiah 's prophetic Emmanuel in verses 7:14 .
The later writers of Matthew and Luke relied on the Septuagint for their references .
After reading this passage in Isaiah , Matthew sought to find a way to fit Jesus into the virgin - birth role that Isaiah spoke of , thus achieving a prophecy in Jesus ' own birth .
The impetus for the idea and the motivation which would eventually permanently seal it into the canon , came from the huge numbers of pagan converts .
These converts did n't want to leave behind Mithras and Perseus , who were both virgin - born , in exchange for a Jewish Messiah who was not .
The text in Isaiah 7:14 , properly translated from the Hebrew Nevi'im reads :
Assuredly , my Lord will give you a sign of His own accord !
Look , the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son .
Let her name him Immanuel .
This " young woman " may perhaps be unmarried or a physical virgin , but she should not be confused with the role of the Holy Virgins of the pagan temples of Ishtar whose job it was to bear savior - gods .
This passage could not refer to anything other than a direct sign of Yahweh concerning the events of Isaiah 's time .
Isaiah specifically refers to the time and place in which the prophet is speaking to King Ahaz and reassuring him that Syria and Ephraim will not go to war with Judah . [ 14 ]
Isaiah " is simply saying to Ahaz that a lady who is now a virgin will shortly fall pregnant and bear a son , and that by the time this has happened the political dangers will have been averted . " [ 15 ]
Matthew , straining to provide some kind of scriptural basis for the virgin- birth of Jesus , takes Isaiah out of context in order to support a prophecy fulfillment through Jesus ' virgin birth .
We see the context - dropping in 8:3 - 4 where Isaiah 's prophecy is said to have come true in that " the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria " shall be plundered by Assyria while the child is yet an infant .
These invasions and the resultant booty did occur in the seventh century BCE .
How did such a doctrine ever become promulgated ?
What actually happened is obvious enough : at an early date , Judaizers interpolated passages designed to make Jesus the Messiah who would establish a Jewish empire at His Parousia ; but then , about 115 - 125 ( CE ) , since it had become impossible to remove these interpolations , certain Hellenizers simply superimposed Matt .
1:18 - 25 and Luke 1 upon them , which provided Jesus with a Virgin Birth and made of Him a savior generically similar to Dionysus and therefore acceptable in the pagan world . [ 16 ]
By the time pagan philosophers like Celsus ( fl. 180 CE ) were denouncing the virgin - birth mythology , it was too late .
The doctrine was already imbedded in the collective minds and manuscripts of the early Christians .
Celsus anticipated the motive behind the virgin birth narrative and accused Christians of attributing the virgin birth to Jesus in order to imitate the pagan savior - gods :
Many of the nations of the world hold doctrines similar to those espoused by the Christians ....
The Galactophagi of Homer , the Druids of Gaul , and even the Getae ( for example ) believe doctrines very close to ( the historicity of Christianity and Judaism ) ...
Linus , Musaeus , Orpheus , Pherecydes , Zoroaster the Persian , and Pythagoras understood these doctrines ....
What absurdity !
Clearly the Christians have used the myths of the Danae and the Melanippe , or of the Auge and the Antiope in fabricating the story of Jesus ' virgin birth . [ 17 ]
Celsus ' bitter criticism necessitated a Christian apology that never quite overcame the defensive posture that it was forced to take .
Early Church fathers like Eusebius and Augustine compare and contrast Jesus heavily against his pagan contemporaries , claiming that if Jesus is false , then so is Mithras and Herakles .
During this period , the early Christians were still tied to their pagan roots and had not yet stated a clear case for why their god should not be considered an equal of Mithras , Dionysus , and other Greek and Roman gods .
Roman critics and neoplatonic philosophers who argued against Christianity from a conservative status quo position , could n't understand why Christians would want to so closely fashion their god after those of the standard repertoire of state - endorsed gods .
The pagan idea of a savior - god being virgin - born was very persistent :
a ... factor making for the survival of such tales ( virgin birth ) in religious cults is stressed by Gilbert Murray .
He notes that it is the saviour gods of paganism who are often reputed virgin - born .
The father - god supplies the human race with a saviour , his son , by impregnating a goddess or a mortal .
He must , however , not be regarded as actuated by lust .
His purpose is the birth of a great saviour of mankind , and so the impregnation has to be effected without carnal intercourse .
Hence
Io was made pregnant by the laying on of the divine hand , Danae by the golden sunlight . [ 18 ]
Nowhere is virgin birth so stressed as in the Graeco - Roman world where the synoptic interpolators were deeply rooted :
[ T ]he doctrine of the Virgin Birth , without which no prophet or savior - god could be a divine incarnation , was so common among ancient cults that it was impossible for any religious founder to achieve acceptance without it . [ 19 ]
The virgin - birth story which is attributed to Jesus , is a later pagan addition interpolated for the sole purpose of adding support for the Christian savior .
Not having been based upon a solid textual foundation like the Jews , early Christians needed to attribute the characteristics and events of existing gods to their savior in order to legitimize him as a god worthy of worship .
Jesus represents a crossover from Messianic Judaism and Graeco - Roman paganism ; an embodiment of the best of both worlds .
Clues from the apocryphal -- texts not included in the canon -- that account for the persistence of Jesus ' virgin - birth may be from the Gospel of Thomas , which dates to perhaps 50 CE .
Jesus is preaching in the desert using parables and saying that " he who has ears , let him hear . "
A woman calls out saying " [ b] lessed are the womb which bore you and the breasts which nourished you " to which Jesus replies :
Blessed are those who have heard the word of the father and have truly kept it .
For there will be days when you will say , `Blessed are the womb which has not conceived and the breasts which have not given milk . '[ 20 ]
Jesus is referring to the hard times that may befall those who choose to serve God for the path to the Kingdom of God is narrow indeed .
Often Jesus is depicted in the gospels as being taken literally ( e.g. , Nicodemus ' " born from above " narrative ) when he meant to use figurative speech , so this may be just such a case .
Also , in the same gospel Jesus tells his disciples that when they " go into any land " and " see one who was not born of woman , prostrate yourselves on your faces and worship him . " [ 21 ]
Thomas ' Jesus constantly plays on words and tells his disciples that only by searching for the beginning will they find the end of their journey .
Aside from the Buddhist overtones of this statement , it is possible that later Christians decided that the " beginning " ( Jesus ) must have been one not born of woman since no mention is made of such beings after the disciples traveled and preached .
The Gospel of Mark , the earliest of the gospels , relates that Jesus is a Jewish Messiah , and so born quite naturally in the manner expected of the Davidic Messiah .
The Jewish ascetic sects who were expecting a son of David to arrive who would invoke the Parousia and regain the throne , said that he would be born in Bethlehem .
The earliest references , upon which Mark 's gospel is based , insist that Jesus was instead born in Galilee at Nazareth .
The last two synoptics , Matthew and Luke , attempt to correct Mark 's error by again placing Jesus ' birth back in Bethlehem .
The Gospel of John , which is totally unconcerned with any notion of Jewish expectations of the Messiah , places Jesus back at Nazareth merely for the sake of argument ascribing the conflict as a " division among the people over him " ( Jn. 7:43 ) .
The conflict would be a minor one if it were not for the fact that there was no such town in Galilee named Nazareth during Jesus ' birth .
In a humorous self - fulfilling prophecy , the Galilean town was established in the third century after news of Jesus ' birthplace had become famous .
This curious insistence on associating Jesus with Nazareth may predate the Christian oral traditions and told among apocalyptic groups like the Essenes , who practiced a form of sun worship .
Early Christians may have considered Jesus a sun-god .
Nazareth is very closely worded to Nazaroth which in Hebrew is " the twelve signs ( of the zodiac ) . "
The root verb nazar means to " surround " as in the twelve constellations of the zodiac which pass overhead each night , thus surrounding the earth . [ 22 ]
Job is reminded of his human limitations and the celestial astrological power of Yahweh , when the latter speaks to him from a raging desert whirlwind :
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades , or loose the bands of Orion ?
Canst thou bring forth Nazaroth in his season ? [ 23 ]
This theory is supported by the evidence that the inhabitants of Qumran by the Dead Sea , who Pliny referred to as Essenes , used a solar - based calendar , rather than the traditional lunar - based Judaic calendar .
Pliny the Younger reported in a letter to the emperor Trajan in 112 CE that " Christians appear to be harmless people who meet at daybreak and sign hymns to the honor of the Christo quasi deo ( the Christ as if he were a god ) . "
Matthew and Luke sought to fill in the missing genealogy for Jesus .
Jewish Messiah's were considered important only in the capacity that they fulfilled the role of a " Son of man " and told their people the message of God who had appointed them .
The Messiah himself was unimportant compared to the mission which he was elected to perform .
But when Matthew and Luke wrote , Jesus had taken on a greater meaning to the Christians than just a fulfiller of Messianic duties .
Understandably , many early Christians wanted to know more about Jesus than the earlier texts and the Sayings Sources had shown .
Writing independently of each other , Matthew and Luke wrote conflicting genealogies based on OT scripture and numerology .
Matthew 's genealogy is an attempt to invoke credibility through powerful numerological magic .
He bases Jesus ' lineage on watershed events in history in three sets of fourteen :
" So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations . " [ 24 ]
Since " seven " is the Hebrew magical number we find a strong desire to tailor Jesus ' genealogy in groups that are divisible by seven , and in groupings that denote historical events of which Jesus ' birth is as important as the " carrying away into Babylon " and King David himself :
Here are the six sets of seven names each that Matthew derives :
Abraham Aminadab | Solomon Joatham | Jechonias Achim Isaac Naasson | Roboam Achaz | Salathiel Eliud Jacob Salmon | Abia Ezekias | Zorobabel Eleazar Judas Booz | Asa Manasses | Abiud Matthan Phares Obed | Josaphat Amon | Eliakim Jacob Esrom Jesse | Joram Josias | Azor Joseph Aram David | Ozias Jechonias | Sadoc Jesus
-------------------+---------------------+--------------------
Formation of | Babylonian | Jesus as Messiah Israel | Captivity |
Matthew omits Joash , Amaziah , and Azoriah from the genealogy in 1 Chronicles 3 and mistakenly counts Jechonias twice in order to achieve the perfect three sets of fourteen which when halved invoke the magical properties of the number seven .
Jesus can be said according to Matthew 's genealogy as being the " seventh son thrice and one " of King David himself .
An impressive lineage indeed and one which testifies to the powerful influences astrology and numerology had on the ancient world and the early Christians in particular .
Pagan critics accused Christians of practicing chicanery and magic learned from the Masters in Egypt.
Matthew and Luke 's birth narratives also show astrological magic in practice by having Jesus born when the stars are correct in the heavens .
These myth - making elements liven up the gospels , but should not be taken literally .
Again , we can safely assume that these accretions which attach magical properties and visiting magicians to Jesus ' birth are stories designed to Hellenize Jesus for the pagan converts sake .

COCOA , Fla . 
A year ago , the Brevard County Schools ran a robust summer program here , with dozens of schools bustling with teachers and some 14,000 children practicing multiplication , reading Harry Potter and studying Spanish verbs , all at no cost to parents .
But this year Florida ’s budget crisis has gutted summer school .
Brevard classrooms are shuttered , and students like 11 - year - old Uvenka Jean - Baptiste , whose mother works in a nursing home , are spending their summer days at home , surfing television channels or loitering at a mall .
Nearly every school system in Florida has eviscerated or eliminated summer school this year , and officials are reporting sweeping cuts in states from North Carolina and Delaware to California and Washington .
The cuts have come as states across the country are struggling to approve budgets , and California ’s governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , declared a fiscal state of emergency on Wednesday .
“ We ’re seeing a disturbing trend of districts making huge cuts to summer school ; they ’re just devastating these programs , ” said Ron Fairchild , executive director of the National Center for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University .
“ It ’s having a disproportionate impact on low - income families . ”
Well , this is kinda embarrassing .
Well , I was with my ... friends ... and well I wo n't go into details .
But anyways , I need to know how I can get semen stains out of Grey Kalvin Klein underwear , Levies jeans , Red Nike sneakers , A black Hollister shirt , A leather belt , Pink high heels , Wheelies , A Bob 's brand mattress , Light brown carpet , Blue / Purple Couch , and headphones .
Can ....
Someone help me ?
P.S My parents are coming over for dinner next week .
" Did I know that Facebook is a CIA op ? "
Well , no , I ’m forced to admit , I did n't .
I did n’t know squat about Facebook , just that I was some time ago nudged by friends who are way more web 2.0-y than I am to join , so I did .
And then I clicked on something , and before I could dive for the plug on the computer “ It ” had sent a “ friend ” message to every name in my gmail account .
By mid-afternoon I knew a lot more about Facebook , in part courtesy a friend -- though not on Facebook ! -- named Joe Cannon .
I learned that Facebook is a CIA - funded IN - Q - TEL startup … and I already knew a few things about IN - Q— TEL :
They funded a startup in 2000 — a shell company that became the “ vehicle ” for a huge $ 40 million stock fraud called Skyway Communications — the company which ' just happened " to own a DC9 airliner busted in Mexico ’s Yucatan carrying 5.5 tons of cocaine several years ago .
I ’m told everyone involved agreed that this had been something of a faux pas .
In - Q- Tel and SkyWay ’s partner in the current unpleasantness was a San Diego defense contractor , Titan Corp . ( now L3 ) which had been the biggest backer of currently - imprisoned California Rep Randy ‘ Boo -Hoo ’ Cunningham .
Also :
A bogus investment bank in Texas called Argyll Equity , in business with an accused drug trafficker in Mexico who is so big he owns railroads in the States ( Jose Juan Segovia ) and a more down to earth ( but still big ! )
Garbage Guy from New Jersey , who got a billion dollars from WasteManagement , a tough company not known for even giving out the time of day for free .
Also involved are a passel of Saudi sheikhs and Gulf States Potentates with important - sounding appellations in front of their first names .
The reason I ’m writing is to say sorry .
All of these people now have your name .
Now that I have provided the CIA with every name in my gmail account -— and they did n’t even need to turn on the water ! —-
I ’m taking the rest of the day off .
I ’ll probably have a few drinks and maybe even get drunk , before the nighttime traffic begins to arrive with news of how many comrades have perished today in raids on now - compromised safe - houses , and all because I just wanted to not be the only person on Facebook who does n’t have any friends .
And all I can think of to say to the widows at the funerals is , “ I had no idea . ”
But of course that wo n’t be much comfort .
did
If you come here often , you probably know that I dislike social networking sites , especially Facebook .
So I was quite astonished to receive a Facebook invite from none other than Daniel Hopsicker , that exceptional and ornery independent investigator .
Did n't he know that Facebook was founded by In - Q - Tel , a CIA cut - out ?
His response ( reprinted with permission ) was addressed to all of his correspondents :
Well , I can't understand why or how Facebook managed to access every address in Daniel 's Gmail account .
Neither can I understand why so many people invite that kind of nightmare into their lives .
That said , the CIA hit squad has yet to arrive .
Then again , the dogbecome a bit sick again last night .
Perhaps there 's a connection .
Daniel Hopsicker has a new blog , http://www.danielhopsicker.tv/ .
He 's also being hit particularly hard by this recession .
So if there 's anything you can do to help , you could not find a worthier cause .
( Yes , I know that many of you are tapped out right now , times being what they are . )
Incidentally , I have , in previous posts , added a bit to the investigation of Argyll .
They have a biotech division which is behind a questionable cure for MS .
It 's a fascinating story -- one which involves a member of the Osmond family , believe it or not .
Congress urged to revise post -9/11 Real ID Act
“ States agree that Real ID is too rigid and needlessly expensive in mandating how states meet security goals , ” Napolitano said in testimony prepared for the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
Eighteen of the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks had state - issued identification cards such as driver licenses from Arizona , California , Florida , Virginia or Maryland .
The independent Sept. 11 commission recommended tightening driver 's license security arrangements – recommendations that proponents said were reflected in the Real ID legislation adopted during the Bush presidency .
Rep. F. John Sensenbrenner , R - Wis. , who proposed the Real ID legislation in 2005 , called Napolitano 's proposal a “ smokescreen ” that would “ turn back the clock while putting America at risk . ”
The Obama administration 's alternative , dubbed Pass ID , provides the “ same strong nationwide security standards ” but is less expensive and easier to implement , Napolitano contends .
States claim full compliance of the Bush administration 's Real ID would cost taxpayers $ 11 billion .
As former governor of Arizona before joining the Obama administration , Napolitano signed an Arizona law exempting the state from taking part .
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has taken steps to tighten issuance of state driver 's licenses by requiring non-citizens to provide proof of legal immigration status .
He also has expressed support for provisions of Real ID that enable security officers to verify individuals ' identities before providing them access to sensitive facilities .
The Obama - backed plan would still require states to issue driver 's licenses with digital photographs and machine - readable identity verification information such as bar codes .
States also would be required to validate applicants ' identities and legal immigration status .
But the plan would drop requirements that states maintain databases linked through a national hub , and states also would be relieved of a requirement to independently verify birth certificates used to get driver 's licenses .
The National Governors ' Association backs easing the restrictions .
But Rep. Lamar Smith , R - San Antonio , the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said Tuesday the proposed changes would return the nation “ to the pre-9/11 vulnerabilities . ”

44 arrested in massive Federal corruption sweep July 23 , 2009
Posted by jefhenningeresq in News Tags : Bribery
Today is a huge day for politics , New Jersey and criminal justice .
44 people have been arrested by Federal Authorities on charges of political corruption and money laundering .
This does not seem to be a small time case either .
All stories indicate that this is a high - volume case that may likely expand beyond the 44 people that have been charged .
In other words , it could be one of the most serious public corruption cases in New Jersey ’s history .
The case started as a bank fraud case against a member of the Syrian Jewish community in Deal , N.J .
That man became a federal informant and posed as a crooked real estate developer offering cash bribes to obtain government approvals and in the end , it apparently ensnared a lot of people .
Just some of the people arrested include :
— Peter Cammarano III , the newly elected mayor of Hoboken and an attorney , charged with
accepting $ 25,000 in cash bribes , including $ 10,000 last Thursday , from an undercover
cooperating witness .
— L. Harvey Smith , a New Jersey Assemblyman and recent mayoral candidate in Jersey City , charged along with an aide of taking $ 15,000 in bribes to help get approvals from high - level state agency officials for building projects .
— Daniel Van Pelt , a New Jersey Assemblyman , charged with accepting a $ 10,000 bribe .
— Dennis Elwell , mayor of Secaucus , charged with taking a $ 10,000 cash bribe .
— Anthony Suarez , mayor of Ridgefield and an attorney , charged with agreeing to accept a $ 10,000 corrupt cash payment for his legal defense fund .
— Louis Manzo , the recent unsuccessful challenger in the Jersey City mayoral election and former state Assemblyman , and his brother and political advisor Robert Manzo , both with taking $ 27,500 in corrupt cash payments for use in Louis Manzo ’s campaign .
— Leona Beldini , the Jersey City deputy mayor and a campaign treasurer , charged with taking $ 20,000 in conduit campaign contributions and other self - dealing in her official capacity .
— Eliahu Ben Haim , of Long Branch , N.J. , the principal rabbi of a synagogue in Deal , N.J. , charged with money laundering of proceeds derived from criminal activity .
— Saul Kassin , of Brooklyn , N.Y. , the chief rabbi of a synagogue in Brooklyn , New York , charged with money laundering of proceeds derived from criminal activity .
— Edmund Nahum , of Deal , N.J. , the principal rabbi of a synagogue in Deal , charged with money laundering of proceeds derived from criminal activity .
While not yet arrested , Federal authorities also searched the office and home of Joseph Doria who is the commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs .
Doria previously served a the Democratic mayor of Bayonne for nine years and represented Hudson County in the State Senate .
This case is going to create a lot of work for many lawyers in New Jersey .
These defendants have to make sure that these lawyers 1 ) know what they are doing , 2 ) have a plan and 3 ) have the time and ability to make it happen .
Of course , the clients just need one thing : money as it is going to take a lot of it to dig them out from the whole that they are in .
A lawyer really needs to put life on hold ( including weekends ) at the moment and dig into this case right away .
You need to determine if your client has any real exposure here .
Then , you need to determine if any of these 44 people can flip on your guy .
If so , its a race to see who can be first in the door for the best deal .
If any of them have a lawyer that does n’t know how to break down a case quickly but completely , they will either wait and thus get a bad deal or quickly sell out for a bad deal .
I suggest that as many of the lawyers on this case get together so that everyone is on the same page .
I want to know who is saying what about my client .
I also would want to look into entrapment issues and wiretaps and other recordings .
Should be very interesting to watch this play out .
Numerous stories from the Star Ledger are here .
LC Glenton says the Afghan war is unjust
3 August 2009 Christopher King explains why it is the legal obligation of soldiers and officers who have been ordered to carry out illegal orders to disobey them , in accordance with the Nuremburg Principles , and why everyone , from army commanders to rank - and file soldiers , are personally responsible for the orders they carry out .
Lance - Corporal Joe Glenton , facing court - martial for refusing to be redeployed to Afghanistan , has written to Prime Minister Gordon Brown , saying in part :
The war in Afghanistan is not reducing the terrorist risk , far from improving Afghan lives it is bringing death and devastation to their country .
Britain has no business there .
I do not believe that our cause in Afghanistan is just or right .
I implore you , sir , to bring our soldiers home .
Having served in Afghanistan , unlike Gordon Brown who has no services experience , Lance - Corporal ( LC ) Glenton knows what he is talking about .
Further , he says :
It is my primary concern that the courage and tenacity of my fellow soldiers has become a tool of American foreign policy .
LC Glenton is clearly a young man of intelligence and thoughtfulness .
Unlike Gordon Brown who stands to be paid off in cash by the Americans and Israelis like his friend Anthony Blair , LC Glenton has earned the right to form , hold and express his views on this war .
And to act on them .
Of course , there should be an army hearing of some sort but it is absolutely improper and unjust to subject LC Glenton to court martial proceedings .
He has expressed views consistent with the Nuremberg Principles that have the intention of outlawing unjust warfare and inhumanitarian acts related to war .
I have previously commented on them here .
The Nuremberg Principles have been adopted by the United Nations whose charter has been endorsed by the United Kingdom .
They are therefore part of both international law and UK law .
Whether LC Glenton specifically invokes them or not , they apply to his case and it is his right and duty to refuse to participate in a war that he believes is unjust and " ... far from improving Afghan lives , it is bringing death and devastation to their country " .
What is disturbing is the attitude of our armed forces to the Nuremberg Principles .
Flight - Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall - Smith defended his refusal to redeploy to Iraq on the basis that the war was illegal .
Judge - Advocate Jack Bayliss refused to accept that argument .
The services � ruling in such cases is that only persons who have the ability to shape strategy and make executive decisions may be held responsible for war crimes .
That must necessarily be a false interpretation of the Nuremberg principles .
Since it is governments that engage in war it would only be government and armed services leaders who would be potentially responsible for war crimes .
If war crimes should occur , then according to Jack Bayliss�s interpretation , those ordered to carry out such crimes have no right to refuse nor judge whether or not their acts are legal .
Following that view , should war crimes occur there can be no inhibition on such criminal behaviour while it is occurring .
It can be judged only after the event , as in the case of the Iraq invasion .
As no government�s leaders will convict themselves of war crimes and they have the power to prevent others in their countries from doing so , judgement necessarily rests with other countries .
In practice therefore , outside Jack Bayliss�s courtroom , without provocation from Afghanistan , US and UK drones are blasting Afghan wedding parties to shreds of flesh , towns are being levelled by artillery and carpet bombing , every moving Afghan can be shot , women and children are being raped and murdered and the entire Pashtun population is being bombed into submission to their invaders � but those who do it under orders have no right to refuse .
Nor are they allowed to recognize that what they are doing is wrong .
It is their leaders � responsibility ; they must follow orders .
So who is able to judge the United States , UK and EU in respect of the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions ?
There is no - one to judge the most powerful military country in the world or those European countries that have allied themselves to its wars of aggression .
The Nuremberg Principles evidently apply only to vanquished or small , weak nations such as Liberia�s Charles Taylor or Serbia�s Slobodan Milosevic .
If so , they and international law are meaningless .
The US , UK and EU would be above the law , and that can not be correct .
Judge - Advocate Jack Bayliss�s interpretation is therefore plainly absurd , proved by reductio ad absurdum , which means what it looks like .
It is not good enough to hold public enquiries long after the event as Gordon Brown is doing with his Iraq war enquiry .
He initially stated publicly that it would be held in secret and no blame would be attributed .
Due to public outrage , he has agreed to hold it in public but it was plainly intended to be a coverup of Anthony Blair�s lies and his own responsibilities , among others , and that is what it will be .
Barack Obama is covering up the details of torture in his Guantanamo torture facility and will punish neither the torturers nor those who ordered torture .
Indeed , US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has threatened that if British resident Binyam Mohammed�s allegations of torture by the US in Morocco , with MI5 collusion , are made public , " ... it would damage intelligence sharing between Britain and the US " .
In other words , he was tortured by the US , the US wants a coverup and there is no doubt that Britain will comply .
Nine innocent Uighurs , imprisoned for seven years , are still there .
Obama is afraid that they will tell of what they have seen .
These are two of the many instances demonstrating that governments cannot be trusted to judge themselves .
Contrary to Judge advocate Jack Bayliss�s view , it is obvious that if illegal orders are to be recognized , illegal wars prevented and war crimes halted in the course of their execution , the best persons to do this are those who have been ordered to carry them out , at whatever level of responsibility they might be .
Whistle - blowers and refusers are essential and they must have the legal right to carry out those functions � which the Nuremberg Principles gives them .
Rather than the refusal to carry out an order being judged to be illegal , it is illegal and , in common - sense terms , outrageous , to deprive anyone of the right to refuse an order that he believes to be illegal .
The court martial judgement and punishment of Flight - Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall - Smith was therefore wrong according to international law , its intention and its practice .
Services personnel are now drawn from the best educated and best - informed UK population in history .
They and we , the public , cannot be treated as idiots .
Everyone now has access to sources of information other than government propaganda and we see plainly the law being distorted to favour the rich and powerful and its contempt for justice .
We see our politicians for the cheats and liars they are and it is becoming evident after the illegal Iraqi and Afghan wars that UK military forces and NATO are in fact tools of American foreign policy .
Why should thinking men and women collude with American expansionism against the interests of their own country ?
Why does the UK military do so when everyone can see plainly that it is engaged in war crimes as defined by the Nuremberg Principles ?
Lance - Corporal Glenton has taken a stance that is lawful no matter what the legal precedents or desires of his officers might be .
On all the evidence in the public domain , his interpretation of his and his comrades� roles as tools of American foreign policy is accurate .
But not entirely so .
At the strategic level , the situation is in fact considerably worse and I will return to this in another article .
We should note that LC Glenton is not a conscientious objector ; he is a man with a conscience .
I would conjecture that he is willing to fight in defence of this country and probably in defence of allies under attack .
He is not willing to fight a war that he has seen with his own eyes and judged from his own knowledge to be unjust .
He is right in not doing so .
That is the intention of the Nuremburg Principles whether politicians , the armed services and government lawyers , who seek to evade rather than keep the law , like it or not .
Our politicians have lost all credibility due to their lies , cover-ups , their casual despatch of our soldiers to their deaths in wars of aggression , collusion with America in kidnapping or " extraordinary rendition " and now we are learning , collusion with America in torture , to the discredit of MI5 , as well as covering it up .
Nor should we forget the enormous number of deaths , refugees and incredible destruction in Iraq and Afghanistan for which they are responsible .
Without Anthony Blair�s and Gordon Brown�s promotion of these wars with the collusion of most of our political class , they would not have happened in their present form and might not have been possible at all .
To distract from the high number of recent troop deaths in Afghanistan the government has commenced a smokescreen debate about whether they have enough helicopters , the correct equipment or the latest item , too many tasks .
This is all nonsense .
They are dying because they should not be there as invaders , killing Afghans in their own country .
Our politicians are write - offs .
The question now is whether Britain�s armed forces will continue to follow the United States into a pit of ethical , social and economic perdition or abandon that failed state to demonstrate independence , ethics , honour and not least , loyalty to the UK in leaving Afghanistan immediately .
If our armed services do not have these qualities , they have nothing .
They are merely mercenaries , who will kill on behalf of whoever pays them .
Rather than court - martialling Lance - Corporal Glenton , he and Flight - Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall - Smith are examples for the Chiefs of Defence Staff to follow .

Whistleblower org says FBI / DoJ attempting ' censorship , ' trying to ' silence whistleblower ' answering ' lawful subpoena '
Letters from FBI , Edmonds attorney posted ...
Brad Friedman Byon 8/7/2009 , 2:26 pm PT
[ Update 8:08 pm PT : The DoJ has now attempted to intercede , on behalf of the FBI , with the Ohio Election Commission .
Details , and letters between DoJ and OEC now posted here ...]
The BRAD BLOG has obtained both the FBI 's response to FBI translator - turned - whistleblower Sibel Edmonds ' notice of her intention to give a deposition this Saturday in response to a subpoena she received in a case before the Ohio Elections Commission ( OEC ) .
We 've also been given exclusive access to her attorneys ' response in turn , which is to be officially released later this afternoon .
The FBI stated its objection to Edmonds ' plans to testify in a two - page letter [ PDF ] on Thursday , sent to Edmonds ' attorney Stephen Kohn , at the National Whistleblowers Legal Defense & Education Fund .
Edmonds and her attorneys , however , in their own two - page letter [ PDF ] , say the objections raised so far by the agency are not sufficient to block Edmonds from " truthfully answer[ing ] questions while under oath pursuant to a lawful subpoena " on Saturday morning in D.C. as scheduled .
Their press release [ PDF ] , to be issued publicly later today , accuses the FBI and DoJ of attempting " censorship " and trying to " silence [ a ] whistleblower . "
As we reported in detail on Wednesday , Edmonds ' attorneys had notified the Department of Justice earlier this week , in a hand - delivered letter of declaration [ PDF ] , that she intended to testify in the pending Schmidt v. Krikorian case about the information she has concerning infiltration of the U.S. Government by agents of Turkey .
She informed the DoJ of her intentions to move forward , unless the DoJ re-invoked the " state secrets " claim that the Bush Administration had twice used to gag any public testimony , her own whistleblower suit , and all other disclosures in regard to information she was privy to during her employ as a linguistics specialist with the FBI following 9/11 .
So far , the DoJ has not done so .
As of this afternoon , Edmonds tells The BRAD BLOG she still " absolutely " plans to testify ...
" As you know , your client executed a Basic Ordering Agreement ( BOA ) with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) which applies to disclosure of any information relating to the services she provided to the FBI , " the August 6th letter to Edmonds attorney Stephen Kohn , from FBI General Consel Valerie Caproni reads .
" That agreement expressly prohibits disclosure ( without prior approval from the Director of the FBI or his delegate ) of information acquired as part of the performance of her contract or her contractor status .
She also signed a Security Acknowledgment Form and Classified Information Non-disclosure Agreement . "
Caproni notes that Edmonds ' agreements with the agency requires the " approval of the Director of the FBI before making any disclosure of information ( oral or written ) to any unauthorized party by presenting the full text of the proposed disclosure to the Director ... at least thirty days prior to disclosure . "
" The purpose of the agreement your client signed , " writes Caproni , " is not to prevent her from speaking about the FBI , but to prevent the disclosure of information where disclosure is contrary to law , regulation or national security . "
She concludes " the FBI has not and will not waive " requirement for compliance with the BOA , Security Acknowledgment form and Classified Information Non-disclosure agreement , and thus , " she does not have approval for any disclosure of any information covered by " those documents .
The " CLASSIFICATION " of the letter itself , as hand - checked on the FBI 's facsimile cover sheet , is specified as " Sensitive . "
Edmonds ' attorneys , however , have rejected Caproni 's letter as insufficient to keep her from testifying , and have requested copies of the employment documents referenced .
" In order for Ms. Edmonds ' counsel to consider your request it is essential that you provide me with full copies [ of ] the document (s ) you claim to prohibit Ms. Edmonds from testifying under compulsion of a subpoena , " Michael D. Kohn wrote on behalf of Edmonds .
He goes on to note that if those documents are not provided by " close of business today " they will presume they may go ahead with the deposition .
" We also require that you produce a copy of Ms. Edmond 's employment agreement as this document may impact on Ms. Edmonds ' ability to testify .
I trust that this information wil be promptly provided .
However , if the documents are not received by close of business today we will interpret this failure as a release of the government 's right to suppress Ms. Edmonds ' ability to truthfully answer questions while under oath pursuant to a lawful subpoena . "
Kohn writes that he believes " the Agency 's pre-publication clearance rules " do not preclude " oral disclosure , including oral testimony , " such as that which will be required by Edmonds in response to questioning at tomorrow 's scheduled deposition .
While he notes that " Ms. Edmonds will attempt , to the best of her ability , [ to ] not disclose classified information , " her " recollection and judgment as to what information may be subject to lawful non-disclosure would , at best , be imperfect . "
Edmonds told
The BRAD BLOG today that she " absolutely intends to answer any questions , unless it 's about intelligence gathering or informants . "
But , since " that has nothing to do with this case , " she did n't anticipate any such questions .
She did say , however , that she was " obligated to respond to any questions that come out about any of the people in the ' State Secrets Privilege Gallery . ' "
The " State Secrets Privilege Gallery " referenced is a webpage of unnamed photographs --- featuring current and former Congressmembers , high - ranking State and Defense Dept. officials , as well as lobbyists and agents from Turkish public interest groups --- which Edmonds posted in 2007 .
The names of most of those officials , and their ties to Edmonds own whistleblower case , have been detailed by Edmonds expert Luke Ryland here .
Some of the names , said to have been illegally tied to Turkish influences , include former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert ( R- IL ) , Congressmen Dan Burton ( R- IN ) , Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , and Stephen Solarz ( D - NY ) , as well as Bush Administration officials such as Richard Perle , Marc Grossman , Douglas Feith , and others .
Kohn continues in his reply to Caproni to detail the " three avenues available [ to the FBI and DoJ ] to guard against such inadvertent disclosure [ of classified information ] : 1 ) file a request for a protective order with the body that issued the subpoena ; 2 ) file a motion to quash the deposition ; and 3 ) dispatch legal counsel to the deposition capable of raise [ sic ] appropriate objections . "
He concludes by notifying the FBI that " failure to take appropriate action ... may be construed as a waiver of any legitimate basis the FBI may have to keep Ms. Edmonds from testifying about certain matters central to an important legal dispute . "
Both his and Caproni's letters are posted in full at the end of this article , along with the press release from Edmonds ' attorney team at that National Whistleblower Center , in which Kohn alleges " The thrust of the government 's action is aimed at self - censorship of a witness .
As far as we are concerned , if the government wants censorship then it must do it itself as Ms. Edmonds will have no part in censorship . "
" The First Amendment protects Sibel Edmonds ' right to testify truthfully without government intervention , " says Kohn in the statement , " and we are disheartened that the Justice Department 's actions evidence a different approach . "
* * *
The matter of the " state secrets " privilege , invoked by the Bush Administration twice against Edmonds , is separate from the issues of non-disclosure involved with her employment at the FBI .
In other words , Edmonds could choose to dispute the claims being made by the FBI and give her deposition , as required by the legal subpoena , as she currently plans , in the event that the Obama Administration 's DoJ declines to invoke the " state secrets " claim again .
Similarly , while the FBI might have allowed Edmonds request to testify , that testimony could then have been blocked by the invocation of the " state secrets " privilege by the DoJ .
We have no word yet on whether the DoJ will attempt to invoke that " privilege " again .
Though , as we noted in an update to our Wednesday night story , Edmonds explained to The BRAD BLOG that during her experience with the cases of other whistleblowers , as founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition ( NSWBC ) , she has seen DoJ attorneys arrive at the last minute , just before scheduled testimony , leaving no time to oppose or challenge such an order .
It is also possible for a DoJ attorney to be present , and object on a question by question basis , as referenced in Kohn 's reply to Caproni , at which time Edmonds would have to confer with her attorney as to whether or not she 'd choose to answer the question anyway , despite the DoJ objection .
Another possibility is that U.S. Rep. Jean Schmidt ( R - OH - 2nd District ) could be facing pressure to drop her case against Steve Krikorian --- who challenged her as an independent in 2008 and plans to do so again as a Democrat in 2010 --- entirely , given the potentially enormous can of worms she may be about to open here .
As co-chair of the Congressional Turkish Caucus , it 's not unlikely she 's facing some presure from her Turkish supporters to do just that .
Krikorian 's campaign is being challenged by Schmidt in the Ohio Election Commission proceeding , for his 2008 campaign allegation that she accepted " blood money " from Turkish interests to help derail a vote in the U.S.
House over whether the murder of some 1.5 million Armenians by the Turks during WWI amounted to a " genocide . "
Krikorian announced [ PDF ] this week that his attorneys intend to ask Edmonds at the deposition about evidence she obtained while employed by the FBI concerning whether :
1 . The Government of Turkey had illegally infiltrated and influenced various U.S. government institutions and officials , including the Department of State , the Department of Defense and individual members of the United States Congress 2 .
The Government of Turkey had engaged in practices and policies that were inimical to American interests and had in fact resulted in both the direct and indirect loss of American lives 3 . Turkish American cultural and business groups conduct operations with direct and indirect support from the Government of Turkey
A great deal of information based on Edmonds ' case ( much of it linked to in our previous post on this matter , and in many Edmonds - related articles in the years prior ) suggests that a number of current and former members of Congress and high - ranking State and Defense Dept. officials , as well as lobbyists for various Turkish public policy organizations , have been bribed , or have otherwise infiltrated the U.S. government towards the end of obtaining nuclear secrets for sale on the black market in Pakistan , Turkey , Libya , Iran , and elsewhere .

Edmonds told
The BRAD BLOG this afternoon that she believes she has an obligation to respond to questions raised during the deposition .
" This is not about being idealistic or heroic , " she told us .
" I am responsible to inform the citizens , and these people 's constituents about who they 're voting for .
I 'm responsible to the citizens of this country and the Constitution .
I 'm going to do my best answer to those citizens , especially when it comes to important issues of the Constitution . "
While the deposition will not be open to the media , as the National Whistleblower Center had originally announced , attorneys from all parties , as well as Edmonds and Krikorian , intend to be available both before and immediately following the deposition on Saturday to take any questions from media .
Unless blocked somehow between now and then by the DoJ , the testimony is currently set to commence at 10:30 am on Saturday morning ( 8/8/09 ) , at the National Whistleblowers Center , 3238 P St. NW , in Washington D.C .

Wasington , DC 20007 Re : Sibel Edmonds Dear Mr. Kohn :
This letter is being sent in response to your undated letter addressed to Attorney General Holder with regard to the anticipated testimony of your client , Sibel Edmonds , before the Ohio Elections Commission ( Commission ) on Saturday Authust 8 , 2009 .
The letter included a copy of Ms. Edmonds ' proposed affidavit , which she seeks to submit to the commission .
You had the letter and affidavit delivered to the Department of Justice on August 3 , 2009 .
The FBI received them on August 4 .
As you know , your client executed a Basic Ordering Agreement ( BOA ) with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) which applies to disclosure of any information relating to the services she provided to the FBI .
That agreement expressly prohibits disclosure ( without prior approval from the Director of the FBI or his delegate ) of information acquired as part of the performance of her contract or her contractor status .
She also signed a Security Acknowledgment Form and Classified Information Non-disclosure Agreement .
When signing the BOA your client agreed to request the approval of the Director of the FBI before making any disclosure of information ( oral or written ) to any unauthorized party by presenting the full text of the proposed disclosure to the Director of the FBI at least thirty days prior to the disclosure .
The purpose of the agreement your client signed is not to prevent her from speaking about the FBI , but to prevent the disclosure of information where disclosure is contrary to law , regulation or national security .
Compliance with the BOA , Security Acknowledgment form and the Classified Information Non-disclosure agreement are the obligation of Ms. Edmonds and the FBI has not and will not waive that compliance .
Your client did not comply with the terms of those documents .
Therefore she does not have approval for any disclosure of any information covered by the BOA , the Security Acknowledgment form and the Classified Information Non-disclosure agreement .
Sincerely ,

Washington D.C. 20535 Re : Sibel Edmonds Dear Ms. Caproni :
This letter responds to your letter of August 6 , 2009 , and specifically to your assertion that Sibel Edmonds " does not have approval for any disclosure of any information covered by the BOA [ Basic Ordering Agreement ] , the Security Acknowledgment form and the Classified Information Non-disclosure agreement . "
In order for Ms. Edmonds ' counsel to consider your request it is essential that you provide me with full copies the document ( s ) you claim to prohibit Ms. Edmonds from testifying under compulsion of a subpoena .
We also require that you produce a copy of Ms. Edmond 's employment agreement as this document may impact on Ms. Edmonds ' ability to testify .
I trust that this information wil be promptly provided .
However , if the documents are not received by close of business today we will interpret this failure as a release of the government 's right to suppress Ms. Edmonds ' ability to truthfully answer questions while under oath pursuant to a lawful subpoena .
In any event , consistent with my understanding of the Agency 's pre-publication clearance rules , oral disclosure , including oral testimony , is permitted without prior review .
Consistent with the Agency 's pre-publication rules , Ms. Edmonds will attempt , to the best of her ability , not disclose classified information .
However , Ms. Edmonds ' recollection and judgement as to what information may be subject to lawful non-disclosure would , at best , be imperfect .
As such , the FBI has at least three avenues available to guard against such inadvertent disclosure : 1 ) file a request for a protective order with the body that issued the subpoena ; 2 ) file a motion to quash the deposition ; and 3 ) dispatch legal counsel to the deposition capable of raise [ sic ] appropriate objections .
In the past the Agency denied Ms. Edmonds her right to a day in court by raising the States Secrets Privilege .
If the government is still of the opinion that the state secrets privilege still applies then it is up to you to raise this privilege with the necessary accompanying affidavit to the body that issued the subpoena , the Ohio Election Commission .
It is our understanding that the States Secrets Privilege is not portable and , as such , the failure to renew the privilege concerning information Ms. Edmonds learned while employed would have to be raised in this forum as well .
We hereby place you on notice that the failure to take appropriate action ( i.e. , seeking to quash the deposition , dispatching legal counsel to the deposition , or raising the States Secrets Privilege before the Commission ) may be construed as a waiver of any legitimate basis the FBI may have to keep Ms. Edmonds from testifying about certain matters central to an important legal dispute .
Moreover , the failure to send an attorney to the deposition risks the inadvertent disclosure of information as Ms. Edmonds may not be aware whether certain information would qualify as confidential .

Sibel Edmonds Fights To Testify National Whistleblowers Legal Defense and Education Fund Contests FBI and Department of Justice Attempts to Silence Whistleblower Washington , D.C. August 7 , 2009 .
Today the National Whistleblower Legal Defense and Education Fund fought efforts by the FBI and the Department of Justice to prevent Sibel D. Edmonds from testifying in a case of alleged election fraud .
Sibel Edmonds is scheduled to testify before the Ohio Elections Commission in response to a subpoena in the Schmidt v. Krikorian case .
Both the Department of Justice and the FBI are attempting to halt her from testifying .
On behalf or Ms. Edmonds , the Fund sent a letter earlier this week requesting that Attorney General Holder independently review the basis upon which the State Secrets privilege was initially invoked against Ms. Edmonds .
Yesterday , Valerie Caproni , General Counsel of the FBI , and Vesper Mei , Senior Counsel with the Department of Justice responded by claiming that the subpoena to testify served on Edmonds was invalid and sought to bar her from appearing .
The DOJ claimed that that Edmonds is under " no compulsion " to testify in the Krikorian case and the FBI asserted that she , " does not have approval for any disclosure of any information . "
Neither the Justice Department nor the FBI has stated why testimony in a case of alleged election fraud would involve State Secrets and / or involve national security .
According to Sibel Edmonds ' counsel , Michael D. Kohn ( President of the National Whistleblowers Center ) , " The thrust of the government 's action is aimed at self - censorship of a witness .
As far as we are concerned , if the government wants censorship then it must do it itself as Ms. Edmonds will have no part in censorship . "
To this end , Edmonds ' counsel responded to the FBI and DOJ stating : " We hereby place you on notice that the failure to take appropriate action ( i.e. , seeking to quash the deposition dispatching legal counsel to the deposition , or raising the States Secrets Privilege before the Commission ) may be construed as a waiver of any legitimate basis the FBI may have to keep Ms. Edmonds from testifying " and " If you believe that the FBI or the Justice Department has any legal basis to halt the deposition or to prevent Ms. Edmonds from testifying , please take whatever action you deem necessary in that regard .
The responsibility for doing so is yours not Ms. Edmonds . "
According to Mr. Kohn : " The First Amendment protects Sibel Edmonds ' right to testify truthfully without government intervention and we are disheartened that the Justice Department 's actions evidence a different approach . " ***
UPDATE 8:08 pm PT : The DoJ has now attempted to intercede themselves , on behalf of the FBI , with the Ohio Election Commission .
Details , and letters between DoJ and OEC now posted here ...
The modern high - level - language programmer thinks ( if he is of the thinking kind ) of low - level system architecture as a stubborn enemy , or , at best , a harsh and indifferent force of nature .
Anyone who suggests that everyday desktop apps ought to be written directly in a CPU 's native instruction set is viewed as much the same kind of lunatic as someone who brings up swimming as a practical means of crossing the Atlantic on a tourist vacation .
Yet , unlike the Atlantic , the ocean of low - level machine ugliness which we perilously cross in our HLL boats is one of our own creation .
Un-creating it is far from impossible .
It is not even a particularly deep problem .
There are viable alternatives to the present way of building computers .
Those in the know sometimes say that today 's dominant architectures are " built to run C. "
In order to fully appreciate the truth of this statement , one must put on an archaeologist 's hat and unearth some which were not .
There are many interesting lessons we could learn from the ruins of computer architecture 's Age of Exploration .
Let 's examine the Scheme - 79 chip : the only architecture I know of which was truly elegant inside and out .
It eschewed the compromises of its better - known contemporary , the MIT Lisp Machine ( and its later incarnations at LMI and Symbolics ) - internally microcoded stack machines , whose foundational abstractions differed minimally from those found in today 's CPUs and VMs .
The experimental S79 fetched and executed CONS cells directly - and was coupled to a continuously - operating hardware garbage collector .
I will not describe the details of this timeless beauty here - the linked paper is eminently readable , and includes enough detail to replicate the project in its entirety .
Anyone who truly wishes to understand what we have lost is highly encouraged to study the masterpiece .
Here is one noteworthy tidbit :
" A more speculative approach for improving the performance of our interpreter is to optimize the use of the stack by exploiting the observation that the stack discipline has regularities which make many of the stack operations redundant .
In the caller - saves convention ( which is what the SCHEME - 79 chip implements ) the only reason why a register is pushed onto the stack is to protect its contents from being destroyed by the unpredictable uses of the register during the recursive evaluation of a subexpression .
Therefore one source of redundant stack operations is that a register is saved even though the evaluation of the subexpression may not affect the contents of that register .
If we could look ahead in time we could determine whether or not the register will retain its contents through the unknown evaluation .
This is one standard kind of optimization done by compilers , but even a compiler cannot optimize all cases because the execution path of a program depends in general on the data being processed .
However , instead of looking ahead , we can try to make the stack mechanism lazy in that it postpones pushing a register until its contents are about to be destroyed .
The key idea is that each register has a state which indicates whether its contents are valuable .
If such a valuable register is about to be assigned , it is at that moment pushed .
In order to make this system work , each register which may be pushed has its own stack so that we can decouple the stack disciplines for each of the registers .
Each register - stack combination can be thought of as having a state which encodes some of the history of previous operations .
It is organized as a finite - state automaton which mediates between operation requests and the internal registers and stack .
This automaton serves as an on - the - fly peephole optimizer , which recognizes certain patterns of operations within a small window in time and transforms them so as to reduce the actual number of stack operations performed . "
What we are looking at is a trivial ( in retrospect ) method for entirely relieving compilers of the burden of stack discipline : a necessary first step towards relieving programmers of the burden of compilers .
A systems programmer or electrical engineer educated in the present Dark Age might ask why we ought to demand relief from CPUs which force machine code to " drive stick " in register allocation and stack discipline .
After all , have we not correctly entrusted these tasks to optimizing compilers ?
Should we not continue even further in this direction ?
This is precisely the notion I wish to attack .
Relegating the task of optimization to a compiler permanently confines us to the dreary and bug - ridden world of static languages - or at the very least , makes liberation from the latter nontrivial .
So long as most optimization takes place at compile time , builders of dynamic environments will be forced to choose between hobbled performance and the Byzantine hack of JIT compilation .
The instruction set of a properly designed computer must be isomorphic to a minimal , elegant high - level programming language .
This will eliminate the need for a complex compiler , enabling true reflectivity and introspection at every level .
Once every bit of code running on the machine is subject to runtime inspection and modification by the operator , the rotting refuse heaps of accidental complexity we are accustomed to dealing with in software development will melt away .
Self - modification will take its rightful place as a mainstream programming technique , rather than being confined to malware and Turing Tarpit sideshows .
Just imagine what kind of things one could do with a computing system unpolluted by mutually - hostile black box code ; one which could be understood in its entirety , the way you understand arithmetic .
Today 's CPU designers have mind - boggling swaths of silicon real estate at their disposal .
Yet they are shackled by braindead architectural dogmas and the market 's demand for backwards - compatibility with a 1970s traffic light controller .
This scenario could have been lifted straight from a 1950s science fiction comedy .
The foundations of the computing systems we use are built of ossified crud , and this is a genuine crime against the human mind .
How much effort ( of highly ingenious people , at that ) is wasted , simply because one cannot press a Halt switch and display / modify the source code of everything currently running ( or otherwise present ) on a machine ?
How many creative people - ones who might otherwise bring the future to life - are employed as what amounts to human compilers ?
Neither programmers nor users are able to purchase a modern computer which behaves sanely - at any price .
We have allowed what could have once become the most unbridled creative endeavor known to man short of pure mathematics to become a largely janitorial trade ; what could have been the greatest amplification of human intellect in all of history - comparable only to the advent of written language - is now confined to imitating and trivially improving on the major technological breakthroughs of the 19th century - the telegraph , telephone , phonograph , and typewriter .
Brokenness and dysfunction of a magnitude largely unknown for centuries in more traditional engineering trades has become the norm in computer programming .
Dijkstra believed that this state of affairs is the result of allowing people who fall short of top - notch in conventional mathematical ability into the profession .
I disagree entirely .
Electronics was once a field which demanded mathematical competence on the level of a world - class experimental physicist .
Fortunately , a handful of brilliant minds gave us some very effective abstractions for simplifying electrical work , enabling those who had not devoted their lives to the study of physics to conceive ground - breaking electronic inventions .
Nothing of the kind has happened in computing .
Most of what passes for widely - applicable abstractions in the field serves only to hamstring language expressiveness and thus to straightjacket cube farm laborers into galley - slave fungibility , rather than to empower the mind by compartmentalizing detail .
( OOP is the most obvious example of such treachery . )
As for invention , almost everyone has forgotten what genuine creativity in software development even looks like .
Witness , for instance , the widespread belief that Linux exemplifies anything original .
I predict that software complexity will eventually cross over the border into the truly unmanageable , and we will begin to see absurdities worthy of Idiocracy .
Perhaps this time has already come .
I realize that my claim to competence at re-inventing computing from scratch is tenuous at best ; yet thus far almost no one else is willing to even contemplate the possibility that we are faced with systemic problems which cannot be solved in any other way , and will continue to worsen .

Doc dump details AF1's NYC mishap
Air Force brass and White House officials were so infatuated by the idea of flying Air Force One around the Statue of Liberty for a photo shoot that they lost sight of the chaos such a mission could cause on the ground , according to documents the Air Force released Friday evening .

While the head of the White House Military Office , Louis Caldera , was essentially sacked in May , the e-mail exchanges make clear that the ill - fated April 27 mission was really the brainchild of the lead pilot of Air Force One , Col. Scott Turner .
The documents show that the Air Force carefully tracked the explosion of negative press that ensued after panicked New Yorkers feared the low - flying , circling planes were part of a Sept. 11 - like attack .
The e-mails also show various components of the bureaucracy trying to steer clear of the fallout .
Of those who knew about the planned flight , only an Air Force reserve Major General , Brian Keenan , seems to have foresight into the response the photo op inspired .
" NYC populace can be sensitive to airplanes that appear lower than normal or on tracks not normally seen over the NYC area .
Influenced by 9/11 , " the Newark - based Continental pilot wrote two days before the starcrossed AF1 sortie .
Many segments of the documents were redacted to protect " deliberative process . "
For whatever reason , the white - out seems particularly prevalent surrounding a number of exchanges relating to an inquiry about the flight from Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . )
Here 's a look at some of the juiciest pages among the more than 1000 released Friday .
Several of the excerpts below can be seen in the slideshow at the left of the page .
p. 37 On April 24 , White House military office aide George Mulligan says he wishes he could come along .
p. 38 Turner promises free 8 x 10 glossies courtesy of Boeing .
p. 154 " Show folks we were not involved , " one military aide writes after the incident .
p. 155 " Strongly suggest we steer clear of this flail , " one National Guard official says , fearing it will look " like we own this . "
p. 166 " To say this is being beaten like a dead horse is an understatement , " a combat information specialist writes of the media response to the flight .
p. 167 A round - up of media attention notes : " 3 tweets per minute . "
p. 175 An e-mail says two airborne AF1 photo shoots were planned , the one in NY and one in DC .
p. 196 An Air Force major says the pass - the - buck stance is making everyone involved look like the Three Stooges .
p. 419 Maj Gen Brian Meenan , AF reserve , tried to warn about fallout , but is told coordination with local officials is complete .
p. 456 Turner signs on to describing the mission as " continuation training , " not just a photo op .
p. 467 Turner urges spokespeople to " stick with the ' canned ' response . "
p. 496 Turner defends the mission .
" The Vc - 25 has not done a photo shoot of this sort since right after aircraft delivery ( 1990 ) . "
p. 508 Turner runs the flight by Air Mobility Command General Arthur Lichte , who replies : " Will love to see the results of the photo shoot of my home town .
Be sure to smile . "
Turner says the purpose of the flight is to update photos in the " hospitality package " given to guests on Air Force One and that the update is his idea .
p. 512 After the flight , Turner emails Lichte : " As was expected , all of the media has jumped on this as a negative thing . "
The Banking Crisis Cometh
The bank failure scene in the U.S. turned a shade uglier over the weekend .
By this time tomorrow , it ’ll probably be even worse .
For starters , Guaranty Financial of Texas went belly up late Friday and secured a spot in the history books .
With $ 13 billion in “ assets , ” the bank is the third largest to fail this year and tied for the 11th biggest bank failure in U.S. history .
Even more interestingly , the FDIC brokered Guaranty ’s assets to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria , a bank from northern Spain .
We ’re surprised on two fronts here : 1 ) That a bank from Spain — strapped with double - digit unemployment and a wretched housing bust — wants to bring their euros to I.O.U.S.A. 2 ) That BBVA already has a huge presence in Texas .
With this acquisition , they will be the fourth largest banking chain in the Lone Star State .
That could be an interesting trend to watch .
Three other banks failed along side Guaranty : CaptialSouth , First Coweta and ebank .
That brings the yearly total to 81 .
This should put the FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund on its last legs .
At the beginning of 2008 , the FDIC ’s bank failure war chest had over $ 52 billion .
At the end of the March 2009 , the last time the FDIC has given us a look into the DIF , they had $ 13 billion left .
60 banks have failed since , including Guaranty and Colonial , which by themselves took out half of that remaining $ 13 billion .
Only the FDIC can say with accuracy if there is any money left , but this chart gives you a pretty good idea of how the trend is shaping up :
The DIF does have a source of income — it taxes member banks a significant “ insurance fee . ”
But we have to think that the DIF is still in bad shape , perhaps even empty … and that the FDIC will soon be hitting up someone ( Tim Geithner , Joe Taxpayer and / or U.S. banks ) to refill their coffer .
The FDIC will provide their second - quarter report tomorrow , which among other things will include a look into the DIF and their infamous bank “ problem list ” … could get ugly .
We ’ll keep you up to speed .
“ Recent bank failures remind us of the problem loans festering on small and regional bank balance sheets , ” writes Dan Amoss , “ and that many of them are marking loans at fantasy levels .
The secondary market value for some of the worst loans , like construction loans , is 20 or 30 cents on the dollar .
“ There ’s a backlog of at least a few hundred insolvent banks that need to be shut down and sold into stronger hands .
Bank stock bulls are ignoring the credit losses yet to be recognized , so there are lots of shorting opportunities in the sector .
Many banks will not be able to “ earn their way out ” of their credit losses .
“ The problem is , there are n’t many strong buyers with lots of capital out there .
Those that are , like private equity groups , are buying only after the FDIC agrees to eat most of the credit losses , and the buyer is gifted with the remaining shell — the profit - making engine of spread lending .
“ It ’s understandable that the FDIC does n’t want much publicity about the Deposit Insurance Fund ; it wants to maintain the public ’s confidence that it can ‘ insure ’ all deposits with just a few basis points of capital reserves and skimpy premium income .
The fund is clearly not adequate to cover the bank failures still in the pipeline , so we ’ll see another ‘ special assessment ’ imposed on all other banks , which will ultimately be passed on to depositors via lower interest rates . ”
Critical banking analysis has been one of the hallmarks of Dan ’s Strategic Short Report .
His brand of scrutiny gave readers 162 % gains betting against Allied Capital , 220 % on PNC Financial and the whopping 462 % winner shorting Lehman Brothers .
Today is the last day we are offering his latest financial short play for just $ 1 .

Django 1.1 status update
It 's well past time for a quick update on the status of Django 1.1 :
Anyone who 's been following our development process and can read a calendar will probably have noticed that we 've missed our originally - targeted ship date of April 13th .
So we 're now about a month behind .
The reason for the schedule slip is pretty typical for most software projects : we reached the target date with a number of bugs still open .
Putting out buggy code on time simply is n't an option , so we 've been working to get these final issues closed before we ship any code .
As I write this we have about fifty bugs still open ( see the complete list here ) .
I 'm pretty hopeful about getting these fixed in short order : today is the first day of the EuroDjangoCon sprints , and we 've got quite a turnout .
A number of tricky bugs have been fixed already today .
Unfortunately , many of these remaining issues are quite tricky .
Ironically , this is caused by Django 's general stability : we 've already fixed all the easy bugs !
We 're not setting a timeline for the 1.1 release because the remaining issues are " blockers " : they have to be fixed before we can put a release out .
So while we 're hoping to have the first release candidate out in a matter of days , this is n't a promise .
We 'll ship Django 1.1 when it 's stable , and not a moment before .
Thanks for your understanding , and watch this space for updates .
Russian navy ships , the Federal Security Service and Interpol are looking for Arctic Sea , a 4,000 tonnes general cargo ship , managed by Oy Solchart , which vanished after apparently entering the English channel from the North Sea on 29 July .
No contact has been made with her and there is speculation that the vessel carrying almost $ 2 m worth of timber from Finland has been hijacked or taken by its Russian crew of 15 .
The wood , from Europe ’s largest papermaking company , Stora Enso , was bound for Bejaia , Algeria .
Arctic
Sea ’s last known position was off the coast of Portugal .
Spanish maritime authorities say that vessel did not pass through the Straits of Gibraltar , through which it would have had to pass to reach Algeria .
Last radio contact was with Dover Coastguard on the morning of July 29 .
Web - based AIS sites logged the last AIS transmission on July 29 - 30 .
It is not very difficult to make a ship disappear in plain site : Minor changes to superstructure and paintwork , a black - market set of ship ’s identity documents and a simple re-configuration of electronic equipment such as the AIS are enough .
It is even possible that Arctic Seas did not leave the North Sea .
However , the real question may not be how she disappeared but why , there are suggestions that she was suspected to be carrying a far more valuable cargo .
Anyone trying to sell the recorded cargo will get a fraction of its insured / market value and $ 2 m split between all those who would need to participate is hardly worth getting out of bed for , but someone was determined to seize something on the vessel and spend money to get it .
Swedish police are investigating the alleged boarding of the Malta - flagged vessel by ten armed men who claimed to be police , between Oeland and Gotland in the Baltic on 24 July , almost a week before her disappearance .
The crew were tied up while the ship was searched and the attackers apparently left empty - handed on fast inflatables .
Arctic Sea disappeared five days later .
Interfax , the Russian news agency says that the Russian Navy announced on Sunday that it was searching for the ship and quotes Mikhail Voytenko , editor of the Maritime Bulletin – Sovfracht : “ It ( Arctic Sea ) was supposed to arrive there ( Bejaia , Algeria ) on August 4 .
But the vessel disappeared on July 28 .
Contact has not been established with it since then .
Neither its owner nor the relatives [ of the crew ] know anything about its whereabouts .
No traces have been found .
All services , including the navy , are searching for the vessel … someone believed there was something valuable on the ship that was being carried illegally … ”
Suggestions that the crew mau have been involved would appear unlikely .
According to Bloomberg : “ Victor Matveev , chief executive officer of Solchart , said in a telephone interview from Helsinki today …
“ We ’ve operated this vessel for many , many years on a consecutive voyage basis between Finland and the Mediterranean , and this is more than disturbing , ” Matveev said .
“ All the crew members have been working for our company for several years , they ’re professional , well educated , and there are no newcomers .
It makes us wonder what happened . ”
On the same day we learn that Dan Froomkin was fired from the WashingtonPost.com , WaPo runs separate op eds by Paul Wolfowitz — Paul Wolfowitz , mind you — and Charles Krauthammer .
They both argue that President Obama does n’t know what he ’s doing and should more forcefully and directly come out in support of the demonstrating Iranians .
Jonathan Chait :
President Obama has taken a cautious tone toward the demonstrators in Iran , with his stated reason being that more open support would discredit their cause .
This strikes me as a sensible position .
The revealed preferences of both sides suggest a mutual belief that an American embrace would hurt the protestors .
The regime is trying ( so far , without much success ) to tie the demonstrators to the U.S. , and the demonstrators are embracing the symbolism of the Iranian revolution ( the color green , chants of “ Alluah Akbar , ” and so on ) in order to demonstrate their patriotism and mainstream cultural status . …
What ’s remarkable to me is that those on the other side refuses to rebut it .
Today ’s Washington
Post op - ed page has two more columns lambasting Obama for failing to embrace the demonstrators .
Today ’s offerings are by Charles Krauthammer and Paul Wolfowitz .
Neither one of them even mentions , let alone answers , Obama ’s argument for why embracing the demonstrators would be counterproductive .
What ’s remarkable to me is that Wolfowitz and Krauthammer have the chutzpah to be seen in public , never mind offer opinions on foreign policy , never mind actually get those opinions published in a major newspaper .
Taking foreign policy advice from the likes of these two is like hiring Napoleon as a consultant for your Russian land invasion .
Worse , actually , since I suspect Napoleon was smart enough to learn from mistakes and might have had some useful ideas .
Gary Kamiya wrote this week ,
Like Rasputin , the unhinged “ Mad Monk ” whom they sometimes seem to have adopted as an intellectual role model , the neoconservatives who brought us the Iraq war refuse to die .
Although they have been figuratively stabbed , poisoned , shot , garroted and drowned , they somehow keep standing , still insisting that history will vindicate George W. Bush ’s glorious crusade .
In a world governed by the Victorian moral code conservatives claim to uphold , they would be shunned , shamed and forbidden to appear on television or write Op - Ed columns .
But because Beltway decorum apparently requires that disgraced pundits be given a permanent platform to bray their discredited theories , the rest of us are condemned to listen to their ravings .
I would argue that they have n’t been “ figuratively stabbed , poisoned , shot , garroted and drowned , ” or at least , not nearly enough .
Major media ( e.g. , the Washington Post ) still treats these zombies with respect , as if their opinions had credibility .
Amazing .
I also want to point out , as others have , that the same neocons and their followers who are cheering for the demonstrators now ( and may I say I am cheering for them , also ; they are a genuine inspiration ) have been urging us to bomb the smithereens out of Iran lo these many years .
Do they not now see that they were wrong ?
That sometimes it ’s wiser to stand back and let events take their course than to force an outcome with death and destruction ?
Probably not .
In 2005 the neocons could n’t say enough about the glorious Cedar Revolution and the brave people of Lebanon .
In 2006 the Cedar Revolution was quickly forgotten when Israel decided to initiate a military adventure into Lebanon , an action that by some miracle killed only Hezbollah Supporters , according to the Right Blogosphere at the time .
Of course , as Kamiya suggests , the real purpose of neocon bleatings now is not to offer any real advice on foreign policy .
It is to undermine the Obama Administration .
Period .

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Saturday that it ’s time for the Republican Party to give up its “ nostalgia ” for the heyday of the Reagan era and look forward , even if it means stealing the winning strategy deployed by Democrats in the 2008 election .
“ You ca n’t beat something with nothing , and the other side has something .
I do n’t like it , but they have it , and we have to be respectful and mindful of that , ” Mr. Bush said .
The former president ’s brother , often mentioned as a potential candidate in 2012 , said President Obama ’s message of hope and change during the 2008 campaign clearly resonated with Americans .
“ So our ideas need to be forward looking and relevant .
I felt like there was a lot of nostalgia and the good old days in the [ Republican ] messaging .
I mean , it ’s great , but it does n’t draw people toward your cause , ” Mr. Bush said .

• GOP leaders form group to reconnect with voters
“ From the conservative side , it ’s time for us to listen first , to learn a little bit , to upgrade our message a little bit , to not be nostalgic about the past because , you know , things do ebb and flow . ”
The Florida governor joined former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and House Republican Whip Eric Cantor on Saturday at a small pizza parlor in Arlington for the inaugural event of the National Council for a New America ( NCNA ) .
Mr. Cantor said meeting with ordinary folks is the key way “ to begin a conversation with the American people ” and explain Republican principles to anyone who will listen .
Mr. Romney , a failed 2008 Republican presidential candidate , said his party has got to do a better job of listening .
“ Let ’s not underestimate the people of America ; let ’s make sure and listen to the people of America … listen to what they ’re feeling and get their ideas , ” he said .
The NCNA - with a “ national panel of experts ” made up of Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney - says the goal of the listening tour is not to recast the party .
“ This is not about messaging , this is not about branding , ” Mr. Cantor told The Washington Times .
“ This is about trying to foster some discussion , because what ’s going on in Washington right now is not reflective of the mainstream of this country .
“ The Republican Party is founded on some common - sense conservative principles that are as effective today as they ’ve always been .
We just need to make sure we ’re listening to the people , ” he said .
Mr. Romney said as well there will be no wholesale changes to the core tenets of the party .
“ I think the principles remain the same , ” he told The Times after the hourlong session .
“ I think we have to be very clear in what we stand for and make sure that the American people understand that we ’re in this to help America ’s future and their families . ”
Republicans were hammered in the 2006 midterm elections - losing the House and Senate in what former President George W. Bush called a “ thumpin ’ ” - and Mr. Obama won a slew of once - staunch Republican states in his decisive 2008 victory .
Many in the party were not thrilled with GOP candidate Mr. McCain , a self - described “ maverick ” who often shunned core Republican principles .
Since the election , the party has fallen into disarray .
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele is not particularly popular among the conservative core ; and while the 2012 election seems far off , the next election is 18 months away .
Adding to their woes , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania announced last week that he would switch parties and become a Democrat , citing his disgust with the big - tent party under President Reagan that he said is now far more exclusionary .
Although the three potential Republican candidates had their shirtsleeves buttoned at the wrist during the informal pizza parlor session , they said they planned to roll up their sleeves and get to work rebuilding the party .
“ Our party has taken its licks over the last couple of cycles , ” Mr. Cantor said .
“ No one is under any illusion about that .
But that ’s why we ’re here … to re-engage and partner with the people of this country .
…
We ’re looking to the future . ”
Said Mr. Romney : “ For America to move forward , they ’re going to want to see a party that has answers , not politics . ”
While he said .
“ We do n’t have to come up with all the answers today , thank heaven , ” he added , “ but certainly by 2010 , we better . ”
Mr. Bush was the most forthright of the panel , repeatedly returning to the notion of looking forward , of the need to first and foremost “ create a consensus around 21st - century ideas that truly matter for American families . ”
“ We have principles , we have values .
They are the values that are shared by the majority of Americans , there ’s no question about it .
But we have to now take those principles and values and apply them to the challenges that our country faces today and in the future . …
“ And then , hopefully - God willing - [ we ] embrace our conservative principles and take these new ideas and present them to the American people , ” he said .
The message resonated with many of those who turned out at the Pie - Tanza restaurant , right in the heart of a firmly liberal community .
“ We do n’t have to compromise our beliefs , ” said Brian Summers , a black Republican from the District .
“ This is our party , our country .
We should stand strong , stay faithful to what we firmly believe , and go forward . ”
But Mike Collins , a former RNC press secretary from Vienna , Va. , who now runs a public - relations firm , said there is an urgent need for the party to rethink its strategy .
“ We need to be much more articulate and reach out to demographics we ’re not reaching right now - Hispanics , suburban women , regions of the country that currently we ’re not effectively talking to , ” he said .
Mario H. Lopez , president of the Hispanic Leadership Fund , agreed , and he applauds the effort by the Republican leaders .
“ It starts with showing up , with listening .
It starts with making an effort .
We really hope that they ’ll do that , ” he said .
But the Hispanic leader closed with a warning : “ The fact is , if they want to be a governing majority again , they have to do that . ”

DALLAS  Federal officials say a maintenance company hired by Southwest Airlines used unapproved parts for repairs on some jets .
The parts will have to be replaced , but they are not considered an immediate safety threat and regulators will let Southwest keep flying the planes for 10 days while it decides how to fix the problem .
Southwest said Wednesday that the incident led it to ground 46 planes last Saturday , causing flight delays throughout its network .
An investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration raised questions about the parts during an inspection Friday of a facility that maintains planes for Southwest .
The parts , called exhaust gate assembly hinge fittings , are used in deflecting hot engine exhaust away from wing flaps .
Southwest uses only Boeing 737 aircraft , which have an engine on each wing .
The maintenance company , which was not identified by Southwest or the FAA , used hinge assemblies made by a subcontractor who is not certified to make the parts , according to the agency .
That led to discussions Friday night between Southwest , Boeing Co. and the FAA about what to do next , but the airline really had no choice .
Federal regulations prohibit knowingly operating a plane with unapproved parts , so Southwest grounded planes that had received the hinge fittings .
By late Saturday , engineers determined that the use of the parts did n't pose an immediate safety danger , so the FAA let Southwest use the planes temporarily .
" The parts have to come off the planes , it 's just a matter of how quickly that has to be done , " said FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford .
" Unapproved parts do n't belong on airplanes . "
Lunsford said FAA officials would meet with Southwest later Wednesday to discuss follow - up actions .
He said it was too early to know whether Southwest would face any penalties .
Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin said the issue hinged on the documentation of repairs on the part by a vendor that does maintenance for the airline .
Harbin said she did n't know of previous concerns about the repairs .
The airline pulled 46 planes — nearly 9 % of its fleet — out of service for several hours Saturday .
That led to widespread delays and a few cancelations " probably on the scope of a pretty good Texas thunderstorm , " Harbin said .
In March , Dallas - based Southwest agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to settle FAA allegations that the airline made nearly 60,000 flights on planes that had missed required examinations for structural cracks and flew them 1,450 times even after being notified of the missed inspections .
Federal safety officials are also investigating an incident in June in which a foot - long hole opened in the top of a Southwest jet bound from Nashville to Baltimore , forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing in West Virginia .
There were no injuries .
Government records indicated that eight cracks in the frame required repairs in January .
Dallas - based Southwest Airlines Co. carries more than 100 million U.S. passengers a year , more than any other airline .
Southwest shares fell 9 cents to $ 8.59 in afternoon trading .

Yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11 and Monday is the same for both the first Moon landing and the first walk on the surface .
In this entry , I ’ve collected some of the best resources on the web related to the anniversary …articles , historical documents , audio , video , transcripts , photos , and the like .
Enjoy .
We Choose the Moon is tracking the activities of the Apollo 11 mission as it happened 40 years ago .
Very nicely done .
Housed on NASA ’s history site is a ton of resources about the Apollo 11 landing , including an annotated transript of the landing , which makes for really interesting reading .
MP3 files are also available as are many , many video clips of the landing at the astronauts ’ time on the surface .
Highlights : this video was shot out of the window of the lunar module from a height of 50,000 feet until one minute after touchdown and I ’ve never seen Armstrong ’s first step on the Moon from this angle before .
For its July 21 , 1969 issue , The NY Times used 96 pt. type to declare that MEN WALK ON MOON .
The landing was made four miles west of the aiming point , but well within the designated area .
An apparent error in some data fed into the craft ’s guidance computer from the earth was said to have accounted for the discrepancy .
Suddenly the astronauts were startled to see that the computer was guiding them toward a possibly disastrous touchdown in a boulder - filled crater about the size of a football field .
Mr. Armstrong grabbed manual control of the vehicle and guided it safely over the crater to a smoother spot , the rocket engine stirring a cloud of moon dust during the final seconds of descent .
The Onion used larger type and took a more unadulterated and profane approach ( love the video version ) .
John Noble Wilford , the Times journalist who wrote the front page story underneath the 96 pt. type — “ the biggest single story of my career ” — recounts his Apollo 11 experience and ponders the Apollo program ’s legacy in a great piece for the Times .
It then occurs to me that if Columbus and Capt .
James
Cook were alive , they might be less astonished by two men landing on the Moon than by the millions of people , worldwide , watching every step of the walk as it happens .
Exploring is old , but instantaneous telecommunications is new and marvelous .
In just 1.3 seconds , the time it takes for radio waves to travel the 238,000 miles from Moon to Earth , each step by Armstrong and Aldrin is seen , and their voices heard , throughout the world they have for the time being left behind .
In contrast to exploration ’s previous landfalls , the whole world shares in this moment .
The Apollo 11 mission in photographs : NASA Images is the comprehensive source for NASA photos of the Apollo 11 mission ; the always excellent Big Picture has photos of the mission from a variety of sources ; David Burnett shot photos of people watching the launch ;
Time looks at Apollo astronauts Now and Then ; the NY Times collected photos from readers of their Apollo 11 moments ;
Life has several photo galleries : Buzz Aldrin Looks Back , Scenes From the Moon , Up Close With Apollo 11 ( rare and never - published photos ) , and The World Watches ; and Google ’s archive of Life magazine ’s Apollo 11 images .
A map of where Armstrong and Aldrin walked during their 2 + hours on the surface .
That same map superimposed on a soccer pitch and on a baseball field .
They did n’t walk that far at all .
Explore the Apollo 11 landing site on Google Moon .
In piece published on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch , Buzz Aldrin advocates not a return to the Moon but a mission to Mars with the objective of establishing a colony on the red planet .
Let the lunar surface be the ultimate global commons while we focus on more distant and sustainable goals to revitalize our space program .
Our next generation must think boldly in terms of a goal for the space program : Mars for America ’s future .
I am not suggesting a few visits to plant flags and do photo ops but a journey to make the first homestead in space : an American colony on a new world .
Robotic exploration of Mars has yielded tantalizing clues about what was once a water - soaked planet .
Deep beneath the soils of Mars may lie trapped frozen water , possibly with traces of still - extant primitive life forms .
Climate change on a vast scale has reshaped Mars .
With Earth in the throes of its own climate evolution , human outposts on Mars could be a virtual laboratory to study these vast planetary changes .
And the best way to study Mars is with the two hands , eyes and ears of a geologist , first at a moon orbiting Mars and then on the Red Planet ’s surface .
Video of John F. Kennedy ’s “ we choose to go to the Moon ” speech given at Rice University on September 12 , 1962 .
Fewer than 7 years later , Apollo 11 achieved the goal that Kennedy laid out in that speech .
In a piece for New Scientist , Linda Geddes writes about possible future lunar parks and how they might be preserved .
Around these [ landing sites ] are scattered smaller artefacts and personal items , such as Neil Armstrong ’s boots and portable life - support system , scientific instruments and their power generators — and , of course , the iconic US flag which remains planted in the moon ’s surface .
Then there are the footprints and rover tread paths .
Despite the passing of the years , these remain carved into the dust because the moon has no wind or rain to wash them away .
Anthropologist P. J. Capelotti of Penn State University in Abington has mapped out five “ lunar parks ” .
These cover the areas where the majority of the artefacts are concentrated and could be used as a basis for future preservation efforts .
“ Nobody ’s saying that the whole moon has to be off limits , but as people are starting to make plans for tourism and mineral extraction , or for putting a base there , they just need to be aware of them and work around them . ”
Since returning from the Moon , Neil Armstrong has been less and less willing to speak in public about his Apollo 11 experience .
For the 40th anniversary , Armstrong will not take part in the NASA event to commemorate the landing .
His only appearance related to the anniversary will be a 15 - minute lecture at a Smithsonian Institution event on Sunday night .
I found this event on the National Air and Space Museum site … maybe that ’s it ?
If so , then Armstrong ’s lecture will be webcast live on the NASA TV site that evening .
Popular Science shares a list of ten things you did n’t know about the Apollo 11 Moon landing .
7 . When Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface , he had to make sure not to lock the Eagle ’s door because there was no outer handle .
Moonwalk
One is a documentary film about Apollo released in 1970 to little fanfare , even though it won an award at the Cannes Film Festival .
The film was commissioned by NASA but with so much Apollo activity and information happening in the late 60s and early 70s , no one was interested in distributing or seeing the film and it was soon forgotten .
Recently , the only remaining 35 mm print of the film was located under the director ’s desk , restored , and offered for sale on DVD in time for the 40th anniversary .
To get a feel of what it was like in the Soviet Union during the Apollo 11 mission , Scientific American interviewed Sergei Khrushchev , son of former Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev .
The reaction was somewhat more subdued than in other parts of the world .
Of course , you cannot have people land on the moon and just say nothing .
It was published in all the newspapers .
But if you remember [ back then ] when Americans spoke of the first man in space , they were always talking of “ the first American in space ” [ not Yuri Gagarin ] .
The same feeling was prevalent in Russia .
There were small articles when Apollo 11 was launched .
Actually , there was a small article on the first page of Pravda and then three columns on page five .
I looked it up again .
Eat Me Daily explores the food consumed on the mission .
The Apollo crew even dined on thermo-stabilized cheddar cheese spread and hot dogs during the moon mission , bringing at least a bit of America in July to the sterile flight craft .
And yes , there was bacon - foreshadowing the current bacon craze , the first meal eaten by man on the moon was none other than bacon cubes , coated with gelatin to combat crumbs .
The issue of the New Yorker published just after the Moon landing is worth a look : much of the Talk of the Town section is devoted to the landing and there ’s also a Letter from the Space Center .
( Subscribers only . )
The main NASA site has an interactive feature to explore the landing site and Eagle ( Eagle was the name of the lunar module ) .
Finally , there ’s still some good stuff to be had on the old telly on Monday .
The History Channel has As It Happened : Man on the Moon at 8 pm ET :
This special takes viewers back to July 1969 to experience the actual CBS News / Walter Cronkite coverage of man ’s first lunar landing .
Using minimal editing and leaving the original footage untouched viewers will feel as if they are watching the CBS coverage in July of 1969 .
While today we know the outcome of Apollo 11 ’s mission it was not a given then .
This will become evident watching Walter Cronkite and his colleagues as they watch the historic lunar mission unfold before them .
and Moonshot , a two - hour documentary about Apollo 11 , at 9 pm ET .
Turner Classic Movies is airing a bunch of Moon - related movies all day , including A Trip to the Moon ( a 12 - minute film from 1902 ) at 8 pm ET and the excellent For All Mankind ( newly out on Criterion Blu-ray ) at 8:15 pm ET .
The Discovery Channel has When We Left the Earth , a one - hour documentary on the mission , at 10 pm ET .
If none of that tickles your fancy , try episode 6 of the excellent From the Earth to the Moon ( available for the insanely low price of $ 12 on Amazon ) or In the Shadow of the Moon on DVD .

Update : Tom Wolfe , author of The Right Stuff , writes that landing on the Moon killed NASA .
Everybody , including Congress , was caught up in the adrenal rush of it all .
But then , on the morning after , congressmen began to wonder about something that had n’t dawned on them since Kennedy ’s oration .
What was this single combat stuff — they did n’t use the actual term — really all about ?
It had been a battle for morale at home and image abroad .
Fine , O.K. , we won , but it had no tactical military meaning whatsoever .
And it had cost a fortune , $ 150 billion or so .
And this business of sending a man to Mars and whatnot ?
Just more of the same , when you got right down to it .
How laudable … how far - seeing … but why do n’t we just do a Scarlett O’Hara and think about it tomorrow ?
July Moon is a forthcoming documentary about some lost NASA tapes .
Surely not these NASA tapes ?
The computer source code that ran Apollo 11 ’s Command Module and Lunar Module has been released .
A recently discovered photo clearly shows Neil Armstrong ’s face on the Moon through his visor .
He was the first man to walk on the moon , taking that one giant leap for mankind — yet most of the famous shots are of his fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin , as it was Armstrong who manned the stills camera .
New Scientist overlaid the Apollo lunar excursion maps on top of cities in Google Earth .
Neil and Buzz did n’t even leave Trafalgar Square on their trip to the Moon .

Video : Bony robot
Like looking in the mirror ( Image : The Robot Studio ) Built like a human ( Image : The Robot Studio )
YOU may have more in common with this robot than any other – it was designed using your anatomy as a blueprint .
Conventional humanoid robots may look human , but the workings under their synthetic skins are radically different from our anatomy .
A team with members across five European countries says this makes it difficult to build robots able to move like we do .
Their project , the Eccerobot , has been designed to duplicate the way human bones , muscles and tendons work …
As I stated in the blog agenda here on Vlad , the logical and bitter consequence of governments failing to consider the histories culture rights and values of their own people , would be that those very people will form their own groups and violently defend them themselves .
This is a bitter and terrible solution to something which could have been fixed so easily by simple acts of legislation .
In my little fantasy land where Neville Chamberlain was the exception and not the rule here is how it should have gone down .
1. Stop Islamic immigration and end all programs to bring in cousins wives and second third and forth wives .
2 . End multi culturalism and deport all who actively preach subversion of the values of the host culture .
Preaching genocide and conspiracy of course should be an easy prosecution .
This means ending special rights for religion to bypass normal liberal secular democracy .
a good thing all around .
3. Protect political freedom of speech and entrench the value of freedom from religion .
It would appear that for Denmark it ’s too late .
Danes are joining Hells Angels motorcycle and crime gangs in record numbers .
These are regular danes who have no interest in either motorcycles or crime but want an organisation which will defend them from attacks by Islamic immigrants on the war path against Danish culture and indigenous people .
The civil wars in Europe indeed have begun .
Please do not think I relish this fact .
While I would rather see a war in the streets than the destruction of European and western secular democracy , my whole purpose in starting this blog was to help wake people and thereby governments to the urgent need to protect values that Europeans have spent rivers of blood to build and protect both from Islam and even its own irrational religious authority and thereby stave it off with intelligent policies as listed , albeit roughly above .
Here is the article I linked to above but do click through to the original as it has sidebars and extra stories relevant to the issue .

Clashes in Denmark between bikers , hangarounds and patriots , versus immigrant gangs and left wing extremists .
More shooting in Copenhagen Update September 15 2008
This afternoon 3 shots were fired against a Hells Angels related Tattoo shop ‘ House of Pain ‘ in Bragesgade in the infamous Noerrebro district of Copenhagen .
Two perpetrators of foreign ethnicity drove by on a red moped and fired 3 shots to the windows .
Three men were in the tattoo shop ; one of them was hit in the neck by a projectile , and was taken to a hospital .
His life is no longer in danger .
A baby was sleeping in a carriage directly outside the shop .
A bullet went through the window missing the infant by only one meter .
House of pain is situated directly next to the Hells Angels support fashion shop Route 81 .
The victim ’s wife and baby were in the shop while the shooting took place .
So far no arrests were made .

Two immigrants were hit by bullets in Rantzausgade , Noerrebro Copenhagen .
One was shot in the back and one in the leg .
At least 11 shots were fired , a white Ford Mondeo and a Toyota Picnic are thought to be involved .
The victims were immigrants standing in the doorway of the Internet café Surf & Play , a well known meeting place for criminal immigrants .
The nature of the weapons involved is not yet clear , but they were probably automatic weapons .
Riots broke out , when at least 5o immigrants quickly gathered at the scene , yelling and pushing up against the police officers who were at the spot .
The officers had to release their dogs to disperse the crowd , until 10 patrol cars arrived and blocked off the scene .
According to TV2 News , this is the 15th episode involving fire arms this month .
Police sergeant Poul B. Hansen said there was no direct proof of involvement by AK81 .
Jyllands - Posten Several residents said they were considering about moving out of the danger zone for good .
The district of Noerrebro has been a regular battle zone for immigrant gangs and communist rioters for years .
The biker group Hells Angels seem to be coming back at the at the moment still dominating immigrant gangs , with their new support group AK81 , which is increasingly gaining support from Danes who are not first and foremost interested in bikes or crime , but who have grown increasingly hostile to especially muslim immigrants , after ever increasing street violence , knife attacks , robberies and rape from the side of muslim immigrants .
The rates for violent crime and especially rape related cases have gone up dramatically with the increasing number of muslim immigrants .
Large numbers of Danes , not otherwise interested in motorcycles or gang related criminal activity , are reported to sign up under the new banner of the HA support group AK81 ‘ 81 ? being synonymous with the letters HA ) , and AK probably referring to the famous AK 47 ‘ Kalashnikov ’ submachine gun , as well as meaning Always Ready [ Altid Klar ] in Danish .
For many years motorcycle gangs such as the illustrious Hells Angels and muslim dominated street gangs managed to exist side by side in relative peace , in the struggle for control of the market for illegal drugs , especially cannabis , but also other forms of crime .
The later years the ethnic Danish gangs such as Hells Angels were increasingly coming under pressure from the muslim gangs , who showed to be far more relentless in their methods , and much less afraid of the possible judicial consequences of their actions , besides being much more numerous , and able to draw upon support from much of the immigrant community not otherwise involved in similar crime .
Police and helped immigrant gangs by keeping down Danish bikers
One of the reasons that the immigrant gangs have been able to gain in strength , is because they are much less visible for the police than the motorcycle gang members , who are easily identified , because of their style of dress with visible logos , their more limited numbers and often also because of their physical stature .
The Hells Angels are tightly organized , and almost all members are known by the police , who have kept these groups under constant observation , making it increasingly difficult for them to defend themselves and their territories from the muslim gangs , who are much more loosely knit , are not easily identifiable and have their respective languages to complicate things for the Danish police .
In the recent past Hells Angels ’ members have been attacked openly by members of the ethnic crime syndicates , and one of their properties has been attacked and demolished by immigrant gangs .
Some chapters closed after that .
But not only the police has more or less taken the part of the immigrants , practically spoken ; the press as well has been an active player in minimizing the problem with the many criminal immigrants , and deamonizing any similar Danish groups .
AK81 , the new Hells Angels ’ support team
Now a newly established support group of ‘ hangarounds ’ has been established , and the Angels are openly recruiting for their team , saying that it is not neccesary to own a motorcycle to be a member .
This has had a dramatic effect , and large numbers of young Danes are volunteering for the new movement , hoping that they will be able to contribute to the fight against the muslim invaders , who so far have been successful in obtaining almost total street domination .
The police , who have used all their resources at keeping the bikers in check , have used a far more soft touch towards the muslim gangs .
Very often the police withdraw from confrontations , and leave demolishing hordes of immigrants untouched , contrary to a simple house search or an arrrest relating to the Bikers ’ gangs , when they arrive in overwhelming numbers , ready with bullet proof vests and submachine guns .
Jaegersborg Street in Copenhagen
Only little more than a week ago , a gang of about 50 immigrants rampaged a whole street in Copenhagen Jægersborgsgade , a local neighborhood where some HA members have their homess , indiscriminately smashing up a number of cars .
The police watched helplessly , and no arrests were made .
The action was a display off of power , after bikers and their new supporter from AK81 , had held a silent and non violent march through to demonstrate their willingness to fight for their turf .
Police powerless against immigrant gangs
Partly this is part of a government and EU strategy , which puts great restrictions on the police when dealing with immigrants and immigrant gangs .
There always are the accusations of ‘ racism ’ , and the muslim gangs are also much feared than the bikers when it comes to their threats to harm individual police officers or their families .
Many policemen whose identities are known by the immigrant gangs , would rather not have their house torched or their loved ones attacked by the invaders who have taken their extremely violent mentality with them straight from the Middleast .
Cell phone Jihad
One of the most powerful weapons of the immigrant gangs is that they are able to gather large numbers of supporters in the run of a few minutes .
They do this using cell phones .
They have been using this method , not only for criminal gang related activity , but it is often used when immigrants get involved in traffic accidents .
They are on the spot in large numbers ten times faster than the police , when one of their fellow ethnics ‘ needs support ’ .
Recently a family father was knifed in the back during a standoff about a completely minor traffic accident .
Anybody who gets into a confrontation with one of these often knife wielding immigrant thugs , risks getting into a war with a whole brotherhood , which does n’t shy away from threatening witnesses , even in court , or on the steps of the court house .
The mainly muslim immigrants supported perhaps by a few Danish renegades , have often completely blocked off accident sites , to the extent that ambulances either could not reach the spot , or in other cases were attacked with stones and other forms of violence .
The same scene often plays out when the fire brigade is sent to an ethnic neighborhood to put out a burning car or a waste container , and firefighters in some cities now refuse to work except under police protection , which often means a long delay when alarmed about a fire .
The cell phone organized criminal jihad of course benefits greatly from the immigrants use of Arabic , Urdu and other languages , making it much harder for the authorities to monitor their communications , while the content communication between the native groups is much easier to access .
Left wing extremists and immigrant thugs
But the biker groups , their AK81 supporters and the immigrants are not the only players in this game .
The extreme left in Denmark , known under various names such as AFA , Antifa , ARN , autonome [ autonomous ] , SUF and countless other aliases also is involved .
The last mentioned SUF group , actually is an official part of the organized left wing extremist party Enhedslisten , which is represented in parliament .
But reality shows , that although there are many such groups , the people involved are largely the same across these red fascist groups .
The extreme left even has its own intelligence service , the secretive REDOX , and the closely related DEMOS outlet .
Both groups which have managed to appear in the mainstream media , as so called ‘ neutral observers and documenters ‘ of ‘ the racist activities of ‘ right wing extremist groups ’ , as they like to present themselves .
This notwithstanding the fact that e.g. the DEMOS personel through the years has maintained close connections with convicted members of Denmarks first and most dangerous left wing terrorist groups the internationally connected Blekingegade Gang , revering the same ideologists and sharing the same sympathies for organizations such as the PFLP and the South American terrorist group FARC .
Elderly woman , one of the victims who were beat up with iron pipes by left wing extremists at a SIOE demonstration against Saudi delegation ’s participation in human rights conference .
The police were present in great numbers , but still left wing anarchists managed to find SIOE demonstrators in a parking garage , and attacked them with iron pipes and knifes .
The incident was first denied in the press , went unreported by most major TV stations and newspapers , and the police never seriously investigated .
The attackers went free .
Only a few weeks ago an 82 year old female demonstrator in Hobro was attacked and brutally thrown off her feet by a muslim youth .
During the last at least ten years , these red fascist groups have been able to turn any and all expressions from anti-immigration or anti-islamic organizations and individuals into a battle zone .
No matter who demonstrated for any purpose the anarchists deemed unworthy , even congregations mainly consisting of pensioners , were met in the streets by yells of ‘ Nazis go home ’ , stones , paint bombs , firecrackers , fists and iron pipes .
Old ladies past their 7oth birthday have been knocked to the ground or hit with iron pipes , as happened recently in Copenhagen before a SIAD ( a non violent anti-racist organization against islamization ) demonstration , where two cars filled with people were attacked in an underground parking garage .
The left wing extremist groups have on several occasions been supported by some immigrants , who are always looking for an opportunity to riot , and the left wing extremists have also supported angry muslim mobs during demonstrations .
Vejle : violent clashes between ‘ neo - Nazis ’ and left wing extremists .
Just a few days ago , on Thursdag september 11 , a short but intense fight devellopped in the city of Vejle in Jutland , as members of the left wing extremist group SUF , were confronted by a group which in the media was described as ‘ neo - Nazies ’ , but as it turns out more likely was made up of some members from the AK81 support group .
This time the red fascists suffered severe defeat , and several were injured .
According to the left wing extremists themselves , they were attacked by ‘ neo - Nazis ’ , which was repeated in the press , even though the statements given by the police were not supporting that theory :
The local newspaper Vejle Amts Folkeblad amongst others wrote the following :
..
The police would not corroborate the newspaper ’s information , that any of the groups involved were actually ‘ neo - Nazis ’ .
The police got a phone call telling that some red fascists had been attacked by a group of ‘ neo - Nazis .
We could not confirm that they were really neo - Nazi , but we do not believe that there is any neo -Nazi presence in the city of Vejle .
There are autonomous [= leftwing extremists ] groups in all major cities , says Jens Soegaard , leader of the special patrol of the local South Jutland police .
Nevertheless , the Vejle newspaper unashamedly used this title for its article : ‘ Neo - Nazis and left wing extremists clashed in street confrontation ‘
In the wake of this latest and other similar incidents , the chief of the Police Intelligence Service PET ; Jacob Scharf appeared on TV saying that all sides in the conflict were acquiring fire arms .
In its latest annual report , the same intelligence service admitted for the first time , what most honest observers knew already more than ten years ago , that most of the political violence in Denmark is perpetrated by the left , and that conflicts mainly occur when ‘ right wing ’ manifestations are attacked by left wing radicals .
Well perhaps all this balance is about to change now .
With the appearance of the AK81 group on the scene , this situation may suddenly become reversed .
Bikers critized for being unpatriotic
Interestingly , groups such as the Hells Angels have so far never had any sympathy at all from the political right , patriotic circles , anti-immigrationalists or however you ’d like to define it .
They were actually criticized apart from being criminal providers of drugs , for cooperating all too closely with the criminal immigrant gangs , and I believe there were several non natives in , or very close to the organization .
In the past the Hells Angels and similar groups have never in any way let patriotic , ethnic or other such moral concerns come between them and their business interests .
The Bandido ’s group for example was or is ethnically diverse , but I am not an expert on these groups , so do n’t take my word for that .
I do n’t know if this group plays any role today , but I ’ll probably be updated on that in the days to come .
Well , it is impossible to describe all the details of the biker , muslim and patriotic conflict here .
But it seems like it ’s a hard rain gonna fall ..
This article may still be edited in the days to come .

BBC News , Hagerstown , Maryland
Opponents of health reform feel their arguments have been dismissed Opinions seem to be as important as facts in America 's healthcare debate .
Go to any of the scores of " town hall " meetings taking place up and down the country and you will find plenty of opinions , but relatively few facts .
Hundreds turned out for such a meeting at Hagerstown , Maryland - about an hour 's drive from Washington DC .
In theory , they had come to hear from the state 's junior senator , Democrat Ben Cardin .
But it seemed that most had already made up their mind .
Angry and vocal
At one extreme there were the protesters carrying posters of Barack Obama with a Hitler moustache .
These are the fringe - often followers of Lyndon LaRouche , an extremist whom many regard as a conspiracy theorist .
His supporters claim that the president is a Nazi who wants to take away healthcare from the elderly and that he is somehow advocating euthanasia .
They are armed with pamphlets that contain dubious quotes .
Not everyone present agrees that access to healthcare is a " right " .
This is the biggest difference between Europe and America
More common are the homemade banners warning of " socialised healthcare " .
These are the opponents who say that America is about to adopt a European - style health service .
And there is one particular example they have in mind , one health system they want to avoid mimicking more than any other : Britain 's National Health Service .
One man asks me why the British have such awful teeth .
He says he has heard it is because Britons have to wait six months to see a dentist .
( He kindly tells me that mine are not that bad , but that I clearly never had braces as a child . )
Another man tells me that the UK has the highest mortality and the worst recovery rates in Europe .
When I ask whether he has experienced this at first hand , he replies : " Why would I ? I 'd be dead . "
And then there is the young woman who likens Britain and Canada to third world countries because of their health systems .
She is wearing a T - shirt that reads : " Proud To Be A Member Of The Angry Mob " .
It is a defiant demonstration of how those opposed to healthcare reform feel their arguments have been dismissed by the left .
These are the vocal - the most prominent opponents of the president 's plans to bring about healthcare reform .
' Broken system '
But there are others who keep a lower profile and feel uneasy .
Louise , for example , is a senior citizen who seems genuinely worried that expanding health coverage to 47 million uninsured Americans will leave her and her husband worse off .
Standing in the long queue to enter the auditorium I also speak to Eric Linn , a man who helps to run a private rural radiology unit .
He fears that reform will cause healthcare to be rationed .
You cannot dismiss every opponent as just a sore loser .
As for proponents of healthcare reform , they seem to be fewer in number .
Supporters of healthcare reform were less numerous at the meeting
There is a mix of die - hard Democrats and those who believe the system is broken .
Charles Stewart - a small - business owner in a suit and tie - tells me that the tone of the debate has turned " ugly " .
He says he cannot afford health insurance and wants a more affordable system .
I ask him about the dangers of expanding health coverage and adding to the national debt .
He replies that it will be more expensive to do nothing .
Mr Stewart is one of hundreds who are turned away at the door .
In the auditorium every seat is taken .
At the start of the meeting , the organisers make a vain appeal for the attendees to respect one another 's opinions .
Senator Cardin arrives to polite applause .
It is pretty much the only applause he gets all afternoon .
Government takeover
After a few opening remarks about the importance of hearing views and holding this debate , he faces the - mostly hostile - questioners .
Instead of questions , they have come armed with well - rehearsed statements .
Most have a familiar theme : the government wants to take over healthcare and in the process will bankrupt the nation .
One brave soul tries to ask about the dangers of leaving 47 million people in America uninsured .
But to this audience the question sounds suspiciously like a " plant " .
Senator Cardin 's biggest problem is that he is short on detail .
He keeps on having to remind the audience , above the shouting , that neither the senate nor the president has finalised the details on healthcare reform .
Passions at the Maryland town hall meeting ran high
He repeats a few broad principles designed to reassure the critics : that there will always be private medicine and choice ; and that America is not going to adopt another country 's system .
He bravely suggests that all Americans should have access to healthcare .
Not everyone present agrees that it is a " right " .
This is the biggest difference between Europe and America .
But Mr Cardin 's arguments all sound rather vague .
The biggest problem with America 's healthcare debate is that no - one has really explained how it will work .
Barack Obama has yet to spell it out .
These town hall meetings certainly show that democracy in America is alive and kicking .
But that is about all .
There has been more heat than light .

A woman accused in the shooting death of her common - law husband told police her gun accidentally fired while they were playing a game of “ dirty cowboy ” during sexual foreplay , a Harris County prosecutor said .
Deborah Yvette Parker , 38 , is charged with manslaughter and being a felon in possession of a firearm , court records show .
She remains in the Harris County Jail on bail totaling $ 60,000 .
Parker is accused of recklessly causing the death of her longtime companion , Broderick Craig Crachian , 58 , at the couple ’s apartment in the 2700 block of Lorraine on June 30 .
Crachian was shot in the chest , the Harris County Medical Examiner ’s Office said .
His death was ruled a homicide .
Parker is “ extremely distraught ” by Crachian ’s death and has fully cooperated with Houston homicide investigators , her attorney said .
“ She loves him , and this is just a terrible accident , ” said Parker ’s court - appointed attorney , Murray Newman .
“ My understanding is she was 100 percent cooperative with the police and very forthcoming in everything that she told them . ”
Parker called 911 after the shooting occurred , Newman said .
Parker made a statement that she accidentally shot Crachian during sexual foreplay , said prosecutor Marcy McCorvey .
“ She describes it as playing ‘ dirty cowboy , ’ ” McCorvey said .
“ She did admit to being in possession of the handgun and using it as a toy during foreplay with the victim ’s acquiescence and request for it to be used in that manner . ”
Both McCorvey and Newman declined to elaborate on the type of foreplay the couple was engaged in or what “ dirty cowboy ” meant .
Newman declined to say if the couple had played the game before .
A heated argument
Houston Police Department homicide investigators who worked the case were not available for comment Thursday but previously said in a news release that other residents at the couple ’s apartment complex saw Parker and Crachian having a heated argument in the street several hours before the shooting .
After the argument was subdued , the couple returned to their apartment .
Several hours later , Parker went to another apartment , frantically yelling that Crachian had been shot , police said .
Parker also is accused of illegally possessing the gun after being convicted of the felony offense of prostitution in 2007 because she was caught with the weapon before the fifth anniversary of her release from prison for that conviction , court papers show .
Parker also has convictions for promoting prostitution , drug offenses and misdemeanor assault , Harris County court records show .

The Java environment and language are safe and efficient for application development .
However , some applications need to perform tasks that go beyond what can be done from within a pure - Java program , such as :
JNI ’s evolution JNI has been part of the Java platform since the JDK 1.1 release and was extended in the JDK 1.2 release .
The JDK 1.0 release included an earlier native - method interface that lacked clean separation between native and Java code .
In this interface , natives would reach directly into JVM structures and so could not be portable across JVM implementations , platforms , or even versions of the JDK .
Upgrading an application with a substantial number of natives using the JDK 1.0 model was expensive , as was developing natives that could run with multiple JVM implementations .
The introduction of JNI in the JDK 1.1 release allowed : Version independence
Platform independence
VM independence
Development of third - party class libraries
It is interesting to note that younger languages such as PHP are still struggling with these issues with respect to their support of native code .
Integrate with existing legacy code to avoid a rewrite .
Implement functionality missing in available class libraries .
For example , you might need Internet Control Message Protocol ( ICMP ) functionality if you are implementing ping in the Java language , but the base class libraries do n’t provide it .
in the Java language , but the base class libraries do n’t provide it .
Integrate with code that ’s best written in C / C++ , to exploit performance or other environment - specific system characteristics .
Address special circumstances that require non-Java code .
For example , implementation of core class libraries might require cross-package calls or the need to bypass other Java security checks .
The JNI lets you accomplish these tasks .
It provides a clean separation between the execution of Java code and native code ( such as C / C ++ ) by defining a clear API for communicating between the two .
For the most part , it avoids direct memory reference by native code into the JVM , ensuring that natives can be written once and work across different JVM implementations or versions .
With JNI , native code is free to interact with Java objects , get and set field values , and invoke methods without many of the constraints that apply to the same functions in Java code .
This freedom is a double - edged sword : it trades the safety of the Java language for the ability to accomplish the tasks listed earlier .
Using JNI within your application provides powerful low - level access to the machine resources ( memory , I /O , and so on ) , so you ’re working without the safety net usually provided to Java developers .
JNI ’s flexibility and power introduce the risk of programming practices that can lead to poor performance , bugs , and even program crashes .
You must be careful about the code you include in your application and use good practices to safeguard the application ’s overall integrity .
This article covers the 10 most common coding and design errors that users of the JNI make .
The goal is to help you recognize and steer clear of them so that you can write safe , effective JNI code that performs well from the start .
This article also introduces available tools and techniques for finding these issues in new or existing code and show how to apply them effectively .
JNI programming pitfalls fall into two categories :
Performance :
The code performs the designed function but does so slowly or in a way that causes the overall program to slow down .
: The code performs the designed function but does so slowly or in a way that causes the overall program to slow down .
Correctness :
The code works some of the time but does not reliably provide the required function ; in the worst case , it crashes or hangs .

The top five performance pitfalls for programmers using JNI are :
Not caching method IDs , field IDs , and classes
To access Java objects ’ fields and invoke their methods , native code must make calls to FindClass ( ) , GetFieldID ( ) , GetMethodId( ) , and GetStaticMethodID ( ) .
In the case of GetFieldID ( ) , GetMethodID ( ) , and GetStaticMethodID ( ) , the IDs returned for a given class do n’t change for the lifetime of the JVM process .
But the call to get the field or method can require significant work in the JVM , because fields and methods might have been inherited from superclasses , making the JVM walk up the class hierarchy to find them .
Because the IDs are the same for a given class , you should look them up once and then reuse them .
Similarly , looking up class objects can be expensive , so they should be cached as well .
For example , Listing 1 shows the JNI code required to call a static method :
Listing 1 . Calling a static method with JNI int val=1 ; jmethodID method ; jclass cls ; cls = ( ∗env ) ‑ >
FindClass(env , " com/ibm/example/TestClass " ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑ > ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) { return ERR_FIND_CLASS_FAILED ; } method = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetStaticMethodID(env , cls , " setInfo " , " ( I ) V " ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑ > ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) { return ERR_GET_STATIC_METHOD_FAILED ; } ( ∗env ) ‑> CallStaticVoidMethod( env , cls , method , val ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑> ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) { return ERR_CALL_STATIC_METHOD_FAILED ; } Show more Show more icon
Looking up the class and method ID every time we want to call the method results in six native calls instead of the two that would be required if we had cached the class and method ID the first time they were needed .
Performance Tip # 1
Look up and globally cache commonly used classes , field IDs , and method IDs .
Caching makes a significant impact on your application ’s run time .
Consider the following two versions of a method , which end up doing the same thing .
The version in Listing 2 uses cached field IDs :
Listing 2 . Using cached field IDs int sumValues2 ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jobject allValues ) { jint avalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , a ) ; jint bvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , b ) ; jint cvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , c ) ; jint dvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , d ) ; jint evalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , e ) ; jint fvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , f ) ; return avalue + bvalue + cvalue + dvalue + evalue + fvalue ; } Show more

Listing 3 does n’t use cached field IDs :
Listing 3 . Field IDs not cached int sumValues2 ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jobject allValues ) { jclass cls = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetObjectClass( env,allValues ) ; jfieldID a = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetFieldID(env , cls , " a " , " I " ) ; jfield ID b = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID(env , cls , " b " , " I " ) ; jfield ID c = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID (env , cls , " c " , " I " ) ; jfield ID d = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID(env , cls , " d " , " I " ) ; jfield ID e = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID (env , cls , " e " , " I " ) ; jfieldID f = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID (env , cls , " f " , " I " ) ; jint avalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , a ) ; jint bvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , b ) ; jint cvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , c ) ; jint dvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , d ) ; jint evalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , e ) ; jint fvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , f ) ; return avalue + bvalue + cvalue + dvalue + evalue + fvalue } Show more

The version in Listing 2 takes 3,572 ms to run 10,000,000 times .
Listing 3 ’s version takes 86,217 ms — 24 times longer .
Triggering array copies
JNI provides a clean interface between Java code and native code .
To maintain this separation , arrays are passed as opaque handles , and native code must call back to the JVM in order to manipulate array elements using set and get calls .
The Java specification leaves it up to the JVM implementation whether these calls provide direct access to the arrays or return a copy of the array .
For example , the JVM might return a copy when it has optimized arrays in a way that does not store them contiguously .
These calls , then , might cause copying of the elements being manipulated .
For example , if you call GetLongArrayElements ( ) on an array with 1,000 elements , you might cause the allocation and copy of at least 8,000 bytes ( 1,000 elements * 8 bytes for each long ) .
When you then update the array ’s contents with ReleaseLongArrayElements ( ) , another copy of 8,000 bytes might be required to update the array .
Even when you use the newer GetPrimitiveArrayCritical ( ) , the specification still permits the JVM to make copies of the full array .
Performance Tip # 2
Get and update only those parts of an array that the native needs .
Use the appropriate API calls to avoid copying the whole array when only part of it is needed .
The GetTypeArrayRegion ( ) and SetTypeArrayRegion ( ) methods allow you to get and update a region of an array , as opposed to the full array .
By using these methods to access larger arrays , you can ensure that you copy only the region of the array that the native will actually use .
For example , consider two versions of the same method , shown in Listing 4 :
Listing 4 .
Two versions of the same method jlong getElement ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jlongArray arr_j , int element ) { jboolean isCopy ; jlong result ; jlong∗ buffer_j = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetLongArrayElements( env , arr_j , &isCopy ) ; result = buffer_j[ element ] ; ( ∗env ) ‑> ReleaseLongArrayElements( env , arr_j , buffer_j , 0 ) ; return result ; } jlong getElement2 ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jlongArray arr_j , int element ) { jlong result ; ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetLongArrayRegion( env , arr_j , element , 1 , &result ) ; return result ; } Show more
Show more icon
The first version might cause two full copies of the array , whereas the second causes no copying at all .
Running the first method 10,000,000 times with an array of 1,000 bytes takes 12,055 ms ; the second version takes only 1,421 ms .
The first version takes 8.5 times longer !
Performance Tip # 3
Get or update as much of an array as possible in a single API call .
Do n’t iterate through the array ’s elements one by one when you can get and update an array in larger blocks .
On the other hand , using GetTypeArrayRegion ( ) to get each of the array ’s elements one by one will also not perform well if you ’re going to end up getting all of the array ’s elements anyway .
For best performance , ensure that you get and update array elements in the largest sensible blocks .
If you ’re going to iterate through all of the elements in an array , neither of the two getElement ( ) methods in Listing 4 is suitable .
Instead , you ’d want to get a reasonable - sized chunk of the array in one call and then iterate through all of those elements , repeating until you cover the full array .
Reaching back instead of passing parameters
When calling a method , you can often choose between passing a single object that has multiple fields and passing the fields individually .
With object - oriented designs , passing the object often provides better encapsulation , in that changes in the object fields do n’t require changes to the method signature .
However , in the case of JNI , a native must reach back into the JVM through one or more JNI calls to get the value for each individual field that it needs .
These additional calls add extra overhead because the transition from native to Java code is more expensive than a normal method call .
For JNI , therefore , causing the natives to reach for many individual fields from the objects passed to them leads to poorer performance .
Consider two methods in Listing 5 , the second of which assumes we have cached the field IDs :
Listing 5 . Two method versions int sumValues ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jint a , jint b , jint c , jint d , jint e , jint f ) { return a + b + c + d + e + f ; } int sumValues2 ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jobject allValues ) { jint avalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , a ) ; jint bvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , b ) ; jint cvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , c ) ; jint dvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , d ) ; jint evalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , e ) ; jint fvalue = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , allValues , f ) ; return avalue + bvalue + cvalue + dvalue + evalue + fvalue ; } Show more

Performance Tip # 4
When possible , pass individual parameters to JNI natives so that the native calls back to the JVM for the data it needs to do its work .
The sumValues2 ( ) method requires six JNI callbacks and takes 3,572 ms to run 10,000,000 times .
It is six times slower than sumValues ( ) , which takes only 596 ms .
By passing in the data required by the JNI method , sumValues ( ) avoids a substantial amount of JNI overhead .
Choosing the wrong boundary between native and Java code
It ’s up to the developer to define the boundary between native and Java code .
The choice of the boundary can have a significant impact on the application ’s overall performance .
The cost of calling from Java code to natives and from natives to Java code is significantly higher than a normal Java method call .
Further , the transition can interfere with the JVM ’s ability to optimize code execution .
For example , the Just - in - time compiler might be less effective as the number of transitions between Java code and native code increases .
We have measured that calling from Java code to a native can take five times longer than a regular method .
Similarly , calls from a native to Java code can take substantial time .
Performance Tip # 5
Define the split between Java and natives to minimize the transitions from Java to natives and callbacks from natives to Java .
The split between Java code and natives should , therefore , be designed to minimize the transitions between Java and native code .
Transitions should be made only when required , and you should do enough work in a native to amortize the cost of the transition .
A key element of minimizing transitions is to ensure that data is maintained on the correct side of the Java / native boundary .
If data resides on the wrong side , constant transitions will be triggered by the need of the other side to reach for that data .
For example , if we want to provide an interface to a serial port using JNI , we could come up with two different interfaces .
One version is in Listing 6 :
Listing 6 . Interface to a serial port : Version 1 /∗∗ ∗ Initializes the serial port and returns a java SerialPortConfig objects ∗ that contains the hardware address for the serial port , and holds ∗ information needed by the serial port such as the next buffer ∗ to write data into ∗ ∗ @param env JNI env that can be used by the method ∗ @param comPortName the name of the serial port ∗ @returns SerialPortConfig object to be passed ot setSerialPortBit ∗ and getSerialPortBit calls ∗/ jobject initializeSerialPort ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jstring comPortName ) ; /∗∗ ∗

Send the next byte ∗ ∗ @param env JNI env that can be used by the method ∗/ void sendNextByte( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj ) ;

In Listing 6 , all of the configuration data for the serial port is stored in the Java object returned by the initializeSerialPort ( ) method , and Java code is in full control of setting each individual bit in the hardware .
Several issues with the version in Listing 6 will lead to poorer performance than the version in Listing 7 :
Listing 7 . Interface to a serial port : Version 2 /∗∗ ∗
Initializes the serial port and returns an opaque handle to a native ∗ structure that contains the hardware address for the serial port ∗ and holds information needed by the serial port such as ∗ the next buffer to write data into ∗ ∗ @param env JNI env that can be used by the method ∗ @param comPortName the name of the serial port ∗ @returns opaque handle to be passed to setSerialPortByte and ∗ getSerialPortByte calls ∗/ jlong initializeSerialPort2 ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jstring comPortName ) ; /∗∗ ∗ sends a byte on the serial port ∗ ∗ @param env JNI env that can be used by the method ∗ @param serialPortConfig opaque handle for the serial port ∗ @param byte the byte to be sent ∗/ void sendSerialPortByte( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jlong serialPortConfig , jbyte byte ) ; /∗∗ ∗ Reads the next byte from the serial port ∗ ∗ @param env JNI env that can be used by the method ∗ @param serialPortConfig opaque handle for the serial port ∗ @returns the byte read from the serial port ∗/ jbyte readSerialPortByte( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jlong serialPortConfig ) ; Show more

Performance Tip # 6
Structure the application ’s data so that it exists on the right side of the boundary and can be accessed by the code that uses it without requiring many transitions across the Java / native boundary .
The most obvious issue is that the interface in Listing 6 requires a JNI call for each bit set or retrieved , as well as a JNI call to read a byte from , or write a byte to , the serial port .
This leads to nine times as many JNI calls for each byte read or written .
The second issue is that L Listing 6 stores the configuration information for the serial port in a Java object that ’s on the wrong side of the Java / native boundary for where the data is used .
We need this configuration data only on the native side ; storing it on the Java side will cause numerous callbacks from the native to Java to set / get this configuration information .
Listing 7 stores the configuration information in a native structure ( for example , a C struct ) and returns an opaque handle to Java code , which can be returned on subsequent calls .
This means that when a native is running it can reach directly into the structure without needing to call back to Java code for information such as the serial - port hardware address or the next buffer available .
The performance of an implementation using Listing 7 will therefore be much better .
Using many local references without informing the JVM
Local references are created for any object returned by a JNI function .
For example , when you call GetObjectArrayElement ( ) , a local reference to the object in the array is returned .
Consider how many local references are used when the code in Listing 8 is run on a very large array :
Listing 8 . Creating local references void workOnArray ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jarray array ) { jint i ; jint count = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetArrayLength( env , array ) ; for ( i=0 ; i < count ; i++) { jobject element = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetObjectArrayElement( env , array , i ) ; if (( ∗env ) ‑> ExceptionOccurred ( env ) ) { break ; } /∗ do something with array element ∗/ } } Show more
Show more icon
Each time GetObjectArrayElement ( ) is called , a local reference is created for the element and is n’t freed until the native completes .
The larger the array , the more local references will be created .
Performance Tip # 7
When a native causes the creation of a large number of local references , delete each reference when it is no longer required .
These local references are freed automatically when the native method terminates .
The JNI specification requires that each native be able to create at least 16 local references .
Although this is adequate for many methods , some methods need to access more during their lifetime .
In this case , you should either delete references that are no longer needed , by using the JNI DeleteLocalRef ( ) call , or inform the JVM that you ’ll be using a larger number of local references .
Listing 9 adds a call to DeleteLocalRef ( ) to the example in Listing 8 , informing the JVM that the local reference is no longer needed and limiting the number of local references that exist at one time to a reasonable number , regardless of the array ’s size :
Listing 9 . Adding DeleteLocalRef ( ) void workOnArray ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jarray array ) { jint i ; jint count = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetArrayLength( env , array ) ; for ( i=0 ; i < count ; i++) { jobject element = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetObjectArrayElement( env , array , i ) ; if (( ∗env ) ‑> ExceptionOccurred ( env ) ) { break ; } /∗ do something with array element ∗/ ( ∗env ) ‑> DeleteLocalRef(env , element ) ; } } Show more

Performance Tip # 8
If a native will have a large number of local references simultaneously , call the JNI EnsureLocalCapacity ( ) method to inform the JVM and allow it to optimize its handling of local references for this case .
You can call the JNI EnsureLocalCapacity ( ) method to tell the JVM that you ’ll be using more than 16 local references .
This allows the JVM to optimize the handling of local references for that native .
Failure to inform the JVM can lead to a FatalError if the required local references cannot be created , or poor performance that ’s due to a mismatch between the local - reference management employed by the JVM and the number of local references used .
Correctness pitfalls
The top five JNI correctness pitfalls are :
Using the wrong JNIEnv
A thread executing native code uses a JNIEnv to make JNI methods calls .
But the JNIEnv is used for more than just dispatching the requested methods .
The JNI specification states that each JNIEnv is local to a thread .
A JVM can rely on this assumption , storing additional thread - local information within the JNIEnv .
Use of the JNIEnv from one thread by another thread can lead to subtle bugs and crashes that are hard to debug .
Correctness Tip # 1
Only use the JNIEnv with the single thread to which it is associated .
A thread can get a JNIEnv by calling GetEnv ( ) using the JNI invocation interface through a JavaVM object .
The JavaVM object itself can be obtained by calling the JNI GetJavaVM ( ) method using a JNIEnv object and can be cached and shared across threads .
Caching a copy of the JavaVM object enables any thread with access to the cached object to get access to its own JNIEnv when necessary .
For optimal performance , however , a thread should pass the JNIEnv that it received when it was invoked down through the methods it calls , because looking it up can require significant work .
Not checking for exceptions
Many of the JNI methods that natives can call can raise exceptions on the executing thread .
When Java code executes , these exceptions cause a change to the execution flow such that the exception - handling code path is automatically invoked .
When a native makes a call to a JNI method , an exception can be raised , but it ’s up to the native to check for exceptions and take appropriate action .
A common JNI programming pitfall is to call a JNI method and to proceed without checking for exceptions once the call is complete .
This can lead to buggy code and crashes .
For example , consider code that calls GetFieldID ( ) , which raises the NoSuchFieldError if the requested field ca n’t be found .
If the native code proceeds without checking for the exception and uses the field ID it thought was returned , a crash can occur .
The code in Listing 10 , for example , might cause a crash — rather than throw a NoSuchFieldError — if the Java class is modified so that the charField field no longer exists :
Listing 10 .
Failing to check for exceptions jclass objectClass ; jfieldID fieldID ; jchar result = 0 ; objectClass = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetObjectClass( env , obj ) ; fieldID = ( ∗env ) ‑>GetFieldID(env , objectClass , " charField " , " C " ) ; result = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetCharField( env , obj , fieldID ) ; Show more
Show more icon
Correctness Tip # 2
Always check for exceptions after making JNI calls that can raise exceptions .
It ’s much easier to include the code to check for the exception than to try to debug a crash later on .
Often you can simply check if an exception has occurred and if so return immediately to Java code so that the exception is thrown .
It will then be either handled or displayed using the normal Java exception - handling process .
For example , Listing 11 checks for exceptions :
Listing 11 .
Checking for exceptions jclass objectClass ; jfieldID fieldID ; jchar result = 0 ; objectClass = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetObjectClass( env , obj ) ; fieldID = ( ∗env ) ‑>GetFieldID(env , objectClass , " charField " , " C " ) ; if (( ∗env ) ‑> ExceptionOccurred ( env ) ) { return ; } result = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetCharField( env , obj , fieldID ) ; Show more
Show more icon
Not checking and clearing exceptions can lead to unexpected behavior .
Can you spot what is wrong with this code ?
fieldID = ( ∗env ) ‑>GetFieldID(env , objectClass , " charField " , " C " ) ; if ( fieldID == NULL ) { fieldID = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetFieldID(env , objectClass , " charField " , " D " ) ; } return ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetIntField ( env , obj , fieldID ) ; Show more
Show more icon
The problem is that even though the code handles the case in which the initial GetFieldID ( ) does n’t return the field ID , it does not clear the exception that this call would set .
The return from the native will therefore cause an exception to be thrown immediately .
Not checking return values
Correctness Tip # 3
Always check the return value from a JNI method and include code paths to handle errors .
Many JNI methods have a return value that indicates whether the call succeeded or not .
A common pitfall , similar to not checking for exceptions , is to fail to check the return value and for the code to proceed on the assumption that the call was successful .
For most of the JNI methods , the return value and exception status will both be set so that checking either the exception status or the return value will let the application know if the method ran correctly or not .
Can you spot what is wrong with the following code ?
clazz = ( ∗env ) ‑> FindClass( env , " com/ibm/j9//HelloWorld " ) ; method = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetStaticMethodID(env , clazz , " main " , " ( [ Ljava/lang / String ; ) V " ) ; ( ∗env ) ‑>CallStaticVoidMethod( env , clazz , method , NULL ) ;
Show more
Show more icon
The problems are that if the HelloWorld class is not found or if the main ( ) method does n’t exist , the native will cause a crash .
Using array methods incorrectly
The GetXXXArrayElements ( ) and ReleaseXXXArrayElements ( ) methods allow you to request array elements .
Similarly , GetPrimitiveArrayCritical ( ) , ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical ( ) , GetStringCritical ( ) , and ReleaseStringCritical ( ) allow you to request array elements or string bytes to maximize the likelihood that they will get a direct pointer to the array or string .
Two common pitfalls are associated with the use of these methods .
The first is to forget to commit changes in the call to the ReleaseXXX ( ) method .
There ’s no guarantee that you will actually get a direct pointer to the array or string even when using the Critical versions .
Some JVMs will always return a copy , and in these JVMs the changes made to the array will not be copied back if you specify JNI_ABORT in the call to ReleaseXXX ( ) or forget to call ReleaseXXX ( ) .
For example , consider this code :
void modifyArrayWithoutRelease ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jarray arr1 ) { jboolean isCopy ; jbyte∗ buffer = ( ∗env ) ‑ > ( ∗env ) ‑> GetByteArrayElements( env,arr1 , &isCopy ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑ > ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) return ; buffer [ 0 ] = 1 ; } Show more
Show more icon
Correctness Tip # 4
Do n’t forget to call Release XXX ( ) with a mode of 0 ( copy back and free the memory ) for each Get XXX ( ) call .
On a JVM that provides a direct pointer to the array , the array will be updated ; however , on a JVM that returns a copy it will not be .
This can lead to cases where your code seems to work on some JVMs but fails to work on others .
You should always include a release call , as shown in Listing 12 :
Listing 12 .
Including a release call void modifyArrayWithRelease ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jarray arr1 ) { jboolean isCopy ; jbyte∗ buffer = ( ∗env ) ‑ > ( ∗env ) ‑> GetByteArrayElements( env,arr1 , &isCopy ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑ > ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) return ; buffer [ 0 ] = 1 ; ( ∗env ) ‑>ReleaseByteArrayElements(env , arr1 , buffer , JNI_COMMIT ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑ > ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) return ; } Show more
Show more icon
The second pitfall is not honoring the restrictions placed by the specification on code that executes between the GetXXXCritical ( ) and ReleaseXXXCritical ( ) .
The native may not make any JNI calls between these methods and may not block for any reason .
Failing to honor these restrictions can lead to intermittent deadlock within the application or the JVM as a whole .
For example , the following code might look okay :
void workOnPrimitiveArray( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jarray arr1 ) { jboolean isCopy ; jbyte∗ buffer = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetPrimitiveArrayCritical( env , arr1 , &isCopy ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑> ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) return ; processBufferHelper ( buffer ) ; ( ∗env ) ‑> ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical( env , arr1 , buffer , 0 ) ; if ( ( ∗env ) ‑> ExceptionCheck ( env ) ) return ; } Show more
Show more icon
Correctness Tip # 5 Ensure the code does not make any JNI calls or block for any reason between calls to Get XXXCritical ( ) and Release XXXCritical ( ) .
However , we need to validate that all of the code that can be run when processBufferHelper ( ) is called does not violate any of the restrictions .
These restrictions apply to all code that executes between the Get and Release calls , whether it is part of the native itself or not .
Using global references incorrectly
Natives can create global references so that objects are not garbage collected until they are no longer needed .
Common pitfalls are forgetting to delete global references that have been created or losing track of them completely .
Consider a native that creates a global reference but does not delete or store it anywhere :
lostGlobalRef( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jobject keepObj ) { jobject gref = ( ∗env ) ‑> NewGlobalRef(env , keep Obj ) ; } Show more
Show more icon
Correctness Tip # 6
Always keep track of global references and ensure they are deleted when the object is no longer required .
When the global reference is created , the JVM adds it to a list that excludes that object from garbage collection .
When the native returns , not only has it not freed the global reference , but the application also no longer has a way to get the reference in order to free it later — so the object will live forever .
Not freeing global references causes issues not only because they keep the object itself alive but also because they keep alive all objects that can be reached through the object .
In some cases this can add up to a significant memory leak .
Avoiding the common pitfalls
Suppose you have just finished writing some new JNI code or inherited some JNI code from elsewhere .
How can you ensure that you have avoided the common pitfalls or can find them in your inherited code ?
Table 1 identifies the techniques you can use to root out instances of the common pitfalls :

You can identify many of the common pitfalls early in the development cycle by :
Validating new code against the JNI specification
It ’s a good practice to maintain a list of the constraints imposed by the specification and review natives for compliance with the list , either manually or through automatic code analysis .
You ’ll likely expend much less effort ensuring compliance than you would debugging the subtle and intermittent failures that can occur when the constraints are not observed .
Here ’s a starting list of specification - conformance checks to do for newly developed code ( or code that is new to you ) :
Validate that a JNIEnv is used only with the thread to which it is associated .
is used only with the thread to which it is associated .
Validate that JNI Methods are not called within GetXXXCritical ( ) ‘s ReleaseXXXCritical ( ) section .
‘s section .
For a method that enters a critical section , validate that the method does not return before it is released .
Validate that there is a check for an exception after all JNI calls that can raise an exception .
Ensure that all Get / Release calls are matched within each JNI method .
IBM ’s JVM implementation includes an option that turns on automatic JNI checks , at the cost of slower execution .
In conjunction with good unit tests for your code , this is a powerful tool .
You can run the application or unit tests once to do a compliance check or when you encounter bugs for which you suspect natives to be the cause .
In addition to doing the specification - compliance checks we listed above , it also ensures that :
The parameters passed to JNI methods are of the correct types .
JNI code does not read past the ends of arrays .
Only valid pointers are passed to JNI methods .
Not all the findings the JNI check reports are necessarily errors in the code .
They include suggestions as to code that should be reviewed closely to ensure that it does what was intended .
You enable the JNI check option with the following command line :
Usage : ‑ Xcheck : jni:option [ , option [ , ... ] ] all check application and system classes verbose trace certain JNI functions and activities trace trace all JNI functions nobounds do not perform bounds checking on strings and arrays nonfatal do not exit when errors are detected nowarn do not display warnings noadvice do not display advice novalist do not check for va_list reuse valist check for va_list reuse pedantic perform more thorough , but slower checks help print this screen Show more Show more icon
Using the IBM JVM ’s - Xcheck : jni option as part of the standard development process can help you find coding errors much more easily .
In particular , it can help you root out the pitfalls of using the JNIEnv with the wrong thread and using critical regions incorrectly .
Recent Sun JVMs provide a similarly named - Xcheck : jni option .
It operates differently from the IBM version and provides different information , but the purpose is the same .

Generating a trace of the natives that are invoked , along with the JNI callbacks that these natives make , can be useful for rooting out a number of the common pitfalls .
Issues to look for include :
An abundance of GetFieldID ( ) and GetMethodID ( ) calls — in particular , if the calls are for the same fields and methods — indicates that the fields and method are not being cached .
and calls — in particular , if the calls are for the same fields and methods — indicates that the fields and method are not being cached .
Instances of calls to GetTypeArrayElements ( ) instead of GetTypeArrayRegion ( ) can indicate unnecessary copying .

A large imbalance between calls to NewGlobalRef ( ) and DeleteGlobalRef ( ) can indicate a failure to free global references when they are no longer needed .
Some JVM implementations provide a mechanism through which a method trace can be generated .
You can also generate a trace through external tools such as profilers and code - coverage tools .
The IBM JVM implementation provides a number of ways to generate trace information .
The first is to use the - Xcheck : jni: trace option .
This generates a trace of the native methods called as well as the JNI callbacks that they make .
Listing 13 shows an excerpt of a trace ( with some lines split for readability only ) :
Listing 13 .

The trace excerpt in Listing 13 shows the native being called ( for example , AccessController.initializeInternal ( ) V ) and then the JNI callbacks the native makes .
Using the - verbose : jni option
Both the Sun and IBM JVMs also provide a - verbose : jni option .
For the IBM JVM , turning this option on provides information about what JNI callbacks are being made .
Listing 14 shows an example :
Listing 14 .
Listing JNI callbacks with the IBM JVM’s - verbose : jni < JNI GetStringCritical : buffer=0x100BD010 > < JNI ReleaseStringCritical : buffer=100BD010 > < JNI GetStringChars : buffer=0x03019C88 > < JNI ReleaseStringChars : buffer=03019C88 > < JNI FindClass : java / lang / String > < JNI FindClass : java/io/WinNTFileSystem >

For the Sun JVM , turning the - verbose : jni option on does n’t provide information about the calls being made , but it does provide additional information about the natives used .
Listing 15 shows an example :
Listing 15 .
Using the Sun JVM ’s - verbose : jni Dynamic‑linking native method java.util.zip.ZipFile.getMethod ... JNIDynamic‑linking native method java.util.zip.Inflater.initIDs ...

JNI [ Dynamic‑linking native method java.util.zip.Inflater.reset ... JNI ]

Turning on this option also causes the JVM to emit warnings when too many local references are used without informing the JVM .
For example , the IBM JVM generates messages like this one :
JVMJNCK065W JNI warning in FindClass : Automatically grew local reference frame capacity from 16 to 48 . 17 references are in use .
Use EnsureLocalCapacity or PushLocalFrame to explicitly grow the frame .

Although the - verbose : jni and - Xcheck : jni: trace options make it easy to get the information you need , reviewing this information manually can take a fair amount of effort .
It ’s a good idea to create scripts or utilities that can process the trace files being generated by your JVM and look for the warning signs .
Generating dumps
Dumps generated from a running Java process contain a wealth of information about a JVM ’s state .
For many JVMs , they include information about global references .
For example , the recent Sun JVMs include the following line in the dump information :
JNI global references : 73 Show more
Show more icon
By generating before and after dumps , you can assess if you ’re creating any global references that are not being freed when they should be .
You can request a dump in UNIX ® environments by issuing a kill - 3 or kill - QUIT on the java process .
On Windows® , use Ctrl + Break .
For the IBM JVM , use these steps to obtain information on global references :
Add - Xdump : system : events=user to the command line .
This asks the JVM to generate a system dump when you invoke kill - 3 on a UNIX variant or Ctrl + Break on Windows .
When your program is running , generate subsequent dumps .
Run jextract - nozip core .XXX output.xml , which extracts dump information into a readable format in output.xml .
Look for JNIGlobalReference entries in output.xml , which give you information about the current global references , as shown in Listing 16 :
Listing 16 .
JNIGlobalReference entries in output.xml < rootobject type =" Thread " id =" 0x10089990 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type =" Thread " id =" 0x10089fd0 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x100100c0 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x10011250 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x10011840 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x10011880 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x10010af8 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x10010360 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " JNIGlobalReference " id =" 0x10081f48 " reachability = " strong " /> < rootobject type = " StringTable " id =" 0x10010be0 " reachability = " weak " /> < rootobject type = " StringTable " id =" 0x10010c70 " reachability = " weak " /> < rootobject type = " StringTable " id =" 0x10010d00 " reachability = " weak " /> < rootobject type = " StringTable " id =" 0x10011018 " reachability = " weak " />

By looking at the numbers reported in subsequent Java dumps , you can assess if global references are being leaked .
Performing code reviews
Code reviews can often be effective for spotting common pitfalls and can be done at a number of levels .
When you inherit new code , a quick scan can reveal issues that would take much longer to debug later on .
In some cases , a review is the only way to identify an instance of a pitfall such as the code not checking return values .
For example , the problem with this code would likely be easy to identify through a code review but much harder to find through debugging :
int calledALot ( JNIEnv∗ env , jobject obj , jobject allValues ) { jclass cls = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetObjectClass( env,allValues ) ; jfieldID a = ( ∗env ) ‑> GetFieldID(env , cls , " a " , " I " ) ; jfield ID b = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID(env , cls , " b " , " I " ) ; jfield ID c = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID (env , cls , " c " , " I " ) ; jfield ID d = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID(env , cls , " d " , " I " ) ; jfield ID e = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID (env , cls , " e " , " I " ) ; jfieldID f = ( ∗env ) ‑ > GetFieldID(env , cls , " f " , " I " ) ; } jclass getObjectClassHelper( jobject object ) {
/∗ use globally cached JNIEnv ∗/ return cls = ( ∗globalEnvStatic ) ‑> GetObjectClass( globalEnvStatic , allValues ) ; } Show more Show more icon
A code review would likely identify that the first method is not properly caching field IDs even though the same IDs are used repeatedly , and that the second method is using a JNIEnv on threads other than the one the JNIEnv should be used on .
Conclusion
You ’re now aware of the top 10 JNI programming pitfalls and have learned some good practices for identifying them in existing or new code .
Apply these practices diligently to increase the likelihood that your JNI code is correct and that your application can achieve the performance levels it requires .
The ability to integrate existing code assets efficiently is essential to succeeding with two technologies that are gaining momentum : service - oriented architecture ( SOA ) and cloud - based computing .
JNI is a key technology for integrating non-Java legacy code and components into a Java - based platform used as a building block for an SOA or cloud - based system .
Proper use of JNI can speed the process of service - enabling these components and allow you to derive the maximum advantage from existing investments .
For people interested in Middle East peace , i should share a fascinating news source .
For the most part it supports Israeli positions and anti-Muslim hysteria ( for example , it will feature articles by Rightist Extremists like Daniel Pipes , who supported arming Saddam Hussein so he would be able to kill more Iranians back during the Iraqi war on Iran ) .
It comes from the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations and is called the Daily Alert .
You can subscribe to it here .
All members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations serve on AIPAC 's Executive Committee .
So you get the definite pro-Occupation slant .
This daily news alert is helpful to understand what those who support continuing the Israeli occupation of Palestine are up to , what propaganda they are currently catapulting to the masses .
If you want to hear the voice of the other side , i would suggest the Jewish Peace News , which is not daily , but very helpful , and supportive of actual working toward peace with justice in the Middle East .
Today 's missive from the pro-settlement side featured an article from Politico .
Democrats pressure Barack Obama on Israel
" My concern is that we are applying pressure to the wrong party in this dispute , " said Rep. Shelley Berkley ( D - Nev. ) .
" I think it would serve America ’s interest better if we were pressuring the Iranians to eliminate the potential of a nuclear threat from Iran , and less time pressuring our allies and the only democracy in the Middle East to stop the natural growth of their settlements . "
" When Congress gets back into session the administration is going to hear from many more members than just me , " she said .
.....
But even a key defender of Obama ’s Mideast policy , Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - Fla. ) , is seeking to narrow the administration ’s definition of " settlement " to take pressure off Obama .
And the unusual criticism by congressional Democrats of the popular president is a sign that it may take more than a transformative presidential election to change the domestic politics of Israel .
Wexler , who is usually a progressive on many issues , has been quick to support AIPAC .
Too quick .
For example , last year when AIPAC supported a resolution essentially supporting an embargo on Iran , Wexler was one of the first to support it , though he backed off after massive opposition from antiwar groups .
You can see he is willing to help AIPAC / pro-settlement side here .
If Wexler is successful in " redefining " settlements , then what is not defined as a settlement will be able to expand , and take more land from a future Palestinian state .
There is a problem .
Because the definition of settlements is crystal - clear .
All land in the West Bank , settled by Israeli citizens , and who are claiming that land for Israel , is a settlement .
Article 49 of the Geneva Convention is also quite clear :
The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies .
What is international law , what is human rights to a US Congress ?
We have seen time and time again that it hardly ever part of their considerations .
Nearly 300,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements among 2.4 million Palestinians .
Another 180,000 live in Jewish neighborhoods of east Jerusalem .
The Palestinians claim both areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war as parts of a future independent state .
What Wexler and AIPAC will attempt to do is redefine " not expanding the settlements " to a few isolated " outposts " that Israel itself has defined as illegal .. by removing them it hopes to claim to achieve the goal of not " expanding the settlements " .
Despite the fact , that on the ground , overall more land will be taken for Israel , more Palestinian homes demolished .
Palestinians will soon be left with next to nothing with such a " peace process " .
Despite the tough talk from Obama , for its part the administration has laid out no consequences for Israel if it continues to expand the settlements .
Theoretically , there is much Obama can do , even without the support of Congress .
Yet we have seen no evidence that it is willing to risk a real confrontation with Congress and the anti-Palestine Lobby .
This week Obama is in the Middle East , where he will be attempting to convince Arab leaders , and the Arab people , that he is serious about peace .
The latter group will be a hard sell , as they want more than words .
We can see that the US Congress is on the side of keeping the status quo .
Unless we see massive pressure from the grassroots to support an end to settlement expansion , then i think the pro-settlement sides will again win the day .
You can help end the settlements by going here .
If the United States wants to see Israel stop the expansion of settlements , then it should cut off or , at the very minimum , condition its military aid to Israel until this and other policy goals are met .
This is the grassroots uprising that we need to pressure congress so that they will be less willing to stick to the status quo .
It will be a long fight .
Join it .
You can join the fight against aipac by going here .
We can stop aipac , like any other anti-peace / human rights lobby .
With people - power .
We wo n't deny others their right to organize according to their political convictions .
We will not hesitate to protest gatherings that support war , occupation , and the denial of human rights .

Television stations now battle for rights to Europe ’s Champions League – which will be broadcast on the Fox Soccer Channel while ESPN is already running trailers for next year ’s World Cup finals .
No wonder , the Wall Street Journal asks Are Americans Becoming Soccer Fans ?
Well , are they ?
The numbers are impressive and are hard to ignore but it is worth noting , as U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati did this week , that the games that are attracting such huge crowds involve the absolute cream of the crop .
“ Clearly we are not getting those attendances at MLS games , and it is an important question as to how we can tap into what is clearly an audience for high - level international games .
“ It ’s a little bit chasing stars if we think most teams around the world would draw those sorts of attendances .
If we were to have a tournament next summer with Stuttgart , Aston Villa , Olympique Marseille and pick another team , I do n’t think we ’d have those same sorts of attendances .
“ The teams that have come are two of the glory teams in Real Madrid and Barcelona , two or three of the top English and Italian teams , really the best teams in the world and biggest stars , ” he said .
Nonetheless , the idea that soccer is alien or foreign to Americans or that the game somehow needs to be altered to appeal to those used to the NFL or NBA has been shown to be the nonsense that it is .
American fans will pay top dollar for a ticket to watch some of the best players in the world – soccer has an appeal and a following among a public which , despite the constant crowing of some in Europe , understands and appreciates the game .
The question is – can Major League Soccer tap into this support ?
Does the league have the capability to go from its current level ( league - wide average crowds of 15,000 and small television ratings ) to something more akin to what Seattle have been able to produce – large crowds and being a central component of a city ’s sporting life ?
The MLS ’s prudent salary cap and the very gradualist approach to expansion have been factors in its modest success so far but they could , in time , turn out to be exactly what is holding the game back .
Right from the outset , MLS has been keen to avoid the fate of the previous attempt at a top flight soccer league – the NASL – which after a surge of interest during the glory days of the New York Cosmos – imploded into oblivion after expanding too quickly ( and recklessly ) and spending too much .
MLS focused heavily in its early years on developing young American talent and in recent years has chosen to recruit relatively cheap foreign players to boost the ranks .
While this is a sensible , conservative approach , it also restricts the chances of the league being able to tap in to that market for top quality soccer that has been illustrated so spectacularly this summer .
Firstly , the low level of salaries encourages the best young American players to go abroad – few of the U.S. team that beat Spain actually play in MLS and that hardly sends a message to fans that their domestic product is something worth following .
Secondly , the salary restrictions mean clubs are not allowed to go chasing players on the international market and inject some exciting names and quality from abroad .
Occasionally , a bargain gem is unearthed such as Seattle ’s Colombian Fredy Montero , but on the whole the foreign players in MLS are not the kind of performers who would put additional numbers on the gate .
Finding players near the end of their careers in Europe , looking for a new challenge and interested in more than just a final payday , is tough and Seattle with Freddy Ljungberg , New York with Juan Pablo Angel and Chicago with Cuauhtemoc Blanco have been among the few to strike lucky .
At the moment there is no real pressure to change the system but that could change next year – a World Cup year .
Should the U.S do well at the World Cup , repeating their surprise showing at the Confederations Cup , the interest level in the game will rise significantly and that could be a golden opportunity for MLS .
First , a U.S success ( by which I mean a run to the semi- finals or at least the quarter - finals ) would help create a generation of popular new American players and with the increased , unprecedented media coverage of the game , possibly the first household names in American soccer .
Secondly , the World Cup always creates new international stars and soccer fans in the U.S would love to watch those who impressed in South Africa play in their own grounds .
Now , I am not suggesting that MLS rip up their sensible approach to salaries but some flexibility to allow teams to capture some of the spirit ( and personnel ) of the World Cup would surely be a smart move .
After all , what a waste it would be if the U.S managed to capture the imagination of the sporting public with a heroic run to the latter stages of the World Cup only to see the handful of remaining MLS players , such as exciting midfielder Stuart Holden , leave to play in Europe .
The U.S national team is slowly becoming a respected force in the global game .
The U.S public is waking up to the entertainment that can be offered by the sport and MLS has the potential to become the biggest and best league outside of Europe ’s elite .
For years the talk has been of the potential for the growth of soccer in the U.S – now that growth is happening , it will be fascinating to see how the game progresses in the next couple of years .

Various analyses have tried to decipher just who the uninsured are .
These are the main conclusions , with the caveat that there is overlap in these numbers :
THE WORKING POOR
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that about two - thirds of the uninsured  30 million people  earn less than twice the poverty level , or about $ 44,000 for a family of four .
It also estimates that more than 80 percent of the uninsured come from families with full - time or part - time workers .
They often cannot get coverage at work or find it too expensive to buy .
They surely deserve a helping hand .
THE BETTER OFF
About nine million uninsured people , according to census data , come from households with incomes of $ 75,000 or more .
Critics say that is plenty of money for them to buy their own insurance .
But many of these people live in “ households ” that are groups of low - wage roommates or extended families living together .
Their combined incomes may reach $ 75,000 , but they cannot pool their resources to buy an insurance policy to cover the whole group .
Still , about 4.7 million uninsured people live in families that earn four times the poverty level  or $ 88,000 for a family of four  the dividing line that many experts use to define who can afford to buy their own insurance .
Those people who could afford coverage but choose not to buy it ought to be compelled to join the system to lessen the possibility that a serious accident or illness might turn them into charity cases and to help subsidize the coverage of poorer and sicker Americans .
YOUNG ADULTS Some 13 million young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 lack coverage .
These are not , for the most part , healthy young professionals making a sensible decision to pay their own minimal medical bills rather than buy insurance that they are unlikely to need .
The Kaiser foundation estimates that only 10 percent are college graduates , and only 5 percent have incomes above $ 60,000 a year , while half have family incomes below $ 16,000 a year .
Many of these younger people would be helped by reform bills that would provide subsidized coverage for the poor and an exchange where individuals can buy cheaper insurance than is now available .
ALREADY ELIGIBLE
Some 11 million of the poorest people , mostly low - income children and their parents , are thought to be eligible for public insurance programs but have failed to enroll , either because they do not know they are eligible or are intimidated by the application process .
When such people arrive at an emergency room , they are usually enrolled in Medicaid , but meanwhile they have lost out on routine care that could have kept them out of the emergency room .
They will presumably be scooped up by the mandate under reform bills that everyone obtain health insurance .
THE UNDERINSURED
The Commonwealth Fund estimates that 25 million Americans who had health insurance in 2007 had woefully inadequate policies with high deductibles and restrictions that stuck them with large amounts of uncovered expenses .
Many postponed needed treatments or went into debt to pay medical bills .
Kurt Vonnegut said it best .
Pistols are machines for killing other people .
That 's all they 're good for .
And the unfortunate showdown in Bluffdale this past week proves the point .
It 's no secret the Deseret News has been concerned over the years with firearms in public .
Concealed weapons , in our book , have no place in schools , in churches and in the parking lots of private businesses .
Today , we add they have no place on " neighborhood watch " patrols .
We 've also said that guns have a habit of hurting the innocent .
The tragedy of handguns is n't that the guilty end up paying but that the decent do .
Such was the case in Bluffdale .
Two well - meaning adults met on the street at night and — quick on the trigger — did n't bother to find out each other 's motives before " slapping leather . "
Both men , by all reports , are good men .
They are conscientious , kind and want the best for people .
They wanted to make their community safe .
Well , we have to ask .
Does Bluffdale feel safer now ?
Will people from the rest of the valley think twice before visiting the town after dark ?
Get out your letter - writing kits , we 're about to make some points we 've made many times before .
First , tough guys do n't pack firearms .
Fearful guys do — people who see everyone around them as a threat and think the worst of every face they do n't recognize .
Guns do n't showcase strength , they showcase weakness .
Second , guns do not make homes safer , they make homes more dangerous .
Statistics prove it .
Third , anyone who feels they must " pack heat " while attending church has a very low opinion of God 's children .
Fourth , putting pistols in the hands of school teachers may be the worst American idea since the Edsel .
Fifth , revolvers solve nothing .
They complicate the problem .
Six , the NRA crowd has it right :
Guns do n't kill people , people kill people .
We 've seen too many gunshot deaths to argue .
In the end , we urge citizens to dial it back .
Shoot your mouth off if you must .
Just do n't shoot someone else 's off .

ECONOMISTS tend to think that an industry divided between hundreds of players , each with a tiny market share , should be fiercely competitive , with prices cut to the bone .
But economic theory struggles to explain the bizarre world of fund management , where the market is fragmented but fees stay stubbornly high .
The takeover of Barclays Global Investors ( BGI ) by BlackRock , finalised on June 16th , will create the world 's largest asset manager .
More deals are likely in the coming months .
In part that is because banks are keen to shed their fund - management arms , either because they need to raise capital or because they no longer see a business case for combining deposit - taking with portfolio management .
In part it is because stockmarket falls in 2008 slashed fund managers ' revenues , leaving some groups with broken business models .
But the industry remains massively diffuse and has defied past predictions of consolidation .
Even the BGI / BlackRock deal will create a fund manager with only 3 - 5 % of the global market .
Perhaps the problem is that the industry has difficulty generating economies of scale .
Might a few mergers be good news ?
Bigger does not necessarily mean better when it comes to running other people 's money .
True , a bigger group has more money to spend on marketing and can achieve economies of scale in areas such as back - office technology and administration .
But there are also disadvantages of scale .
Large funds are less flexible and tend to move prices against them when they trade ; they also tend to be more bureaucratic and end up alienating talented managers , the ones clients want to look after their money .
Luck also plays its part .
Fund managers may grow for a while because of superior investment performance .
But sooner or later they will be undone by a change in market fashion ; their performance will deteriorate and hot money will move elsewhere .
The BGI / BlackRock deal may avoid some of these problems .
BGI is one of the two biggest fund managers in the field of index - tracking , one area where having more funds under management does lead to lower costs , which in turn makes it easier for the manager to match a chosen benchmark .
But that is something of a special case .
The general rule of fund - management consolidations is that they may be a good deal for the companies , but they rarely bring much benefit to investors , for two reasons .
First , retail fund managers compete on past performance rather than price .
Alas , a good performance one year tends not to be repeated the next ; but the fees carry on .
Second , because of their inertia , retail investors tend not to buy funds ; funds are sold to them .
Fund managers must pay banks and brokers to distribute their products , and they claim back that money from investors .
As a result the bestselling funds often have the highest charges ; other things being equal , they represent the worst deal for investors .
The price is wrong
That second factor helps explain why there is a stark difference between America and Europe .
In America , where retail investors are more willing to buy funds directly , the expense ratios of mutual funds have declined for four successive years , according to Lipper , a provider of financial information .
But in Europe , where funds are largely sold through banks , annual management fees have steadily risen , from 1.3 % in 1994 to 1.6 % last year .
Retail fund - managers have fed themselves well , but their investors have been left with the scraps .
Even institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies , which ought to have the clout to force down fees , are paying more .
A survey by Watson Wyatt , a consulting firm , found that the cost of running a pension scheme increased by around half between 2003 and 2008 .
That was because schemes allocated more of their portfolios to hedge funds and private - equity managers , which charge much higher fees .
Chasing performance by paying higher fees might work for individual investors , but in aggregate it is doomed to fail .
The return to the average investor is the market return minus costs ; if costs rise , returns must fall .
Retail investors , in particular , would do well to learn that lesson , and take responsibility for their own finances .
Just as they shop around to find the best estate agent , they can seek out low - charging vehicles such as exchange - traded funds .
If enough investors focus on cost , not performance , the fund - management industry will have to give them a better deal .

A blog post announces that some of the source code for the Apollo 11 spacecraft has been put online .
On this day 40 years ago , Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon .
This was quite an achievement for mankind and a key milestone in world history .
To commemorate this event the Command Module code ( Comanche054 ) and Lunar Module code ( Luminary099 ) have been transcribed from scanned images to run on yaAGC ( an open source AGC emulator ) by the Virtual AGC and AGS project .
Since we LTUers spend a lot of time talking about the highest of the high level languages it 's illuminating to see how much was done with so little .
The source also shows that flying to the moon is really not that different from the kind of programming most programmers do every day .

Relatives of a dead man in Spain asked a doctor to confirm his death a second time because his body showed no signs of going pale hours after he passed away , local officials say .
The 70 - year - old died of a heart attack and his body was on display at a funeral home in Lorca , a city of about 90,000 people in southern Spain , when his family noticed that it still had a healthy pink glow , a spokesman for the funeral home said on Wednesday .
They then called in the doctor to confirm that their loved one was in fact dead .
The doctor concluded that the man still had a healthy glow , even though he was dead , because his pacemaker was still running .

OTTAWA–They are professional journalists .
They give voice to terrorists .
They are vital to democracy .
They suppress it .
They are Al Jazeera English and they are hoping to come to a television near you .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission received public comments that varied from strongly in favour to outrageously against an application to allow the Qatar - based broadcaster to air in the country .
" At a time when Canadian newspapers and broadcasters are reducing coverage of foreign news , it is even more critical that Canadians can easily access coverage of international news and events , " wrote the Arab Canadian Association of the Atlantic Provinces in a favourable comment .
" Al - Jazeera has broadcast pre-recorded videos or interviews with extremists , who proclaim that Jews are pigs born of monkeys , that Christians in the Muslim world are the fruit of the Crusades and must be punished and that violent jihad is the path to paradise , " wrote Madeleine El- sayegh of Nepean , Ont. , in a comment explaining her opposition to the application sponsored by Toronto - based carrier Ethnic Channels Group Ltd .
Tony Burman , a former CBC news executive who became managing director of Al Jazeera English two years ago , said he is buoyed by the fact there have been far more positive comments than negative .
" Contrary to what people would have predicted , the overwhelming sentiment was in favour of Al Jazeera English being in Canada , " said Burman .
He said out of 2,652 public comments submitted to the CRTC , there were only 39 that could be described as against bringing the broadcaster to Canada .
A CRTC spokesperson said the commission does not categorize comments into for or against but glancing at the website where they are available it's evident the majority of them are in favour of bringing Al Jazeera English to Canada .
Burman described the comments from those opposed as having much more to do with the controversial record of its sister station , Al Jazeera Arabic , which he called " irrelevant " because editorial staff at the English - language service operate independently .
The Canadian Jewish Congress did not come out against the application , but expressed concerns about the link to the Arabic - language service – which , the association notes , has been known to broadcast Holocaust denial and anti-Semitic views – and the independence of Al Jazeera English given that the Qatar government owns both stations .
Bernie Farber , head of the CJC , said Burman alleviated some of its fears when he proposed a consultation committee , made up of the CJC and B'nai Brith Canada , to serve as a conduit for immediate complaints .
" That brought us some lessening of our angst , but we still remain concerned and vigilant , " Farber said in an interview .
The CRTC has not released a date for its decision but Burman said if all goes well , he expects Al Jazeera English to be available in Canada by the fall , when it would then set up a bureau here .
" We 're currently in discussions with various cable and satellite providers .
...
Most of them have been quite clear there is no question they want to include Al Jazeera English , " Burman said .
Shatter , the brick - breaking game that ‘ shattered ’ our expectations , is easily one of our most favorite PSN titles to date .
Even though Shatter was created using Sony ’s PhyreEngine , Sidhe may be bringing the title to other platforms .
Speaking to Gamasutra , Sidhe ‘s Managing Director Mario Wynands spoke about their promotional strategy for Shatter , the equal - value pricing across all regions , and how Shatter is NOT a PSN exclusive .
“ We have always had a very platform agnostic approach , but have moved quickly when opportunity arises .
Shatter is not exclusive to PSN , but Sony is offering the combination of good royalties , strong technology , and a well defined process for getting content to market .
PSN was an ideal first landing place for Shatter . ”
“ We have n’t ruled out any other platforms at this stage . ”
This is good for gamers , since more people could eventually get their hands on this amazing game .
But it ’s bad for Sony ’s PSN exclusive category , since one of their best offerings would be ‘ breaking ’ through to other platforms .
Sidhe , while you ’re at it , why not bring it over to the PSP ?

GM says
Volt to get 230 miles per gallon in city ...
General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its Chevrolet Volt rechargeable electric car should get 230 miles per gallon of gasoline in city driving , more than four times the mileage of the current champion , the Toyota Prius .
GM came up with the figure in early tests using draft guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for calculating the mileage of extended range electric vehicles , said Tony Posawatz , GM ’s vehicle line director for the Volt .
If the figure is confirmed by the EPA , which does the tests for the mileage posted on new car door stickers , the Volt would be the first car to exceed triple - digit gas mileage , Posawatz said .
The Volt is powered by an electric motor and a battery pack with a 40 - mile range .
After that , a small internal combustion engine kicks in to generate electricity for a total range of 300 miles .
The battery pack can be recharged from a standard home outlet .
Most automakers are working similar plug - in designs , but GM could be the leader with the Volt , which is due in showrooms late in 2010 .
Toyota ’s Prius , the most efficient car now sold in the U.S. , gets 48 miles per gallon of gas .
It is a gas- electric hybrid that runs on a small internal combustion engine assisted by a battery - powered electric motor to save gasoline .
The first - generation Volt is expected to cost near $ 40,000 , making it cost - prohibitive to many people even if gasoline returns to $ 4 per gallon .
The price is expected to drop with future generations of the Volt , but GM has said government tax credits and the savings on fuel could make it cost - effective , especially at 230 miles per gallon .
“ We get a little cautious about trying to forecast what fuel prices will do , ” Posawatz said .
“ We achieved this number and if fuel prices go up , it certainly does get more attractive even in the near - term generation , ” he said .
GM was to present details of the mileage figure on Tuesday morning at an event at its technical center in the Detroit suburb of Warren .
Figures for the Volt ’s highway and combined city / highway mileage have not yet been calculated , Posawatz said .
The combined mileage will be in the triple digits as well , he said , but both combined and highway will be worse than city because the engine runs more on longer highway trips .
The EPA guidelines , developed with input from automakers , figure that cars like the Volt will travel more on straight electricity in the city than on the highway .
If a person drives the Volt less than 40 miles , in theory they could go without using gasoline .
The mileage figure could vary as the guidelines are refined and the Volt gets further along in the manufacturing process , Posawatz said .
GM is about halfway through building about 80 Volts that will look and behave like the production model , and testing is running on schedule , Posawatz said .
Two critical areas , battery life and the electronic switching between battery and engine power , are still being refined , but the car is on schedule to reach showrooms late in 2010 , he said .
GM is simulating tests to make sure the new lithium - ion batteries last 10 years , Posawatz said .
“ We ’re further along , but we ’re still quite a ways from home , ” he said .
“ We ’re developing quite a knowledge base on all this stuff .
Our confidence is growing .
” The other area of new technology , switching between battery and engine power , is proceeding well , he said , with engineers just fine - tuning the operations .
“ We ’re very pleased with the transition from when it ’s driving EV ( electric vehicle ) to when the engine and generator kick in , ” he said , GM also is finishing work on the power cord , which will be durable enough that it can survive being run over by the car .
The Volt , he said , will have software on board so it can be programmed to begin and end charging during off - peak electrical use hours .
Chrysler LLC , Ford Motor Co. and Daimler AG are all developing plug-ins and electric cars , and Toyota Motor Corp. is working on a plug - in version of its gas-electric hybrid system .
Nissan Motor Co. announced last month that it would begin selling an electric vehicle in Japan and the U.S. next year .
Since last year , Ihave been closely following the FDIC's DIF fund ( Deposit Insurance Fund ) .
Starting at $ 53 billion in 2008 , the DIF has dwindled down to …. zero .
From the estimated losses they post after each bank closure , the FDIC is technically bankrupt .
The DIF is toast .
Although there does not seem to be much consternation in the mainstream media , a popular blog , Mish 's Global Economic Trend Analysis , posted my conclusion , saving me the work of typing it up , here .
I confirm that my own spreadsheet is also negative .
Readers of my column are quite aware of the predictions and suggested methods of protection made in “ Off a Cliff with No Airbags ” in April and the recent post here at TowneForCongress.com , “ Yes , Virginia , There Are No Reserve Requirements ” among other warnings of system insolvency .
The most likely scenario is that the U.S. Congress now allows the FDIC to tap into the $ 100 billion “ backup insurance ” fund already set aside .
However , the reader should carefully note my conclusion in “ Yes , Virginia … ” that we are on a paper ticket system .
In times of trial and lies , the truth can be labeled as deceit , but that does not make it any less truthful .
Truth persists and illuminates , even if there is no one around to utter it .
From Mish 's piece , note the words of deception from FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair on last Friday :
“ The past 18 months have been a very trying period in the financial services arena , but the FDIC and its staff have performed as Congress envisioned when it created the corporation more than 75 years ago .
Today , after protecting almost $ 300 billion in deposits since the current financial crisis began , the FDIC 's guarantee is as certain as ever .
Our industry funded reserves have covered all losses to date .
In fact , losses from today 's failures are lower than had been projected .
I commend our staff for their excellent work in assuring once again a smooth transition for bank customers with these resolutions .
The FDIC continues to stand by the nation 's insured deposits with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government .
No depositor has ever lost a penny of their insured deposits . ” ( photo )
My retort to Bair is to check on the $ 53 billion the FDIC has LOST over the last one and a half years .
This is a SHOCKING AND OUTRAGEOUS amount of money lost by clueless savers , but when one remembers that , heck , they are just paper tickets and fiat electrons anyways , perhaps everything will work out .
Yeah , right .
Besides this troubling news , one should also take a look at the monetization of debt by the Federal Reserve .
Chris Martenson writes a great piece here about POMOs – Permanent Open Market Operations .
We learned about OMOs recently in “ Fractional Reserve Banking in Pictures . ”
POMOs are when the FED very quickly buys the same Treasury from its primary dealers ( or even direct from the Treasury if need be ) and “ adds reserves ” or “ injects liquidity ” to the system .
This is just fancy talk for creating new dollars out of thin air .
All of the recent POMOs are purchases , but they can also be sales by the FED , which would deplete the money supply .
Obviously , one should not look to Bair or the other central planners to start a panic ; to the contrary , they will do anything to avoid a panic .
Therefore let a word to the wise be sufficient , and stay free .
Until we have members of Congress who will drive for sound money , this depression is going to take a long while .

While I am short - term pessimistic , the long - term prospectives are promising and well worth fighting for .

Michele Bachmann : Pro-Choice Warrior
While reading through the latest news this morning I happened upon a startling , yet much - welcomed story about GOP Rep.
Michele Bachmann .
It comes as just the latest sign that in the 21st Century we are moving toward an overwhelming pro-choice consensus in this country .
I 'm pleased to announce that on Tuesday , right - wing hardliner Michele Bachmann came out in support of a woman 's right to choose .
And on Sean Hannity 's radio show of all places !
Here 's the excerpt , from her delusional ranting about what is n't actually in the health insurance reform bill :
That 's why people need to continue to go to the town halls , continue to melt the phone lines of their liberal members of Congress and let them know , under no certain circumstances will I give the government control over my body and my health care decisions ! "
You go girl !
I knew she 'd come around and see the light eventually !
I can't believe it but I actually completely agree with Michele Bachmann for once !
The government should have no control over a woman 's body ( or anyone 's body for that matter ) or her health care decisions !!
And to have the courage to stand up so strongly for abortion rights , on such a conservative forum , is just amazing .
And the weird part is , Sean Hannity was so cowed by Bachmann 's pro-choice arguments , that he did n't even object !
Maybe Sean Hannity is pro-choice now too !
What an incredible day !
To think , two right - wing fringe lunatics like Michele Bachmann and Sean Hannity both tell the government that legislating what a woman can and can't do with her body is wrong !
And on the same day !
If they can change anyone can change !
And like me , they 'll also be happy to know that nowhere in the health reform legislation does it give the government any control of our bodies or our health care decisions !
Yes , it actually gives us more choices about our health care and removes many of the most harmful controls that the private insurance industry has over our bodies and our lives !
I can't wait for Michele Bachmann to sign on as a co-sponsor of health care reform and any pro-choice legislation that comes to the floor in Congress .
And why would n't she ?
I mean she could n't possibly say something like " under no certain circumstances will I give the government control over my body and my health care decisions " and then turn around and support the government telling women they are powerless to make decisions about their own pregnancies .
I mean that would just be the height of hypocrisy !
And I can't even imagine how ignorant a person would have to be to say something like " hands off my body " while holding anti-choice views at the same time .
That would be pretty ridiculous , would n't it ?
Anyway , I 'm glad to have you as our newest ally Rep. Michele Bachmann !
Oh , and THANK YOU for in the same breath exposing how the right - wing noise machine is creating these astroturf protests against health care reform :
BACHMANN : ... and let them know , under no certain circumstances will I give the government control over my body and my health care decisions .
And speak it loudly , clearly because they are now listening because you [ Sean Hannity ] have a brilliant audience and they are doing exactly what you told them to do .
Wow , one minute declaring your pro-choice values and in the next minute calling out Sean Hannity on being behind these right - wing mobs ?
Move over Barney Frank , we have a new cop on the beat !
What a day !

CHENNAI , India ( Reuters ) - India ’s unfancied rugby sevens side must bulk up if they hope to make an impact at next year ’s Commonwealth Games , eating seven meals and at least 15 eggs a day , the country ’s South African coach said on Friday .
“ I have told them ( his players ) they must eat at least 15 eggs a day , six for breakfast and the remaining nine any time , any how , during the day , ” the country ’s South African coach Norman Laker told the Telegraph newspaper on Friday .
“ The players have three meals a day and that ’s not enough .
In South Africa , elite rugby players have seven meals a day . ”
India is rated a lowly 83rd out of the 95 teams in the International Rugby Board rankings which are currently headed by South Africa .
“ Indian players weigh 72 - 77 kg on an average whereas the international players weigh between 88 and 100 kg .
That is the weight difference you have to make up , ” Laker said ahead of the team ’s departure to South Africa for a training stint .
India is hosting the Commonwealth Games in October 2010 .

Here is a guest post from BC union ( Steelworker ) researcher Kim Pollock .
By Kim Pollock
There is growing evidence that a new stock - market bubble is growing daily , right before our very eyes .
But while stock - market prices and market capitalization grow , there are still few signs of real economic recovery .
In Canada for instance , real gross domestic product decreased Â 0.5 percent in May , a faster rate of decline than in the previous three months , according to Statistics Canada .
And it was the goods - producing industries that saw the biggest decrease in real GDP .
The energy and manufacturing sectors were the main contributors to May ’s decline notes Stats Can , while construction and wholesale trade also decreased .
Conversely , the activities of real estate agents and brokers as well as retail trade actually advanced in the month .
This indicates thereâ€™s no end in sight to the massive growth in debt that helped fuel last yearâ€™s economic meltdown and that now is likely to deepen the recession .
In March , the Chartered General Accountants of Canada reported that household debt is at an all - time high , reaching $ 1.3Â trillion in 2008 .
And they warned that the escalation of debt is primarily caused by consumption motives rather than asset accumulation .
The three main indicators of household indebtedness â€ “ debt - to - income , debt - to - assets and debt - to - net worth ratios â€ “ have all deteriorated significantly in the past twoÂ years and particularly during 2008 , say the CGAs .
Canadian households are financing consumption activity and fuelling gross domestic product growth with unearned money as families increasingly turn to credit to finance day - to - day living expenses .
While their wages stagnate , working families are borrowing just to maintain their living standards .
And with growing unemployment , there will either finally be a decline in debt - creation , putting pressure on consumer demand or else a further growth in indebtedness and insolvency .
In July Stats Can says that another 45,000 people became unemployed across the country â€ “ more than twice what most economists predicted .
Losses were severe in both full - and part - time work .
â€ œSince October , total employment has fallen by 2.4 per cent , all in full - time work , with the vast majority of employment losses in manufacturing , construction , and transportation and warehousing , â€ the report stated .
â€ œDuring the same period , the unemployment rate increased 2.3 percentage points to 8.6 per cent , the highest rate in 11 years .
â€ 
Worse , itâ€™s increasingly clear that the Harper governmentâ€™s â€œstimulus packageâ€ was either too puny or so ineffectively delivered that it will do nothing to stop the tide of joblessness .
As a result of the growing employment crisis , Canadian personal bankruptcies are also jumping , up in June by over 50 per cent compared to the same time last year .
CBC reported a total of 10,823 personal bankruptcies in June , up 54.3 per cent compared to the previous June ’s numbers .
The Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada says that while only 7,013 individuals had to resort to bankruptcy in June 2008 , a few months before the recession took hold .
This June , there were also 515 business bankruptcies , up 10.8 per cent year - over - year .
The June 2009 personal bankruptcy numbers represent a 9.3 per cent increase compared to the previous month ’s figures , when there were 9,900 personal bankruptcies .
Personal bankruptcies rose for all provinces , both year - over - year and compared to May numbers .
In other words , weâ€ ™re simply seeing an extension of the same perverse economic forces that were at work before the global economy imploded .
Capital continues to be diverted from production to investment and spending rather than production of goods and services .
Corporations and consumers continue to try to square the circle through borrowing .
And real investment and employment creation remain in the tank .
With respect to investment , Statistics Canada for instance reported recently that business fixed capital formation â€ “ investments in the buildings , machinery and equipment needed to actually produce goods and services â€ “ fell by 6.4 percent from the last quarter of 2008 to the first quarter this year .
Compared to a year ago , capital formation was down by 6.3 percent .
Companiesâ€™ record in machinery and equipment investment is even worse , falling by 10.8 percent from the last three months of 2008 to the first three months of 2009 and down almost a fifth since the first quarter last year .
But bad as this seems , itâ€™s even worse when you take oil and gas investments out of the mix .
Almost all of Canadian firms investments in the past decade were in fact in the oil patch : Canadian firmsâ€™ investments in the energy sector grew by 12.2 percent per year from 1999 - 2008 , while investment in the overall goods - producing sector actually fell by 0.1 percent per year .
So even though itâ€™s a good time to invest , with prices of many commodities low and even falling and plenty of people looking for work , and even though new investments are clearly needed to keep Canada internationally competitive and save Canadian jobs , companies are currently not taking the opportunity .
Instead , what they are doing is continuing to shovel capital into stock markets , where the rate of profit continues to exceed that offered by real production .
Itâ€™s what UCLA historian Robert Brenner calls â€œbubblenomicsâ€ .
The Toronto Stock Exchange hit bottom in early March at an index level of just below 7600 .
Since then it has rebounded to about 10,800 , a recovery of about 42 percent .
So while capital has poured back into the stock market , it has not gone into investment or production of goods and services .
And sadly , financial investment will not significantly ease the employment crisis .
The growth in stock values helps to explain one thing though : why some economists insist they can see signs of economic recovery .
Apparently they donâ€™t get or donâ€™t value the difference between real investment in production and speculative investment in stocks , bonds , securities or weird financial instruments like derivatives â€ “ the same bunch of exotic , fictitious assets that helped push the economy over the brink last year .
Itâ€™s the sort of thinking revealed by former US Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan , who told Congress last year he didnâ€™t see the crisis coming !
During the run-up to the recent crash indeed , the illusion that all was well seems to have been fed at least in part by the sustained growth in market values and share prices .
In fact , there wonâ€™t be any shift toward real investment without concerted government intervention .
This might take the form of a concerted program of investments in infrastructure such as urban transit and commuter rail , alternate energy projects , improved social program delivery , child care , health care and education .
Hopefully these should be combined with â€ œBuy Canadianâ€ procurement policies â€ “ instead of howling about the US â€ œBuy Americanâ€ program in other words , the Harper government should match it with a Canadian equivalent to ensure that the benefits of stimulus stay here in Canada rather than get exported to China and other low - wage platforms .
There also has to be regulation of lending and capital markets to stop the flow into speculative investments rather than goods and services production .
The reason that capital continues to flow into financial dealing is not hard to find , after all .
Stats Can reported in May that while lower corporate revenues contributed to falling profits across the economy â€ “ Canadian corporations reported operating profits of $ 55.1 billion in the first quarter of 2009 , down 11.8 percent from the prior quarter â€ “ profits in the non-financial industries fell 12.6 percent to $ 41.0 billion , compared to only 9.3 percent to $ 14.1 billion in the financial sector .
This comes after a decade or more in which profits in financial dealing exceeded those in the real economy .
The net result is a strong and likely mounting corporate preference for stock - market speculation , not real investment .
The federal government should break that tendency with investment targets in manufacturing and other goods - producing industry , as well as measures to encourage training and infrastructure development .
These are measures that would lift sagging consumer demand , create jobs and put Canada on a firm footing to compete globally when the slump ends .
In short , it seems like all the forces that created the economic crash and drove the economy over the precipice remain fully in effect .
There is little reason to expect a recovery of the Canadian economy any time soon , in spite of the repeated cries of â€œlight at the end of the tunnelâ€ or sightings of â€œgreen shootsâ€ of economic growth .
And thereâ€™s particularly to reason to expect an early recovery if the government sits on its hands .

Sometimes , you just try to get ahead in life .
And sometimes it backfires on you .
This seems to be a running trend with public officials , especially insurance commissioners .
A recurring theme with insurance commissioners labeled as corrupt is the misuse of their positions in office to benefit them and advance politically .
However , the end result unfortunately turns into a front seat before a judge .
What is an Insurance Commissioner ?
A little background on what an insurance commissioner should actually focus on is this .
The basic definition is a “ top state regulator of the insurance business who is either elected to office or appointed by a state to safeguard the interests of policy owners . ”
The states slightly vary , however , in regards to whether the insurance department / division is autonomous or actually a portion of a larger body .
For example , the State of California has an insurance commissioner who oversees and directs all of the functions within the Department of Insurance .
In Florida , the Chief Financial Officer oversees the Department of Financial Services .
These positions and offices are essentially very similar , however , the Chief Financial Officer in Florida is actually a combination of the former offices of Comptroller , Treasurer , Insurance Commissioner , and the Fire Marshal .
Back to the corruption .
There have been a handful of insurance commissioners in recent years that have jeopardized their careers because of unethical practices .
Instead of boring you with a laundry list , we ’ll just focus on three juciest .
Chuck Quackenbush
Former California Insurance Commissioner , Chuck Quackenbush , served between the years of 1995 - 2000 .
He officially announced his resignation from office on June 28 , 2000 .
The corruption of the California Department of Insurance was revealed when Cindy Ossias , a senior lawyer within the Department , exposed the allegedly illegal and corrupt actions of the insurance commissioner .
Apparently , Quackenbush allowed insurance companies ( State Farm , Allstate and 20th Century Insurance ) to compensate their clients much less than the actual damages after the 1994 earthquake in Northridge , CA .
These insurance companies had set up special “ educational funds ” to create television commercials as an exchange .
The commercials were disguised as public service announcements .
However , suspicions arose , with people assuming that Quackenbush used these commercials to achieve electoral gain .
He eventually resigned in June 2000 , after putting Ossias on administrative leave after her identity was revealed .
His resignation was effective on July 10 , 2000 as he managed to avoid impeachment .
He eventually became a sheriff ’s deputy in Lee County , Florida .
Carroll Fisher
Unlike Quackenbush , former Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner , Carroll Fisher , was actually impeached by the state House of Representatives .
He had resigned in 2004 after being convicted of embezzlement and perjury .
On February 17 , 2006 , he received a one - year sentence on the embezzlement count and a two - year sentence on the perjury count .
These sentences were to run consecutively .
In May 2003 , Fisher had embezzled his own campaign funds after depositing a $ 1,000 campaign check into his already overdrawn bank account .
The perjury count ?
He never disclosed this information .
But that is not all .
In addition to these two counts , Fisher also faced allegations of bribery , filing false income taxes , and failure to pay money over to a state .
According to an article found on www.bubbaworld.com, he allegedly also failed to register a charity , failed to report charitable contributions and failed to keep appropriate records of contributions .
He unfortunately continues to visit the courtroom , despite his shady past .
Recent research discoveries have found him serving a six - month sentence .
He had pleaded no contest to accepting bribes and was serving his time in a private lock - down facility in Tulsa , Oklahoma .
As if he has not already faced enough humiliation .
The prosecutors , however , surely would not mind seeing him serve even more time behind bars .
Kevin McCarty
The last of the top three is the insurance commissioner from Florida .
Kevin McCarty had allegedly solicited campaign money from lobbyists in the industry that he regulates .
His intentions were simply to just help out a friend .
In 2007 , McCarty was “ assisting ” Robin Lotane , the wife of a man employed by the Office of Insurance Regulation .
She was running for the position of the Leon County Circuit Court Judge and McCarty was playing the role of a fundraiser sponsor .
Apparently , McCarty was urging lobbyists to attend an evening fundraiser that was held to support Lotane .
This upset Florida Cabinet members , since McCarty was obviously using his position as a way to garner support for a friend .
As a result , Lotane was suspended with pay from her position as chief assistant state attorney .
Her husband had resigned .
Lotane ’s husband was working on his wife ’s campaign invitation during work hours and McCarty ’s involvement was purely inappropriate .
Lotane had stated that the campaign invitation was “ never sent to anyone on a state computer , but it was still a terrible error in judgment for which I sincerely apologize to the commissioner , to all my superiors and to the people of Florida , ” Lotane wrote .
“ That is why I resigned my position this morning . ” McCarty on the other hand , is still in the office .
Theodoros Iliopoulos is free after 49 days of hunger strike .
He was arrested in December and detained with fabricated molotov - throwing charges .
His innocence was defended by witnesses , but the only witness reports considered by the “ justice ” authorities were those of two police officers .
He went on hunger strike on 10 July and for more than a month the authorities refused to provide him with proper medical support at a public hospital and instead kept him in the under - funded and under - equipped prison ’s medical room .
He was hospitalized into Sotiria Hospital only a few days ago .
Anarchist comrades in Greece and abroad quickly mobilized in solidarity , and later leftist and communist political parties also made announcements in his support .
The voices demanding his release were becoming more and more , and as his case was being picked up by progressive media the government could n’t ignore the protests anymore and set him free at last .
Free , but with a few conditions : he is n’t allowed to disembark from the country and every bi-weekly period he should report to the local police station .
He was set free without the need for bail payment .
Comrades in Greece had planned a solidarity march , which will go on as planned .
It should be made clear that Theodoros Iliopoulos won thanks to his determination and to the Greek and international solidarity movement in his support .
Meanwhile , in Naxos , a small island in Greece , immigrants went on hunger strike today to protest about the denial of their human rights .
The social war continues …
Thanks to everyone in Greece and elsewhere who supported Theodoros Iliopoulos .
Solidarity is our weapon !

Beijing
THE riots in the Xinjiang region , the home of China ’s Muslim Uighur minority , will affirm to many analysts outside the country that social unrest is a direct threat to the continued rule of the Communist Party .
If officials do n’t take a long , hard look at how to avoid such uprisings , this argument will run , the government could eventually fall .
If only Chinese officials saw things that way .
But even after at least 156 people have been reported dead in the city of Urumqi , many officials here see the recent violence  with Uighur rioters torching businesses owned by Han Chinese , China ’s ethnic majority  as simple ingratitude .
A front - page editorial in the state - run People ’s Daily described the protests as criminal actions by rioters , not as the manifestation of complaints of citizens angered by discriminatory policies .
That view is already popular here in the capital .
Few are surprised by the violence meted out by the state , and more than a few applaud it .
A merchant in east Beijing expressed allegiance with his fellow Han entrepreneurs and , referring to the large outlays of aid to Xinjiang , asked of the Uighurs , “ Where is their thanks for all the money we provide them ? ”
Both nationalistic fervor and the fear that instability might reverse the hard - won individual gains of economic reform combine to create more support for the government ’s hard - line approach .
Less discussed are the Uighurs ’ real grievances : Beijing ’s tight control over the practice of Islam ; Han Chinese who migrate to Xinjiang and take the better jobs there ; and the fact that ethnic minorities lack regular access to the government bureaucracy , where business in China is largely done .
Stop at a traffic light in Delhi or Bombay ( Mumbai ) , and magazine hawkers descend , pressing against your car window a fan of Bollywood gossip rags , newsweeklies , and ... the IKEA catalog ?
India , like most of Asia , has no IKEA outlet .
The Swedish superstore , known for its inexpensive yet stylish home furnishings , has swept across Europe and North America - but not here .
Indians who buy the catalogs are n't interested in mail order .
Instead , they do what middle - class Indians have always done - have local carpenters make the furniture .
" Whenever we think of doing something for the house , one of the things we always hope we can get our hands on are a few IKEA catalogs , " says Arundhati Ray , a consultant who works with nongovernmental organizations in Calcutta .
" It 's shameless pirating , " Ms. Ray adds , showing off an elegant wrought - iron chandelier she commissioned from a local artisan , based on an IKEA picture .
Ray also had dining - room chairs and a CD rack copied , though the rack now holds various spices and masalas .
Locally made knockoffs of IKEA pieces are ubiquitous in the homes of professionals in India 's rapidly modernizing big cities .
Educated and westernized , many of them prefer IKEA 's minimalist Scandinavian style to homespun Indian handiwork or the clunky British colonial pieces they grew up with .
" It 's the need to break away from the traditional , " says Gita Rana , owner of a high - end home accessories company based in Bangalore .
" IKEA furniture represents modern design .
It 's easy to maintain ....
It 's the look , the lightness .
You can move it around . "
Getting furniture made from scratch is nothing new in India , where labor is cheap and mass - produced products are often low quality .
But the changing aesthetic reflects changes in the lifestyles of middle - class Indians over the past decade .
International companies opening offices and call centers in India , combined with astronomical growth in the information - technology industry , have created a lucrative urban job market for a tech - savvy generation .
Instead of living at home with parents until marriage , many young Indians are moving into their own apartments , postponing marriage , and even cohabiting .
Real estate is booming and city living is getting more expensive , so many find themselves squeezed into tight quarters with a need for modern , space - saving furniture .
" I like the big colonial furniture fine in big houses , but I do n't like them in modern houses , " says Tripti Bose , a retired psychologist who divides her time between Washington , D.C. , and India .
" If something 's so ornate and heavy , it better go in a palace . "
When Ms. Bose built her Indian house 10 years ago , she cut pictures from an IKEA catalog and brought them to a carpenter , who furnished her entire two - bedroom bungalow with pieces modeled after them .
King - size beds provide extra storage with built - in drawers .
A wall - sized wardrobe has closets , shelves , shoe racks , and a dressing table .
A desk , bookshelves , tables , and other pieces of furniture were made with plywood and painted in Bose 's favorite colors - red and black .
" The design is IKEA , but this is all pure wood , " she says , referring to IKEA 's use of particle board .
The price was right - about $ 2,250 for everything .
That would be an unimaginable cost for the 80 percent of Indians who live on $ 2 a day , but it 's a fraction of what IKEA would sell all that furniture for in the West ( even with its bargain prices ) , and it 's affordable for most middle - class Indians .
For the richest Indians , IKEA has become a stylistic stepping - stone toward higher - end European design , says Vikram Phadke , co-owner of Evoluzione , a Madras store that specializes in imported furniture .
Three years ago , when Mr. Phadke opened his store , $ 500 was the most retailers in India dared charge for any piece of furniture , he says .
Now , Evoluzione has nurtured a small but growing clientele that wants the best in European design and will spend $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 on a sofa .
" In the last two years , it 's a sea change in attitude , in purchasing power , " Phadke says .
IKEA is aware of the copying , but has no plans to open stores here .
" We take copying of our products seriously , " says IKEA spokeswoman Tracey Kelly in a prepared statement .
But , she adds , " We are happy that the Indian people like IKEA design . "
Part of the reason IKEA does n't have plans to open stores in India , she says , is India 's strict licensing laws for foreign - owned companies .
IKEA , which started in a small Swedish village in 1943 , now has stores in 33 countries with nearly $ 19 billion in sales last year .
But its retail operations are confined to the world 's wealthier countries - mostly in Europe , North America , and Australia .
With its reliance on mass marketing and efficient transportation of its assembly - required products , the IKEA model probably would not work in India or other poor countries , says Abhijit Banerjee , an economics professor at MIT .
" Its prices would not be a bargain for most Indians , and those who could afford real IKEA products are too few . "
For now , Indians say they are happy to hire locals to make knockoffs - and avoid the hassle of putting furniture together .
If you buy from IKEA , Bose says , " then who 's going to assemble it for you ? "
