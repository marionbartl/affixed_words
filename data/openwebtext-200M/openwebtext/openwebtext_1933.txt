Red Hatは先週、Windowsのコアフォントであ るArial / Courier New / Times New Roman（順に、現在もっとも普及しているサンセリフ/等幅/セリフフォント）と置き換えて使用可能な、Liberation書体の3つのフリー・フォントを
リリース した。
Liberationフォントはすでにダウンロード可能になっている。Liberationフォントは、文書をフリーなオペレーティングシステムとWindowsとで共有する際に、フォントの違いが原因でユーザがやむなく文書を整形し直すことがないように、Windowsコアフォントとフォントメトリックス的に同等になる（つまり各文字の占める横幅の長さが、対応するWindowsのフォントと等しい）ように設計されている。
Red Hatはかなり以前より、オペレーティングシステム間での相互運用性を実現するための高品質なフォントに関心を寄せていた。Red Hat次席法務顧問兼秘書役 のMark Webbink氏によると、1990年代後期のRed HatディストリビューションにはArial / Courier New / Times Roman書体が含まれていたが、Microsoft社の著作権の侵害にあたるとしてサードパーティに訴えられたのだという。そしてその後、その争議については示談が成立し、2004年にRed HatはWindowsコアフォントとフォントメトリックス的に同等なAgfa Monotype社のプロプライエタリなフォントであるAlbany/Cumberland/Thorndale（各フォント名の頭文字は、それぞれが置き換える各Windowsコアフォントの頭文字に対応している）という3種類のフォントのライセンスの取得を発表した。これらのフォントはRed Hatの商用パッケージのExtras CDに含められて配布されたが、Webbink氏によると「フリーでもオープンでもなく、Red Hatにとって歯がゆい思いがするものだった」という。
デザイナ ー
Albany / Cumberland / Thorndaleのリリースの後 、Agfa Monotype社 でRed Hatとの一件を担当していた何人かのデザイナーと経営者が独立し、Ascender社というフォントデザイン会社を設立した。Ascender社のスタッフには大手企業向けにフォントの設計を行なってきた長年の経験があり、Microsoftコアフォントの他にも、Microsoftのオンライン向けフォントとして最も有名なVerdanaフォントや、Courier
Newとフォントメトリックス的に同等になるよう設計されたAndale Monoプロジェクトといった作品がある。
Red HatはAscender社のスタッフとともに働いた経験があったため、Times Romanとフォントメトリックス的に同等になるように設計されたLinux Libertineのような既存のフリーフォントを利用するのではなく、再びAscenderチームと一緒にフリーな代替フォントを設計することにした。Red Hatは作業の開始前にLiberationフォントのための技術的な仕様は指示したものの、それ以外の細部の多くはAscender社のスタッフに委ねたという。
Webbink氏によると 「 メトリックス的な観点から問題がなければ、Ascenderチームにデザイン的な観点での自由を与えてしまっても大丈夫だと考えた」とのことだ。
Ascender社副社長 のSteve Kuhlman氏によると、同社はそれ以前にはフリーなフォントを扱った経験はなかったという。またKuhlman氏によるとAscender社はLiberationフォントについても、デザイン的な観点を第一として取り組んだとのことだ。そしてKuhlman氏が「Ascender社をまさに代表するデザイナー」と呼ぶSteve Matteson氏が同フォントの制作に昨年着手した。さらにKuhlman氏は、LiberationフォントはWindowsコアフォントと同じ幅になるよう設計されてはいるものの「完全な類似品ではなく、デザイン的にははっきりした違いがある」とも述べた。
Webbink 氏 はLiberationフォントの制作に必要となった経費について正確な数字は明らかにしなかったが、「膨大な費用がかかった……が、正直に言ってRed Hatは得られた結果にかなり満足している。Liberationフォントは非常に魅力的なフォント集だと思う」と述べた。
フォントの現 状
Liberationフォントにはバージョン番号は付いていないが、Webbink氏によると同フォントの制作はまだ完了したわけではないという。とりわけ、フォントのヒンティングが8ポイントから40ポイントまでのサイズについてしか行なわれていないということがある。つまり8ポイントよりも小さいサイズや40ポイントを越える大きなサイズのLiberationフォントでは、読みやすさ、間隔の取り具合い、色、字体の一貫性などに関して問題がある可能性がある。しかしWebbink氏は「今年の末までには」フォントのヒンティングが完了するはずだとしている。

また別の現時点での問題点として、Liberationフォントには西ヨーロッパ、中央ヨーロッパ、東ヨーロッパの各言語の文字（ラテン文字、ギリシャ文字、キリル文字）しか含まれていないということがある。Webbink氏によるとRed Hatは、フリーのフォントのサポートが今なお貧弱であるインド諸言語、日本語、中国語の文字にも後々は対応したいと考えているとのことだ。
このような問題点があるとは言え、LiberationフォントにはWindowsコアフォントにまさる点として、単一のデザイン会社による作品であるという利点がある。Liberationフォントのセリフ/サンセリフ/等幅の各書体はそれぞれ異なるものだが、別のデザイン会社によってそれぞれが独立して設計されたArial/Courier
New / Times New Romanの文字と見比べてみると、文字がより似通っていることが見本を見てもらえば分かるだろう。このような統一感があるため、一つの文書内で3つの書体が併用されたときにLiberationフォントではより美しい印象を与えることができるはずだ。また少なくとも最初の時点では、あまりにもあちこちで頻繁に使われているArial/Courier
New / Times New Romanの組合わせと比較して、より目新しさがあるという利点もあるだろう。
Liberationフォントに対するユーザからの反応についてWebbink氏は「非常に好意的」と表現した。また「 Windowsユーザからもダウンロードしたいという要望が多数届いている」とも付け加えた。しかしその一方で印刷コミュニティの一部からは、完全なヒンティングが行なわれていないことについての期待外れの声もあるようだ。
おそらくもっとも否定的な反応は、情報アーキテクトのDan Klyn氏によるものだろう。Klyn氏は「ArialとVerdanaとの間に子供が生まれたら？
Liberationという名前の非常に醜い子供になるだろう」と述べている。なお同氏が投稿している見本から推測すると、Klyn氏が不満である主な点は「グリフが角張り過ぎている」ということのようだ。
今後の計 画
今後Ascender社 がLiberationフォントのヒンティングを完了させたりサポート言語を増やしたりする間、Red Hatでは同フォントの普及に取り組むという。例えばWebbink氏によると「是非OpenOffice.orgで使用可能になっているのを見てみたい」とのことだ。また、ここ2、3年の間に登場したオープンフォントコミュニティ（翻訳記事）によって基本デザインが拡張されることになれば、さらに普及する可能性もあるかもしれない。
Liberationフォントは現在、いくつかの例外規定をともなうLGPL（GNU劣等一般公衆利用許諾契約書）でリリースされている。一つめの例外規定は、Liberationフォントを使用して作成した文書をLiberationフォントと同じ利用条件下に置く義務は特にないとするものだ。この例外規定が明記される必要があるのは、フォントの場合、ソフトウェアの一部にフォントが埋め込まれて使用されるためと、PDFなどフォントが文書内に埋め込まれる文書形式が存在するためという2つの理由からだ。またそれ以外には、改変したフォントに対してRed Hatの商標（「 Liberation」という名称）を使用することを禁じる条項、無保証や責任の制限を明記する条項、法的な争議が起こった場合にはRed Hatの所在地である米ノースカロライナ州の司法によることとするという条項などが定められている。
Webbink氏によるとこのようなライセンスが採用された理由は、Ascender社が組み込みデバイスやプリンタメーカに対するフォントデザインの販売権の保持を希望したことと、そのためデュアルライセンスにするならばLGPLがオーソドックスな選択肢であるためだという。なお、オープンなフォントのデザイナーたちの間で最近ますます普及しつつあるOpen Font Licenseを採用しなかった理由を尋ねたところWebbink氏は、Open Font Licenseが現時点ではまだOSI認定ライセンスではないことが主な理由だと説明した。Webbink氏によるとOpen Font LicenseがOSIに認定されれば、「 Ascender社 とRed Hatとの契約上、問題がなければ」LiberationフォントがOpen Font Licenseへ移行する可能性もあるとのことだ。
コミュニティにフォントを寄与するということは資金的な問題だけでは済まず、Red Hatが今後も解決にいくらか時間のかかる細かい多くの問題に対処していかなければならないことは明らかだ。Webbink氏は「 Red Hatはこのことを継続的な取り組みだと考えている」としている。

I ’ve visited the question of the butterfly dream before on this blog .
It ’s relevance to lucid dreaming has until now been largely left as an exercise for the reader .
Today we ’re going to revisit it briefly because there is another important aspect to the question posed by Chuang Tzu :
Reality .
Paraphrased , the question put by the Chinese philosopher is this : “ If I dream that I am a butterfly , how can I be sure which “ me ” ( man or butterfly ) exists in reality , and which one is merely a dream ? ”
Without delving too deeply into the question of what “ reality ” actually is , let ’s take a look at the central theme as it relates to you learning how to lucid dream .
Consciousness
Learning how to lucid dream often introduces people to dream journaling and reality checks .
I ’ve spoken about this before .
The point is simply this , although it may take a while to sink in :
Whether you ’re the man or the butterfly , your reality is whatever you ’re paying attention to .
The reason people fail to have a lucid dream despite their best efforts probably has something to do with what they pay attention to most of the time .
Think about it .
Right now are you really paying attention or are you just skimming over the text on this page .
Did you even make it this far ?
Does your mind jump from one thing to the next ?
Discipline
Most people unfortunately lack the mental discipline to make lucid dreaming work for them .
Unless you can direct your consciousness to pay attention it wo n’t matter if you ’re a man or a butterfly .
You ’ll be so caught up in your internal dialogue and following your mind as it wanders that you ’ll miss the lucid dreaming forest for the metaphorical trees .

Breaking away from standard building design , this apartment complex — located in Amsterdam — looks to be straight from a Sci -Fi flick .

The 700 - year - old red light district is a big tourist attraction
The city has reached a 25 m euro ( £ 18 m ) deal to buy 18 buildings and turn them into shops or housing .
The mayor of Amsterdam , Job Cohen , said that although prostitution was legal in the Netherlands , there was too much of the sex trade in the city centre .
He also said that the trade involved exploitation and trafficking of women , and other kinds of criminal activity .
Dirty money
Prostitutes in Amsterdam 's red light district ply their trade in neon - lit street windows and the area 's seediness has always been part of its attraction for tourists .
Under the deal , 51 of these windows - a third of the total - will be sold .
The Wallen , as the area is known in Dutch , is in one of the oldest and most picturesque areas of Amsterdam .
But the city 's authorities say the windows are a magnet for crime and money laundering .
Mr Cohen said the move was not intended to get rid of prostitution entirely , since it is part of the area 's history .
" What we do want is to get rid of the underlying criminality , " he said .
We believe that less windows means more exploitation of women
Metje Blaak
De Rode Draad
However , the plan was criticised by the Dutch sex workers ' union De Rode Draad .
" We believe that less windows means more exploitation of women , " spokeswoman Metje Blaak told Agence France - Presse news agency .
" If the windows close down , women who are being exploited will be hidden somewhere else where union representatives and health workers can't make contact with them , " she said .
Prostitutes hire the windows for around 100 euros ( £ 70 , $ 141 ) for part of the day .
One window is usually used by several prostitutes a day .
The tiny kangaroo rat , a native of the southwestern deserts of the United States , never takes a drink of water in its lifetime .
What little moisture this tiny rodent needs it gets from eating roots and desert plants .
Yet this is enough to keep the kangaroo rat alive .
The kangaroo rat got its name from the fact that it has the same long , powerful legs and the same strong tail as its Australian namesake .
It moves about by leaping , but with such accuracy that it can jump over a cactus and land on top of a grasshopper .
When two kangaroo rats fight , they look like tiny mice on pogo sticks !
If you 're as huge fan of reddit as I am , then you 'll have noticed that many titles have " ( Pic ) " , " [ Picture ] " , or " ( Video ) " after them .
It means that the content the link points to has a picture or a video in it .
Sometimes I just want to quickly browse through all the pics or vids but unfortunately reddit 's search is broken and there is really no good way to see the best pics and videos on reddit .
I decided to solve this problem and create Reddit Media website , which monitors reddit 's front page , collects picture and video links , and builds an archive of them over time .
In fact I just launched it at redditmedia.com .
I developer this website very quickly and dirty by just throwing code together .
I did n't worrying about code quality or what others will think about the code .
I like to get things done rather than making my code perfect .
You can't beat running code .
I will release full source code of website with all the programs that generating the site .
Also I will blog how the tools work and what ideas I used .
Update : Done !
The site is up at reddit media : intelligent fun online .
Reddit Media Website 's Technical Design Sketch
I use DreamHost shared hosting to run this website .
Overall it is great hosting company and I have been with them for more than a year now .
The best part is that you get shell access .
Unfortunately a downsite is that as it's shared hosting , sometimes the server gets overloaded and serving of dynamic pages can become slow .
I want the new website to be as fast as possible even when the server is loaded .
I do not want any dynamic parsing to be involved when loading the website .
Because of this I will go with generating static HTML pages for the content .
A Perl script will run every 30 mins from crontab , get reddit.com website , extract titles and URLs .
Another script will then add the titles to the lightweight sqlite on - disk database in case I ever want to make the website dynamic .
And the third script will use the entries in the database and generate HTML pages .
Technical Design
An experienced user might ask if this design does not have a race - condition – what happens at the moment when the new static page is generated and user loads the same page .
Is n't there a race condition ?
The answer is no .
I 've thought about it and the way static pages will be updates is they will first be written to temporary files , then moved in place of the existing ones .
The website runs on Linux operating system and by looking up `man 2 rename ' you 'll find that :
If newpath already exists it will be atomically replaced ( subject to a few conditions - see ERRORS below ) , so that there is no point at which another process attempting to access ( 2,5 ) newpath will find it missing .
TLDR : rename system call is atomic , which means we have no trouble with race conditions .
Reddit provides RSS feed to the front page news .
It has 25 latest news and maybe 5 of them are media links .
That is not enough links to launch the website .
People visiting the site will get bored with just 5 links and only 10 new added daily .
I need more content to launch the site .
I could wait and launch the site later when articles have piled up but I do not want to wait and I want to launch it ASAP !
Here 's what I 'm gonna do .
First , I 'll create a script that will go through all the pages on reddit looking for picture and video links , and insert the found items in the database .
It will match patterns in link titles and domains which contain only media ( such as flickr or xkcd ) .
Here is the list of patterns I came up with that describe pictures and videos :
picture
pic
image
photo
comic
chart
video
vid
clip
film
movie
And here are the domains that exclusively contain media :
youtube.com
video.google.com
liveleak.com
break.com
metacafe.com
brightcove.com
dailymotion.com
flicklife.com
flurl.com
gofish.com
ifilm.com
livevideo.com
video.yahoo.com
photobucket.com
flickr.com
xkcd.com
To write this script I 'll use LWP :: UserAgent to get HTML contents and HTML :: TreeBuilder to extract titles and links .
This script will output the found items in a human readable format , ready for input to another script , which will absorb this information and put it in the SQLite database .
A true Unix hacker 's approach !
This script is called reddit_extractor.pl .
It takes one optional argument which is number of reddit pages to extract links from .
If no argument is specified , it goes through all reddit pages until it hits the last one .
For example , specifying 1 as the first argument makes it parse just the front page .
I can now run this script periodically to find links on the front page .
No need for additionally parsing RSS .
There is one constant in this script which can be changed .
This constant , VOTE_THRESHOLD , sets the threshold of how many votes a post should have received to be collected by the program .
I had to add it because when digging ( heh ) through older reddit 's posts there are a lot of links with 1 or 2 votes , which means it really was n't that good .
The script outputs each media post matching a pattern or domain in the following format :
title ( type , user , reddit id , url )
title is the title of the article
is the title of the article type is the media type .
It can be one of ' video ' , ' videos ' , ' picture ' , ' pictures ' .
It 's plural if the title contains " pics " or " videos " ( plural ) form of media .
is the media type .
It can be one of ' video ' , ' videos ' , ' picture ' , ' pictures ' .
It 's plural if the title contains " pics " or " videos " ( plural ) form of media .
user is the reddit user who posted the link
is the reddit user who posted the link reddit id is the unique identifier reddit uses to identify its links
is the unique identifier reddit uses to identify its links url is the url to the media
Script ' reddit_extractor.pl ' can be downloaded here :
catonmat.net/ftp/reddit_extractor.perl
Then I will create a script that takes this input and puts it into SQLite database .
It is so trivial that there is nothing much to write about it .
This script will also be written in Perl programming langauge and will use just DBI and DBD ::SQLite modules for accessing the SQLite database .
The script will create an empty database on the first invocation , read the data from stdin and insert the data in the database .
The database design is dead simple .
It contains just two tables :
reddit which stores the links found on reddit , and
which stores the links found on reddit , and reddit_status which contains some info about how the page generator script used the reddit table
Going into more details , reddit table contains the following colums :
id - the primary key of the table
- the primary key of the table title - title of the media link found on reddit
- title of the media link found on reddit url - url to the media
- url to the media reddit_id - id reddit uses to identify it 's posts ( used by my scripts to link to comments )
- id reddit uses to identify it 's posts ( used by my scripts to link to comments ) user - username of the person who posted the link on reddit
- username of the person who posted the link on reddit type - type of the media , can be : ' video ' , ' videos ' , ' picture ' , ' pictures ' .
It 's plural if the title contains " pics " or " videos " ( plural ) form of media .
- type of the media , can be : ' video ' , ' videos ' , ' picture ' , ' pictures ' .
It 's plural if the title contains " pics " or " videos " ( plural ) form of media .
date_added - the date the entry was added to the database
The other table , reddit_status contains just two colums :
last_id - the last id in the reddit table which the generator script used for generating the site
- the last id in the table which the generator script used for generating the site last_run - date the of last successful run of the generator script
This script is called ' db_inserter.pl ' .
It does not take any arguments but has one constant which has to be changed before using .
This constant , DATABASE_PATH , defined the path to SQLite database .
As I mentioned , it is allowed for the database not to exist , this script will create one on the first invocation .
These two scripts used together can now be periodically run from crontab to monitor the reddit 's front page and insert the links in the database .
It can be done with as simple command as :
reddit_extractor.pl 1 | db_inserter.pl
Script ' db_inserter.pl ' can be downloaded here :
catonmat.net/ftp/db_inserter.perl
Now that we have our data , we just need to display it in a nice way .
That 's the job of generator script .
The generator script will be run after the previous two scripts have been run together and it will use information in the database to build static HTML pages .
Since generating static pages is computationally expensive , the generator has to be smart enough to minimize regeneration of already generated pages .
I commented the algorithm ( pretty simple algorithm ) that minimizes regeneration script carefully , you can take a look at ' generate_pages ' function in the source .
The script generates three kinds of pages at the moment - pages containing all pictures and videos , pages containing just pictures and pages containing just videos .
There is a lot of media featured on reddit and as the script keeps things cached , the directory sizes can grow pretty quickly .
If a file system which performs badly with thousands of files in a single directory is used , the runtime of the script can degrade .
To avoid this , the generator stores cached reddit posts in subdirectories based on the first char of their file name .
For example , if a filename of a cached file is ' foo. bar ' , then it stores the file in /f / foo. bar directory .
The other thing this script does is locate thumbnail images for media .
For example , for YouTube videos , it would construct URL to their static thumbnails .
For Google Video
I could not find a public service for easily getting the thumbnail .
The only way I found to get a thumbnail of Google Video is to get the contents of the actual video page and extract it from there .
The same applies to many other video sites which do not tell developers how to get the thumbnail of the video .
Because of this I had to write a Perl module ' ThumbExtractor. pm ' , which given a link to a video or picture , extracts the thumbnail .
' ThumbExtractor. pm ' module can be viewed here :
< a href = " https://catonmat.net/ftp/ThumbExtractor.pm " title= " thumbnail extractor ( perl module , reddit media generator ) >catonmat.net/ftp/ThumbExtractor.pm
Some of the links on reddit contain the link to actual image .
I would n't want the reddit media site to take long to load , that 's why I set out to seek a solution for caching small thumbnails on the server the website is generated .
I had to write another module ' ThumbMaker. pm ' which goes and downloads the image , makes a thumbnail image of it and saves to a known path accessible from web server .
' ThumbMaker. pm ' module can be viewed here :
thumbnail maker ( perl module , reddit media generator )
To manipulate the images ( create thumbnails ) , the ThumbMaker package uses Netpbm open source software .
Netpbm is a toolkit for manipulation of graphic images , including conversion of images between a variety of different formats .
There are over 300 separate tools in the package including converters for about 100 graphics formats .
Examples of the sort of image manipulation we 're talking about are : Shrinking an image by 10 % ; Cutting the top half off of an image ; Making a mirror image ; Creating a sequence of images that fade from one image to another .
You will need this software ( either compile yourself , or get the precompiled packages ) if you want to run the the reddit media website generator scripts .
To use the most common image operations easily , I wrote a package ' Netpbm.pl ' , which provides operations like resize , cut , add border and others .
' Netpbm.pm ' package can be viewed here :
netpbm image manipulation ( perl module , reddit media generator )
I hit an interesting problem while developing the ThumbExtractor.pm and ThumbMaker .pm packages - what should they do if the link is to a regular website with just images ?
There is no simple way to download the right image which the website wanted to show to users .
I thought for a moment and came up with an interesting but simple algorithm which finds " the best " image on the site .
It retrieve ALL the images from the site and find the one with biggest dimensions and make a thumbnail out of it .
It is pretty obvious , pictures posted on reddit are big and nice , so the biggest picture on the site must be the one that was meant to be shown .
A more advanced algorithm would analyze it's location on the page and add weigh to the score of how good the image is , depending on where it is located .
The more in the center of the screen , the higher score .
For this reason I developed yet another Perl module called ' ImageFinder.pm ' .
See the ' find_best_image ' subroutine to see how it works .
' ImageFinder. pm ' module can be viewed here :
best image finder ( perl module , reddit media generator )
The generator script also uses CPAN's Template : : Toolkit package for generating HTML pages from templates .
The name of the generator script is ' page_gen.pl ' .
It takes one optional argument ' regenerate ' which if specified clears the cache and regenerates all the pages anew .
It is useful when templates are updated or changes are made to thumbnail generator .
Program ' page_gen.pl ' can be viewed here :
reddit media page generator ( perl script )
While developing software I like to take a lot of notes and solve problems that come up on paper .
For example , while working on this site , I had to solve a problem how to regenerate existing pages minimally and how to resize thumbnails so they looked nice .
Here is how many tiny notes I tool while working on this site :
( sorry for the quality again , i took the picture with camera phone with two shots and stitched it together with image editor )

What is reddit ?
Reddit is a social news website where users decide its contents .
From their faq :
A source for what 's new and popular on the web -- personalized for you .
We want to democratize the traditional model by giving editorial control to the people who use the site , not those who run it .
Your votes train a filter , so let reddit know what you liked and disliked , because you 'll begin to be recommended links filtered to your tastes .
All of the content on reddit is from users who are rewarded for good submissions ( and punished for bad ones ) by their peers ; you decide what appears on your front page and which submissions rise to fame or fall into obscurity .
Have fun with Reddit Media and see you next time !
A biomedical engineer at Purdue University has developed a new method to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation that promises to be more effective than standard CPR because it increases nourishing blood flow through the heart by 25 percent over the current method .
A new technique is desperately needed because conventional CPR has a success rate of 5 percent to 10 percent , depending on how fast rescuers are able to respond and how well the procedure is performed .
For every one minute of delay , the resuscitation rate decreases by 10 percent .
In other words , at 10 minutes , the resuscitation is absolutely ineffective , " said Leslie Geddes , Showalter Distinguished Professor Emeritus in Purdue 's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering .
" Any medical procedure that had that low a success rate would be abandoned right away .
But the alternative is not very good , either : Do n't do CPR and the person is going to die . "
Geddes has developed the first new CPR alternative , called " only rhythmic abdominal compression , " or OAC - CPR , which works by pushing on the abdomen instead of the chest .
There are major problems with standard CPR , " Geddes said .
" One is the risk of breaking ribs if you push too hard , but if you do n't push hard you wo n't save the person .
Another problem is the risk of transferring infection with mouth - to - mouth breathing . "
The new CPR method eliminates both risks , Geddes said .
advertisement
Findings will be detailed in a research paper appearing this month in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine , published by Elsevier Inc .
The paper was authored by Geddes and his Purdue colleagues Ann E. Rundell , assistant professor of biomedical engineering , biomedical engineering doctoral student Aaron Lottes , and basic medical sciences graduate students Andre Kemeny and Michael Otlewski .
In standard chest - compression CPR , which has been in practice since the 1960s , the rescuer pushes on the chest and blows into the subject 's mouth twice for every 30 chest compressions .
However , the risk of infection is so grave that many doctors and nurses often refuse to administer mouth - to - mouth resuscitation .
In one 1993 study of 433 doctors and 152 nurses , 45 percent of doctors and 80 percent of nurses said they would refuse to administer mouth - to - mouth resuscitation on a stranger .
This is the real world that nobody knows about , and it's a sobering thought , " Geddes said .
OAC -CPR eliminates the need to perform mouth - to - mouth resuscitation .
The American Heart Association requires that rescuers administering CPR push with enough force to depress the chest 1 and a half to 2 inches at a rate of 100 times per minute .
advertisement
" To depress the chest 1.5 to 2 inches takes 100 to 125 pounds of force , " Geddes said .
" So you have to push pretty hard and pretty fast , and two people are needed to perform it properly .
One blows up the lungs and the other compresses the chest .
And when the one who 's compressing the chest gets tired , they change positions . "
OAC -CPR requires only one rescuer .
Instead of two breaths for every 30 chest compressions , the new procedure provides a breath for every abdominal compression because pushing on the abdomen depresses the diaphragm toward the head , expelling air from the lungs .
The release of force causes inhalation .
Researchers have known since the 1980s that pushing on the abdomen circulates blood through the heart .
The idea was originated by Purdue nursing doctoral student Sandra Ralston , Geddes said .
She made the remarkable observation that if you pushed on the abdomen after each chest compression you could double the CPR blood flow , " he said .
" So I started thinking , what would happen if you just pushed on the abdomen and eliminated chest compression entirely ? "
The procedure provides a new way to effectively perform " coronary perfusion , " or pumping blood through the heart muscle , which is critical for successful resuscitation because the heart muscle is nourished by oxygenated blood , Geddes said .
Unfortunately , in standard chest - compression CPR , blood sometimes flows in the wrong direction , which means the coronary blood flow goes backward , bringing de-oxygenated blood back into the heart muscle , " Geddes said .
" This retrograde flow reduces the likelihood of resuscitation . "
Findings showed that OAC - CPR eliminates this backward flow .
The Purdue researchers compared coronary artery blood flow during standard chest - compression CPR with the flow resulting from only abdominal compression CPR .
Findings showed that using the new method and pushing with the same force recommended for standard CPR provided 25 percent more blood flow through the heart muscle without retrograde flow in the coronary arteries .
The researchers followed the standard recommended by the American Heart Association , pushing with 100 pounds of pressure 100 times per minute .
With OAC - CPR , you really do n't have to press as hard or as often , but we followed the American Heart Association standard to avoid possible criticism from people who could have said we did n't observe the standard , " Geddes said .
Another benefit of OAC - CPR is that it eliminates rib fractures , which are commonly caused by compressing the chest .
Rib fractures cause the chest to recoil more slowly , but effective CPR requires that rescuers wait until the chest recoils fully before compressing .
Geddes created a wooden " pressure applicator " that resembles a scaled - down version of a baseball home plate .
It is contoured so that it can be used to compress the abdomen without pushing on the ribs .
However , a rescuer could push with the hands to perform the procedure if no applicator were available .
Abdominal organs contain about 25 percent of the total blood volume in the body .
You can squeeze all of that into the central circulation when you press on the abdomen , " Geddes said .
Whether the procedure gains widespread acceptance depends on whether other researchers can duplicate the results .
In research , you publish data and then the scientific community looks at the data and tries to duplicate it to verify that it works , " said Geddes .
The research was funded by the Purdue Trask Fund .
The Patrick administration forcefully urged lawmakers yesterday to withdraw more than $ 100 million in state pension fund investments from foreign companies doing business in genocide - ravaged Sudan , setting the stage for the state 's first major attempt to exert financial pressure on a foreign government since it pulled funds from apartheid - era South Africa more than two decades ago .

Idea of Giuliani victory results in third party challenger threat Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 30 , 2007 Print This Email This With former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani leading in many national polls for the Republican Party nomination in 2008 , some conservative groups are looking for ways to defeat him .
One conservative activist has even threatened a religion - focused third party challenger if he wins the nomination next year , according to a blog post at the Christian Broadcasting Network .
" From the moment Giuliani is nominated -- if they are stupid enough to do it next February -- a third party will be started emphasizing pro-family issues and conservative economic and foreign policies , and probably within a decade or two that 3rd party will be the dominant party along with the pro-abortion and left - wing Democrat Party , " according to an e-mail written by an anonymous , prominent conservative activist .
Excerpts of the e-mail were posted by David Brody , CBN News 's Senior National Correspondent .
At a weekly luncheon hosted at the conservative Free Congress Foundation , Brody also noted that a group called Conservatives For Peace was handing around a leaflet warning against a Giuliani nomination .
" If the Republican Party nominates Rudy Giuliani as its candidate for either president or vice president , I will personally work to defeat the GOP ticket in 2008 , " the flyer reads .
" If the Republican Party nominates him , it is saying to the American people that it has lost all purpose except the raw political desire to hold power .
It will be time to put the GOP out of its misery . "
Brody puts these warnings in perspective , but still suggests they are notable .
" Look , this group isnt a Focus on the Family or a Family Research Council but it gives you a sense of how some are already plotting to destroy Giuliani , " he writes .
Giuliani's campaign did not reply to RAW STORY at press time .
Recent polls from Rasmussen and Zogby show Giuliani leading nationally in the Republican race for the 2008 nomination .
However , a collection of polls by the New York Sun 's Latest Politics shows that the New York Republican 's lead is less commanding than it was earlier in the year .
And some polls for early important primary states show Giuliani falling behind some of his competitors .
Poll numbers posted at Election Central from American Research Group , Strategic Vision , and the Des Moines Register all show Giuliani behind either Arizona Senator John McCain or former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney .
Giuliani's support among Republicans may be softening as his stances on social issues become better known to many in the party 's base .
" If we dont find a way of uniting around broad principles that will appeal to a large segment of this country , if we cant figure that out , we are going to lose this election , " he warned in a May 11 commencement speech at Houston Baptist University , which came after his positions on abortion and other issues were teased out in the first Republican primary debate .

Although New York State considers the apartment to be rent - controlled , Mr. Kirschenbaum said he was not sure it qualified for that status , because it was the only residential unit in a commercial building .
He added that the couple 's lease , originally drafted 60 years ago , requires them to make repairs to the apartment .
Maddy Tarnofsky , the couple 's lawyer , disagreed .
" There is an ancient lease that does provide for the tenant to make certain repairs , but not structural repairs , " she said , adding that she did not believe the provision would be enforceable in any event .
Ms. Tarnofsky contends that the rent sounds better than it is .
" If you add in the amount they have spent over the years to keep the boiler running , and to do the types of repairs that are the responsibility of the landlord , it has actually been a very expensive apartment , " she said .
The couple is now suing Mr. Kirschenbaum to force him to make further repairs to the apartment .
If the geopolitical situation were different , the prince and princess , who married in 1991 , would have servants to handle such matters .
Twelve years ago , Osman became the oldest male member of his family -- and thus the 45th head of the dynasty founded by Osman I in 1299 .
He is the last living grandson of any Ottoman emperor ( his grandfather , Abdul Hamid II , ruled from 1876 to 1909 ) .
After him , Zeynep said , " the tradition of the family will disappear because the rest of the members were born abroad . "
Their annual visits to Turkey are front - page news there .
Turkey is seeking admission to the European Union , hat in hand , a process that some Turks find humiliating .
By contrast , Osman symbolizes a time when the Ottomans exercised vast power .
He also represents a moderate approach to Islam .
" If the caliphate were restored , " Zeynep said , referring to the sultan 's traditional role as the leader of Sunni Muslims , " the world would be a better place . "
Born in 1912 , Osman was sent to school in Vienna as a child .
In 1924 , the royal family was expelled by Kemal Ataturk , the founder of the Turkish Republic .
" The men had one day to leave , " he said .
" The women were given a week . "
It ’s not widely known , but the first bootleg recording was made by Thomas Edison back in 1902 .
Edison snuck one of his wax cylinder recorders into a parade where he briefly recorded John Philip Sousa ’s band as they passed by .
Edison was a huge fan of Sousa and was eager to use his invention to relive the performance in the comfort of his own home .
Sousa , on the other hand , hated Edison ’s invention and refused to be recorded .
Edison knew that his clandestine recording was the only hope he had of ever enjoying Sousa ’s music privately .
Music fans have been recording and trading live performances of their favorite artists ever since .
Edison ’s recording is what we commonly call a bootleg .
Bootlegs have been a rite of passage for music lovers throughout the rock era .
You discover a band , become obsessed with their music , buy everything you can get your hands on , then move on to unreleased live recordings .
A recording of Bob Dylan and The Band released under the name Great White Wonder is said to be the first bootleg of the rock era .
The release started what eventually became a thriving industry of bootlegged live recordings .
The history of the bootleg industry is documented by Clinton Heylin in Bootleg : The Rise And Fall Of The Secret Recording Industry .
So , did this parallel recording industry damage the legitimate recording industry ?
Probably not .
Bootlegs are for hardcore fans .
Because of their price , quality , and limited availability , the casual music fan was never likely to accidentally buy a bootleg thinking it was the latest release .
Fans who bought bootlegs did so because they already owned everything they could possibly purchase by their favorite artists .
The distribution of bootlegs has changed over the years .
What started as the illicit sale of unauthorized vinyl LPs eventually morphed into the trading of tapes , CDRs , and now digital music files .
In the process the profit motive has been lost and black market profiteers have been replaced by a network of fans anxious to share their favorite shows with their peers .
As a result , the dark side of bootlegging ( the fact that someone else is profiting from your favorite artists music ) has largely been diminished .
Trading of live recordings is now an act of pure joy that can be practiced among fans without contributing to a black market economy that artists do n’t profit from .
These live recordings fill a hole in the market by allowing hyper - responsive fans to connect with their favorite bands and create a community around the hobby of collecting and trading performances .
While it may sound like a recipe for rampant piracy , labels should n’t worry too much about this activity .
Bootleg collectors are among the music industry ’s very best customers .
These are people who will buy anything their favorite artist releases , then buy the remastered version a few years later .
It ’s well known that the Grateful Dead supported the taping and trading of their live performances .
Perhaps less well known is the fact that so many contemporary artists have taken a similar stance in recent years .
The Live Music Archive features thousands of recordings from hundreds of bands that support the recording of their concerts .
I ’m not sure you can technically call these bootlegs since the bands have authorized the recording , but they certainly fit the spirit of what bootlegs have always been about .
Obviously more and more musicians are realizing the benefit of encouraging their fans to share and promote their music through the trading of live recordings .
The result is that both the artists and their fans benefit from this enlightened approach .
Version Control : The Future is Adaptive June 21 , 2007
Posted by Ian Clatworthy in Bazaar
The Version Control space is undergoing a renaissance right now thanks to the increasing popularity of Distributed Version Control Systems ( DVCS ) such as Arch , Bazaar , DARCS , Git , Mercurial , Monotone and SVK .
Many really smart people believe these systems have the potential to dramatically change how software is built and I agree with them !
But which ones actually will and why ?
I think the answer to that lies in a closer examination of the criteria teams use to adopt collaboration tools .
Beyond market acceptance , there are 6 main criteria I consider when evaluating collaboration tools :
Reliability Adaptability Usability Extensibility Integration Administration ( including Total Cost of Ownership )
The order given above is the one I use for version control tools – different collaboration tool categories deserve different orders .
Every team is different so the criteria they consider may not be identical , but the ones above are those I ’d expect every team to include in their evaluations .
While few people would be surprised to see Reliability at the top , few systems do a really good job of delivering the features that implies , so I plan to return to Reliability in another post .
Today though , I want to explain why I think Adaptability is # 2 , even if that makes me “ dumb and stupid ” in the eyes of one of my heroes . 😦
If you have n’t seen it already , I recommend watching the Google video of Linus Torvalds talk about Git .
He makes a lot of excellent points about the advantages of Distributed VCS .
Unfortunately in my mind , he also suggests that anyone using Central VCS tools , particularly CVS and Subversion , is dumb and stupid .
I strongly disagree !
The future of version control is neither Central nor Distributed – it ’s Adaptive .
It ’s all comes down to the numbers …
I remember once being told that to a pure mathematician , there are only 3 interesting numbers : 0 , 1 and infinity .
Why ?
These numbers represent Nothing , Something and Everything .
Likewise , in the field of collaboration , I think there are 5 interesting numbers : 1 , 2 , 10 , 100 and 1000 .
These numbers represent :
an Individual
a Partnership
a Team
a Company
a Community
Once upon a time , Version Control tools only helped Teams and Companies work more efficiently .
Today , Distributed Version Control helps across the whole collaboration spectrum – from Individuals to Communities .
I ’d like to stress that point again because I suspect many teams and companies are currently dismissing DVCS because of its reputation for solving Community needs .
Yes , it does that very well , but the very best DCVS tools ( including Bazaar and Hg ) are also personal productivity tools , just as IDEs are .
Not all DVCSs are equal for personal use though .
Be sure to select one with very low administration overheads , e.g. tools that support creating version stores without requiring a database running .
So if Distributed VCS is so useful at both the low end and high end , why wo n’t it completely replace Central VCS ?
The answer to that is twofold .
Firstly , Central VCS can and does actually work quite well right now for many teams and companies .
It may never be as flexible as a more powerful approach , but there are processes ( e.g. Continuous Integration ) and tools ( e.g. JetBrain ’s TeamCity ) that partially compensate for that .
To be more blunt , many teams are probably only using 20 % of the features in their Central VCS tool – just like every other bit of software installed on their computers .
Secondly , many companies like central systems and their current workflows .
They want to add flexibility to how they work , not be lectured to about throwing out everything and using a different process .
Given this , I think that some of the Distributed VCS tools are being overly elitist in telling users that “ distributed in the only way ” .
A better way is to support how many teams work right now ( with the same number of commands ) , while giving them smarter ways of forking and merging for larger bits of development .
Having learnt from that journey , teams are then better placed to adopt more of a distributed process without the inherent risk of changing before they have that knowledge and experience .
Adaptability is the answer .
From little things , big thing grow : using the same adaptable tool across that spectrum is what I want .
In the middle of that spectrum , I want a tool that supports different workflows so that I ’m not fighting it if and when my team decides to change how it does things .
And I want a tool that runs well on all the major platforms , because my broader development team ( including software engineers , technical writers , graphic artists and quality engineers ) are most likely using a mix of Linux , Mac OS X and Windows .
In summary , I think the world needs tools that scale across the collaboration spectrum , from making one person more productive to making a community interact better .
The only certainty in software development is change .
Tools must be adaptable to different teams , different workflows and different platforms .
As a member of the Bazaar development team , I guess it ’s pretty obvious as to which tool I think is best !
See http://bazaar-vcs.org/Workflows for an overview of the numerous workflows Bazaar supports .
For those most comfortable with the central approach , http://bazaar-vcs.org/Tutorials/CentralizedWorkflow shows how Bazaar can be used in a centralized way , using the same commands people expect : checkout , update and commit .
Even if you only ever use Bazaar this way , it is still more powerful than Subversion and CVS thanks to features such as true rename tracking and intelligent merging .
Ultimately , Bazaar rocks because of 2 main reasons .
Firstly , it has a very active community behind it lead by some very smart people .
Secondly , it started with the goal of being a tool people will love to use , so user - centered design followed .
Next week , I ’ll be looking at usability more closely :

Bush Preparing To ' Cut and Run' From Iraq
Washington , D.C .
10/17/06
A panel of White House advisers , which includes a former US secretary of state , is ready to recommend large troop withdrawals from Iraq , it emerged today .
In what would be a major shift in policy , the experts are said to be ready to suggest the " Redeploy and Contain " option which would mean withdrawing American troops to bases outside Iraq where they could be used against terrorist organizations anywhere in the region .
The report is being prepared by a 10 - member commission called the Iraq Study Group , headed by former US secretary of state James Baker , and is backed by President Bush .
According to an article in the Los Angeles Times , the alternatives to a large - scale withdrawal include " Stability First " , which would mean continuing to try to stabilise Baghdad , boosting efforts to entice militants into politics and bringing Iran and Syria into plans to end the fighting .
Another option is " Stay the Course , Redefine the Mission " , but the panel appears to be less interested in that choice .
Violence in Iraq and rising American casualties are emerging as key issues for November 's US mid-term elections .
" There 's got to be another way , " is how one member of the Iraq panel summed up their views on the situation in Iraq and the failure of current US policy , according to the LA Times .
Mr Baker , who was Secretary of State under President George HW Bush , the current president 's father , has so far stressed that the panel has not come to a definitive conclusion .
But he has indicated the direction of the panel 's thinking in recent television interviews .
" Our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives , the ones that are out there in the political debate of ' stay the course ' and ' cut and run ' " , he told ABC News recently .
He has also said there would probably be some things in the report that the administration might not like .
The White House has not commented on the newspaper report .

Sometimes it seems like it .
As the Webmaster for Antiwar.com , I get many critical letters every day .
I get at least one letter from someone claiming to be a US soldier or veteran who seems to have the same philosophy as bin Laden : “ If you do n’t agree with us , we will kill you . ”
The majority of them contain numerous misspellings and grammatical errors .
This morning I received this note from Maj. J. McCaffery , USMC .
I am including the name and email address he gave since he listed it for publication .
Anti-war ?
Do yall seriously against all military action ?
I was in Haiti , Afghanistan , and Iraq and I can tell you right now its damn hippies like you who give us a bad name .
If I had it my way id take my company straight into your heaquarters and put a end to your damn lies .
You have no idea about the good that we do in those countries .
All you do is sit your fat ass in a cubicle and read far left bullshit and pass it on a fact .
We help more people in those nations than is getting reported .
THE US IS NOT THE BAD GUYS .
If you hate America so much , please do us all a favor and get the hell out .
~ Maj. J McCaffery USMC
It is such a shame .
Many Americans seem willing to adopt the principles of the terrorist enemies : the violent destruction of those who do n’t agree with them .
But I will close on a positive note .
I received another email yesterday ( I am withholding the name in this case , so as not to jeopardize him with the military ) :
Has one of our articles helped you out ( or made you laugh ) ?
Let us know by sending us an email , or if you 'd like , you can buy us a " happy hour " beer .

Overseers of the 1500 - year - old Shaolin Monastery in China 's Henan province , where Buddhist practice and martial arts have long been one , are demanding a public apology from some internet dude who claimed online that a Japanese ninja once whupped the asses of the kung fu monks of Shaolin in a showdown .
Oh snap , Grasshopper !
The affront is said to have taken place in the " Iron Blood Bulletin Board Community . "
If the ninja propagandist refuses to apologize , the wushu masters say they may sue him .
OR WORSE .
And that 's what I call real ultimate power .
Snip from Reuters item :
" The so - called defeat is purely fabricated , and we demand the Internet user to apologise to the whole nation for the wrongs he or she did , " the Beijing News said , citing a notice announced by a lawyer for the Shaolin monks .
Relations between Chinese and Japanese are sensitive at the best of times , with emotions still running high over Japan 's invasion and occupation of parts of China in the first half of the 20th Century .
The Internet user , calling themselves " Five Minutes Every Day " , said on an online forum last week that a Japanese ninja came to Shaolin , asked for a fight and many monks failed to beat him , the newspaper said .
" The facts that the monks could not defeat a Japanese ninja showed that they were named as kung fu masters in vain , " the Internet user was quoted as saying in the post .
The Shaolin temple " strongly condemned the horrible deeds " of the user , the newspaper said .

Update : Boing Boing readers have been analyzing this news in the comments forum , but none nails it quite so well as BB reader J L Borghead :
The Shaolin monks knew there was only one thing that could defeat a ninja in single combat : A Lawyer !
Let 's look at the facts : 1 . Lawyers are mammals
2. Lawyers are in the court room ALL the time
3 . The purpose of the lawyer is to flip out and sue people .
What do they do when they 're not suing people ?
Most of their free time is spent flying , but sometime they subpoena .
And BB reader Evan says , that 's what I call ..
Real Ultimate Power of Attorney !

Even the Swiss are going crazy !
Usually , a swiss army knife can be described by one short phrase : minimalistic and practical .
This means that you get a bunch of useful functions out of a small and simple to use device .
Well , now , the ‘ small ’ part seems to be totally out .
How about 9 whole inches of width ?
Of course , there ’s an awful lot of functions in there ( 85 fully functional implements ) , but none of the tools is now practical , simply due to the ginormous size of this .
This really deserves to be categorized as a ‘ Wacky Gadget ’ .

Hell , there ’s even a tire pressure gauge in there !

I 've finally determined What 's Wrong With Apple 's Font Rendering .
As it turns out , there actually was n't anything wrong with Apple 's font rendering , per se .
Apple simply chose a different font rendering philosophy , as Joel Spolsky explains :
Apple generally believes that the goal of the algorithm should be to preserve the design of the typeface as much as possible , even at the cost of a little bit of blurriness .
Microsoft generally believes that the shape of each letter should be hammered into pixel boundaries to prevent blur and improve readability , even at the cost of not being true to the typeface .
So we answer the question with another question .
What do you respect more : the pixel grid , or the font designer ?
It 's not surprising that Apple would side with the font designer , because Steve Jobs thinks Microsoft has no taste .
But me , I 'm a pragmatist .
Given the ubiquity of relatively low DPI displays , I 'm with Dave Shea .
I side with the pixel grid .
Joel talks about the pixel grid , and how Microsoft 's type rendering pays more attention to it .
Speaking as someone who thinks a lot about the pixel grid , I have to say I think I 'm coming around to the idea that Microsoft 's ClearType simply works better .
Alright , I 'd better qualify that quickly .
Think about it this way – as a designer , you do n't just set type in Photoshop and let it go , right ?
You tweak .
You kern .
You attempt to match the letters to the pixel grid as closely as possible to reduce the blurriness .
Sometimes spacing suffers , and you have to choose between a slightly blurry letter with perfect spacing , or a more precise fit within the pixel grid with just slightly off spacing .
I can't be the only one that leans toward the latter most times .
And that 's the difference here .
ClearType is a closer match to what I do manually already .
Yes , I prefer the way type on OS X looks ; ClearType seems too sharp and overly blocky , the subtleties of the curves are lost and it 's overly chunky .
But , for the medium in which it 's being rendered , it seems like a more ideal solution .
Dave 's opinion carries a lot of weight here , not just because he 's a well - known designer , but because the three citations he provides demonstrate just how common it is for designers to do exactly the kind of manual , per-pixel tweaks that ClearType does for us automatically .
And it 's not just an aesthetic choice , either – there 's plenty of hard data to support the assertion that snapping fonts to the pixel grid improves reading accuracy .
A fascinating greyscale - only variant of this rendering techique , FontFocus , illustrates beautifully how subtle tweaks can " snap " fonts to the pixel grid for better readability :
Typography , if you have n't figured this out by now , is really complicated .
It 's one of the few areas of " computer science " that actually justifies the title .
I highly recommend reading the entire FontFocus article , as it's very instructive .
Dave Shea thinks the pixel grid will be moot once high resolution displays become ubiquitious .
I wholeheartedly agree , although I 'm unsure when exactly that will be .
The history of display resolution increases have been quite modest so far .
Ten years ago I was using a single 17 " 1024x768 display ; now I 'm using three 20 " 1600x1200 displays .
So you 'll forgive me if I 'm not overly optimistic about this theoretical jump from 100 DPI to 200 DPI .
I do n't understand why Apple is asking us to sacrifice the present at the altar of the future .
Ca n't we have hinting at low resolutions , and accuracy at high resolutions , too ?
Snapping fonts to a pixel grid may very well be irrelevant when everyone is luxuriating in the glow of their 200 DPI monitors .
Until that glorious day arrives , respecting the pixel grid certainly makes text a lot more readable for those of us stuck in the here and now .
Bill Moyers : ' Greed and God won four elections in a row ' for Rove David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 16 , 2007
Print This Email This Bill Moyers will consider the departure of Karl Rove in a video essay released early by PBS to RAW STORY .
Moyers , a Texan like Rove and Bush , is not easily swayed by the commentators and administration figures who have been quick to describe Rove as " brilliant ... mastermind ... boy genius . "
" Karl Rove figured out a long time ago , " says Moyers , " that the way to take an intellectually incurious , draft - averse naughty playboy in a flight jacket with chewing tobacco in his back pocket and make him governor of Texas was to sell him as God 's anointed . "
" Rove turned religion into a weapon of political combat , " explains Moyers .
" Never mind that in stroking the base 's bigotry of true believers you coarsen both politics and religion . "
" Rove was also shaking down corporations for campaign cash , " Moyers continues .
" Crony capitalism became a biblical injunction .
Greed and God won four elections in a row .
...
But the result has been to leave Texas under the thumb of big money , with huge holes ripped in its social contact , and the US government in shambles . "
Moyers ' final reaction to Rove 's departure is to wonder , given that Rove has " confessed to friends his own agnosticism ... how all those folks on the Christian right must feel discovering they were used for partisan reasons by a skeptic , a secular manipulator . "
The following video will appear on Friday on PBS 's Bill Moyers Journal .
Partial transcript :
What struck me about my fellow Texan , Karl Rove , is that he knew how to win elections as if they were divine interventions .
You may think God summoned Billy Graham to Florida on the eve of the 2000 election to endorse George W. Bush just in the nick of time , but if it did happen that way , the good lord was speaking in a Texas accent .
Karl
Rove figured out a long time ago that the way to take an intellectually incurious draft - averse naughty playboy in a flight jacket with chewing tobacco in his back pocket and make him governor of Texas , was to sell him as Gods anointed in a state where preachers and televangelists outnumber even oil derricks and jack rabbits .
Using church pews as precincts
Rove turned religion into a weapon of political combat -- a battering ram , aimed at the devils minions , especially at gay people .
It s so easy , as Karl knew , to scapegoat people you outnumber , and if God is love , as rumor has it , Rove knew that , in politics , you better bet on fear and loathing .
Never mind that in stroking the basest bigotry of true believers you coarsen both politics and religion .
At the same time he was recruiting an army of the lord for the born - again Bush , Rove was also shaking down corporations for campaign cash .
Crony capitalism became a biblical injunction .
Greed and God won four elections in a row - twice in the lone star state and twice again in the nation at large .
But the result has been to leave Texas under the thumb of big money with huge holes ripped in its social contract , and the U.S. government in shambles - paralyzed , polarized , and mired in war , debt and corruption .
Rove himself is deeply enmeshed in some of the scandals being investigated as we speak , including those missing emails that could tell us who turned the attorney general of the United States into a partisan sockpuppet .
Rove is riding out of Dodge city as the posse rides in .
At his press conference this week he asked God to bless the president and the country , even as reports were circulating that he himself had confessed to friends his own agnosticism ; he wished he could believe , but he cannot .
That kind of intellectual honesty is to be admired , but you have to wonder how all those folks on the Christian right must feel discovering they were used for partisan reasons by a skeptic , a secular manipulator .
On his last play of the game all Karl Rove had to offer them was a hail mary pass , while telling himself theres no one there to catch it .
A con man is a person who intentionally misleads another person , usually for personal financial gain .
In recent history there have been a number of con men who have really stood out for either the wealth they amassed , or the ease with which they tricked people .
This is a list of 10 of the most famous con men in recent history .
10 Frank Abagnale [ Born : 1948 ]
Frank Abagnale is a former cheque con artist , forger and imposter who , for five years in the 1960s , passed bad cheques worth more than $ 2.5 million in 26 countries .
The recent blockbuster film Catch Me If You Can is based on his life .
His first experience of fraud was as a youth when he used his father ’s Mobil card to buy car parts that he would then sell back to the gas station for a lower price .
He did not realise that his father was the one who had to foot the bill and when he was eventually confronted with the fraud , his mother sent him for four months to a juvenile correction facility .
After moving to New York , Frank lived solely on the income of his fraudulent activities .
One of his most famous tricks was to print his own account number on fake bank deposit slips so that when clients of the bank deposited money , it would actually go in to his account .
By the time the banks realised what had happened , Frank had taken $ 40,000 and run .
For two years , Abagnale travelled around the world free by masquerading as a Pan Am pilot .
He was able to abuse the professional courtesy of other airlines to provide free transport for competing airline pilots if they had to move to another city at short notice .
When he was nearly caught leaving a plane , he changed his masquerade to that of a Doctor .
He worked as a medical supervisor for 11 months without detection .
At other times he worked as a lawyer and a teacher .
He was eventually caught in France and spent six months in prison there .
After that he was extradited to Sweden and imprisoned for a further six months .
After a successful escape whilst travelling to the United States , he was finally given 12 years in Prison .
He escaped from his prison by masquerading as an undercover officer of the Bureau of Prisons .
He was once again captured in New York City and returned to jail .
After serving only five years of his sentence , the US Federal Government offered him his freedom in return for helping the government against fraud and scam artists without pay .
He currently runs Abagnale and Associates , a financial fraud consultancy company and is a multi-millionaire .

9 Charles Ponzi [ Born : 1882 ; Died : 1949 ]
Advertisement
Ponzi , an Italian immigrant to the United States became one of the most famous con men in American history .
While many people do not know the name Ponzi , the Ponzi Scheme is extremely well known and continues today in Internet Make Money Fast schemes .
His early life is not entirely known as he was prone to fabricate stories about it .
What is known is that he spent a short amount of time at University in Rome and , after dropping out , caught a boat to Boston , USA where he arrived with $ 2.50 in his pocket .
His early years in the United States were troublesome .
He began working at a restaurant but was soon fired for playing tricks with the bills and shortchanging customers .
His next job was working in a bank in Canada that catered to Italian immigrants .
His knowledge of numbers helped him to do very well there .
Unfortunately it turned out that the owner of the bank was stealing money from newly opened savings accounts to pay the interest on the interest bearing accounts and to cover bad investments .
The bank owner eventually fled to Mexico and left Ponzi without a job .
After writing a fraudulent cheque and spending a number of years in prison , Ponzi determined to become wealthy at any cost .
Once he had settled in to life on the outside , he discovered postal reply coupons through a letter that was sent to him from abroad .
He realised that he could buy foreign coupons at massively devalued prices ( because of price fixing after the war ) and then resell them in the United States for a 400 % profit .
This was a form of arbitrage and it was legal .
Ponzi began canvasses friends and acquaintances for money – promising them a 50 % return or a doubling of their money in 90 days .
He started his own company , the Securities Exchange Company , to promote the scheme .
The word of this great investment quickly spread and before long Ponzi was living in a luxurious mansion .
He was bringing in cash at a fantastic rate , but the simplest financial analysis showed that he was n’t making money , he was losing it rapidly .
For every dollar he took in , he went more deeply into debt .
As long as money kept flowing in , Ponzi would stay ahead of the eventual collapse .
People soon began to become suspicious and the press were starting to publish negative articles about him .
Inevitably people were starting to demand their money .
Shortly after , federal agents raided his office and shut it down .
No stock of stamps was found and everyone that had invested their money with Ponzi lost every penny .
It is probably that he lost tens of millions of dollars .
Ponzi plead guilty of mail fraud and was sent to prison .
After one escape he was returned to jail to complete his sentence .
He was eventually deported back to Italy and he died there in poverty in 1949 .
8 Joseph Weil [ Born : 1877 ; Died : 1975 ]
Joseph “ Yellow Kid ” Weil was one of the most famous con men in his era .
Over the course of his career he is believed to have stolen over 8 million dollars .
In his first job as a collector , he realized that his co-workers were collecting their debts but keeping a little part of the money for themselves .
Weil started a protection racket – offering not to report their activities in return for a small portion of what they were taking .
He also used phony oil deals , women , fixed races , and an endless list of other tricks to steal from an increasingly gullible public .
He could change his persona daily to further his gains : one day he was Dr. Henri Reuel , a noted geologist who travelled around and told his hosts that he was a representative for a big oil company while draining them of the cash they gave him to “ invest in fuel . ”
The next day he was director of the Elysium Development Company , promising land to innocent believers while robbing them in recording and abstract fees .
Or he was a chemist par excellence , who had discovered how to copy dollar bills ; promising to increase your fortune , he would multiply your bill ’s then take the booty once the police arrived .
In his autobiography , Weil writes :
“ The desire to get something for nothing has been very costly to many people who have dealt with me and with other con men , ” Weil writes .
“ But I have found that this is the way it works .
The average person , in my estimation , is ninety - nine per cent animal and one per cent human .
The ninety - nine per cent that is animal causes very little trouble .
But the one per cent that is human causes all our woes .
When people learn — as I doubt they will — that they ca n’t get something for nothing , crime will diminish and we shall live in greater harmony . ”
7 Victor Lustig [ Born : 1890 ; Died : 1947 ]
Victor Lustig was renowned as the Man who Sold the Eiffel Tower .
He was born in Bohemia but later moved to Paris where he was able to con people on his frequent journeys between Paris and New York .
His first con was to show people a device that could print $ 100 bills .
The only problem , he would tell them , is that it only prints one bill every six hours .
Many people paid him enormous amounts of money ( usually over $ 30,000 ) for the device .
In fact , the device contained two real hidden $ 100 bills – once they were spat out by the machine it would produce only blank paper .
By the time the buyers discovered this , Lustig was well gone with their money .
In 1925 , as France was recovering from the war , the upkeep of the Eiffel tower was an almost unbearable expense for the city of Paris .
When Lustig read about this in a paper , he came up with his most brilliant idea .
After forging government credentials , he invited six scrap metal dealers to a secret meeting in a hotel .
He explained that the City could not afford to keep the tower and that they had to sell it for scrap .
He told them the secrecy of the meeting and all future dealings was due to the fact that the public may become distressed at the idea of the removal of the tower .
While it seems implausible , at the time the tower was built it was meant to be temporary and this happened just 18 years after the original date for removal of the tower .
Lustig took the dealers in a limousine to tour the tower .
One of the dealers , Andre Poisson was convinced that the tale was legitimate and he handed over the money .
When he realised he had been conned , he was too embarrassed to tell the police and Lustig escaped with the money .
One month later , he returned to Paris to try the whole scam again .
This time it was reported to the police but Lustig managed to escape .
At one point , Lustig convinced Al Capone to invest $ 50,000 with him .
He stored the money in a vault and returned it two months later , stating that the deal had fallen through .
Capone , so impressed by Lustig ’s honesty gave him $ 5,000 for his effort .
In 1934 , Lustig was found guilty of counterfeiting .
He plead guilty and was sentenced to 20 years in Alcatraz .
In 1947 he died of pneumonia whilst in jail in Springfield , Missouri .
6 George Parker [ Born : 1870 ; Died : 1936 ]
Parker was one of the most audacious con men in American history .
He made his living selling New York ’s public landmarks to unwary tourists .
His favorite object for sale was the Brooklyn Bridge , which he sold twice a week for years .
He convinced his marks that they could make a fortune by controlling access to the roadway .
More than once police had to remove naive buyers from the bridge as they tried to erect toll barriers .
Other public landmarks he sold included the original Madison Square Garden , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Grant ’s Tomb , and the Statue of Liberty .
George had many different methods for making his sales .
When he sold Grant ’s Tomb , he would often pose as the general ’s grandson .
He even set up a fake “ office ” to handle his real estate swindles .
He produced impressive forged documents to prove that he was the legal owner of whatever property he was selling .
Parker was convicted of fraud three times .
After his third conviction on December 17th , 1928 he was sentenced to a life term at Sing Sing Prison .
He spent the last eight years of his life behind bars .
He was popular among guards and fellow inmates who enjoyed hearing of his exploits .
George is remembered as one of the most successful con men in the history of the United States , as well as one of history ’s most talented hoaxers .
His exploits have passed into popular culture , giving rise to phrases such as “ and if you believe that , I have a bridge to sell you ” , a popular way of expressing a belief that someone is gullible .
5 Soapy Smith [ Born : 1860 ; Died : 1898 ]
Soapy Smith ( born Jefferson Randolph Smith ) was an American con artist and gangster who had a major hand in the organized criminal operations of Denver , Colorado , Creede , Colorado , and Skagway , Alaska from 1879 to 1898 .
He is perhaps the most famous “ sure - thing ” bunko man of the old west .
Some time in the late 1870s or early 1880s , Smith began duping entire crowds with a ploy the Denver newspapers dubbed The Prize Package Soap Sell Swindle .
Jefferson would open his “ tripe and keister ” ( display case on a tripod ) on a busy street corner .
Piling ordinary soap cakes onto the keister top , he would describe their wonders .
As he spoke to the growing crowd of curious onlookers , he would pull out his wallet and begin wrapping paper money ranging from one dollar up to one hundred dollars , around a select few of the bars .
He then finished each bar by wrapping plain paper around it to hide the money .
He mixed the money - wrapped packages in with wrapped bars containing no money .
He then sold the soap to the crowd for a dollar a cake .
A shill planted in the crowd would buy a bar , tear it open it , and loudly proclaim that he had won some money , waving it around for all to see .
This performance had the desired effect of enticing the sale of the packages .
More often than not , victims bought several bars before the sale was completed .
Midway through the sale , Smith would announce that the hundred - dollar bill still remained in the pile , unpurchased .
He then would auction off the remaining soap bars to the highest bidders .
Through the masterful art of manipulation and sleight - of - hand , the cakes of soap wrapped with money were hidden and replaced with packages holding no cash .
It was assured that the only money “ won ” went to members of what became known as the “ Soap Gang . ”
Soapy was eventually shot to death by a group he swindled in a card game .
4 Eduardo de Valfierno
Eduardo de Valfierno , who referred to himself as Marqués ( marquis ) , was an Argentine con man who allegedly masterminded the theft of the Mona Lisa .
Valfierno paid several men to steal the work of art from the Louvre , including museum employee Vincenzo Peruggia .
On August 21 , 1911 Peruggia hid the Mona Lisa under his coat and simply walked out the door .
Before the heist took place , Valfierno commissioned French art restorer and forger Yves Chaudron to make six copies of the Mona Lisa .
The forgeries were then shipped to various parts of the world , readying them for the buyers he had lined up .
Valfierno knew once the Mona Lisa was stolen it would be harder to smuggle copies past customs .
After the heist the copies were delivered to their buyers , each thinking they had the original which had just been stolen for them .
Because Valfierno just wanted to sell forgeries , he only needed the original Mona Lisa to disappear and never contacted Peruggia again after the crime .
Eventually Peruggia was caught trying to sell the painting and it was returned to the Louvre in 1913 .
3 James Hogue [ Born : 1959 ]
Hogue is a US impostor who most famously entered Princeton University by posing as a self - taught orphan .
In 1986 Hogue enrolled in a Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman , a 16 - year - old orphan from Nevada .
He had adopted the identity of a dead infant .
A suspicious local reporter exposed him .
In 1988 Hogue enrolled at Princeton University using the alias Alexi Indris Santana , a self - taught orphan from Utah .
He deferred admission for one year because he had been convicted of the theft of bicycle frames in Utah .
Hogue claimed in his application materials that he had slept outside in the Grand Canyon , raising sheep and reading philosophers .
He violated his parole to enter class .
For the next two years he lived as Santana and as a member of the track team .
He was also admitted into the Ivy Club .
In 1991 Hogue ’s real identity was exposed when Renee Pacheco , a student from the Palo Alto High School , recognized him .
He was arrested for defrauding the university for $ 30,000 in financial aid and sentenced to three years in jail with 5 years probation and 100 hours of community service .
On May 16 , 1993 Hogue made headlines again through his association with Harvard University .
Having lied about his identity again , he was able to take a job as a security guard in one of Harvard ’s on campus museums .
A few months into his tenure , museum officials noticed that several gemstones on exhibit had been replaced with inexpensive fakes .
Somerville police seized Hogue in his home and charged him with grand larceny to the tune of $ 50,000 .
On March 12 , 2007 Hogue pleaded guilty to a single felony count of theft of more than $ 15,000 in exchange for a prison sentence not to exceed 10 years , and prosecutors ’ agreement to drop other theft and habitual criminal charges .
2 Robert Hendy - Freegard [ Born : 1971 ]
Robert Hendy - Freegard is a British barman , car salesman , conman and impostor who masqueraded as an MI5 agent and fooled several people to go underground for fear of IRA assassination .
He met his victims on social occasions or as customers in the pub or car dealership where he was working .
He would reveal his “ role ” as an undercover agent for MI5 , Special Branch or Scotland Yard working against the IRA .
He would win them over , ask for money and make them do his bidding .
He demanded that they cut off contact with family and friends , go through “ loyalty tests ” and live alone in poor conditions .
He seduced five women , claiming that he wanted to marry them .
Initially some of the victims refused to co-operate with the police because he had warned them that police would be double agents or MI5 agents performing another “ loyalty test ” .
Hendy - Freegard also seduced a newly married personal assistant who was taking care of his children .
He told her he was with MI5 and forced her to cut contact with friends and family lest the IRA would kill her .
He also took naked pictures of her and threatened to give them to her husband if she would not cooperate .
She had to change her name and tell the deed poll officer it was because she was sexually abused as a child .
Her loyalty tests included sleeping in Heathrow airport and on park benches for several nights and pretending to be a Jehovah ’s Witness so that his bosses in MI5 would let them marry .
In 2002 Scotland Yard and the FBI organized a sting operation .
First , the FBI bugged the phone of the American psychologist ’s parents .
Her mother told Hendy - Freegard she would hand over £ 10,000 but only in person .
Hendy - Freegard met the mother in Heathrow airport where police apprehended him .
He denied all charges and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against him and continued this story in the subsequent trial .
On June 23 , 2005 , after an eight month trial , Blackfriars Crown Court convicted Robert Hendy - Freegard for two counts of kidnapping , 10 of theft and 8 of deception .
On September 6 , 2005 he was given a life sentence .
Police doubt that they have discovered all the victims .
On April 25 , 2007 , the BBC reported that Robert Hendy - Freegard had appealed against his kidnapping convictions and won .
This means that the life sentence is revoked but he will still serve nine years for the other offences .
He could be free by the end of 2007 .
1 Bernard Cornfeld [ Born : 1927 ; Died : 1995 ]
Bernard Cornfeld was a prominent businessman and international financier who sold investments in US mutual funds .
He was born in Turkey .
When he moved to the US , he first worked as a social worker but became a mutual fund salesman in the 1950s .
Although he suffered from a stammer , he had a natural gift for selling and when a schoolfriend ’s father died , the two of them used the $ 3,000 insurance money to purchase and run an age and weight guessing stand at the Coney Island funfair .
In the 1960s , Cornfeld formed his own mutual fund selling company , Investors Overseas Services ( IOS ) , which he incorporated outside the US with funds in Canada and headquarters in Geneva , Switzerland .
Although the headquarters were offcially in Geneva , the main operational offices of IOS were in Ferney - Voltaire , France , a short drive from the Swiss border to Geneva — this was simply a means of avoiding the problems of obtaining Swiss work - permits for the many employees .
During the next ten years , IOS raised in excess of $ 2.5 billion , bringing Cornfeld a personal fortune of more than $ 100 million .
Cornfeld himself became known for conspicuous consumption with lavish parties .
Socially , he was generous and jovial .
A group of 300 IOS employees complained to the Swiss authorities that Cornfeld and his co-founders pocketed part of the proceeds of a share issue raised among employees in 1969 .
Consequently he was charged with fraud in 1973 by the Swiss authorities .
When Cornfeld visited Geneva , Swiss authorities arrested him .
He served 11 months in a Swiss jail before being freed on a bail surety of $ 600,000 .
He returned to Beverly Hills , living less ostentatiously than in his previous years .
He developed an obsession for health foods and vitamins , renounced red meat and seldom drank alcohol .
He suffered a stroke and died of a cerebral aneurysm on 27th February 1995 in London , England .

IPtables is Fun !
Suddenly everything is kittens !
It 's kitten net .
/sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 - p tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 64.111.96.38
For the uninitiated , this redirects all traffic to kittenwar .
For more fun , we set iptables to forward everything to a transparent squid proxy running on port 80 on the machine .
/sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 - p tcp - m tcp -- dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.1
That machine runs squid with a trivial redirector that downloads images , uses mogrify to turn them upside down and serves them out of its local webserver .
The redirection script
#!/usr/bin/perl $ |=1 ; $ count = 0 ; $ pid = $ $ ; while ( <> ) { chomp $ _ ; if ( $ _ =~ /(.*\. jpg ) /i ) { $url = $ 1 ; system ( " /usr/bin/wget " , " - q " , " - O " , " / space/WebPages/images /$pid-$count.jpg " , " $url " ) ; system ( " /usr/bin/mogrify " , " - flip " , " / space /WebPages/images /$pid-$count.jpg " ) ; print " http://127.0.0.1/images/$pid-$count.jpg
" ; } elsif ( $_ =~ /(.*\. gif ) /i ) { $url = $ 1 ; system ( " /usr/bin/wget " , " - q " , " - O " , " / space/WebPages/images /$pid-$count.gif " , " $url " ) ; system ( " /usr/bin/mogrify " , " - flip " , " / space /WebPages/images /$pid-$count.gif " ) ; print " http://127.0.0.1/images/$pid-$count.gif
" ; } else { print " $_
" ; ; } $ count ++ ; }
Then the internet looks like this !
And if you replace flip with - blur 4 you get the blurry - net
I made xkcd - how cool is that ?
Here 's an email I received from Fraser at kittenwar ,
Hi Pete , Apologies for the unsolicited mail , but I thought I 'd drop you a line to say how much I like your Upside - Down - Ternet advice for confusing wireless thieves .
Every so often I receive extremely irate e-mails from people claiming that my Kittenwar site is playing host to some kind of nefarious virus preventing them from accessing the web , accusing me of practising all sorts of dark arts - to which I politely respond that I 'm terribly sorry , but this only usually happens to people who are using someone else 's wireless connection , and pointing them in the direction of your site .
This has happened dozens of times over the last few years , and you know what ?
None of them have ever got back to me after I point this out .
It seems that the kernel.org team also turned their bit of the internet upside down .
kernel.org
gotmi1k has redone this page for the Web 2.0 generation and turned the entire technical explanation into a video .
They did write some more scripts for messing about with the images and I must confess that the asciiart filter and time machine options are particularly inspired .
A talentless copyright infringing idiot called Varun Chandak plagarised this page without any subtlety at all and gave me the opportunity to send my first ever DMCA takedown notice .
It would be awful if this page appeared in Google as the first search result for his name .
Being the complete tool that he is he added a tiny attribution just like this one Varun Chandak is a talentless copyrighting infringing idiot which does n't appear in the Google cache for his page and pretended that the retrospective addition makes it definitely not copyright infringement .
It ’s no secret that our favorite music download service at ‘ Loper HQ is n’t iTunes , but eMusic .
Kirk discussed his reasons last year , and mine are pretty much the same : the wide variety of music , the great pricing , and the fact that I can do whatever I want with the music I ’ve downloaded .
No damn dirty DRM .
I ’m not going to address the breadth and depth of the music itself , but rather the user experience .
And to do that , I should very quickly explain how I use eMusic .
It ’s pretty simple actually : I pay $ 14.99 per month for 65 downloads ( it ’s a legacy plan ) , and every week , I login , go through the new music for that week , and save the things in which I ’m interested in my “ Saved For Later ” page .
That way I do n’t use up my downloads at the beginning of the month , and have to wait because something as awesome as The Hold Steady Live At Lollapalooza comes out the day after I used them up .
( Of course , I could get a booster pack if that happens , but that ’s not maximizing my music dollar . )
After doing it this way for the past couple of years , I ’ve noticed some ways that eMusic could improve its user experience .
Five ways , as it turns out , and here they are :
1. Add a “ New Since Last Login ” button .
We all crave the new music .
And , naturally eMusic provides a major section of the site called “ New on eMusic . ”
This is broken down into three sub-sections :
Freshly Ripped
New This Week
New This Month
But people do n’t login to the site exactly every day , or week , or even month .
They login at irregular periods .
So why not add a forth sub-section : “ New Since Last Login . ”
That way , if I login every 10 days or 3 weeks , I do n’t miss anything that has come out since my last login .
2 . Let me control how many albums are on a page .
So , currently , when I hit that “ New This Week ” button , there are then various ways I can refine that search : I can break it down by genre , order it by album , artist , label , etc , and even sort it alphabetically or chronologically .
The only thing I ca n’t do is control how many albums are displayed on a page .
That is 15 per page .
So if my sort returns 300 albums , I have to make 20 mouse clicks to see all of the albums .
Why is this ?
Actually , I ’m pretty sure that the answer is to maximize page impressions , but from the user standpoint , it ’s a big giant pain in the ass .
Back in the dial - up days , it was pretty standard to favor a lot of pages over a long user wait time for longer pages to load .
But , we ’re in the broadband world now , and it ’s inexcusable that I do n’t even have a choice to view pages that have 50 or even 100 albums listed .
3. Downloading selected tracks .
When you are looking at an individual album , you have down choices :
You can download individual tracks , one at a time .
You can download the entire album in its entirety .
What this does n’t allow you to do is select multiple tracks from an album and choose to download those tracks at the same time .
Where this comes in handy is when you ’re wading through something like one of those live John Coltrane albums with several discs that all have the same songs over different nights .
All that they would need to do is add checkboxes next to each track , and then a “ Download Selected Tracks ” button next to the “ Download All ” button .
Sure , I can download the individual songs as I see them , but when I get to Disc Seven of Live Trane : The European Tours , I might have wished I did n’t already download a version of “ Impressions ” from the first disc when I come across the monster 25 - minute version which is the very last track listed on the page .
What the checkboxes do is allow me to review the individual tracks prior to actually downloading , a big help when you picking and choosing through albums that have annoying 30 - second skits or 5 - second artsy “ interludes ” that count as full tracks .
It also lets me pay more attention to how many downloads I have left , so that I leave any on the table when my monthly refresh comes around .
4 . Make the refresh truly monthly .
Did I say “ monthly refresh ? ”
Well , I ’m wrong .
Here is how they break down their current subscription plans :
Q : What subscription programs does eMusic offer ?
A. eMusic offers three low priced subscription plans .
eMusic Basic * 30 Song Downloads per month
* $ 9.99 per month eMusic Plus * 50 Song Downloads per month
* $ 14.99 per month eMusic Premium * 75 Song Downloads per month
* $ 19.99 per month
So , by “ monthly , ” you mean that every month on the same day , my credit card will be charged and my downloads will refresh , right ?
Wrong .
By “ monthly , ” they mean “ every 30 days . ”
Not a big deal , right ?
But here ’s my payment / refresh history for the last 15 months :
April 5 , 2006
May 5 , 2006
June 4 , 2006
July 4 , 2006
August 3 , 2006
September 2 , 2006
October 2 , 2006
November 1 , 2006
December 1 , 2006
December 31 , 2006
January 30 , 2007
March 1 , 2007
March 31 , 2007
April 30 , 2007
May 29 , 2007
June 28 , 2007
It ’s crept from the 5th of the month to the 28th of the month .
I know it ’s not the biggest deal , but it ’s something else in my crazy complicated life that I have to keep track of : this slowly changing refresh date .
And for no good reason that I could possibly see .
What is means is two - fold : I used to think that the last weekend of the month was when I needed to make sure I ’d downloaded all of my songs , but now that ’s moved up .
Also , if you wanna do the math , if you ’re an eMusic customer for longer than six years , you ’ve made an extra “ monthly ” payment .
Why every thirty days ?
Why not monthly , like you know — every single other subscription I ’ve got ?!?
To be fair , eMusic does n’t hide this fact — in their FAQ , right after the description of the “ monthly ” plans :
Q : How does the eMusic subscription work ?
A : Our subscription program is simple .
For each 30 day period you receive a fixed number of downloads for one low price .
Every 30 days your account is refreshed with the appropriate number of downloads .
Downloads do not rollover from one period to the next .
5. Rollover my downloads .
I would have never even noticed the whole monthly / 30 - day disconnect if I was n’t caught totally by surprise by the Dec 31 refresh .
I ’d been busy with Christmas and a vacation , and had n’t had a chance to grab my downloads , so I was totally caught by surprise by that refresh .
But it totally would n’t even matter if my downloads rolled over .
If you do n’t want people to accumulate hundreds of downloads and use them all at once ( though I ’m not sure why not ) , then at least give some kind of grace period to the people who might have had their — you know — life interfere with getting their downloads that month .
Despite all of this , I still love eMusic .
I use it every weeks — far far more than iTunes , and the other services might as well not even exist , as long as they are wed to DRM .
I just want to love it that much more , and these changes would go a long way towards making that happen .

In this post I am going to show you how someone can remotely install a simple , persistent filter within a GMail account and download all previous as well as snoop onto all future email conversations .
The following sequence of screenshots describes how the attack works .
[![ GGEHT Seq1 ] ( / files/2007/09/ggeht-seq1-248x150.jpg " GGEHT Seq1 " ) ] (/ files/2007/09/ggeht-seq1.jpg ) [!
[ GGEHT Seq2 ]( / files/2007/09/ggeht-seq2-248x150.jpg " GGEHT Seq2 " ) ] (/ files/2007/09/ggeht-seq2.jpg ) [!
[ GGEHT Seq3 ]( / files/2007/09/ggeht-seq3-248x150.jpg " GGEHT Seq3 " ) ] (/ files/2007/09/ggeht-seq3.jpg )
The victim visits a malicious page while being logged into GMail .
Upon that , the page performs a multipart / form - data POST to one of the GMail alternative interfaces and injects a filter into the victim 's filter list .
In the example above , the attacker writes a filter , which simply looks for emails with attachments and forward them to an email of their choice .
This filter will automatically transfer all emails matching the rule .
Keep in mind that future emails will be forwarded as well .
The attack will remain present for as long as the victim has the filter within their filter list , even if the initial vulnerability , which was the cause of the injection , is fixed by Google .
The technique used in this example is known as Cross - site request forgery , or simply CSRF .
I am not planning to go into details how it works .
Just look it up on this blog or with your favourite search engine .
I am not planning to release the details of this vulnerability for now .
The exploit was verified by Ryan Naraine and several close friends .
It does work and it is nasty if you ask me .
UPDATE 2007/09/28 : I promised to release the POC as soon as Google fixes the vulnerability .
Well they did .
So , here are the details :
The actual exploit can be launched from here .
It makes use of a CSRF redirection utility to simplify the process .

Their way of life has n't changed for hundreds of years - a group of skilled fishermen using only their bodies and extraordinary bravery to catch 75 ft - long sperm whales to provide enough food and materials for their whole village .
It is like a scene from Moby Dick , except the odds are stacked even higher against the captains of each tiny wooden boat .
These amazing images were taken during a whale hunt in one of the last places on Earth where people still use traditional methods to fish for one of the largest creatures in the seas .
Scroll down for more ...
They battle for more than six hours , their hands gripping traditional duri flensing knives , to subdue the whale - which they call Koteklema .
Finally , the fishermen of Lamalera ( a village perched on the southern part of Lembata island , Indonesia ) kill their prey with their bare hands .
It is all a far cry from the whaling fleets of Japan , whose factory boats and grenade harpoons wreak slaughter on an industrial scale .
The sails of the Lamalera boats are woven from gebang leaves and each vessel is hand - made , with no nails or metal parts .
Ropes are made from palm leaves and waru wood fibres , coiled together .
Scroll down for more ...
There is no other equipment - apart from the centuries - old rituals of whale - hunting passed down through the generations .
The poor , rugged and stony island has very little agriculture and the population depends on the sea , which is abundant with marlin , tuna , stingray , sea-turtles , octopus and lobster .
During Lefa Nue ( the sea season ) , from May to October , the villagers hunt whales , sharks and dolphins .
However , there are fears for the future of the community , with Koteklema hunts becoming less successful over the past five years .
Last year , the village caught only three whales .
Scroll down for more ...
The villagers blame lack of harmony between different clans for their lack of success .
" If there is no peace among us , there will be no good whaling , " said villager Anna Bataona .
Whale hunting in the Sawu Sea , west of Timor , is a tradition connected to every aspect of life in Lamalera .
The people believe in the harmony between life in the sea and the island .
Peace on the land makes for good hunting from the sea .
If a Matros ( fisherman ) sails without making peace with his brother or enemy , his boat will face problems during the hunt .
Hunts are led by the Lamafa ( boat captains ) , who purify themselves during the six - month whale hunting season by abstaining from sex .
They are also banned from sleeping during a hunting trip .
Rofinus Sanga Sulaona , 47 , is among the most skilful Lamafa .
He has killed 35 sperm whales and his presence on a hunt is considered the guarantee of a successful expedition .
His peledang ( a fishing boat that can accommodate 16 men ) , called Dolu Tene , is famous among the Lamalera hunters .
The Lamafa leaps from the boat holding a ' kefa ' ( a javelin - like bamboo pole with an iron - blade ) which he uses to pierce the whale before swimming back to collect another pole .
The fishermen work as a team , stabbing into the whale flesh and working ropes around its massive body .
The tiny boats , dwarfed by the bulk of a whale , risk being pulled under with every lurch of its huge tail .
Moving faster than a jet - ski , the whale drags the boats through the water , writhing as kefas are thrust into its flesh .
The whale blubber is at least a foot thick and it takes a great effort to reach the tender flesh underneath .
More boats from other village clans will join in the desperate effort .
Every leap onto the whale 's back could be the last for the Lamafa , as each wide swing of the tail could knock them unconscious into the foam .
It may seem a cruel way to hunt , but Lamafa Korolus says : " We have no other choice - we need Koteklema to live . "
As the life ebbs away from the whale , applause breaks out over the boats along with jubilant shouts of ' Hirkae ! '
On this occasion , the fishermen of Lamalera succeeded hunting as many whales in one day as in the whole previous year .
" It is because we took the reconciliation seriously and wholeheartedly , " says Sanga .
As a Lamafa , Sanga got the first cuts of the whale .
But instead of taking the meat to his house , he went to the house of the late Lamafa , Stefanus Beding , and gave it to his widow .
" He taught me the skills , discipline and ethics of being Lamafa , " Sanga said .
" As long as his widow lives , I will give half my share to his family . "
The rest of the cuts of meat are then distributed among the elderly and poor of the village in the belief that harmony within the community will ensure future catches .
But with disappearing whale stocks and the availability of more sophisticated harpoon technology , one wonders how long this remarkable tradition will continue .
Like almost everything the Fox News channel cooks up , The 1/2 Hour News Hour , the network 's new Daily Show - esque satirical news program , is diabolically brilliant in its sheer stupidity .
It started Feb. 18 , and has already made waves with its use of iconic right - wingers like Rush Limbaugh and Ann " Ignore - Her - and - She 'll - Go - Away " Coulter as de facto spokespeople .
The show seems like a rather wonderfully democratic spectacle that uses comedy as its own rocket grenade launcher .
It seems
Fox is attempting to attack the left with the weapons the left itself created .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Much to my pain - for - pleasure chagrin , Fox News has yet to traverse the 49th and make itself available here , but The 1/2 Hour News Hour is , thankfully , available on YouTube and at Political Humor .
Though the use of The Daily Show 's wildly popular format comes as an affront to lefty - fans of Jon Stewart 's brilliant nightly broadcast , one can hardly fault Fox 's logic .
Politics , particularly the hard - right , grumpy - old - man - politics of Fox News , is a hard sell to young people .
Every post -X Generation has grown more and more attached to irony , sarcasm and mockery to the point that it 's become the default language .
We 've all heard the startling fact that most college - aged kids get their news from Stewart or Stephen Colbert 's Colbert Report , but the crutch of irony goes deeper : at its most harmless , it 's a " Jesus is my Homeboy " t- shirt or a Hello Kitty vibrator ; at its worst , its an entire generation unable to look sincerity in the face .
Ironic potato chip generation
The folks at Fox News may be moronic , but they ain't stupid .
They 've looked at a young generation to whom even potato chips must be sold with eyes rolled , and have adjusted their language accordingly .
The kids do n't want O'Reilly preaching hellfire and brimstone .
They want smug , in - jokey , whip - crackers poking deserved fun at admittedly ripe targets like Hillary Clinton , self - righteous hippies and liberal Hollywood .
The Fox take on fake news is much what you 'd expect .
Created by 24 mastermind Joel Surnow ( recently under fire for that show 's starkly pro-torture messages ) , it unabashedly apes elements of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report , practically setting itself up for failure by inviting comparisons to the two smartest shows on TV .
The 1/2 Hour News Hour features two anchors , Jennifer Lange and Kent McNally ( Jenn Robertson and Kurt Long ) who deliver fake news stories that target the sacred cows of the left ( a joke about Cindy Sheehan going on a shooting spree anyone ? ) in their smarmiest fake - anchor tones .
On the opening night , a sketch featuring Coulter and Limbaugh portrayed Rush the rotund radio mouthpiece as he gave a victory speech after wining the 2009 presidential election , wresting the country from the hands of a mentally - ill Howard Dean .
Who owns humour ?
The premise is funny , but boy howdy , the jokes are not , despite how high the producers turn up the canned laughter .
You know you 're in trouble when Ann Coulter , who apparently still thinks fag jokes are funny , gets in the best line as Limbaugh 's victorious Veep .
( " Invade their countries , kill their leaders , and convert them to Christianity " says Coulter of her nation 's enemies , suggesting she either did n't know she was on a satirical show , or that her whole persona is a performance art piece so wickedly dark it kind of blows one 's mind . )
For those of us who thought the rest of Fox News was supposed to be comedy , the failure of The 1/2 Hour News Hour was expected -- many of us may have felt that satire belonged to the oppressed , that it was the domain of the leftist intelligentsia , or at the very least that its purpose was to speak truth to power .
And given that Fox tends to shill for the current administration , satire seems damn near impossible .
Many of us forget that there have been acclaimed and popular right - wing satirists ( P.J. O Rourke and Tom Wolfe writing for Rolling Stone in the 1980s certainly springs to mind ) , and that the Clinton administration endured some wickedly funny satire .
So it 's not that satire is the domain of the right or the left , but rather of the wit .
The 1/2 Hour News
Hour fails not because it is overtly mean - spirited ( is n't all the best humour a bit cruel ? ) , but because it 's just not that funny .
Conservative blogs like Hot Air and Right Wing News as well as liberal media like Slate and Hollywood Reporter alike seem to agree that it 's simply poorly written and not sharp enough to go toe - to - toe with The Daily Show .
Indeed , watching it , I , an admittedly left - leaning TV columnist , could n't help but feel a little sad that the adversary was not a little more worthy .
It 's possible for an opposing viewpoint to make a lefty laugh ( witness post 9 - 11 Dennis Miller , or Bill Maher , when the mood strikes ) but it has to be , well , it has to be more than a cheap Marion Barry joke .
( Yes , the first episode of The 1/2 Hour News Hour contained a Marion Barry joke .
Way to stay current , writers !
Shagadelic !
Where 's the beef ?
Wasssuppp !?)
This show ( and its as - yet uncertain future ) fails not because satire belongs to the people , but because , though some of it thought it not possible , Fox has underestimated the intelligence of its audience .

Tyee stories :
This morning on Meet The Press , Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden walks in lockstep with right - wing talking points on Iraq funding .
When asked by host Tim Russert if he would vote to cut off funding for Iraq if President Bush refuses to accept a withdrawal date , Biden moves directly to the " cutting off funding means you do n't support the troops " mentality pulled straight from the pages of the RNC playbook .
Instead of speaking the truth , that it means appropriating funds to begin a safe and smart withdrawal from the country , not abandoning out troops , Biden instead says he wo n't vote to cut off funding and chooses to chastise Democrats who support it .
It 's infuriating to say the least to see Biden falling for the White House framing -- not one single Democrat in Congress wants to leave our soldiers stranded in the middle of the desert with no food , water , ammo or protection -- and cutting off Bush 's funding would not do that -- and Senator Biden should know better .

Biden 's big push in this interview is sending MRAPS ( which should have been the vehicle of choice from the beginning ) to the troops .
The problem is , he 's willing to betray the American people and cave to President Bush and his minority party in order to get them .
This mentality is what has led to our prolonged presence in Iraq , the fatally flawed surge strategy and the deaths of hundreds of U.S. troops and countless Iraqi citizens .
Senator Biden , you can put all the protective equipment into the spending bill you want , but you then must stand firm with the troops and the American people and fight for a timetable to get them out of harm 's way and bring them home .

Use the above link to subscribe to the paid research reports , which include coverage of several smallcap companies positioned to rise during the ongoing panicky attempt to sustain an unsustainable system burdened by numerous imbalances aggravated by global village forces .
An historically unprecedented mess has been created by compromised central bankers and inept economic advisors , whose interference has irreversibly altered and damaged the world financial system .
Analysis features Gold , Crude Oil , USDollar , Treasury bonds , and inter-market dynamics with the US Economy and US Federal Reserve monetary policy .
A certain nerve has been struck a few times in recent reading on my part by the description of the USDollar as a subprime currency .
How true !!!
When a debtor has poor credit history , inadequate income , and shoddy assets , the borrower is deemed to be subprime , which means less than good , not up to snuff , of second rate standard .
The entire world is growing in its disgust for having been defrauded .
While US banking and economic leaders are smugly claiming containment of the problem , foreign officials are acting according to the opposite conclusion .
Every single denial of the problem , whether from press pundits , corporate titans , banking officials , government ministers , agency heads , trade representatives , and central bankers , has been incorrect .
My article of this June entitled � Absolute Bond Contagion � ( click here ) might have seemed like a wild - eyed universally indictment , but now we see that the contagion is spreading in almost every conceivable bond cranny on a global basis .
The contagion seems absolute in more clear fashion .
At risk next are commercial mortgages and corporate bonds in the immediate crosshairs of trouble .
Foreign banks are clearly affected in profound ways , the extent of which will have to be seen .
French , British , German , Japanese , and Chinese banks have been harmed from ingesting falsely labeled food items .
What was sold as �AAA � rated milk products was actually highly toxic acid , more suitable for cleaning automotive grease and other industrial coatings than entering delicate human digestive systems .
Heck , that milk aint even homogenized , but rather has layers of fat , scum , heavy acid , even mold .
While US - based players and coaches display a cocky swagger that all will work out just fine , that credit supply will continue endlessly , foreigners might be in the early stages of calling for a boycott of US $ - based financial assets .
It started with subprime mortgages and their incredibly flawed credit derivatives called collateralized debt obligations .
These CDO products are the wares of conmen , fraud artists , and hucksters .
The next step is for other US $ - based debt securities to face a gradual shun .
Such bonds peddled by American shell game criminals cannot be trusted by foreigners who have valuable savings .
In 1999 they were burned with overpriced tech , telecom and dotcom stocks whose values were suspect , whose forward earnings guidance was absurd , whose PE ratios were lofty .
In the case of the dotcom stocks , their value models were nonsensical , based upon eyeballs , clicks , and sticky websites , and not tried & true fundamentals .
This bond debacle fraud perpetrated upon the world is 50 to 100 times larger , in an extreme display of financial crime worthy of the description , Weapons of Mass Destruction .
The conspiracy among Wall Street , the US Federal Reserve , and Debt Rating Agencies involved the sale of asset - backed bonds which very clearly , vividly , and lethally constituted weapons that dole out mass destruction to banking systems .
The most obvious victim is the US banking system , whose problems are far from over .
GOLD SURPASSES 700 MARK
Many signals are flashing positive for gold lately .
Gigantic futures options point to professionals anticipating a substantial move up in the gold price this autumn , probably early autumn .
These bets are not placed by amateurs , and they do not stand as contrary indictors .
Here were are , only three trading past the Labor Day holiday , and gold has jumped past 700 .
The 3 - month USTreasury Bill yield remains a full 1 % below 5.25 % and the Fed Funds target .
The corporate bond yield spreads are showing distress , the B- rated yield much higher than the AAA - rated yield .
The USFed is stuck on policy .
They must address the problem of overnight bank loan rates being out of whack , where money for intra-bank loans is too expensive to meet demand .
Gold has responded also to statements made by the Euro Central Bank today , as they announced no rate hike , but stern vigilance for monitoring inflation .
In other words , they stand ready to hike soon again .
They nodded in respect to the USFed , giving their beleaguered colleagues a pass .
Gold should be viewed not so much with chart points from peaks last year .
They disturb the pattern .
In the last twelve months , two parallel trend channels are evident .
Their trendlines are clearly defined , with touch points relevant from the last twenty months .
We have a pathway for a march to new highs .
Today gold jumped past the 700 mark easily .
Hardly anyone noticed .
That is actually great news for gold investors .
Hype produces a peak price .
The public will be involved later on , like when 775 is reached .
John Hathaway has been an inspiration to me over the past few years .
In his recent work from late August � A New Chapter for Gold� ( click here ) , he points out how the weak hands have been flushed out of gold and mining stocks .
Those who abused margin are out of stock positions .
He judges the path for much higher gold price has been hewn .
He fully acknowledges that the finance sector leads the USEconomy .
Thus it is in trouble .
He highlights how the homestead is a sacred cow , now endangered .
Soon he expects home prices to be directly assisted with official policy .
He heralds the upcoming presidential election as an opportunity for easy money to be restored , which always hurts currencies and helps gold .
He regards the current distress in financial markets as an order of magnitude worse than in 1998 when the LongTerm Capital Mgmt blew up and was rescued .
He cites the troubles for gold mining firms , such as heavy government interference , worker strikes , higher costs , and more challenging ore deposits .
My past work has analyzed how the cover of hedge books diverts important funds from operations .
Money should go into producing ore and refining it to bullion .
These factors all fortify the argument that gold supply is extremely inelastic .
Higher gold prices have not resulted in higher gold output !!!
CONTAGION WILL SPREAD
The contagion is absolute .
The only varying parameter is the level of ingestion and acceptance of acidic mortgage bonds into foreign bank systems .
The Arab nations were the smart guys , since they bought none .
The Chinese were the dupes , since they bought a mountain of them , inexperienced in managing huge trade surpluses .
They will learn fast .
The Europeans , being of similar ethnic and genetic strain , having decades of trusted successful encounters with their colonialist cousins , also bought a raft of them .
In the eyes of foreigners , the con game has roots extended way back in time .
The Americans conned foreigners into buying USTreasurys back in the 1970 decade , as interest rates soared past 10 % .
There has always been a general motive to participate in the American Engine of global economic growth .
However , in the latest two rounds of pure premeditated calculated ( unprosecuted ) criminal bond peddling , the degree of the fraud is orders of magnitude greater .
No justice will be meted out .
The criminals are the henchmen to the USGovt itself , which might include the Dept of Treasury ( aka Goldman Sachs ) , the US Federal Reserve ( aka JPMorgan ) , who together control the levers like the Securities & Exchange Commission , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , and the Debt Rating Agencies .
The level of incest and collusion is suffocating .
Foreigners cannot expect to have any restoration of losses due to misrepresentation and concealed mislabeling of products .
They will resort to what they can do , stop buying bonds .
Foreigners will next reconsider the purchase and investment of other US $ - based bond securities .
That is their only recourse in pursuit of justice from a nation which has declared before the world that treaties do not apply to them , laws even from a Constitution are to be scoffed at , and world institutions are designed to exploit for US gain .
My perspective of the USGovt and USMilitary working in coordinated fashion toward a protection racket has been described .
Shadowy US agencies play a key role .
The current Administration goes so far as to boast they are capable of producing their own reality .
Well , the rest of the world can oblige with an exercise of the Third Law of Thermodynamics , that every action is met by an equal and opposite reaction .
Hegemony laced with fraud might be met by an international boycott of US $ - based bonds , hidden at first , revealed as a broad strategy later , and finally boasted as a badge of honor farther down the road .
Like the Roman Empire , the implosion is home grown .
Its similar empire collapse has causes too numerous to cite , many beyond the scope of finance .
The core source of the problem is false money , reckless management of money growth , dishonest sale of debt , compromised regulatory agencies , a central bank whose function has become to create inflation which produce bubbles .
Our central bank has corrupted the monitor of monetary effects as in statistics , and fostered economic dependence upon monetary and debt inflation .
The long - term victims of the colossal mismanagement have been both American workers and US industry .
The standard of living has been led downhill by business capital investment overseas .
Declining wages follow naturally .
The factories have been dispatched to the Pacific Rim in the 1980 decade , the Mexican corridor in the 1990 decade , and the Chinese mainland in the 2000 decade .
Something big this way comes , and to American financial and economic managers , it aint gonna taste good .
It is a reaction from Economic Mother Nature .
Abuse of the custodial role for the world reserve currency invites retribution .
The Wall Street hucksters were well aware of the foreign pipelines to recycle trade surpluses into US $ - based securities .
They exploited the situation for private gain , tapping into vast pools of legitimate savings , intentionally misleading the risk associated .
Those who believe the entire broad multi- year promotion , sale , and purchase exercise was not loaded with fraudulent intent probably believe USGovt economic statistics , believe Wall Street analyst reports , believe USFed position statements , maybe even believe the JFKennedy lone gunman theory , and believe the 911 Commission report .
The response from foreign financial organizations of diverse type will likely be a shun , a revulsion , even a boycott of many kinds of US $ - based bonds .
The first obvious US bond to be avoided has been mortgage bonds .
No longer can they be trusted , when subprime garbage was mixed in to produce banking system hairballs large enough to cause seizures .
If Wall Street insists on packaging various types of asset - backed bonds into aggregated securities , foreign investors will just say NO .
Mortgage funding will be curtailed for US home buyers .
To some extent corporate bonds will suffer from funding inadequacies , for two reasons .
They too are mixed into CDO securities .
They suffer when the USEconomy falters .
The USEconomy will falter like night follows day , with the only variable of uncertainty being the length of day .
Commercial mortgage bonds soon will be dragged down by the inevitable slowdown in the USEconomy .
Car loans and credit card finance also depend upon the same source of funding .
Notice the severe drop in foreign purchase of US corporate bonds , to nearly nil .
USTREASURYS AT RISK Lastly , the USTreasury Bonds are at risk .
The entire story of a � Flight to Quality � has been yet another desperate distortion .
To be sure , some migration has been seen from stocks to bonds , from the large cap S&P stocks to the USGovt bond securities .
The sudden move in 3 - month TBill yield well below 4.0 % a couple weeks ago , only to recover above 4.0 % , testifies to big flight into some desired haven .
My personal conjecture is that the Plunge Protection Team gave a big assist to the migration into 3 - month TBills , but misjudged the stock market�s own desire .
The result was an over - reaction .
Confirmation of the false billboard message of a supposed flight to quality can be seen in the truly pathetic lousy � Bid to Cover� for public auctions of new and recycled USTreasury debt .
Such low bid levels have not been seen in over a decade .
The public bond dealers were not in any way involved in any massive initiative to purchase USTreasury Bonds which offered supposedly safe haven !!!
In the last two years , the Asians have virtually halted USTBond purchase with recycled trade surpluses .
Broad deep and pervasive regional capital investment within Asia has paid off handsomely .
The United States could learn much from Asians about investment in businesses to serve consumer needs and to generate jobs .
In time , like the US did at the turn of the 1900 century , the Asians will learn to instill product controls through proper regulation .
Instead , the primary fostered industries in the USEconomy have been in support of the war machine .
It is ironic that the US sold China toxic bonds while China sold the US poisoned animal food and toys !
Arguments of systemic benefit from wartime dominance , emphasis , and stimulus simply deny the realities of the last few wars , all of which have helped to wreck official US financial balance sheets .
Wartime stimulus might lift the USEconomy out of recession , but they guarantee the next recession from an even weaker position with more dismantling of the manufacturing base .
A bad lesson was learned after World War II .
The exception of China , regular investors of USTBonds and more , is likely not to continue much longer .
They prefer to keep loading their sovereign investment fund in lieu of continued nobrainer USTBond and Agency bond purchases .
By this time next year , their sovereign fund should reach the $ 2000 billion mark .
They are vocal about USDollar risk as a major concern .
They are acutely angry at the brewing trade disputes , easily worsening to become a trade war .
China will be using the USTBond sale as a weapon to an increasing degree .
The have reduced USTBond investment holdings steadily since early summer .
This trend will continue .
The Persian Gulf nations have stuck with the USGovt , more out of obligation than any great fraternal love or deep cultural meld or broad economic partnership .
For commerce , Arabs and Iranians prefer to do business with Europe .
The purchase and dependence of OPEC crude oil does not constitute a vastly integrated marriage of economies .
Even that is in the process of changing .
Persian Gulf nations must react to the tight US $ peg which has opened the door to price inflation .
The foreign appetite for USTreasury Bonds is next in line to suffer an important historical backlash .
When Asians no longer roll trade surpluses into USTBonds , one major pillar is removed upon which the USTBond structure rests .
When Persian Gulf nations respond to their own inflation infection directly related to the US $ peg , with diversification being the remedy , a second major pillar is at risk of removal for the same USTBond structure .
The last pillar is but a central artery of USDollar supply flowing from a printing press pockmarked by metastasized cancer bodies .
Such a central pillar is more like a spongy channel laden with bubbles which can support no more weight than shifting sand does a house foundation .
To compound matters , when the USEconomy slows and hits the brick wall in a matter of a few weeks or few months , the USDollar will lose its attractiveness , with or without official USFed rate cuts .
Domestic US investors will flock from stocks to bonds in the usual parade .
However , foreign investors take an entirely different view .
They will expect to be required to finance ever - growing burgeoning USGovt debt .
They will regard the USEconomy as constricted from credit supply problems , stalled out home equity extractions , heavily reliant upon credit card extensions in last resort , adrift amidst a housing market in decline , and absent key factory industries .
Having more balanced economic structures with actual diverse industries , foreigners will quickly conclude the USEconomy is crippled and beyond remedy .
THEY WILL DEEM THE USDOLLAR AS A SUBPRIME CURRENCY , AND ITS OBVERSE THE USTREASURY AS A SUBPRIME BOND .
The process of downgrading US $ - based bonds has started with mortgage bonds , and will continue down the risk ladder to other bonds .
The gradual penalty for exporting debt inflation over the course of a few decades is compromised sovereignty and vulnerability to credit supply interruptions .
Far from the harmless effect of selling debt to ourselves , the accumulative effect has been to erode the US sovereignty itself , while relegating the USDollar to Third World currency status .
The most ridiculous of self - inflicted wounds have come from the current trade sanctions directed by the US Congress against the Chinese .
Imagine slapping the face of a key credit master !
The Administration , whose finance function is led by Goldman Sachs and its icon Henry Paulson , sees greater wisdom in working with the Chinese , especially when vast Wall Street IPO fees lie on the table from giant stock issuances .
So one branch of the USGovt has corrupted its decisions .
Another branch has rendered its decisions as destructive .
So two political parties offer corruption and destruction , not much choice !
USFED CORNERED LIKE A RAT
The test for USFed Chairman Ben Bernanke has come .
The Treasury Bond market is ordering him to cut official interest rates .
The stock market eagerly awaits a return to easy money , lower bond yields , and favorable earnings yields comparisons to bonds .
He seems acutely unaware of the depth of the commercial debt interruption and its guaranteed detrimental effect on US corporate production of goods and services .
The corporate finance pipeline has hit a wall .
Corporate paper , as it is called , is not well understood .
Good companies are having trouble finding adequate funds .
It reminds me of a teenager who has a large object like a toy or bone or sock lodged in his throat .
Dr Bernanke insists that the boy has not turned blue in the face yet , so no action is necessary .
This crew of USFed minions has lost its way , unable to use any compass .
With only one year under his belt , Little Ben has only a little less experience than most other Fed Governors .
This absence of basic tools renders them as more incapable than colonial explorers , blind without scouts , lost without direction , in hostile lands with natives brandishing hatchets and knifes .
Then again , recall that the USFed acts as agent for the USGovt to sell bonds .
So they harbor a little publicized vested interest in favor of recession since economic downturns favors the sale of bonds over stocks .
No longer in recent weeks has the USFed focused its commentary on price inflation .
Their endlessly analyzed verbage is more tilted toward economic risk .
Their bias has changed away from price inflation .
Committee white papers seem in crystal clear fashion to pave the way for an official rate cut .
The discount rate cut usually is prelude to an official cut .
Recall , when the USFed begins to cut rates , it does not cut only once .
A new cycle begins .
Gold will rejoice , but so will crude oil .
The same are true for silver and natural gas .
This USFed needs some cover , some excuses , to justify their next inevitable rate cut .
Gold and crude oil smell it , each priced in opposite correlation to the USDollar .
The USFed might want to permit a stock decline in the Dow and S&P500 indexes , so as to lay the responsibility on the markets .
Worse , lacking forecasting skill beyond high school mediocrity , the USFed might wait until they see the �whites of the eyes� for economic recession .
They lack any forecasting prowess , having turned away from legitimate tools , fully reliant upon doctored distorted destroyed economic statistics .
The best economic forecasters in the USGovt domain lie hidden in ignored offices and agencies , as they serve no purpose .
By the time the USEconomy shows the serious stumble the Fed & minion Governors require , the medicine they administer with lower rates will be too little , too late .
The rescue that comes from an official rate cut will offer a lift to the stock market in an immediate sense , NOT THE ECONOMY .
Much dispute has been heard over whether a lower interest rate will do much to help housing and what ails mortgage bonds .
My view is lower rates will do nothing to stop the housing bear market for another two years .
The associated mortgage bond debacle will be dictated by this decline .
Little can or will be done to help ruined home owners .
They are setting foreclosure records .
They have no vote on Wall Street .
The surprise in the next couple months , after an official interest rate cut by the cornered USFed , might be the rise in the long - term USTreasury Bond yields .
The door will be opened to systemic price inflation in a big way .
Good riddance to the inverted Treasury Yield Curve .
It served the financial markets well , in offering nothing but confusion .
Let the next chapter on gold be written .

Previous Articles by Jim Willie CB
A couple of days ago , Infinite Loop reported on a research note from Forrester Research which said that Apple 's music sales were slowing and that sales of the company 's venerable iPod were failing to drive downloads from the iTunes Store .
Two days after Forrester 's report , investment firm Piper Jaffray has released its own report saying that no , the iTunes Store is doing just fine in terms of growth .
Analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray says that through September , iTunes Store weekly sales are up 78 percent from 2005 .
Munster 's report is based on Apple company data , according to Reuters , and shows that Apple sold 695 million tracks through September , a total of 18.5 million per week .
In contrast , Forrester 's figures come from a analysis of credit and debit card purchases from the iTunes Store , made over a 26 - month period ending in June 2006 .
From April 2004 through January 2006 , Apple saw a seven - fold increase in transactions , according to Forrester , with the average transaction size growing to $ 6.69 from $ 3.55 .
Since the beginning of the year , the number of transactions has fallen by 58 percent , with the average transaction size dropping to $ 5.56 .
Only 3 percent of US Internet - using households made purchases at the iTunes Store during that period .
The bigger picture
Lurking in the background of the discussion over Apple 's music sales is the state of the online music industry itself .
When Yahoo announced it was selling a handful of non-DRMed MP3s last week , we noted that Nielsen was reporting a drop - off in online music sales .
After several quarters of steady growth , Nielsen SoundScan reported that after hitting an all - time high of 144 million tracks sold during the first quarter of 2006 , the second and third quarters saw sales of only 137 million .
Despite the growth the online music market has seen over the past couple of years , it still only accounts for a small fraction of overall music sales .
The music market as a whole has been struggling for the past several years , with sales of physical media declining even as digital sales crept upward .
The record labels have been quick to blame the decline in sales on piracy , but recent research shows that the vast majority of music found on digital music players comes either from users ' own CD collections or legal downloads , not piracy .
In fact , the IFPI found that the number of illegal music files available on P2P networks dropped almost 20 percent between April 2003 and the beginning of 2006 .
Is it time to reinvigorate the market ?
In a statement given to Reuters , Apple said that " the conclusion that iTunes sales are slowing is simply incorrect . "
Piper Jaffray 's analysis appears to support Apple assessment .
Still , the data from Forrester and Nielsen shows that there are challenges looming on the horizon for the music industry .
Despite the ability to cherry pick individual tracks from an album and the always - popular instant gratification from an online purchase , a large number of consumers remain unconvinced by the online music value proposition .
There are a few steps the music industry can take to meet the challenge of lackluster growth , all of which would arguably strengthen the music industry 's value proposition .
Rethink DRM
When the iTunes Music Store debuted , its DRM restrictions were much looser than any of the other online stores backed by the record labels .
That said , some consumers do n't like the DRM at all .
As we 've pointed out before , it ties listeners to a particular ecosystem of music stores , software , and hardware good news for Apple , but not for the rest of the industry .
Yahoo !
Music has convinced a couple of the record labels to experiment with DRM - free music that 's a good start , but the labels need to be more aggressive when it comes to rethinking DRM .
Audio quality
Let 's get one thing straight : many consumers are perfectly happy with the 128 Kbps AAC files sold through the iTunes Store .
A handful of stores , such as Napster , have begun offering tracks encoded at 192 Kbps .
But lossy is lossy , and discerning listeners want more choices when it comes to encoding .
Part of what has made the IFPI 's poster child of villainy AllofMP3.com so popular is that it lets the customer decide what format and bit rate he or she wants to purchase music in .
If the music stores would offer more choice when it comes to encoding , they would likely attract some customers who are currently content to buy CDs and rip them using a lossless encoder of their choosing .
Pricing
99 ¢ per track has evolved as the standard in the industry .
The labels would like to see that go higher , at least for some popular tracks , but the music stores have resisted .
But there is also room to go lower .
The costs associated with selling digital music downloads are much lower than that of physical media there are no warehousing and transport costs involved .
Unfortunately , those cost savings are n't passed on to consumers .
If the record industry would content itself with lower margins on each track sold , chances are good that they 'll make much if not all of that up on volume as lower prices result in increased sales .
The social
When we reviewed the new Microsoft Zune , we noted that its WiFi capability offered a lot of potential for viral marketing .
Unfortunately , the Zune does n't deliver .
Shared music " expires " in three days , even if the original track is not DRMed .
More importantly , shared music cannot be " reshared . "
Once it has migrated from one Zune to another , it 's stuck there .
Microsoft is n't the bad guy here .
The concept of sharing music between digital music players over WiFi is a good one , but the labels ' reliance on DRM and overblown fears of piracy keep the Zune 's WiFi feature from reaching its potential .
The recording industry needs to overcome these fears and make it easier for music fans to get the word out to one another about the music they love .
Get back in the barn , Chicken Little
Above all , the online music business is still young .
That means awkward fits and starts as it slowly matures , especially as it reaches those gangly junior - high years that we all remember so fondly .
Growth patterns may not look identical from quarter to quarter or year to year , but grow the market will .
Even as the iTunes Store and other music sites see sales increase , they will still remain a fraction of physical media .
The CD may be old school , but it is still the preferred format for the majority of music fans and that does n't appear about to change anytime soon .
Also keep in mind that we 're talking technology here .
When it comes to tech , early adopters often come from the geek crowd , and their usage patterns usually look quite a bit different from those of the general public .
The sky is n't falling for Apple or for the online music industry as a whole .
Online music stores face challenges as they attempt to increase sales , but downloads are poised for growth in the long term , even if those growth patterns differ radically from those of the past two or three years .
Make Your Own Produce Homemade Vibrator
When looking for a handy sex aid , many of us turn to the produce aisle for inspiration , and a dildo or masturbation toy may be as close as the refrigerator or fruit bowl .
While the humble cucumber and its comrades have served well , we ’ve stepped things up a bit to bring you some more elaborate creations .
With these you should have no trouble getting your daily five servings of fruits and vegetables .
A Note on Safety : Use common sense .
Before playing with produce , wash it thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap .
If you are inserting a produce item vaginally , we very strongly recommend covering it with a condom to prevent damage to sensitive areas , and to minimize risk of anything getting “ lost ” inside you .
Do not insert anything pointy , like a carrot .
Never , ever insert fruits or vegetables anally ; they can become lodged in the rectum or lower bowel , requiring emergency medical attention and possible surgery to remove .
If you are warming produce before use , submerging it in hot water is the preferred heating method .
Use a microwave with extreme caution ; the inside of items can become very hot and cause severe burns .
Not following these guidelines may result in injury .
We recommend using waterproof vibrators to make these toys , or wrapping the vibrator carefully in a condom or plastic wrap secured tightly with a rubber band .
Moisture seeping into a non-waterproof vibrator can cause damage to the device .
Also , we firmly believe that these homemade creations can only serve as a temporary replacement for the top rated vibrators on the market .
Classic Cucumber DIY Vibrator
The cucumber is a time - honored favorite from the refrigerator .
Here we ’ve updated it with a bullet vibrator and a celery stick clit stimulator .
Cut off the end of a cucumber and dig a hollow in it about twice as long as your bullet vibrator .
Cut a length of celery about four inches long .
About an inch from the open end of the cuke , cut a hole in the side just big enough to fit the celery .
Push the bullet vibe all the way in , then insert the celery stalk , pushing it down behind the bullet .
You ’ll feel the vibrations deep inside while the celery ridges tickle your clit .
Papaya Pussy
The super slick flesh of this fruit combines with smooth slippery seeds creating a sensation you wo n’t soon forget .
Select a ripe papaya long enough to fit your penis but small enough to hold comfortably in one hand .
Cut a hole in the round end ( not the stem end ) a little smaller than your penis .
Remove most of the pulp and loose seeds from the inside , leaving some attached to the sides to make “ ridges ” .
The papaya is ready to use at this point , but you can also add vibration .
At the stem end , cut a small hole through the meat of the papaya perpendicular to the tunnel and slide in a small bullet vibrator .
Cucumber - Melon Ball
This creation was inspired by a reader who suggested inserting a cucumber dildo into a melon base so it could be “ ridden ” .
We ’ve gone one better and added vibration and a second ridged cucumber for clit or anal stimulation .
Cut two holes in a melon a couple of inches apart .
Size the holes so that your cucumbers will fit in snugly .
Cut a few inches off the end of a cucumber , carve ridges into the surface , and hollow out the base to fit a bullet vibrator .
Cut a small notch in the base to accommodate the wire when the piece is inserted .
Fit the bullet in place and insert the cuke section into one of the holes , then push the other whole cucumber into place in the other .
This can be ridden facing either direction , with the vibrating element pressing against the clit or anal area .
English Cucumber Double Dildo
You and a friend can share your love of produce with this two - ended toy .
Select the longest English cucumber you can find .
One with a curve to it is ideal .
Near the center of the cuke , carve out two small holes in which to insert your bullet vibrators .
You can leave the vibrators sticking up a bit to nudge your clit (s ) .
We added some textured jelly cock rings for extra stimulation .
Japanese Eggplant Wand
These elegant eggplants have many advantages as a sex toy – they ’re long , smooth , slightly pliant , come in a variety of sizes , and are often gently curved .
We installed a bullet vibrator by carving out a hollow near the stem end of the eggplant .
As a clitoral tickler , we selected a frilly kale leaf .
To insert the kale , poke a hole through the eggplant with a skewer or small knife and thread the kale stem through .
A little vegetable oil “ lube ” can ease the way .
Bell Pepper - Asparagus Clit Vibe
In general , it ’s best to stay away from peppers when making sex toys from food , but we made an exception for this sweet red bell pepper .
To make this toy , carefully cut the bell pepper on the diagonal so that the “ bump ” inside below the stem remains intact .
Remove all seeds and trim the inner membranes around the protuberance .
With a corer or knife , cut around the stem and remove it , leaving the rest of the cap intact .
Carve out a hollow where the stem was and insert a bullet vibe .
For an optional anal tickler , cut a small hole below the vibrator and insert a sturdy stalk of asparagus with a base wider than the tip .
The asparagus can rest against the anal area .
We do n’t suggest inserting it , but if you do , cover the entire toy with a condom in case the stalk breaks .
One Potato , Two Potato
This hefty yam promises to be mighty filling , while a small potato serves as a side dish .
Cut an inch or two off the end of a yam or sweet potato .
If the other end is pointy , carve it down and round it off .
Use an apple corer to remove flesh from the inside of the yam , carving out a hole long enough and wide enough to insert a slim vibrator .
This dual vibrator had an attached bullet , so we slipped that into a small Yukon Gold potato , also cored out .
Pass the butter !
Zucchini - Carrot Combo
Zucchinis are a favorite alternative to the classic cucumber dildo .
Here we ’ve added some baby carrots for clit and G - spot stimulation .
Cut a couple of inches off the end of a zucchini , carefully hollow it out , and insert a slim vibrator .
Near the base of the zuke , make some small circular holes 1 / 4 to 1/2 inch in diameter .
Cut off short lengths of baby carrots and insert into the holes .
Adjust the height of the bumps depending on how wild a ride you want .
Starfruit Passion
This tropical fruit is just the right size and shape for an exotic sex toy .
Select a starfruit that is underripe and firm .
Cut a small hole in the stem end and hollow out a cavity just big enough for a bullet vibrator .
Insert the bullet ( if it ’s not waterproof , you may need to cover it with plastic wrap to protect it from the juice ) .
The starfruit ’s ridges are perfect for gliding along your clit , and produce unique sensations when inserted .

July 11 is Flanders Day .
The date refers to the day in 1302 when an army of Flemish burghers defeated a superior army of French knights by driving them into a swamp .
Historically the term Flanders refers to the mediaeval county of Flanders centered around the town of Brugge ( Bruges in French ) .
Today , the term Flanders is used in a broader sense , referring to the Dutch - speaking part of contemporary Belgium i.e. the historical counties of Flanders , Brabant and Loon .
Brussels , the historical capital of Brabant , is currently the capital of Europe , Belgium and Flanders ( in its contemporary , broad sense ) .
Most Americans do not know that they owe a lot to the freedom - loving Flemings .
A significant portion of the roots of American democracy can be found in the mediaeval Flemish towns of Brugge and Ghent and in the Brabant towns of Brussels and Antwerp .
To find these roots we must return to the early Middle Ages , the period following the disintegration of Charlemagne ’s empire .
Ironically , the European Union claims to go back to the same roots .
Indeed , part of the original mystique of the movement for European unification can be found in the name that was given to the Brussels building which for almost 50 years has housed the European Council of Ministers .
The building is called the Charlemagne Building .
Charlemagne , king of the Germanic tribe of the Franks , was crowned Emperor of the West in 800 AD .
He was the first ruler France and Germany ever had in common .
His son Louis the Pious was the last .
His grandsons , Charles the Bald and Louis the German , became the first kings of respectively France and Germany when in 843 at Verdun the Carolingian empire was divided and the kingdoms of France ( the West - Frankish kingdom ) and of an entity encompassing present - day Germany ( the East - Frankish kingdom ) were established .
Charlemagne is considered the father of the political unification of Europe just as he is considered the father of both France and Germany , the two nations whose alliance constitutes the political backbone of the process for European unification after the Second World War .
The territory of the original six member - states of the European Economic Community ( France , Germany , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxemburg ) was an almost exact copy of this Carolingian Empire .
Only Switzerland was missing .
But Charles the Bald and Louis the German were not the only grandsons of Charlemagne .
They had a brother , Lothar , who inherited the imperial crown and the lands lying between France and Germany – the Middle - Frankish kingdom .
This Kingdom of the Middle was named after him : Lotharii Regnum or Lorraine .
Lothar ’s realm comprised all the countries lying between France and Germany today ( the three Benelux - nations plus Switzerland ) as well as the Eastern part of present - day France and the Western part of contemporary Germany plus the northern half of Italy .
When Lothar ’s son died without offspring in 875 the middle territories were divided between Charles the Bald and Louis the German .
However , as these regions lay on the periphery of their heartlands generations of kings of France and emperors of the so - called “ Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation ” trying to consolidate their powers were never able to establish a firm rule over them .
The result was that throughout the Middle Ages , and for some of them up to the 18th century and even today , the lands of the ancient middle part of Charlemagne ’s empire were made up of virtually self - governing republics of farmers ( as in Switzerland ) , independent countries controlled by burghers ( as in the Netherlands and along the Rhine ) or city republics ( as in the North of Italy ) .
Virtually self - governing , with little interference from greedy princes , their tax collectors and meddling civil servants , these lands became very prosperous .
Capitalism originated here .
This whole axis from Amsterdam in the north to Siena in the south evolved into the economic spine of continental Europe .
During the course of history in some of these middle regions ( notably in the Netherlands in the Burgundian era and at the time of the United Dutch Republic , and in Switzerland ) these small , independent states merged gradually into federations where the constituting parts and the individual citizens retained a large degree of autonomy .
In these regions sophisticated political theories were devised which ensured that the Prince or the government did not embody the highest authority and were accountable to the Law .
Switzerland has been a republic since the 13th century and the Netherlands was a republic from the 16th to the 18th century .
The Burgundian Netherlands had a Prince , but whenever he wanted to raise taxes this prince , the Duke of Burgundy , had to ask the 17 counties of the Federation ( and in the most prosperous of these counties , like Flanders and Brabant , even the different cities ) for permission .
The former Carolingian Middle Lands saw not only the birth of capitalism but also of limited government .
Historically , the formation of the Dutch nation started at the end of the 14th century when the Dukes of Burgundy through a series of marriages united 17 hitherto independent territories in the delta of the Rhine , Maas ( Meuse ) and Scheldt rivers , that were commonly referred to as the Nederlanden in Dutch ( literally : the Low Countries ) or the Provinciae Belgicae in Latin .
This area comprised contemporary Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxemburg as well as a part of northern France .
Because these 17 provinces were situated on the periphery of the two kingdoms that they nominally belonged to ( i.e. the Kingdom of France for Flanders and Artois , and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation for the other 15 counties and duchies ) they became a cluster of very prosperous and virtually independent city states where neither the overlord ( the King of France or the Emperor ) nor the feudal lord of the various counties and duchies had much to say .
The burghers of towns like Brugge , Ghent , Antwerp , Brussels , Leuven , Mechelen , Breda , Middelburg , Rotterdam and Amsterdam ruled themselves .
Very soon a republican tradition developed , where the nominal lord was tolerated only so long as he did not harm the interests of the cities , allowed them to rule themselves , and respected the charters and liberties which his predecessors had granted .
The Privilege of the Burghers
As early as the beginning of the 12th century , the citizens of Flanders had already formulated the principle that they were entitled to depose their Prince if the latter did not fulfil his duties towards the people .
When in February 1128 Count William Clito of Flanders , son of Duke Robert Curthose of Normandy and grandson of William the Conqueror of England , introduced a new tax , despite an earlier promise not to , the Flemish cities rebelled .
The burghers demanded that the Count be brought before an independent court , consisting of “ barons from both parties and responsible men from the clergy and the people , ” to decide whether or not the Count had broken his promise and , if so , to depose him .
Instead of recognizing that the Prince had been appointed by God the Flemings insisted that he , too , was subject to the law and , if he did not accept this , he would be removed by an impartial court .
The Count objected and raised an army to teach his subjects a lesson , but he was defeated and killed in a battle with the Ghent militia in July 1128 whereupon the nobles and cities of Flanders convened to choose themselves another count from a different family .
When the King of France , the overlord of the County of Flanders , tried to interfere the city of Brugge issued a proclamation , stating quite bluntly : “ Let it be known to everyone [ … ] that the King of France has nothing to do with the appointment or election of a Count of Flanders . [ … ]
This is the privilege of the nobles and burghers of this land . ”
During the following three centuries various Kings of France tried to meddle with Flemish affairs but never succeeded in establishing a permanent hold on the richest county of their kingdom .
From Brugge and Ghent the new principle of “ government by consent ” and under the Rule of Law spread into neighbouring Antwerp , Brussels and other Brabant cities and towns .
From 1356 onwards every new Duke of Brabant , upon his accession , had to take a solemn vow , the so - called Joyful Entry .
In this vow the prince promised to respect the liberties of the citizens and formally acknowledged that they had a right to rebel and “ separate ” from him if he did not do so .
By the time the Dukes of Burgundy became lords of the various Low Countries it was an accepted principle in all the 17 provinces that the prince succeeded as Lord of the Netherlands only at the moment that he took this vow .
When in the middle of the 16th century the direct descendant of the Burgundians , the Habsburg King Philip II of Spain , tried to introduce Spanish absolutism in the Netherlands , the Dutch states rebelled .
Their States - General convened in The Hague on 26 July 1581 where they issued the Plakkaat van Verlatinge ( Statement of Separation ) to justify their secession from Spain .
“ It is common knowledge that [ … ] the sovereign is there to serve his subjects , without whom he would not be sovereign , ” the document stated .
When the sovereign violates the rights of the people “ he must be regarded not as a sovereign but as a tyrant .
Then his subjects may freely choose no longer to acknowledge him as their sovereign – especially after the States of the land have taken counsel together – but to separate from him and in place of him to choose another to be their sovereign and to protect their safety . ”
The Dutch provinces decided to establish a confederation of sovereign republics .
This new state , inhabited by Catholics as well as Calvinist Protestants , issued a proclamation of religious tolerance ( the so - called Pacification of Ghent ) and vested supreme authority in representatives whose mandate was provisional and temporary .
The military leadership was assigned to a Stadholder ( literally : a defender of the city ) , Prince William “ the Taciturn ” of Orange .
Eventually , however , Spanish troops succeeded in reconquering 10 of the 17 provinces .
The fall of Antwerp in 1585 marked the end of independence in the southern provinces but the Spanish troops were unable to subdue the lands further to the North because the Dutch had flooded the estuary of the Maas and Rhine , thus creating a barrier of water against the Spanish .
After the Spanish conquest of the South more than ten percent of the population of southern provinces such as Flanders and Brabant fled to the North and resettled in and around Amsterdam and other towns in Holland and Zeeland .
The population of Antwerp fell from 84,000 in 1583 to 42,000 in 1589 ; Ghent from 45,000 to 22,000 ; Brugge from 35,000 to 17,000 ; Mechelen from 30,000 to 10,000 .
In the North , Amsterdam boomed from 30,000 to 60,000 ; Haarlem from 16,000 to 40,000 ; Middelburg from 10,000 to 30,000 ; Leiden from 13,000 to 26,000 .
Crossing the Atlantic
While the southern ( Spanish ) Netherlands remained under foreign rule and became a colony first of the Spanish Habsburgs , later of their Austrian relatives , the confederation of the seven northern provinces – the Confoederatio Belgica or United Dutch Republic – became a global power .
It established its own colonies all over the world , from America to South Africa , the Far East and Japan .
The Dutch colonists took their political ideas along with them , also to Nova Belgica , New Netherland , with its capital Nieuw - Amsterdam , known today as New York .
It was a 30 - year old adventurer from Amsterdam , Arnout Vogels , who in 1610 became the first fur trader along the Hudson river .
Vogels was born in Antwerp and had fled Brabant with his parents after the Spanish conquest .
In 1624 Nieuw - Amsterdam was founded by the West India Company , a Dutch trading company established by Willem Usselincx , an Antwerp businessman who had also fled to Amsterdam in 1585 .
According to Russell Shorto in his 2004 bestselling history of Manhattan , The Island at the Centre of the World , the Dutch gave America its cosmopolitan outlook and shaped it into the open and democratic society it is today .
The democratic traditions of the Netherlands were brought to America by Adriaen van der Donck , a lawyer from Brabant .
There is a direct historical line linking Brugge to Antwerp , Antwerp to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to New York .
The “ centre of the world , ” as a beacon of self - governing democracy and liberty where capitalism originated , evolved along this line .
Brugge was the Manhattan of the 13th century , as Antwerp was the Manhattan of the 16th century and Amsterdam that of the 17th century .
Likewise Antwerp was the Brugge of the 16th century , Amsterdam that of the 17th , and New York that of the 20th century .
A number of typically American things such as cookie ( koekje ) , dollar ( daalder ) and Santa Claus ( Sinterklaas ) have a Dutch origin which dates back to mediaeval Flanders .
The same is true for the concept that free trade liberates people and that political and economic freedom are indivisible .
Professor Stephen E. Lucas of the University of Wisconsin at Madison writes in “ The Plakkaat van Verlatinge : A Neglected Model for the American Declaration of Independence ” ( his contribution to Hofte , R. , and H. Kardux , eds .
The Netherlands in Five Centuries of Transatlantic Exchange .
Amsterdam : VU Press , 1994 ) that the text of the Declaration of Independence issued by the American Continental Congress on 4 July 1776 was clearly modelled on the 1581 Dutch Plakkaat van Verlatinge .
The American Declaration stated : “ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that [ … ] whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends [ i.e. to secure the liberties of the people ] it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness . ”
This is exactly what the Flemings had said in 1128 when they deposed Count William Clito of Flanders and the burghers of Brugge declared that “ the appointment or election of a Count of Flanders [ … ] is the privilege of the nobles and burghers of this land . ”
Here ?s CNN?s " Situation Room " coverage of Bush ?s scripted " chat " with our troops where they " pulled back the curtain " and showed the troops being drilled by a Pentagon hack .
It ?s painful to see the troops themselves being used for propaganda purposes such as this .
Notice also Scott McClellan evading and spinning around the journalist 's question and shifting the blame onto the troops .
What an absolute prick .
Metric Preview Below are five digital Apollo 15 metric frames that represent a preview of what is to come in the Apollo Image Archive ; a joint project between NASA 's Johnson Space Center , Arizona State University , and the Lunar Planetary Institute .
The Apollo Mapping ( or Metric ) camera flew on three missions , Apollos 15 , 16 , and 17 .
It was housed in the Service Module SIM Bay and was commanded to take image sequences , usually in tandem with the Panoramic Camera .
An excellent overview on the Apollo imaging systems is available in the NASA publication " Apollo Over the Moon " by Masursky , Colton , and El - Baz ( NASA SP 362 , 1978 ) .
Each metric frame is scanned using a Leica DSW 700 photogrammetric scanner , which obtains a 200 pix / mm ( 5 micron pixels ) spatial resolution and 14 - bit A/D ( 16,384 shades of grey ) .
The DSW 700 was modfied from the original 12 - bit A/D to a 14 - bit A/D because the Moon is a very contrasty target and the original film is capable of capturing a very wide range of grey scale variation .
The combination of small pixels ( 5 micron ) and the 14 - bit gray scale results in a very detailed scan and very large raw scan files ( 1.3 Gbytes ) .
To make the images accessible over the Internet to a wide audience , we deployed a web interface that allows the user to rapidly preview each image at high resolution ( using the Flash based program Zoomify ) .
We also present several PNG files at decreasing resolution for download in addition to a map projected view and the original RAW scan .
Due to the logarithmic response of film to variations in brightness the raw scans appear very contrasty .
Photographic paper also has a logarithmic response and in effect reverses the films response , thus a conventional paper print has a natural contrast range .
All the processed frames presented here have had a logarithmic correction applied , thus simulating the natural contrast of a conventional paper print ; one can think of the processed images as " virtual prints " .
For each scan there are 6 download options .
The Original raw scan is just that - nothing has been done to those data .
They are stored as 16 - bit tiff files and are very large ( 1.3 Gbytes ) .
The processed files have been log corrected ( virtual prints ) and converted to 8 - bit values .
The " Large PNG " has been reduced in resolution by the square root of two ( 1.4142x ) , the " Medium PNG " by a factor of 2.8x , and the small PNG by a factor of 5.7 x .
The final two files are map projected versions at 10 m / p ( ISIS format and PNG format )
What is the resolution of each image ?
We can easily calculate the size of a pixel projected on the surface .
For instance the frame AS15 - M- 0081 has a pixel size of 6.2 meters ( 20.3 feet ) at the center of the image in the raw scan .
The large PNG file has been reduced by 1.414x , thus its center pixel resolution is 8.8 meters ( 28.9 ft ) .
But what do these resolutions really mean ?
A seemingly simple question that is really quite complicated .
The angular size of a pixel is important in terms of resolution , but so are other factors .
In the case of the Metric films the spatial resolution is limited by the grain of the film and how well the image is exposed .
For example in very bright regions the film may saturated thus lowering the effective resolution in that region of the image .
Likewise in vary dark regions the image may appear noisy and thus the effective resolution is lower .
The focus of the scanner itself also has an effect of the true resolution of the scan .
Though the Leica DSW 700 Scanner is of very high quality it is certainly not perfect .
Keep in mind that understanding the the true resolution of an image can indeed be complicated .
We have scanned the film to capture what we believe is the full spatial resolution of the film , probably scanning a little beyond the true resolution of the film .
So the large PNG that has been subsampled by 1.414 x from the raw scan may be close to the actual resolution of the film .
Keep in mind that as the image is reduced in resolution the sharpness of the image is increased by an effective gain in the signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) of the digital file .
For each image we report the angular resolution of the pixel projected on the surface ( assuming a spherical Moon ) .

OTTAWA–Canadians are being gouged at the gas pumps , paying in excess of 15 cents a litre more for gasoline than justified by costs and historic petroleum industry profit margins , says a report being released today by a think - tank .
The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives says it examined gasoline prices before and after Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005 and found that the rules of the game for pricing gasoline at the pump had changed overnight .
Hugh Mackenzie , an economist and researcher with the group , said there has always been an " unexplained differential " between what consumers pay at the pump and what they would be paying if the industry tied prices to costs and traditional profit margins .
" Up to the point of August 2005 , what you saw was a normal pricing pattern where the unexplained price would fluctuate between the positive and negative , " Mackenzie said .
" But after the fall of 2005 , there 's a marked change and the price differential became mostly on the positive side and grew .
" Frankly , I think in Canada there was psychological barrier of $ 1 a litre , and the industry probably felt there would be real consumer resistance to pushing prices beyond that .
What they discovered is that the market will in fact bear going well north of $ 1 a litre and they took advantage . "
The overcharge at the pump ranges from 15 cents a litre in Toronto to as much as 27 cents a litre in Vancouver , the report says .
Mackenzie argues that events such as Katrina and the recent disruptions at oil refineries may give producers an excuse to raise prices , but they cannot justify the hefty increases on the basis of costs .
" The crude oil that ends up in our tanks today does n't cost one cent more to produce today than it did in 2001 when the pump price was less than 60 cents a litre , " the report says .
" And the windfall for Canadian producers amounts to $ 1.7 million every day for every dollar the price of crude goes up . "
As evidence for the claim , the report attempts to gauge the relationship between crude oil prices and gasoline prices at the pump .
At current exchange rates , it calculates , a $ 1.25 ( U.S. ) per barrel increase should result in an increase of one Canadian cent per litre .
But in September 2005 , when crude oil prices increased by $ 10 ( U.S. ) a barrel , gasoline prices more than doubled , and at one point increased fivefold , above what the crude oil price justified .
" I think the facts speak for themselves , " he said .
Tony Macerollo of the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute , which represents major Canadian refiners , said he " categorically rejected " the argument .
While he conceded industry profit margins have increased , he said there were a number of reasons for the current high prices , including increased demand , speculation and the fact many North American oil refineries postponed upgrades in the wake of Katrina .
" We may still be experiencing some catch up . "
But Liberal MP
Dan McTeague said the report merely confirms what most Canadians instinctively know , that oil companies are reaping profits on the backs of consumers who have no choice but to pay .
" Frankly , it does n't matter , " McTeague said .
" If a group of people want to push the price of gasoline beyond what is realistic , there 's no one in Canada there to stop them . "
The MP says competition in the oil industry is an illusion .
The four major distributors in Canada each set the price in the region they control and the others follow , he said .
" You have a classic oligopoly and it 's important for Ottawa to get its collective head out of the sand because it is responsible for our flawed Competition Act . "

The Competition Bureau has conducted several investigations into allegations of price collusion but has cleared the industry of wrongdoing .
McTeague , who has sought amendments to the act , said the government should also look into establishing an independent body that could monitor and analyze gasoline price increases so that Canadians will know whether they are justified .

Storm Outbreak : Building A Bigger , Better Botnet
The outbreak that washed across the Internet on Thursday died down Friday morning , but not before hackers added thousands of newly infected computers to their botnet .
The new Storm worm outbreak that buffeted the Internet with malware - laden spam on Thursday slowed down early Friday morning .
The massive spam campaign died off in the early morning hours , according to Adam Swidler , a senior manager with Postini .
The security company had reported the day before that the new Storm variant drove Thursday 's virus level to 60 times the average .
At the same time , the Internet Storm Center reported detecting at least 20,000 infections , while the Security Response Team at Symantec said they received several hundred thousand reports of the malicious e-mail making the rounds .
That all changed on Friday morning when the attack went quiet .
" Typically , we see a burst in the initial attack from the folks who control the botnets that are sending out the spam , " Swidler said in an interview .
" I 'm not surprised it died down so quickly . "
The spam messages carried a variant of the virulent Storm worm that plagued the Internet in January .
In that initial malware attack , the malicious code was in an executable attachment in the e-mail .
This time it 's disguised in an encrypted zip file and the password is embedded in an image in the body of the e-mail .
Encrypting the malicious code makes it much more difficult for anti-virus programs to catch it , and if they can't catch it , they can't stop it .
If a user opens the file , his machine is infected with the malware and it then connects to a peer - to - peer network where it can upload data , including personal information from the infected computer .
It also can download additional malware onto the infected system .
The fact that infected computers connect through a peer - to - peer system and not to a standalone server or even a node makes it extremely hard to shut down .
" We traditionally can shut down the IRC server or whatever controls it , " said Johannes Ullrich , chief research officer at the SANS Institute and chief technology officer for the Internet Storm Center .
" But with this , there is no single server or node to shut down .
To deal with this , you 'd have to shut down those 20,000 infected hosts .
We would have to walk up to every single one of them and pull the plug . "
Paul Henry , VP of technology evangelism with Secure Computing , said in an interview that this latest Storm attack was aimed at building out the hackers ' botnet .
" The whole end game is building a bigger , better botnet , " he said in an interview .
" It 's whole purpose is to create a money - printing engine for the bad guys .
They get all these [ infected machines ] under control so they can rent them out as a botnet that can send spam . "

The groupthink syndrome : Review of the major symptoms
In order to test generalization about the conditions that increase the chances of groupthink , we must operationalize the concept of groupthink by describing the symptoms to which it refers .
Eight main symptoms run through the case studies of historic fiascoes .
Each symptom can be identified by a variety of indicators , derived from historical records , observer 's accounts of conversations , and participants ' memoirs .
The eight symptoms of groupthink are :
1. an illusion of invulnerability , shared by most or all the members , which creates excessive optimism and encourages taking extreme risks ;
2. collective efforts to rationalize in order to discount warnings which might lead the members to reconsider their assumptions before they recommit themselves to their past policy decisions ;
3. an unquestioned belief in the group 's inherent morality , inclining the members to ignore the ethical or moral consequences of their decisions ;
4. stereotyped views of enemy leaders as too evil to warrant genuine attempts to negotiate , or as too weak and stupid to counter whatever risky attempts are made to defeat their purposes ;
5. direct pressure on any member who expresses strong arguments against any of the group 's stereotypes , illusions , or commitments , making clear that this type of dissent is contrary to what is expected of all loyal members ;
6. self - censorship of deviations from the apparent group consensus , reflecting each member 's inclination to minimize to himself the importance of his doubts and counterarguments ;
7. a shared illusion of unanimity concerning judgments conforming to the majority view ( partly resulting from self - censorship of deviations , augmented by the false assumption that silence means consent ) ;
8. the emergence of self - appointed mindguards - members who protect the group from adverse information that might shatter their shared complacency about the effectiveness and morality of their decisions .
When a policy - making group displays most or all of these symptoms , the members perform their collective tasks ineffectively and are likely to fail to attain their collective objectives .
Although concurrence - seeking may contribute to maintaining morale after a defeat and to muddling through a crisis when prospects for a successful outcome look bleak , these positive effects are generally outweighed by the poor quality of the group 's decision - making .
My assumption is that the more frequently a group displays the symptoms , the worse will be the quality of its decisions .
Even when some symptoms are absent , the others may be so pronounced that we can predict all the unfortunate consequences of groupthink .
[...]
Psychological functions of the eight symptoms
Concurrence - seeking and the various symptoms of groupthink to which it gives rise can be best understood as a mutual effort among the members of a group to maintain self - esteem , especially when they share responsibility for making vital decisions that pose threats of social disapproval and self - disapproval .
The eight symptoms of groupthink form a coherent pattern if viewed in the context of this explanatory hypothesis .
The symptoms may function in somewhat different ways to produce the same result .
A shared illusion of invulnerability and shared rationalizations can counteract unnerving feelings of personal inadequacy and pessimism about finding an adequate solution during a crisis .
Even during noncrisis periods , whenever the members foresee great gains from taking a socially disapproved or unethical course of action , they seek some way of disregarding the threat of being found out and welcome the optimistic views of the members who argue for the attractive but risky course of action .
( 4 ) At such times , as well as during distressing crises , if the threat of failure is salient , the members are likely to convey to each other the attitude that " we need n't worry , everything will go our way . "
By pooling their intellectual resources to develop rationalizations , the members build up each other 's confidence and feel reassured about unfamiliar risks , which , if taken seriously , would be dealt with by applying standard operating procedures to obtain additional information and to carry out careful planning .
The member 's firm belief in the inherent morality of their group and their use of undifferentiated negative stereotypes of opponents enable them to minimize decision conflicts between ethical values and expediency , especially when they are inclined to resort to violence .
The shared belief that " we are a wise and good group " inclines them to use group concurrence as a major criterion to judge the morality as well as the efficacy of any policy under discussion .
" Since our group 's objectives are good , " the members feel , " any means we decide to use must be good . "
This shared assumption helps the members avoid feelings of shame or guilt about decisions that may violate their personal code of ethical behavior .
Negative stereotypes of the enemy enhance their sense of moral righteousness as well as their pride in the lofty mission of the in - group .

Trouble for greenhouse skeptics in the latest Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences :
Observations show both a pronounced increase in ocean heat content ( OHC ) over the second half of the 20th century and substantial OHC variability on interannual - to - decadal time scales .
Although climate models are able to simulate overall changes in OHC , they are generally thought to underestimate the amplitude of OHC variability .
Using simulations of 20th century climate performed with 13 numerical models , we demonstrate that the apparent discrepancy between modeled and observed variability is largely explained by accounting for changes in observational coverage and instrumentation and by including the effects of volcanic eruptions .
Our work does not support the recent claim that the 0 - to 700 -m layer of the global ocean experienced a substantial OHC decrease over the 2003 to 2005 time period .
We show that the 2003 –2005 cooling is largely an artifact of a systematic change in the observing system , with the deployment of Argo floats reducing a warm bias in the original observing system .
Forecasters predict heavy drinking at TCSDaily and the American Spectator .
The froofaraw stems from a 2006 paper by John Lyman and colleagues in Geophysical Research Letters claiming that sea surface waters grew cooler between 2003 and 2006 .
Gavin Schmidt noted in April that the authors corrected their paper to account for the probability that a large - scale change in the sampling method could entirely explain the anomalous cooling , and this week ’s paper confirms that .
In a commentary on the Lyman work linked enthusiastically by rightwing bloggers the skeptic / contrarian researcher Roger Pielke wrote :
If the ocean absorbs most of the heat ( which Climate Science agrees with ) , than that is the climate metric that should be reported on with respect to global warming , rather than the global average surface temperature trend data .
Indeed .
Like creationists , greenhouse doubters really need to stay away from testable predictions .
While the natural human fascination with gossip and backbiting among our rulers guarantees media coverage and best - seller status for George Tenet ’s new memoir , the former CIA director cannot achieve absolution in print or on television .
His clumsy attempts to shift the blame to Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and their rebuttals are titillating but ultimately pointless .
He is right about them , of course , but they are right about him , too .
History will absolve none of them .
With thousands of Americans and Iraqis dead and national honor permanently tarnished , there is more than enough blame to go around .
As a group of former intelligence officers observed in a letter they sent to Tenet upon the publication of “ At the Center of the Storm : My Years at the CIA , ” his outrage over the misleading propaganda that led to the war is belated and utterly self - serving .
During the critical months between September 2002 and March 2003 , in the midst of that White House campaign , he was nothing but the useful tool of those he now criticizes .
From the beginning , Tenet knew that his colleagues in the White House and the National Security Council were concocting a case for war that went far beyond any reliable intelligence about Saddam Hussein ’s arsenal and intentions .
He knew that his best field officers and most competent analysts did n’t believe the warnings about an Iraqi “ mushroom cloud . ”
He also knew that they had no convincing evidence of ties between Saddam and al - Qaida .
Yet while Cheney and Rice lied dramatically on national television , persuading the majority of Americans that Iraq was indeed behind the 9/11 attacks , Tenet maintained a discreet silence — except when he was enabling them .
Now , however , Tenet hopes to be seen as the truth - teller among those prevaricators .
Promoting his book on “ 60 Minutes ” on Sunday evening , he vehemently denounced the White House spinning of 9/11 to justify the war .
At one point , CBS correspondent Scott Pelley suggested that he should have pushed back harder against that spin , reading from a speech in which the president warned that “ we need to think about Saddam Hussein using al - Qaida to do his dirty work . ”
Pelley then asked : “ Is that what you [ were ] telling the president ? ”
The former CIA chief replied indignantly .
No , he said , “ we did n’t believe al - Qaida was going to do Saddam Hussein ’s dirty work . ”
Why , then , did he emphasize the alleged connections between al - Qaida and Iraq when he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in February 2003 ?
The answer is that he knew what the White House wanted , and he delivered the message that helped to sell the war .
Tenet played the stooge over and over again during those months .
In October 2002 , he signed the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq , a fatally skewed assessment of the dangers posed by that ruined country .
In January 2003 , he let the White House pretend that Iraq was seeking to obtain uranium from Africa .
And in February 2003 , as Secretary of State Colin Powell presented a series of bogus assertions to the United Nations and forever disgraced himself and his country , Tenet sat behind him in silent , nodding confirmation of those falsehoods .
Perhaps the most pitiful argument mustered by Tenet to defend himself today is his attempt to rebut the “ slam - dunk ” anecdote .
President Bush and other members of the administration have said that the CIA director assured them the intelligence proving the existence of Saddam ’s terrible arsenal was unassailable .
He whines that his basketball cliche has been misinterpreted , because he was only promising the president that a strong argument could be made , not that the information itself was perfect .
More plausibly , he also notes that the decision to invade had been reached long before that little warmongering pep rally in the Oval Office .
But so what ?
Tenet sat and listened as the president told us , untruthfully , that no such decision had been made — and that war would only be waged as a “ last resort . ”
He does n’t deny encouraging Bush ’s war salesmanship , even though he doubted the wisdom of that policy and the process that had led to it .
His fitful protests against the worst lies uttered by Cheney and Rice had no effect because he refused to risk his own position on behalf of truth .
Bleating about his damaged reputation , Tenet sounds much like Powell , whose loyalty to the president overruled duty to the country .
Tenet got a medal and a multimillion - dollar book contract , but he forfeited his honor , and that can not be retrieved .

Dedicated to everything from architecture to sports medicine , “ career academies ” claim to offer high school kids focus , relevancy , and solid job prospects .
Now add a new kind of program to the list : homeland security high .
In late August , Maryland ’s Joppatowne High School became the first school in the country dedicated to churning out would - be Jack Bauers .
The 75 students in the Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness magnet program will study cybersecurity and geospatial intelligence , respond to mock terror attacks , and receive limited security clearances at the nearby Army chemical warfare lab .
The new school is funded and guided by a slew of federal , state , and local agencies , not to mention several defense firms .
Officials say it will teach kids to understand the “ new reality , ” though they hasten to add that the school is n’t focused just on terrorism .
School administrators , channeling Cheneyesque secrecy , refused to be interviewed for this story .
But it ’s no secret that the program is seen as a model for the rest of the country , with the Pentagon and other agencies watching closely .
Students will choose one of three specialized tracks : information and communication technology , criminal justice and law enforcement , or “ homeland security science . ”
David Volrath , executive director of secondary education for Harford County Public Schools , says the school also hopes to offer “ Arabic or some other nontraditional , Third World - type language . ”
The school ’s main goal is to get its grads jobs in the booming $ 24 - billion - a - year homeland security industry .
It ’s certainly in the right location : Northeast Maryland has become a mecca for the military - industrial complex .
The Army ’s Aberdeen Proving Ground is the county ’s biggest employer , and all manner of defense contractors have set up shop nearby , including weapons maker Northrop Grumman .
However , it ’s not clear how many Joppatowne grads will be on track to join the upper echelons of the intelligence community and how many will wind up as airport screeners .
“ We do want to encourage higher education , ” Volrath says .
“ We also want to be realistic .
Some of these defense contractors will have huge security needs , and the jobs wo n’t require four years of college . ”
Critics see the school as a troubling landmark : a public school , possibly the first of many , that is an active participant in the war on terror .
Jonathan Zimmerman , director of New York University ’s History of Education Program , says that if it offered students an “ intellectually curious ” curriculum , “ I ’d send my daughter there .
But my fear is that they will instead teach a series of predigested truths about keeping our country safe . ”
Volrath maintains that Joppatowne High will remain above the fray .
“ The school ’s built around the marketplace that surrounds the defense industry , ” he explains , “ but the program ’s not involved in war or peace .
Still , there are some realities about good guys and bad guys that will surely be discussed . ”
THE STUDY “ Discovery of HE 1523-0901 , a Strongly r-Process - Enhanced Metal - Poor Star With Detected Uranium , ” by Anna Frebel et al. , The Astrophysical Journal , May 10 , 2007 .
THE MOTIVE
How do you determine the age of an ancient star ?
For distant galaxies , astronomers measure redshift — the stretching of light that indicates how fast the stars are receding and therefore how old they are relative to the age of the universe .
But this does n’t work for an ancient star nearby .
So Anna Frebel of the McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin looked for chemical clues .
She reckoned that a rare form of old “ metal poor ” star , one with one - thousandth the iron content of our own young sun , carries an internal clock , one composed of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium .
Because these metals decay at a steady rate , an astute observer can extrapolate backward and pinpoint the star ’s moment of birth .
Frebel has found one such star in our own Milky Way and dated its birth to 13.2 billion years ago — barely 500 million years after the universe itself was born .
THE METHODS
The older a star is , the fewer metals it contains .
The first stars , which formed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang , were composed of only hydrogen , helium , and traces of lithium .
Some tens of millions of years after their birth , these massive , puffy stars exploded as supernovas , and new heavy elements were born in their fiery depths .
Frebel first hunted for their offspring , an old star with a chemical fingerprint that could be dated : 74 percent hydrogen , 25 percent helium , smidgens of uranium and thorium inherited from a parent supernova , and very little iron — a relatively light element that accumulated later in history as the universe evolved and that would obscure any signal from the radioactive components .
To detect uranium and thorium , Frebel could measure the strength of their absorption lines in a spectrum — in other words , calculate how much light each element absorbs at a particular wavelength .
Frebel used the Clay Magellan Telescope in the Chilean Andes to search the halo of the Milky Way — its outer reaches , where old stars lurk — and turned up a bright red giant about eight - tenths the mass of our sun , dubbed HE 1523-0901 , that appeared to meet all the requirements .
Frebel then turned to the European Southern Observatory ’s Very Large Telescope in northern Chile .
The VLT incorporates the Ultraviolet - Visual Echelle Spectrograph , or UVES , which acts like a supersensitive prism , splitting light collected by the telescope into a rainbow .
Staff at the VLT collected the star ’s spectra , from which Frebel calculated its uranium and thorium content .
Finally , Frebel compared her results with theoretical models that compute the quantities of heavy metals in stars at the moment of their formation .
These programs model the process of nuclear synthesis in supernovas and infer how much uranium and thorium would be present at the birth of new stars .
By subtracting her own figures on the star ’s current heavy - element content from these theoretical estimates , Frebel determined how much radioactive decay had occurred and , therefore , established its age .
HE 1523-0901 “ is certainly among the oldest stars , ” Frebel says , “ and was probably formed as the second or third generation of stars . ”
THE MEANING
“ Recently the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measured the age of the universe to be 13.7 billion years from the cosmic microwave background , ” Frebel says .
“ The actual age measurement of a star provides an independent lower limit of the age of the universe . ”
My wife requested that I post a particular Monty Python skit on the site .
Well , posting just one Python video is right out !
No , here at One Man ’s Institute for the Exceptional Documentation of Silly Time Wasting Videos we have a rule that one shall post no fewer than 150 videos – and the number of videos posted shall be 150 .
Therefore , being that my wife is an HR manager and has to interview tons and tons of mackerels , and furthermore since she gets a kick out of Monty Python ’s classic Silly Job Interview … RIGHT !
On with it then !
( In fact , as I understand it she conducts all of her own interviews in this manner .
Nudge , nudge .
Wink , wink .
Say no more . )
Additionally , in the spirit of being Halibut , I ’ve spent a truly silly amount of time sifting through applicants , while wearing pantys and a bra .
No I did n’t !
Yes – you did !
Right .
On with it !
Unfortunatly due to the fact that this article was posted an infinetesimally long time ago , the following videos have been lost to the sands of the Interwebs .
If any of you Pythonoholics locate them please drop a comment below and I ’ll update the post for everyone ’s benefit .
Albatross .
America may be referred to as the " Home of the Brave " because when the bills arrive it takes a lot of courage to open them up , especially when you must turn around and face your wife and kids with a straight face .
When it comes to paying bills these days , America just does n't feel like the land of the free any longer .
To be truly free you must be debt - free ; if you 're not , your creditors own you .
Americans now owe a staggering $ 16 trillion dollars ( $ 2.4 Trillion in personal loans , and $ 13.6 trillion borrowed from their house ) .
Yet , as a society , we just can't seem to get away from accumulating debt , and have become nothing short of debt slaves .
The American consumer continues to abuse credit that has been offered to them , and pay incredibly high interest charges every month , without blinking an eye .
To maintain a certain lifestyle that would ordinarily be unattainable with their current income levels , our nation of consumers is slowly but surely being eaten alive by our own conspicuous consumption .
In May , Personal Savings ranked in at a negative 1.4 percent of income ( or a minus $ 140 billion annually ) .
Consumers are still not saving enough and continue using credit to offset any shortfall in income just to keep up with normal expenses like a mortgage , groceries , and gas because they have chosen to live extravagantly .
One major cause of our country 's need to import massive amounts of foreign capital to keep our economy afloat stems from a weary American consumer struggling to live and pay the rent , but behaving like they 're rich .
The United States might be the only superpower but we still owe Japan and China each about a trillion dollars .
( We owe even more to the Gulf Arabs . )
With no savings , America continues to run an $ 800 billion dollar trade deficit .
We are effectively giving America away to our creditors and if we continue to give more and more away , we will lose the ability and the will to take back control and ownership of our own economy .
Not only are Americans , individually , becoming debt slaves , but the country on a national level is losing its independence this 4th of July , one manufacturing job and one container shipment at a time , as jobs continue to go overseas .
Even though our elected officials know that letting Japan and China manipulate their currencies will undercut American manufacturers and workers , our national policy still caters to them .
Our government may feel they have no choice but to look the other way because when you owe $ 2 trillion dollars , you have to remember the golden rule : China and Japan have the gold so they make the rules .
The White House knows that if we annoy our largest creditors , they could very easily sell the dollar .
If that happened , interest rates would be forced up and the stock market would crash .
The joke , of course , is that it is Americans borrowing against their houses and buying foreign goods that gives Japan and China our money and puts our nation in their debt .
But I can't help but wonder how long the United States will remain the superpower it is if we continue to give other nations so much power over us ?
With the White House losing power and credibility , it 's becoming more likely that Congress will start calling the shots .
A key reason the Democrats won The House and Senate is that they actually wanted to do something about jobs going overseas , and to address the issue of unfair currency manipulation by Japan and China which is subsidizing exports to America .
However , if Congress starts to force the currency manipulation issue , the likely outcome has " 1987 stock market crash " written all over it .
Why ?
If America " sticks it " to Japan and China , the Yen carry trade will collapse and China will start taking their money out of the dollar .
This could have dire consequences !
Who then is left for America to borrow from ?
The Gulf Arabs want to diversify away from the dollar , and Russia , which wisely prefers the Euro , has told us to take a hike .
The international front for the dollar and dollar investments is already precarious .
One by one , countries are showing less love for the dollar , and are unwilling to hold all investments in U.S. Treasuries and Agency Securities .
Even Kuwait the country we went to war to save is diversifying from the dollar .
The big trade surplus countries are setting up separate investment funds to diversify away from U.S. Treasury debt .
This new trend does not bode well for keeping long - term U.S. interest rates low , or preventing the dollar from spiraling downward .
Currency realignment is inevitable , but forcing the issues offers great risk to owners of dollar assets , such as stocks and bonds .
Ex -Watergate prober : Thompson ' was mole for the White House ' Will Menaker
Published : Thursday July 5 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?

According to an article in Wednesday 's Boston Globe , GOP presidential hopeful , and one - time Republican Senator from Tennessee , Fred Thompson leaked information to the Nixon white house during the height of the Watergate investigation .
In his capacity as the Senate Watergate Committee minority counsel , Thompson tipped off Nixon 's attorney that the committee was aware of the president 's secret tapping device , and would be making the information public .
In his Watergate memoir , " At That Point in Time , " Thompson recalls that he acted with " no authority " in disclosing this information to Nixon .
Former investigator for the Democratic majority on the Watergate committee , Scott Armstrong , claims this was just one of many leaks Thompson provided to the Nixon administration .
" Thompson was a mole for the White House , " Armstrong claims .
" Fred was working hammer and tong to defeat the investigation of finding out what happened to authorize Watergate and find out what the role of the president was . "
When asked to comment on today 's article , Thompson responded , " I 'm glad all of this has finally caused someone to read my Watergate book , even though it 's taken them over thirty years . "
Earlier this year , Watergate icon Bob Woodward stated that Fred Thompson 's role in the Watergate investigation was exaggerated and that when Thompson famously asked about the existence of a secret White House taping system , he already " knew the answer . "
The role of Thompson as a " mole " for the Nixon White House undermines the cultivated image of a straight shooting and independent minded prosecutor who played a role in bringing down the president .
Thompson 's website even proclaims that he " gained national attention for leading the line of inquiry that revealed the audio - taping system in the White House Oval Office . "
A Test Case for China
There are few better places than Chad to watch for signs of how China ’s African gambit will pay off .
Chad ranks just four places from the bottom on the United Nations scale of human development , yet it is emerging as a critical piece in China ’s economic push in a broad swath of sub-Saharan Africa , beginning with Sudan and extending in virtually every direction .
Despite advanced prospecting by French and other Western firms dating back to the 1970s , Chad ’s oil had never been tapped .
The nation was simply too unstable and the price of oil too low to justify investing much here .
The oil that had been found was of low quality , and there was no practical way to get it out .
That changed in 2000 , when the World Bank agreed to help finance a $ 4.2 billion , 665 - mile pipeline connecting Chad to Cameroon on the condition that oil revenues be used to fight poverty .
Chad ’s revenues quickly outstripped expectations , but have not gone into quelling its immense poverty .
Mismanagement and fraud have beset the World Bank plan from the start .
Beyond that , Chadian rebels with bases in Sudan have been trying to depose Mr. Déby , so he pressed the World Bank to relax its rules on how to spend the country ’s oil money .
A compromise was reached , and he went on a military spending spree , buying guns , aircraft and armored vehicles for his troops , along with a fleet of armored Humvees that stop traffic as they zoom about Ndjamena ’s dusty , potholed streets .
Seeking an even freer hand with the country ’s oil bonanza , Mr. Déby ’s government also hinted that it could find other partners willing to invest in Chad , especially with the price of oil so high .
Then , in 2006 , Chad ended a relationship with Taiwan and recognized mainland China , and the floodgates opened .
China bought the rights to several oil exploration zones in the country from a Canadian company and has gone from bit player to center stage in Chad ’s affairs , confident that it can wring smart profits from the most inhospitable conditions .
The practical limit on what a computer can do is not the memory built into the machine itself , although any serious computer should have at least 48 and preferably 64 K of random access memory , but rather how much information it can quickly draw from its disks .
Here again I speak from the perspective of the sadder - but - wiser man .
In moving up from tapes to a disk drive , I took the bargain route .
I bought one rather than two , used small disks ( 5 1/4 " diameter ) rather than large ( 8 " ) , and chose single - rather than double - density storage .
I saved a couple of hundred dollars but bought myself a source of frustration , since each disk fills up too quickly and I have to keep rotating different disks in and out of the drive .
( Again , this may not sound like much to you , but live with it for a year or two and you 'll see what I mean . )
I think you 're cheating yourself if you get anything less than two double - density 5 1/4 " drives , which together should be able to store 400 K or more of data .
The exact capacity varies quite a lot , depending on the configuration a manufacturer chooses .
A two - drive system of 5 1/4 " disks for the Apple III , for instance , can store as little as 280 K , while Heath - Zenith and Victor each offer two - drive 5 1/4 " systems that hold more than 1,000 K , or one megabyte .
In some cases , you may do better to get two 8 " drives , depending on the specific prices and configurations different manufacturers offer .
The top of the line among storage systems is the hard disk , most often available in the form called the Winchester .
( This is not a brand but a nickname , applied by wits in the computer world because the model number on one of the earliest drives was 3030 , reminiscent of a rifle . )
The other disks , known as floppies , get pulled in and out of their drives like tape cassettes , but a Winchester is permanently sealed in its case .
You do n't need to remove the hard disks because each one stores a prodigious amount of data , from two or three on up to several dozen megabytes .
With even a small Winchester , you can store some 2,000 pages of data at once — enough , for example , to contain all the notes for a book , along with drafts of all chapters , or a record of all your correspondence over a period of years .
Winchesters are expensive ; cheap models go for about $ 2,000 , and some of them cost at least twice that much .
But you should n't buy one right now anyway
They 're just entering the period of soaring volume and falling prices and will be cheaper in a year .
3. Scrimping on the printer .
The same misguided frugality that directed me toward tape recorders also tempted me to think that my converted Selectric printer was a great deal .
True , I could have made an even worse mistake .
I could have bought a dot matrix printer , which is fast and cheap but which leaves you with a manuscript resembling a grocery receipt .
If eyes other than your own are going to see the things you print , you 're foolish to get anything except a letter - quality printer .
This means either a converted Selectric , like my first printer , or one of the systems known as daisy wheels or thimbles .
These have small wheels or drums that spin across the page and print at a phenomenal rate .
They cost more than the Selectric to begin with , but they 're a bargain in the long run .
The real cost of the Selectric is the headaches of repair and breakdown .
In operation , it is a blur of rods and connectors , one of which is always about to go awry .
But daisy - wheel printers have only one main moving part .
A year ago , I gave in and bought a daisy wheel , the Anderson - Jacobson 830 model , which cost about $ 1,400 .
In a year of steady use , it has broken once , which is about one tenth as often as the Selectric .
You should get one from the start .
Demolition had already been completed on the look - out tower
When troops of the Black Watch left the village it ended a posting all soldiers dreaded .
The area was considered so dangerous that troops and police officers could not travel by road , and had to be flown in and out by helicopter .
The move was a significant step in the so - called " normalisation " - part of the overall political process .
It was previously considered impossible for the police to carry out their duties in Crossmaglen without military support .
For more than 30 years , soldiers and police officers based in the village were tasked with confronting some of the IRA 's most deadly units in the heart of south Armagh .
The area was referred to by many as " Bandit Country " because of its history of lawlessness .
More than 20 police officers and soldiers were murdered in the Crossmaglen area during the Troubles .
Demolition had already been completed on the look - out tower and the Army and police base which loomed over Tomas O Fiaich Square in the village .
The Army installations , troops on patrol and helicopter flights were a source of anger for locals in the village for decades .
" For over 30 years the community here in south Armagh has had to endure British military occupation , " MP for the area , Sinn Fein 's Conor Murphy , said .
Army watchtowers have been taken down in the area
" It is now important that lands previously occupied by the British are returned to their owners and that larger sites vacated by the crown forces are utilised for the benefit of the communities which have had to endure so much repression from the British army throughout their unwelcome stay in south Armagh . "
However , Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said : " There is a strong feeling among the unionist population in the area that these changes are slightly premature given the very real threat posed by republican dissidents in the area .
" Unionist politicians have been given warnings from the PSNI to be careful in terms of personal security in the run up to 8 May . "
An Army spokesman said : " As published in the normalisation plan of 28 March 2006 , the military will be leaving Crossmaglen by the end of this month . "
The withdrawal of the Army from the base was part of the government 's normalisation programme in response to the IRA 's declared end to its activities .
Operation Banner , the name the Army gave to its support role for the police , will end completely in August after more than 30 years - the longest running operation in British army history .
By the summer there will be no more than 5,000 British soldiers in Northern Ireland , based in 11 locations .
At the height of the Troubles there were almost 30,000 , based in more than 100 locations .
The Iraqi government is run by the main coalition partners of the Shiite - dominated United Iraqi Alliance , with Kurds as minority members .
The Shiite clerical establishment formed the alliance to make sure its people did not succumb to the same mistake as in 1920 : rebelling against the occupying Western force ( then the British ) and losing what they believed was their inherent right to rule Iraq as the majority .
The qualified and reluctant welcome we received from the Shiites since the invasion has to be seen in that historical context .
They saw in us something useful for the moment .
Now that moment is passing , as the Shiites have achieved what they believe is rightfully theirs .
Their next task is to figure out how best to consolidate the gains , because reconciliation without consolidation risks losing it all .
Washington ’s insistence that the Iraqis correct the three gravest mistakes we made — de-Baathification , the dismantling of the Iraqi Army and the creation of a loose federalist system of government — places us at cross purposes with the government we have committed to support .
Political reconciliation in Iraq will occur , but not at our insistence or in ways that meet our benchmarks .
It will happen on Iraqi terms when the reality on the battlefield is congruent with that in the political sphere .
There will be no magnanimous solutions that please every party the way we expect , and there will be winners and losers .
The choice we have left is to decide which side we will take .
Trying to please every party in the conflict — as we do now — will only ensure we are hated by all in the long run .
At the same time , the most important front in the counterinsurgency , improving basic social and economic conditions , is the one on which we have failed most miserably .
Two million Iraqis are in refugee camps in bordering countries .
Close to two million more are internally displaced and now fill many urban slums .
Cities lack regular electricity , telephone services and sanitation .
“ Lucky ” Iraqis live in gated communities barricaded with concrete blast walls that provide them with a sense of communal claustrophobia rather than any sense of security we would consider normal .
In a lawless environment where men with guns rule the streets , engaging in the banalities of life has become a death - defying act .
Four years into our occupation , we have failed on every promise , while we have substituted Baath Party tyranny with a tyranny of Islamist , militia and criminal violence .
When the primary preoccupation of average Iraqis is when and how they are likely to be killed , we can hardly feel smug as we hand out care packages .
As an Iraqi man told us a few days ago with deep resignation , “ We need security , not free food . ”
In the end , we need to recognize that our presence may have released Iraqis from the grip of a tyrant , but that it has also robbed them of their self - respect .
They will soon realize that the best way to regain dignity is to call us what we are — an army of occupation — and force our withdrawal .
This week health secretary Alan Johnson announced that he was n't going to stick by the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme that lines the pockets of the drugs industry .
You only have to say those words to trigger my favourite three - minute dinner party package : how evil is big pharma ?
In the UK , the pharmaceutical trade is the third most profitable activity after finance and - this will surprise you if you live here - tourism .
We spend £ 7bn a year on pharmaceutical drugs , and 80 % of that goes on patented drugs - medicines released in the last 10 years .
In 2002 , the 10 US drug companies on the Fortune 500 list had combined international sales of $ 217bn ( £ 106.6bn ) .
They spent only 14 % of that money on research and development , but 31 % on marketing and administration .
They are very careful not to let anyone see how much goes on marketing and on administration .
Whenever you hear the drug companies explaining why they have to charge so much for their products - perhaps as they are denying their lifesaving Aids drugs to the 20 million HIV - positive people in Africa - the plea is that they need money to develop new drugs .
That 's not true if they spend twice as much on marketing as on research and development .
This unhappy collision of facts makes them look very evil indeed .
They also charge this money in slightly evil ways .
Drugs have 10 years " on patent . "
Loratadine is an effective antihistamine drug that does not cause drowsiness .
Before the patent ran out , the price of this drug , by Schering - Plough , was raised 13 times in the US in just five years , increasing by over 50 % .
This is not a price rise in keeping with inflation .
This is evil .
But it 's also an industry in trouble .
The golden age of medicine has creaked to a halt , and the number of new drugs being registered has dwindled from 50 a year in the 1990s to about 20 now .
At the same time , the number of " me-too " drugs has risen , making up to half of all new drugs .
Me -too drugs are an inevitable function of research driven by a market : they are rough copies of drugs made by another company , but they are different enough for a manufacturer to claim its own patent .
They need to be tested and marketed just like a new drug ; but for all that effort they generally do n't represent a significant breakthrough in human health .
They are merely a breakthrough in making money .
Again , you have to admit , that is reasonably evil .
But what really interests me is what we do with our feelings about this evil , market - driven venality , which can be found in every market sector .
But we find it uniquely distressing when we are sick and needing healthcare .
This moral discomfort and resentment leaks out in delusional anti-MMR beliefs , or bizarre acts of faith in the vitamin pill industry , as acts of misguided and wasteful political rebellion .
Why ?
Because everybody is a socialist when it comes to healthcare , but nobody knows what to do with those feelings any more .

From Far Right to Far Left — and Farther — With Karl Hess
James Boyd
This text was originally published in The New York Times Magazine , December 6 , 1970 .
Many thanks to E. for sending me this text .
— François - René Rideau
James Boyd , a freelance writer , is executive director of the Fund for Investigative Journalism in Washington , D.C .
On a June afternoon in 1960 Karl Hess 3rd , an assistant to the president of Ohio's vast Champion Paper and Fibre Company , was driving toward Cincinnati , lost in the manipulative thoughts common to rising young executives .
Suddenly the sound of a police siren intruded and he pulled over , perplexed but not alarmed , for in his world the police menaced not .
" Mr. Hess ? "
The trooper spoke deferentially .
" The White House is trying to reach you , sir .
Please call this number . "
He called .
Would he write the platform for the upcoming Republican National Convention at Chicago , the platform Richard Nixon would run on for President ?
He would ; shortly thereafter he moved into an office in the White House .
At 37 , clean - cut , huskily handsome , mellow - voiced , he was the kind of fellow that big business loans out to politicians to advise them what to do and say , a fellow who conducted seminars for Congressmen , authored Republican white papers on military and diplomatic strategy , would one day help ghost a book on defense policy for Representative Mel Laird .
He was good at it , was in demand .
In 1964 he did his stint again , co-authoring the Republican platform and staying on as Barry Goldwater 's speech man in the Presidential run .
Better than anyone else , Karl Hess could tell you what conservative Republicanism stood for .
Nowadays when the sirens sound , Hess scrams for the nearest exit .
From Goldwaterism , which sought to abolish half of government , he has progressed to anarchism , which would abolish all .
Night after night he socks it home to receptive audiences that the old conservatives were wiser than they knew : that growing militarism and welfarism have brought the garrison state and stagnation to America , just as they had prophesied ; that the Old Right must join forces with the New Left in a libertarian revolution to restore neighborhood government by boycotting all other kinds .
The Hess platform for 1970 is a blueprint for resistance to authority : do n't pay taxes ; do n't submit to the draft ; do n't move out when the government condemns your neighborhood in the name of eminent domain ; pay no attention to permits , licenses or craft certificates ; hide political prisoners ; support all who resist — whether it be Vivien Kellems , Rhody McCoy or the Panthers .
" The revolution occurs , " Hess says , " when the victims cease to cooperate . "
Well , maybe .
Hess represents no more than a talking aberration , one man making a fool of himself , someone to be swept out with the garbage , as Mr. Agnew would say .
But suppose there is an entire breed of rebel out there , spawned not by permissive indolence , but rugged individualism ; asking not to be coddled , but to be left entirely on their own ; inspired not by alien subversives , but by quintessential Americans like Taft , Garrison , Calhoun , Jefferson , and the signers of the Old Declaration that said government should be minimal and should be abolished whenever it oversteps itself .
A lot of people still believe in John Hancock : the millions who cheer George Wallace 's threats of mayhem against the pointy - headed bureaucrats ; the thousands of pioneer types who migrate from here to Western Canada each year to get away from governmental interference in their lives ; the recalcitrants among us who keep defeating tax and bond referendums ; the otherwise solid citizens of Warren , Mich. , enraged by the latest urban renewal blueprint , who recently mobbed Housing Secretary George Romney 's car ; the ubiquitous wildcatters and injunction defiers who are in other respects patriotic Americans ; the enthusiasts for local self - government and neighborhood control who spring up here and there to resist Washington and the statehouses ; the graying ex-aides of Senator Taft who write anarchist articles for the Libertarian Forum ; and the substantial minority at last year 's national convention of the Young Americans for Freedom that designated itself as libertarian and voted for active resistance to the draft laws .
It may suffice to note the dichotomy among the thousands of young conservatives who so conspicuously campaigned for Jim Buckley last month : " The bulk of the youths are ' traditionalists ' who emphasize stability and a somewhat aggressive foreign policy , " journalist Stephen Wiesman describes , " but the others are ' libertarians ' who believe so vehemently in personal freedoms that they find more in common with the radical left than with liberals . "
" This is not the year of the radical - liberal at all , " writes John A. Hamilton of The New York Times .
" It is the year of the radical reactionary . "
If this is so , then we ought to know more about Karl Hess so that , depending on our disposition , we can ( 1 ) requisition additional garbage cans ; ( 2 ) start counterblackguarding Republicans as breeders of subversives ; or ( 3 ) begin to inquire into whether something vital in our past is being violated by our present , remembering that civilizations begin to die when they betray their origins .
Behind his post - Republican beard ,
Hess is a smiling , soft - voiced sympathetic - eyed man , broad - shouldered in the sturdy blue shirt of a laborer .
He exudes that ethereal , inexplicable cheerfulness of a nun scrubbing floors , a gentility that is unsettling ; we expect our anarchists to be glittery - eyed bomb - throwers because we get our ideas about them from politicians , whose attitudes sour upon discovering there would be no place for politicians in Utopia .
" Politics has always been the institutionalized way for some men to live off the output of other men , " Hess says .
" Politics devour men ; a laissez - faire world will liberate them . "
Why did he defect from the palace to the barricades ?
" The immediate cause was Vietnam , " he says .
" Conservatives like me had spent our lives arguing against Federal power — with one exception .
We trusted Washington with enormous powers to fight global Communism .
We were wrong — as Taft foresaw when he opposed NATO .
We forgot our old axiom that power always corrupts the possessor .
Now we have killed a million and a half helpless peasants in Vietnam , just as Stalin exterminated the kulaks , for reasons of state interest , erroneous reasons so expendable that the Government never mentioned them now and wo n't defend them .
Vietnam should remind all conservatives that whenever you put your faith in big government for any reason , sooner or later you wind up as an apologist for mass murder . "
If Vietnam persuaded Hess that government is evil , the new technology convinced him it is an unnecessary evil .
" Power institutions developed because of scarcity .
Historically , there was never enough of the necessities to go around , so people submitted to kings and armies , either to steal from others or to defend what little they had .
But new developments in ways of growing and making things mean there is no longer any logical reason for scarcity , and so there is no longer any justification for the nation - state that outweighs its obvious threat to human survival . "
Hess feels that the logic of decentralization and the impulse of people to take things onto their own hands is visible everywhere and will crumple Stalinist states at about the same rate it does capitalist ones .
" They are in the same boat and they know it ; remember , it was the Communist party of France that bailed out the Gaullists from the student - worker revolution .
You 'll see that alliance more and more , because Stalinism is only the perfected model of state capitalism .
Anarchism is the common enemy of both . "
Whatever the immediate causes and perceptions that influenced Karl Hess to insurrection , much of his life seems to have been a preparation for it .
His mother preceded him in realizing a version of the American dream , finding it unworthy , and rejecting it .
She was a working girl in Washington , D.C. when she won the hand of a dashing millionaire , who carried her off to a great estate in the Philippines , where his businesses were and where little Karl was born in 1923 .
But Thelma
Hess in time decided that her husband was an incurable philanderer .
She left him and returned home with her son .
As a matter of personal principle , she insisted on making her own way as a switchboard operator and sought no alimony .
Thus , even as an infant , Karl was an unwitting partner in a revolt against a major American institution .
" We remained virtuous but poor , " he says .
One perceives a trace of wistfulness , as though once in a while Karl wonders furtively what life is like back at the ancestral hacienda .
And there was the matter of his education .
Long before he was of school age , Karl 's mother taught him to read .
" She had a rule .
Before I got a toy , I must read a book .
Before I got to kindergarten , I had read H. G. Wells ' ' Outline of History . ' "
To this precocious boy , school was a prison ; the contrast between his joy in discovery outside and the bored , regimented hours within may have planted in him the seed of contempt for all institutions , and for society 's assumption that it knows best .
In the first year of high school , he quit and became a permanent truant .
He believes his own experience is shared by millions , whether advanced , average or backward .
" At age 5 or 6 , a child is introduced to the stupidities of state compulsion .
School on these terms is a challenge not to learn anything , and most kids rise to the challenge . "
His tactic in quitting school foreshadowed the nonviolent resistance he now advocates as the citizen 's proper stance toward the demands of government .
Instead of just not showing up , he enrolled in two high schools ; then at each school he filed transfer papers to the other .
" They never caught on .
A bureaucracy is always inefficient ; the bigger it gets the more vulnerable it is to clerical sabotage .
Instead of learning how to make bombs , revolutionaries should master computer programming . "
But at 14 revolution was far from Karl 's thoughts .
It was enough then to be free at last to enter productive life .
Under the law , he was too young to work ; he lied and landed a job with the Mutual radio network as assistant to newscaster Walter Compton .
In a few weeks , he progressed from legwork and research to interviews and writing news shows — heady days for a juvenile .
The new freedom , however was a tenuous thing , existing only so long as the authorities did n't notice him .
One day he borrowed Compton 's car to drive to an interview .
En route he got a traffic ticket .
From the subsequent proceedings , Mutual learned Karl 's age and fired him to comply with the law .
Hess feels that the freedom of most Americans is just as revocable .
" We have the illusion of freedom only because so few ever try to exercise it .
Try it sometime .
Try to save your home from the highway crowd , or to work a trade without the approval of the goons , or to open a little business without a permit , or to grow a crop without a quota , or to educate your child the way you want to , or to not have a child .
We all have the freedom of a balloon floating in a pin factory . "
At 16 , Hess began anew as copyboy to the manager of The Alexandria Gazette in Virginia , a post he remembers fondly .
" We were always shorthanded , so I got a chance to do everything you can do at a newspaper — setting type , taking photos , hustling ads , writing editorials .
In two years I knew the business inside out . "
He began now to take an interest in politics .
He was never tempted by the Democrats .
They smacked to him of the paternalism that had chained him to school , of the do - goodism that was forever tripping him up , of the elitism wherein the intelligent few presumed to solve the problems of the stupid many .
For a time , he went to Socialist meetings .
" They were not elitists , but they were even more doctrinaire and bureaucratically inclined than the Democrats .
I liked them , though , and learned a lot from their interminable discussions .
For one thing , I learned to hate Stalinism as the ultimate perversion of everything decent . "
By process of elimination , he became a Republican .
" In 1940 the Republican party presented itself as the party that was against centralized power , against militarism and foreign meddling , against Communism ; it was for local control , individual liberty and the pioneer spirit .
That was my ticket . "
Came Pearl Harbor and Hess volunteered .
He could have stayed out , for during his infancy in the Philippines he had contracted malaria and other tropical diseases .
But he wanted to do his part , for his doubt about the system then was only the entrepreneur 's impatience with restraint , the feeling that America was n't quite American enough .
He concealed his medical history , enlisted in the Armed Forces and went to Fort Knox , Ky . During training there , he was felled by asthma and bronchial pneumonia ; his medical history surfaced .
He was honorably discharged and returned home where he got a job as a rewrite man for The Washington Times - Herald .
He was now 18 .
If in later life Hess was to rebel on principle , in those years he did so out of impishness .
" Several of us at the Times - Herald rotated as the night - club columnist , " he recalls .
" It was such a drag that we used to make up our columns out of thin air .
One day I did an imaginary account that placed our city editor in the most disreputable flophouse in town .
Everybody at the paper roared , except him .
' Never do it again , ' he warned .
So , naturally in my next column I put him back in that joint , and I got fired . "
Hess crossed over to The Washington Daily News .
Ability propelled him to the post of assistant editor before he was 20 ; but again that gargoyle of the spirit undid it all .
" One day the editor called me up at some ungodly hour to say that Roosevelt was dead and for me to rush in and do the obituary piece .
I said Roosevelt 's obit was n't worth getting up for .
He canned me . "
He was at an age when losing a good job was trivial ; he was learning to fly .
Literally .
Aviation became his big enthusiasm and led him to the news editorship of Aviation Week .
Flying planes , writing about them and getting paid for it ; could life possibly offer more ?
In fact it could .
There was Yvonne , marriage , and two adored sons .
But politics was eating away at him with that special faculty it has for poisoning the good life .
It was now the postwar era , when the United States was defining the role it would play in the world .
Two principles
Hess now regards as contradictory had coalesced within him : the pool hustler 's instinctive love for the unrestricted free market , and the cold warrior 's acquired credo that America must mobilize itself and the world to roll back the advance of Communism .
For the next two decades he would live the odyssey of the conservative intellectual , alternating with the seasons between journalism and party politics .
Writing an anti-Communist column for Pathfinder , a conservative weekly with a million readers , led to a post with the Republican National Committee where he set up its first news service .
Then he edited Counter Attack , a cold war newsletter , and freelanced for American Mercury until it became grossly anti-Semitic .
" I should have quit earlier than I did , but there is so much anti-Semitism on the right that I had grown insensitive to it . "
For a while he worked for H. L. Hunt , doing the graphic design of Facts Forum and editing the first few issues .
But the association with Hunt did n't last long .
" You can't reasonably discuss anything with a man who makes a million dollars a week ; what possible basis does he have for listening to you ? "
From 1950 to 1955
Hess was press editor at Newsweek .
Then he became one of the founding fathers at National Review .
" Anti-Communism is an exciting ideology which for many meant status , a sense of ' doing something , ' in an otherwise fairly drab environment .
The difference between being just a reporter and being an anti-Communist crusading reporter — with regular assists from the ' secret ' files of the F.B.I. — is considerable in terms of vanity alone , if not money . "
There were times when his interests in life - at - large almost detoured him from polemics and from whatever fate now awaits him .
He wrote a children 's book , the " Nature and Science " volume of the University Society Bookshelf for Children .
And he indulged his love of fishing by taking the editorship of Fisherman Magazine at Oxford , Ohio .
" My object was to make it a gentlemanly , almost English , sporting magazine .
For two years all went well , but it got too expensive and folded . "
Then — the world of business at Champion , where he would set up corporate defenses against socialist ( as opposed to responsible ) unionism , and would win a corporate award for establishing one of the first industrial programs for ideological indoctrination .
By the contemporary standard , those were salad years for Karl Hess .
He shuttled back and forth from executive boardrooms to political backrooms in the White House and on Capitol Hill .
" I became a standard Midwestern conservative , self - satisfied , well - paid ; I had 17 custom suits , a plush suburban home , the works .
And so did all the people I knew .
We were part of the managerial class , used to having our way .
You develop a mystique to justify this ; ours was that what was good for management was good for everyone .
We really believed that we were the salvation of America and that laboring people ought to bow down and thank God for us every day before breakfast . "
In 1962 , Hess left Champion to return to Washington as director of special projects at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research , a blue - ribbon think tank considered to be the most effective defender of corporate capitalism .
There the shuttling was easier and Hess worked with such present Administration luminaries as Paul McCracken , G Warren Nutter , Milton Friedman and William Baroody Jr .
With the 1964 Presidential campaign approaching , Hess left the plush certitude of A.E.I. for another run on the political roller coaster .
This time he was in the number two salaried post at the Republican National Committee , a front seat for the exhilarating rise with Barry Goldwater to nomination and the headlong plunge to shattering defeat at the polls .
Some of us should not be allowed too close a look at our electoral process .
For most , such exposure destroys only innocence , but for Hess it destroyed faith .
It was not the defeat , he insists , or the temporary exile from party favor suffered by those associated with that defeat .
Such bruises hurt , but conservatives were accustomed to losing elections and Hess was used to re-establishing himself afterwards .
Certainly it was not disillusion with Barry Goldwater , whom Hess continued to serve and still regards as the most admirable of politicians , because he is the least political .
What lingered on was the dawning conclusion that our politics is based on lies .
All of us suspect this at one time or another , but with Hess the impact was deeper and began to spread , like an infection or a revelation , questioning all of his past allegiances .
His big business , " free enterprise , " group had given its money to Johnson instead of Goldwater ; in the crunch , the corporations wanted not the laissez - faire of their slogans , but government subsidies and contracts and tariffs and preferential regulations .
Established power centers of the Republican party , preferring the status quo of the Democrats , had defected from a Republican standard - bearer who stood for traditional conservative doctrine .
The campaign dialogue that Hess had counted upon to equalize the disproportion in money , patronage and organization had been so distorted and caricatured as to make millions believe that Goldwater wanted to abolish their Social Security and start a nuclear war .
And the pro -" war in Vietnam " party had posed as the peace ticket and had gotten away with it .
To Hess , such perfidies robbed the electoral process of all meaning .
Where was the free choice between alternatives that was supposed to legitimize the awesome power of government ?
Advancing apostasy now suggested contradictions in the conservative cause and these Hess now mercilessly exhumed .
" I had once edited Washington World , a paper designed to prove that private enterprise could do anything better than government and make a profit to boot .
Our chief backer was a Kansas wheat grower who , as it turned out , was getting a huge farm subsidy every year .
The subsidies he was against were subsidies to poor people .
I saw that conservatism in practice was shot through with that sort of thing .
Conservatives reject the state as an instrument of beneficence but revere it as an instrument of chastisement .
They would deny the Federal Government certain controls over people at the state level , which they say is more effective .
This means that conservatives support the coercion of individuals at the most effective level ! "
Management executives no longer seemed to Hess the sacred bearers of progress .
" I began to ask , ' What did we really do ?
What did we create ? '
We invented nothing , made nothing , improved nothing .
All we did was shift people and paper around .
I was a managerial featherbedder .
I had attended hundreds of meetings , but only at two or three did the subject of product improvement ever come up .
The product is only incidental to the real business of business , which is making money for nothing .
Next to politicians , the managerial class is the least productive , most parasitic group on earth . "
The build - up of the Vietnam war , and the refusal of the " Communist slaves " to either accept liberation or surrender to unprecedented destruction , gave Hess something concrete against which to measure the mysticism of cold war dogma .
" Most of the founders of National Review were disillusioned - Communists whose new cause in life was the destruction of the Soviet Union .
The others were Catholics , like Bill Buckley and me , quack metaphysicians who regarded Communism as the Antichrist and the war against it as God 's fight .
This group of accomplished pamphleteers took over conservatism from the old isolationist - pacifist right and converted it into a military - religious crusade against the Reds .
It was a tragedy , for it left no political opposition to resist the liberal push toward more and more U.S. intervention around the globe .
Buckley still talks about fighting Communism ' unto the consummation of the world . '
He used to say that the continued existence of one Communist was an affront to God ; well , it 's too late now , but I think it 's Buckley who is an affront to God . "
As with most heresies , Hess 's doctrinal doubts matured slowly .
He still puttered at Congressional speechwriting , ghosted a syndicated column for Goldwater , groped for a place in politics in which his shifting outlook would fit .
He did n't find it .
More and more he felt a need to go to work with his hands , to earn a living not tied to politics .
So he enrolled in Bell 's Vocational High School in Washington and learned the welder 's trade .
There he formed a partnership with Donald Bried , a black classmate ; they mortgaged a portable welding rig and began to scour the area for work .
They scared up a thriving business in emergency repair jobs on damaged vehicles and machinery , jobs that had to be done at night , on location , outside .
If , during that winter , you were driving home from a Washington cocktail party on a freezing night and saw a flash of blue - white light coming from some deserted truck lot , it was probably Karl Hess atoning for politics .
As late as 1968 he kept one hand in the old game , doing temporary writing chores for old friends in the Congress .
" I remember being called out from under a bulldozer one day to go to a State Department briefing . "
But after writing speeches for Goldwater 's successful Senate comeback in 1968 ( on the condition that he be excused for speeches on the cold war or on law and order )
Hess dropped out of the system and continued his drift " left , left , left , back to the roots . "
" Looking back , " he muses , " I followed the standard progression that has led so many people from the right to the left : First , opposition to the New Deal , then Republican libertarianism , then the anti-Communist disaster , then an anti-political period with Ayn Rand and the objectivists , then the S.D.S. hits you like a bombshell with its synthesis of the values of individual freedom and communal life , then you want to do something about it and the left is where things are being done .
I never speak anywhere without someone coming up after who says , ' I was in the Goldwater campaign ; now I 'm with the New Left . '
The other day I met a Weatherman who once drove a sound truck for Barry . "
In 1969 Hess 's ex-peers in Republican circles came to power .
Now and again they would hear stories about their old friend Karl that were puzzling .
He seemed to have become some kind of outlaw .
For instance , he was a tax evader , was giving people advice on how to break laws , was advocating the appropriation of public and corporate wealth , was an abettor of known felons , a poacher on Federal property .
" Karl 's gone crazy , " they said .
It was not his activities , per se , that shocked ; after all , such practices are but the traditional pursuits of the politician - corporate lawyer caste ; the basic financing of both political parties has always been founded upon them .
No , it was not his pursuits that jarred , but his motives .
For his declared aim was not to enrich politicians , but to eliminate them .
" We all liked Karl , " said one .
" We wished him well with his acetylene torch .
But this ? "
Indeed , to the old gang now up at the White House and on the Hill and at G.O.P. headquarters , the reports that filtered back on Hess put people in mind of the former club member taken to drink who is glimpsed occasionally on back streets in successive stages of decline and disrepair .
The word got around that Hess had extolled anarchy and revolution at a libertarian conference at the Diplomat Hotel in New York , from a stage dominated by the black flag .
He had been gassed during a march on Fort Dix , arrested at an antiwar melee in Washington , summonsed by the tax police , spotted at meetings with Black Panthers .
And there were the personal notes .
His marriage had broken up ; he had taken to racing motorcycles and wound up with his leg in a cast ; he was broke ; he now lived in , of all things , a houseboat — somewhere along the Anacostia River .
In the shadow of buildings where power sits , Hess was seen once in a while , with long hair and a black beard , wearing the field jacket and the olive drab pants and the boots that seemed to manifest both a disdain for the old lifestyle and a militant design to change it .
Sometimes he wore a little Castro - type cap and a knapsack , as if he were headed for some distant and subversive rendezvous .
What seemed to old colleagues an inexplicable decline was by other standards a renaissance .
Hess turned his blowtorch to metal sculpture , with such effect that museums began to order pieces from him and he staged a successful one - man show .
Writing in his own name now , he produced a torrent of articles , climaxed by a monumental broadside in behalf of libertarianism ( " The Death of Politics " ) which won Hess the Playboy award for its best nonfiction piece of the year .
He started books and embarked on lecture tours , but only in service of the Cause .
It is significant that the indictment of American government made by Hess in his writings and speeches is not dissimilar to that of such an establishment figure as John W. Gardner , former Cabinet member and foundation head , now chairman of Common Cause .
Gardner stated recently : " State governments are mostly feeble .
City government is archaic .
The Congress of the United States is in grave need of overhaul .
The parties are useless as instruments of the popular will ....
Most parts of the system have grown so rigid that they cannot respond to impending disaster .
They are so ill - designed for contemporary purposes that they waste taxpayers ' money , mangle good programs and frustrate every good man who enters the system . "
Mr. Gardner , however , prescribes a liberal cure — to make government more effective by revitalizing it through pressure exerted by a citizens ' lobby .
Hess ' solution is both radical and reactionary : to eliminate government as far as possible , to throw out the Constitution and go back , for starters , to the Articles of Confederation — to that government which governs least .
To sustain this approach , Hess instinctively looked to the vestigial Old Right which he had long before abandoned and which now welcomed him home with fatted calf .
He began writing for The Libertarian Forum , joining such Taft - era conservatives as economist Murray Rothbard and historian Leonard Liggio , who had held the Libertarian torch aloft for two decades while Conservatism went to war .
And when Hess first proselytized among the young , it was to the conservative youths of Young Americans for Freedom that he turned , with some success .
In time , he would turn toward the New Left , or to that portion of it which is anti-authoritarian and anarchist ; that seemed to be where the numbers were , where the life - style was developing , and where , as he said , " people were making revolution , instead of talking about it . "
One of the obstacles to building an anarchist society is that there is no place where you can secede from the Union .
Hess lives in a floating community of houseboats ; periodically , its location shifts as it tries to keep a jump ahead of official harassment .
The heat , noise and tensions of Washington are still with you when you come upon the present site , a boatyard hidden behind a row of oak trees .
You are immediately struck with the timeless serenity of the place , like the uncle 's farm of your childhood .
It is cool under the trees ; a tanned girl in frayed short - shorts lounges on a hammock ; muscular young men tinker with motors in the wordless communion of craftsmen doing what they like .
Down to the right , fragile catwalks lead to a wharf , the hitching post for more than a dozen blocky boats , which rise and fall almost imperceptibly .
A hairy man wearing only a half loincloth is painting one of the boats ; he stops to banter as two girls pass on the wharf .
Beyond is the sweep of Anacostia , where in the distance sailboats glide and rowing teams compete .
Up to the left is a shack which serves as the boatyard office and two sheds with a long workbench in front that seems to be communal headquarters .
There , attended by a noble looking goat and a big , black dog of indeterminate parentage , Hess receives visitors .
He is dressed in a white hunter 's shirt , the kind Stewart Granger used to wear in safari movies .
He bought it in Rhodesia , where he sculptured the 6 - foot metal artwork that until recently stood in front of the Archives Building in Salisbury .
He rises now in mock courtesy , sweeping his arm in a broad arc .
" Welcome to a self - governing community of 21 free citizens living amidst a colony of 900,000 disenfranchised subjects , " he says .
He conducts a tour of the place , with as much proprietary pride as if it were Mount Vernon .
One of the community is Karl 's oldest son , Karl 4th , a strapping , articulate youth , formerly president of Young Americans for Freedom at the University of Virginia , now a conscientious objector ; whatever other gulfs may now separate
Hess from his past , he has conquered the generation gap .
" We share here in all the chores and decisions .
No step is taken that any one of us violently objects to , and we 've never yet come to the situation where the majority wanted to do something badly enough to alienate any one of us .
In an anarchist world , of course , there would be thousands of different communities , enough variety to accommodate everyone except someone who wanted power over others .
We have different leaders for every task , on the basis of personal competence .
I 'm the welder ; someone else is the carpenter .
Last week the job was getting the sheds ready for the winter , this week it 's mending the wharf .
We have communal meals a couple of times a week , at which we decide things , and talk and entertain each other .
This is more than an efficient way to live ; it is a happy way .
Everyone has a boat here , but nobody goes out in his boat because they do n't want to miss the fun . "
There are bicycles and fishing gear in the sheds ; recreation and leisure are an important item .
" We want to do more than plot anarchy in cellars ; we want to live the life .
I 'm 47 years old and this is the first time I have known what it means to live in a real family — to be surrounded in my daily life by people who take time for each other , who are completely open , who do everything together , whose happiness comes from sharing experiences , not owning things . "
The community is , of course , artificial in part : its members must earn their bread in the square world .
One runs a duplicating shop in the National Press Building , another is a nurse , some are mechanics , others congenially earn marginal livelihoods in Washington left - wing think tanks .
Hess earns money as he needs it from lecturing , writing , sculpturing , and occasionally getting back under the bulldozers .
And he is a fellow of the Institute of Policy Studies in Washington , where he conducts a seminar on " The Ways in Which Left and Right Political Positions Have Merged in the New Left . "
He leads you down the wharf to a boat called the Tranquil .
Below , in the cabin , a rifle occupies the place of honor on the fore bulkhead ; a symbol of the anarchist belief in the right of self - defense against government .
The interior is awash with books , pamphlets and unfinished drafts , for Hess has mastered anarchism just as methodically as he did Republicanism .
He can tell you about a tractor factory in England , run on anarchist principles ; about the solar cell , which transforms sunlight into electricity and may one day make us independent of Con Edison and continental power grids ; about how there are now 42 neighborhood steel plants in the United States employing under 300 men each , doing a thriving business because they 're efficient — the wave of the future , he says .
He can tell you how Ireland had an anarchist society for centuries , how it avoided crime without a police force , how it took the English hundreds of years to subjugate Ireland because the people had no Government to surrender for them .
And he 's watching the experiments in Sweden to train the average citizen in methods of personal resistance and sabotage as a possible substitute for armies and air forces ; and keeping track of how even the poorest ghetto neighborhoods pay out more in taxes than they receive in benefits and how the Black Panthers and their drive for local autonomy could be the salvation of the inner cities — if the Panthers are n't exterminated and do n't turn Marxist in deed as they have in rhetoric .
" Anarchy is merely the lack of institutional authority , " he says .
" There will always be ' government ' in terms of voluntary , social organizations formed to do specific things — putting out fires , protection against thieves , different kinds of schools .
If you want the service , you support it and participate ; if you do n't want it , nobody can make you use it or pay for it .
Why should anyone have permanent authority over you and your kids merely because they provide certain services ? "
Hess has a book just out , a collaboration with Thomas Reeves on draft resistance ( " The End of the Draft : The Feasibility of Freedom " ) .
In it , Hess analyzes the draft as the instrument of the capitalist state , which routinely confiscates lives to fight wars , but dares not confiscate money or property , which it holds more inviolate than life — and which therefore must be borrowed and repaid with interest .
Reeves follows with a libertarian formula for a voluntary army .
A
Hess autobiography is also in the works .
A wall calendar is all the office he needs now , and it is covered with scribbled data on campus speaking engagements — at L.S.U. , Mankato State , American University , Berkeley and the University of Texas .
He takes pleasure in the advertisement of his Texas appearance in the college paper : " Union Speakers Comm . ( the people who brought you Abbie Hoffman ) present : Karl Hess , farout freak , militant , commie , anarchist , pervert !!!
currently assoc. editor of Ramparts .... "
It is these campus appearances which buoy his hopes that anarchy is catching on .
A few nights later I will accompany him to Trinity College , a Catholic girls ' institution in Washington , D.C. , presumably the kind of place parents send their daughters in order to cloister them from the likes of Karl Hess .
But there they are , a large , responsive audience .
It is almost frightening — this matter - of - fact way in which the majority of these apple - cheeked young girls agree that American society is bankrupt .
They are sympathetic to his theme , curious about the practical details of an anarchist society .
For four hours they pepper him with questions and when it is time to lock up the building , they follow him out on the steps in the rain .
But that was in the future .
Now we go back up on the little deck to catch the afternoon sun .
Way out on the river a great fountain shoots white foam a hundred feet in the air .
" That 's one of Lady Bird 's beautification projects , " Karl says .
" At night it 's in color . "
He takes off his shirt , the prevailing fashion in this community .
" Part of being free is to be comfortable , " he grins .
" Clothes should be functional .
A field jacket , for instance , is the most comfortable and useful garment ever devised .
What could be less functional or comfortable than the white - collar uniform ? "
A little booklet has fallen out of his shirt pocket .
It is a membership card in the International Workers of the World , which I had wrongly thought was long ago defunct .
" We used to have a labor movement in this country , until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned .
You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them .
They 're destroying the militant black leaders the same way now .
If the slaughter continues , before long liberals will be asking , ' What happened to the blacks ?
Why are n't they militant anymore ? ' "
Why , you ask , are the hardhats so hostile to radicals ?
" The men in construction unions are the least representative of workingmen .
They are at the mercy of government appropriations , the pawns of goons who tell them whether they can work or not .
They know that their wages are inflated , conditioned on a monopoly given them by politicians and on excluding blacks who would like to work .
No wonder they are insecure and turn violent at the thought of change .
They are creatures of the worst elements in our society , perfect examples of what government and its collusions do to decent people . "
Up at the boatyard office are two men in immaculate white - collar uniforms , F.B.I. agents , it turned out , looking for someone who 's not here .
They will be back tomorrow .
Though pleasant and courteous , they cast a menacing shadow in the late afternoon sun which lingers long after they are gone , a shadow that says : yours is a community living on borrowed time .
You hope Karl comes out of this all right .
But you have premonitions of disaster — the tragedy of a real talent alienated and painting itself into a corner ; the spiritual destruction that perhaps awaits a dedicated man who has been burned before and who is investing so much in the thin hope that the left and the Panthers and the militant radicals will not come to embody the authoritarianism , dogmatism and violence that were the cause of his retreat from the palace .
Some say that Hess discovered the New Left too late , that it is already dead , that what remains is mostly Stalinoid .
So he is playing with dangerous people and ideas , and risks again being caught up in terrible contradictions .
Maybe he will be the victim of state violence ; maybe events will twist him into a position where he condones violence against the state .
Such forebodings are speculative ; what is certain is that libertarianism has many more obstacles in its path than Goldwaterism ever did .
Hess understands this better than anyone , and since he does , perhaps he 'll survive the bitterness and the pitfalls after all .
He has laid it all out in his own words :
" Libertarianism is rejected by the modern left — which preaches individualism but practices collectivism .
Capitalism is rejected by the modern right — which preaches enterprise but practices protectionism .
The libertarian faith in the mind of men is rejected by religionists who have faith only in the sins of man .
The libertarian insistence that men be free to spin cables of steel as well as dreams of smoke is rejected by hippies who adore nature but spurn creation .
The libertarian insistence that each man is a sovereign land of liberty , with his primary allegiance to himself , is rejected by patriots who sing of freedom but also shout of banners and boundaries .
There is no operating movement in the world today that is based upon a libertarian philosophy .
If there were , it would be in the anomalous position of using political power to abolish political power . "
Although the American engagement with the Sunni groups has brought some early successes against Al Qaeda , particularly in Anbar , many of the problems that hampered earlier American efforts to reach out to insurgents remain unchanged .
American commanders say the Sunni groups they are negotiating with show few signs of wanting to work with the Shiite - led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki .
For their part , Shiite leaders are deeply suspicious of any American move to co-opt Sunni groups that are wedded to a return to Sunni political dominance .
With the agreement to arm some Sunni groups , the Americans also appear to have made a tacit recognition that earlier demands for the disarming of Shiite militia groups are politically unachievable for now given the refusal of powerful Shiite political parties to shed their armed wings .
In effect , the Americans seem to have concluded that as long as the Shiites maintain their militias , Shiite leaders are in a poor position to protest the arming of Sunni groups whose activities will be under close American scrutiny .
But officials of Mr. Maliki ’s government have placed strict limits on the Sunni groups they are willing to countenance as allies in the fight against Al Qaeda .
One leading Shiite politician , Sheik Khalik al - Atiyah , the deputy Parliament speaker , said in a recent interview that he would rule out any discussion of an amnesty for Sunni Arab insurgents , even those who commit to fighting Al Qaeda .
Similarly , many American commanders oppose rewarding Sunni Arab groups who have been responsible , even tangentially , for any of the more than 29,000 American casualties in the war , including more than 3,500 deaths .
Equally daunting for American commanders is the risk that Sunni groups receiving American backing could effectively double - cross the Americans , taking weapons and turning them against American and Iraq ’s Shiite - dominated government forces .
Americans officers acknowledge that providing weapons to breakaway rebel groups is not new in counterinsurgency warfare , and that in places where it has been tried before , including the French colonial war in Algeria , the British - led fight against insurgents in Malaya in the early 1950s , and in Vietnam , the effort often backfired , with weapons given to the rebels being turned against the forces providing them .
Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch , commander of the Third Infantry Division and leader of an American task force fighting in a wide area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers immediately south of Baghdad , said at a briefing for reporters on Sunday that no American support would be given to any Sunni group that had attacked Americans .
If the Americans negotiating with Sunni groups in his area had “ specific information ” that the group or any of its members had killed Americans , he said , “ The negotiation is going to go like this : ‘ You ’re under arrest , and you ’re going with me . ’
I ’m not going to go out and negotiate with folks who have American blood on their hands . ”
One of the conditions set by the American commanders who met in Baghdad was that any group receiving weapons must submit its fighters for biometric tests that would include taking fingerprints and retinal scans .
The American conditions , senior officers said , also include registering the serial numbers of all weapons , steps the Americans believe will help in tracing fighters who use the weapons in attacks against American or Iraqi troops .
The fighters who have received American backing in the Amiriya district of Baghdad were required to undergo the tests , the officers said .
The requirement that no support be given to insurgent groups that have attacked Americans appeared to have been set aside or loosely enforced in negotiations with the Sunni groups elsewhere , including Amiriya , where American units that have supported Sunni groups fighting to oust Al Qaeda have told reporters they believe that the Sunni groups include insurgents who had fought the Americans .
The Americans have bolstered Sunni groups in Amiriya by empowering them to detain suspected Qaeda fighters and approving ammunition supplies to Sunni fighters from Iraqi Army units .
In Anbar , there have been negotiations with factions from the 1920 Revolution Brigades , a Sunni insurgent group with strong Baathist links that has a history of attacking Americans .
In Diyala , insurgents who have joined the Iraqi Army have told reporters that they switched sides after working for the 1920 group .
And in an agreement announced by the American command on Sunday , 130 tribal sheiks in Salahuddin met in the provincial capital , Tikrit , to form police units that would “ defend ” against Al Qaeda .
THE radioactive fallout from a major accident at Sellafield 50 years ago was underestimated , with scores more falling ill with cancer as a direct result than previously thought .
In 1957 , a fire at the Windscale nuclear reactor in Cumbria -- which has since been renamed Sellafield -- led to a release of radioactive material that spread across the UK and Europe .
New research claims the incident generated twice as much radioactive material and caused dozens more cancers than was previously thought .
However the findings - which were made by analysing weather patterns - show Ireland was not at risk because the radioactive cloud was carried over mainland Europe .
But residents of Dundalk , Co Louth , which was the nearest Irish town , point out that people in the immediate area had higher instances of cancer than other regions .
It has been claimed that a cluster of Down Syndrome births and cancer cases in the area were caused by radiation .
The cancer rate in the area was estimated to be more than 12 pc above the national average .
Fergus O'Dowd , Fine Gael TD in Louth , said the new research shows that the nuclear industry cannot be trusted .
" Up until now we were repeatedly told we were overplaying our concerns ( about cancer ) but now it 's clear we were n't , " he said .
" I 'd be very concerned about the lack of truthfulness , and we clearly have n't been told the full truth until now . "
He also pointed to a leakage of highly radioactive nuclear fuel two years ago , warning that problems still exist at Sellafield .
About 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium -- enough to make 20 nuclear weapons -- dissolved in concentrated nitric acid , escaped through a cracked pipe into a huge stainless steel chamber which is too dangerous for humans to enter .
Deputy O'Dowd has called for the setting up of an independent body to oversee the plant to ensure another disaster does n't happen .
The new research , which was published in the journal Atmospheric Environment , claims the radioactive cloud spread further than just Cumbria .
On October 10 , 1957 , a failure to properly control the temperature of graphite control rods within the reactor sparked a devastating fire , which caused radioactive contamination to spew into the atmosphere .
The fire was eventually put out with water -- an act which could have caused an explosion -- but a radioactive cloud had already spread .
At the time of the accident the levels and spread of the radioactive materials was estimated , and measures were put in place to limit contamination .
The study by John Garland , formerly of the UK Atomic Energy Authority , and Richard Wakeford , a visiting professor at the University of Manchester , suggests the contamination of the environment may have been much higher .
The team carried out a re-analysis of data taken from environmental monitoring of air , grass and vegetation and combined this with computer models that revealed how the radioactive cloud would have spread from the reactor with the meteorological conditions at that time .
They confirmed radioactive iodine and caesium were released , as well as polonium and a very small amount of plutonium , but found that the levels would have been higher than previously thought .
This would have also impacted the numbers of cancers that the accident would have caused , said the authors .
Previously , it was thought that the radiation would have eventually led to about 200 cases of cancer , but the new contamination figures suggest it could have caused about 240 .
Prof Peter Mitchell , the author of another study , has also said the radioactive plume did not pass across Ireland .
Irish Met Office measurements in Dublin from the time of the Windscale fire gave no indication of any trace of the plume .
In the past the State 's nuclear watchdog , the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland ( RPII ) , warned the plant will pose a major threat to Ireland for another 150 years
After allegedly pilfering more than $ 24.7 m from small businesses and non-profits across the country , a gaggle of web scam artists - sorry , alleged web scam artists - will fork over a measly $ 1.2 m to settle a court case brought by the federal government .
For several months starting in 2002 , according to a suit from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , the case 's 11 defendants forced unauthorized web charges onto hundreds of thousands of American companies , nabbing nearly $ 25 m .
Five years on , the FTC has announced that 10 of the 11 have agreed to settle , each promising not to pull the same trick again .
The lone hold - out , Steven L. Kennedy , looks set for a December trial .
Filed in June of 2006 , the FTC suit claims that the 11 made countless cold calls to small businesses and non-profits , offering a free 15 - day trial of a web site design service .
But it looks like the free trial was less than free .
Though operators insisted that the service would automatically cancel after 15 - days if it was n't approved by the customer , the FTC says , the defendants pushed charges onto customer phone bills whether they had approval or not .
Then , when customers called to complain , operators insisted they had " verification recordings " authorizing the charges .
At least , that 's the word from the FTC .
We have to be careful about these things .
In settling , the defendants have n't admitted they 're guilty .
But they have agreed to pay over $ 1.2 m in settlement costs .
The court would ask for the full $ 24.7 m , but the defendants have official papers proving they can't afford that much .
Speaking with The Reg , James Elliott , the FTC lawyer overseeing the case , said that the money will go into a temporary FTC fund that should eventually be distributed among the victims of the alleged scam .
" Hopefully , there will be a redress procedure , " he said , " and somewhere down the line , consumers will be able to assert a claim against the redress fund . "
Some business have already received refunds from the defendants and various phone carriers .
The hold - out , Stephen Kennedy , may yet get off , but if the U.S. District Court in Houston , Texas orders him to pay damages , those will go into the same FTC fund .
If you 're interested , the other defendants include WebSource Media , BizSitePro , Eversites , Telsource Solutions , Telsource International , Marc R. Smith , Kathleen A. Smalley , Keith Hendrick , John O. Ring , and James E. McCubbin , Jr. ®

Some of the City 's richest bosses could see their earnings slashed after it emerged they were paying tax at a lower rate than their office cleaners .
The Treasury yesterday said it would look at closing a loophole that allows the multi-millionaire chiefs of private equity firms to pay as little as 10 per cent tax on their earnings .
Officials made the announcement after one of the industry 's biggest players made an extraordinary attack on his fellow bosses .
Nicholas Ferguson , chairman of SVG Capital , said it was wrong that private equity bosses pay tax of only 10 per cent , when the basic income tax rate is 22 per cent and the higher rate is 40 per cent .
" Any commonsense person would say that a highly - paid private equity executive paying less tax than a cleaning lady or other low - paid workers can't be right , " Mr Ferguson told the Financial Times .
" I have not heard anyone give a clear explanation of why it is justified . "
Private equity firms borrow billions to buy underperforming companies , before cutting costs and putting them back on to the stock market several years later for massive returns .
They have been criticised by trade unions for cutting jobs , stripping assets and riding roughshod over workers ' interests in the name of a quick profit .
In recent months private equity firms have been stalking some of Britain 's bestknown brands .
Boots fell prey last month to an £ 11 billion takeover by aggressive American firm KKR , while Sainsbury 's only narrowly managed to fend off a bid by a consortium of three private equity companies .
Treasury minister Ed Balls has already launched a task force to investigate whether private equity firms are dodging tax .
But Mr Ferguson 's comments have opened up a new front .
At issue are so - called ' taper relief ' rules which reduce the bill on capital gains from the normal 40 per cent rate to as little as 10 per cent the longer an asset is held .
The reform was intended to reward entrepreneurs for sticking by new firms .
But private equity bosses also benefit from it , because their pay is heavily based on the profits their firms generate from selling the companies they buy .
Treasury officials said they are examining the loophole and added that an agreement between the industry and HM Revenue made in 2003 had been violated .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : " It is scandalous that there are many people on low or middle incomes who are paying more and more tax and yet you have very rich people paying only 10 per cent .
" It is Gordon Brown who has created this , despite supposedly being the father of social justice .
" They never thought through the implications and the way it could be abused . "
Paul Myners , the former chairman of Marks & Spencer , said it was " preposterous " for private equity bosses to face such tiny tax bills when " a police sergeant is charged at 40 per cent " .
Paul Kenny , general secretary of the GMB union , added : " Top private equity chiefs are freely admitting that the current tax regime allows them to pay less tax than the minimum wage worker .
This is an important and significant breaking of the ranks . "
A spokesman for the British Venture Capital Association , which represents private equity firms , said Mr Ferguson 's views did not represent the industry as a whole .
He added : " It is a matter for government policy to determine the most effective tax regime in which the private equity industry should work . "
BANGALORE : Priyanka , an HR manager in an IT company in Bangalore , is a happy mother of a three - month - old baby .
She was artificially inseminated a year ago since she and her husband , a software engineer , were too busy to find time for sex .
Her husband had stored his semen at the Bangalore Assisted Conception Centre ( BACC ) before leaving on a business tour so that his wife could conceive during his absence when the time was right for it .
Sharmila , another techie , was unable to conceive for many years after marriage .
This is because she and her husband , another IT professional , had neither the time nor the inclination for sex .
She finally had a baby recently after being artificially inseminated , when the husband was away , using his banked semen .
At least two out of every 10 ' double - income - no-sex ' or DINS couples working in the IT industry are resorting to this Assisted Reproductive Technique ( ART ) because they have no time for sex or because the wife or the husband is away on official assignment , says Dr Kamini Rao , medical director of BACC .
The number is steadily rising , she adds .
The recourse to semen banks by the always - on - the - move IT professionals is now emerging as a trend .
But their sexual woes have been known for some time .
Long hours before the computer and stressful work schedules are resulting in impotency among men and infertility among women .
The number of patients visiting the Institute of Sexual Medicine in Bangalore has gone up by 10 times in three years .
" About 30 patients visited my clinic in a week three years ago but now the number is 300 , " says its director , Dr Padmini Prasad .
" Sex on demand for the purpose of procreation and not pleasure creates tension in the male spouse resulting in erectile dysfunction , " explains Dr Prasad , adding : " Storing semen comes as a relief . "
A study conducted by BACC in 2004 on the sexual proclivities of 1,920 techie couples in Bangalore found that one out of four couples reported sexual dysfunction .
" The couples did n't have any medical problem .
The culprit was hectic life that resulted in reduced libido , " says Dr Rao .
" The situation is no better today . "
" Most IT professionals carry office problems to bedrooms along with laptops , " says India 's leading sexologist Dr Prakash Kothari in Mumbai .
" The stressed IT professional indulges in alcohol or smoking to de-stress , which affects the libido .
Erectile dysfunction is more common than common cold in India . "
When the Federal Reserve slashed its discount rate by a half - percentage point earlier this month , it was trying to add a little lubricant to a credit market that seemed on the verge of seizing up .
But by giving weary investors a chance to catch their breath , the move also gave them an opportunity for finger pointing – at avaricious mortgage lenders , at naive borrowers , and at rating agencies .
One culprit , though , has not only avoided blame but has come across as the episode 's hero .
And that culprit is the Federal Reserve itself .
Like some renegade fireman , though unwittingly , the Fed played a part in igniting the conflagration it 's now trying to smother .
Because the disaster was kindled years ago , responsibility for it belongs not to the current Fed board but to Alan Greenspan and his team of monetary policymakers .
The fundamental problem , however , transcends the actions of any Fed chairman .
Indeed , the Fed as it's presently managed can hardly help causing sometimes ruinous market distortions .
Why did mortgage lenders earlier this decade start showering credit as if it were spewing from a public fountain ?
The answer is that credit was spewing from a public fountain – and that fountain was the Fed .
In December 2000 , the Fed began an unprecedented year - long series of rate cuts , reducing the federal funds rate from over 6 percent to just 1 - 3/ 4 percent – a level last seen in the 1950s .
By mid-2003 , two further cuts had reduced the rate to just 1 percent .
The general aim of these cuts was to keep a mild growth slowdown from getting worse .
But they had the quite unintended effect of generating euphoria in the mortgage market by flooding it with funds .
Lenders dramatically lowered mortgage rates and kissed old - fashioned lending standards goodbye .
Buying property was never easier .
As one jubilant industry insider put it , " Who could ask for anything more ? "
The sad sequel is grist for the mill of monetary economists long critical of central banks ' attempts at fine - tuning .
It illustrates the late Milton Friedman 's claim that the full effects of monetary policy changes happen only after " long and variable lags , " when conditions that motivated the changes have passed into history .
The result is that fine - tuning often ends up promoting business cycles instead of dampening them .
The subprime lending crisis also shows that , while central banks certainly have the power to expand a nation 's spending power , they can't guarantee that the extra power gets used as intended , namely , to give a roughly uniform boost to the overall demand for goods .
On the contrary :
The crisis supports the argument , first developed by Austrian - school economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek , that the techniques central banks employ to increase spending power are bound to distort spending patterns by driving lending rates below their sustainable , " natural " levels .
By injecting the new money they create into credit markets , central banks create an artificially high demand for long - term investments , such as real estate , in which interest costs loom large .
Think back a few years .
Even your auto mechanic was bragging about " flipping " condos with easy credit .
That 's a natural consequence of the way central banks distort spending patterns .
The trouble , however , is that the new money does eventually swell overall demand , including the demand for credit .
Interest rates soon rise , ending the investment boom .
Regrets multiply .
That 's exactly what happened last year , when the federal funds rate climbed back above 5 percent .
In hindsight , it 's easy to say that the Fed blundered .
But avoiding similar blunders in the future is another matter .
The truth is that the Fed , as presently constituted , faces an impossible task :
It can't tell whether its targeted rates are " natural " ( and therefore sustainable ) except in retrospect , when it 's too late ; and it will always be tempted to engage in fine - tuning , both because the Humphrey - Hawkins
Act of 1978 calls for it to do so , and because a myopic and inadequately informed public rewards
Fed bureaucrats for " doing something " even when they ought to stand pat .
Only institutional reform can get us out of this predicament .
The Fed must be taken out of the fine - tuning business .
Instead , it must observe a strict and unambiguous monetary rule , such as one calling for the Fed to announce and stick to an inflation - rate target .
As it happens , chairman Ben Bernanke favors such a rule .
If Congress gives him what he wants , the Fed may be spared some future finger pointing ; and the public may be spared further crises .

Alexandra hopes to be able to pay off her debts
Often it is because the woman is not producing her own healthy eggs and one solution is to use eggs donated by someone else .
The problem is the shortage of voluntary donors who are willing to give their eggs for free .
So if someone is prepared to sell their eggs for thousands of pounds , there are plenty of willing buyers .
It just sounds a good idea - easy money really - and it helps someone out
Alexandra Saunders
Alexandra Saunders from High Wycombe has advertised her eggs on the internet .
She hopes to make some money to pay off credit card debt .
She says : " I 'm 25 and I 've got three jobs - one in an office in the day , two in pubs .
I work five nights a week , I 'm in quite a bit of debt and I just want to get it paid off really . "
An article in a magazine gave Alexandra the idea of selling her eggs .
" I was sat in a doctor 's waiting room and I read about it in a magazine .
It just said ' sell your eggs for thirty grand ' or something like that .
And I went and put my name down on a couple of websites .
" It was saying about girls coming from Britain and going to America and selling their eggs .
It just sounds a good idea - easy money really - and it helps someone out .
" I 'm not using them so , if someone else can , it would be good and also clear me out of a hole too , " she explained .
Eggs for sale
So why are so many women having to consider paying someone for their eggs ?
Egg donation used to be anonymous but , now the rules have been altered , fewer women are coming forward .
A change in the law last year means that , at the age of 18 , a child born from donated eggs can be told who their biological mother is .
Lack of anonymity is not the only thing putting off potential donors .
Egg collection is a complicated and uncomfortable process , and involves taking a cocktail of hormones .
Laura Witzens is a spokeswoman for the National Gamete Donation Trust .
She thinks more women should be willing to donate eggs altruistically .
She said : " I think the donors want to do it because they see the dollar signs .
There 's a very interesting book , Confessions Of A Serial Egg Donor , and she 's donated five times and she regrets it .
" These girls are typically in their 20s , have n't had families of their own , they 're in debt and they want to go on to donate . "
Easy money ?
But Laura thinks young women who are only interested in being paid for donating may put their health at risk .
She explained : " You do n't know about the drugs and what effect it will have if you want your own child , and you 're not in a position to judge how you will feel if you can't have your own children . "
Stephen and Elaine have twins born using donor eggs
Stephen and Elaine Eades are one of the lucky couples who managed to find a voluntary donor .
Their twin daughters Millie and Grace were born earlier this year .
Elaine said : " I wanted a family and I needed a family because that instinct is so strong .
" To be told you need a donor - I wo n't lie - it was extremely hard to accept because I felt I was n't a complete woman , it was n't my eggs and it was very hard . "
" But initially I thought if I do n't go for this and I do n't take this chance , I would have had no chance of having children , and that I could not cope with . "
Stephen believes voluntary donors are unique people .
" Without them we would n't be where we are today .
They give you a gift that we would never have been able to have without a donor , " he said .
Alexandra is still waiting for a response to her internet advert but she says that , if someone was willing to pay for the privilege , she'd be happy to go through with donation .
She said : " It 's just cells .
It 's not me giving a baby up .
So if it can help - and also it would help me - then I 'd do it . "
Inside Out : Egg Donors was broadcast on BBC 1 West Midlands on Monday 30 October at 1930 GMT .
After several hours spent at the Rally for Reason , several students and I tried to figure out whether we wanted to go inside the Creation Museum .
The upside would be seeing the museum first - hand .
The downside would be that Ken Ham would get $ 20 of our money via the admission cost .
( Actually , it was $ 15 with the coupons we had … but still . )
We decided to go into the museum .
Even though we did n’t have the Creationist attire of khaki pants , tucked - in shirt , and neatly parted hair .
It should be noted that , outside major holidays , the museum is open seven days a week .
What ever happened to resting on the seventh day ?
Is n’t that punishable by death ?
You know , for the $ 27,000,000 they spent on the building , there were a few things they were missing out on :
An air - conditioned place where we could wait in line to get inside .
Instead , we waited in the the heat as if this was an amusement park .
More air - conditioning inside .
Walking through the crowded exhibits , the heat was getting to many people .
In one area , there was a large fan … but that was it .
An electronic credit card machine .
Seriously .
The long line was partly due to people wanting to pay with a credit card … and the machine being used to process the credit cards was one of those hand - held things where you slide the carbon copier over the cards .
You ’re telling me they could n’t afford a computerized processor ?!
Outside in the line to the museum , there was a man making balloon animals for kids .
Because when I go to a museum , its credibility is always bolstered by a man making balloon animals …
Strangely enough , while in line , I was also handed a small plastic drinking glass with the Oreo label on it .
There was nothing inside the glass … and there was nowhere to put it at the time , which was annoying .
But is Oreo sponsoring this museum ?
Or do they not have any knowledge of this ?
And dammit , I ’m still trying to figure out what the point of the glass was .
Anyway , I get inside the museum .
Here ’s what went down .
( I should add that there are some great pictures that Zachary Lynn posted .
I wo n’t duplicate his pictures .
Just go check them out . )
One of the first things I saw was man and dinosaur living together … the man was exceptionally happy for some reason :
Then there was the timeline of fossils .
Where all the geological epochs take the same amount of time .
And no dates at all are provided …
Then I stepped into the line for the actual tour .
You just walk through the exhibits on your own .
I asked one worker how many staff members there were at the Creation Museum .
She said over 300 .
And still , there were no tour guides .
One exhibit showed the consequences that had happened in a world where God was absent from the culture .
It featured a collage of magazine covers in a dark hall with red , creepy light …
They had that collage along a very long wall .
And they always used the same magazine covers .
I saw the headline about the “ New Atheism ” from Wired magazine ( “ No heaven .
No hell .
Just science . ” ) used several times over .
It was like they could n’t find enough examples of God missing from our culture so they recycled certain images over and over .
Later in that same exhibit came my favorite part of the tour .
While explaining how church life disappeared among young people as they got older , there was a sign that declared the alarming statistics of church attendance :
Now , they did not say “ Almost 1 in 3 … ” or “ Nearly 1 in 3 … ” They said “ Only 1 in 3 … ” as if that was exact , then gave us the actual statistic of 30 % .
Maybe this math was brought to us by the same people who say π = 3 .
There was another exhibit where there were dioramas of Noah ’s Ark .
Another area displayed a lifelike version of the Ark , still being built .
Where they got the blueprints from , I have no idea .
The Answers In Genesis people must have special editions of the Bible .
What was disturbing was hearing a mother near me telling her kids to look at the large size of the Ark and the small size of the animals .
“ That ’s how Noah fit all the animals on the Ark ! ”
She added that the Bible even told us how many cubits long the boat was ( so it must be reliable ) .
Her kids just nodded like this was the most normal answer in the world .
Do you realize how much effort it takes to not pull the kids aside and tell them their mother does n’t know what she ’s talking about ?
Speaking of taking the museum seriously , it displayed a history of attacks on the church , including the worst one of them all …
The whole museum was structured so that the 7 Cs ( Creation , Corruption , Catastrophe , Confusion , Christ , Cross , Consummation ) were explained in order .
While each of the first four
Cs got their own section , we were whisked into a small movie theater to watch a movie about everything else , including Christ ’s death and resurrection .
The group I was with joked that they must have ran out of money after the first four Cs so they decided to lump the last three together .
Overall , and I know this is n’t exactly surprising , there was no science in the museum at all .
When artifacts were presented , they were without dates .
“ Proof ” for anything was given by a Biblical passage .
And there was a dinosaur eating a pineapple .
Personally , I think it ’d be a nice addition if they had a scale of some sort where you could have your IQ measured before and after you came into the museum .
We all felt dumber after we left .
The whole experience reminded me of two quotations I heard the night before at the pre-rally .
My friend Herb Silverman noted :
Creationism is not good enough to be considered “ bad science . ”
Also , Frank Zindler , editor of the American Atheist magazine , said this :
We are witnessing the grand opening of what might fairly be called the Eighth … [ Wonder ] of the Ancient World .
The Eighth Wonder is , of course , the museum in which the technology of the twentieth century CE is used to illustrate the scientific misunderstandings of the twentieth century BCE .
What a disappointing experience .
You knew it was going to be bad .
But who knew it could be this awful .

Texas braces for Erin 's landfall ; Dean could hit Category 4 Monday
CORPUS CHRISTI , Texas ( CNN ) --
Bands of rainfall spun off by Tropical Storm Erin rolled ashore along the Texas Gulf Coast Wednesday night , as state officials mobilized National Guard troops and water rescue teams to deal with the storm 's landfall Thursday morning .
Forecasters said Erin , with 40 mph winds , was not expected to achieve hurricane strength before reaching the shore .
But up to 8 inches of rain and a storm surge of up to 3 feet are forecast for coastal areas of Texas , where a tropical storm warning was in effect .
Meanwhile , out in the Atlantic , Tropical Storm Dean was on the cusp of becoming the first hurricane of the 2007 season , and the latest long - range forecast has the storm reaching destructive Category 4 status -- with winds of at least 131 mph -- by Monday in the western Caribbean between Cuba and Mexico 's Yucatan peninsula .
At 11 p.m. Wednesday , the center of Dean was about 625 miles east of Barbados , moving west - northwest at about 23 mph .
The storm 's maximum sustained winds were about 70 mph , and forecasters said it could reach the 74 mph threshold needed to become a hurricane Thursday morning .

SAN FRANCISCO ( CNN ) -- U.S. Department of Justice attorneys argued in federal court Wednesday that " state secrets " should require the court to dismiss legal challenges to the government 's wiretapping and electronic surveillance program .
A lower court refused to dismiss two lawsuits last year , and the Department of Justice appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco where oral arguments in both cases were heard in front of a three judge panel .
The two lawsuits involve so called " state secrets , " which , if revealed , could assist terrorists , according to government filings .
The first lawsuit was filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation against AT&T on behalf of four Californians who claim the telecommunications company and the government used equipment in an AT&T building in San Francisco to spy on citizens without a warrant .
The second lawsuit involves a now defunct Islamic charity which sued President Bush , claiming three of its attorneys were also victims of warrantless surveillance .
No decision was made by the three judge panel Wednesday , and they have not indicated when they will rule on the government 's motion to dismiss the lawsuits .

Unknown noise detected in collapsed Utah mine
HUNTINGTON , Utah ( CNN ) --
An underground listening device deployed on the mountain above the Crandall Canyon mine registered a " series of spikes " Wednesday , but officials overseeing the rescue of six miners trapped for nine days in the central Utah coal mine say there is no way to know whether the information might be significant .
Richard Stickler , director of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration said that based on the location of the unknown noise , rescuers have decided to change the location of a fourth drill hole they are planning to bore down into the mine in an effort to make contact with the miners and determine the conditions inside .
Wednesday evening , a video camera and microphone were lowered into a third bore hole , which was completed earlier in the day , and Bob Murray , president and CEO of mine owner Murray Energy , said results of that surveillance should be available later in the night .
After the camera and microphone are pulled out of the hole , a steel pipe will be inserted to draw air out of the mine for testing .

NYPD releases report on homegrown terrorists
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
In light of attacks and thwarted plots on foreign and domestic cities by so - called " homegrown terrorists , " the New York Police Dept. released a report Wednesday exploring how the radical opinions and motives behind such attacks are formed and the threat these individuals pose on domestic soil .
The NYPD previously focused on homegrown terrorist groups once they were already formed and ready to plan attacks .
The 90 - page report titled " Radicalization in the West : The Homegrown Threat " studies the process by which their beliefs become radicalized and what drives the formation of these groups .
" This does n't contradict the national intelligence ... what this report does is look at the process , before people become terrorists , what we can do to intercede and prevent the process from going forward , " NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said at a press conference in New York Wednesday morning .
The report claims that homegrown terrorist groups are more often not directed by Al - Qaeda but they do model much of their ideology on values and beliefs shared with those of the radical Islamic terrorist network .

Use of spy satellites for domestic purposes to be expanded
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The director of national intelligence has given the Homeland Security Department expanded authority to use the nation 's spy satellites for domestic purposes such as monitoring the nation 's borders and law enforcement , homeland security officials confirmed to CNN Wednesday .

While declining to provide specifics , officials said there are certain details these satellites cannot pick up .
Officials involved in the program said legal authorities exist allowing such use of the satellites .
Some civil rights advocates have voiced concerns about the use .
The expanded use of the satellites , which is scheduled to begin Oct. 1 , will be rolled out in phases , a homeland security official said .
At first they will be used for such missions as looking at the borders .
Because there are complicated issues regarding laws and civil liberties , the satellites will not be used for law enforcement purposes until next year , the official said .

たとえば、あなたが午後いっぱいを費やして製作したオーディオ・ファイルの再生を楽しみながら、「やあ、こいつはすごい音だ!
こっちに移動しておくとしよう」と思ったとする。そのとき、潜在意識が違和感を唱えるのだ。「ええと、だっけ、じゃないのか?」…やっちまった。そのショックはよくわかる。誰にでもありうる失敗だ。だが、失われたファイルを取り戻す簡単な方法はある。しかも、それはどの標準Linuxシステムでも使える方法だから、覚えておいて絶対に損はない。
簡単に説明すると 、Linuxファイルシステム上にあるように見えるファイルは、実際はinodeへのリンクに過ぎない。inodeには、ファイルのあらゆるプロパティ（アクセス権や所有権など）のほか、ファイルの中味が実際に存在するディスク上のデータブロックのアドレスも記録される。 rm コマンドでファイルを削除すると、ファイルのinodeを指すリンクは削除されるが、inodeそのものは削除されない。削除した時点で、他のプロセス（オーディオ・プレーヤーなど）でファイルがまだ開かれている場合もある。このようなプロセスがすべて終了し、すべてのリンクが削除されるまで、inodeとそれに関連付けられたデータブロックが書き込みの対象となることはない。
このように実際のファイルが削除されるまでタイムラグがあることは、すばやい復元の成功にとって重要なポイントだ。ファイルを開いているプロセスがあれば、データはまだ存在する。たとえディレクトリリストからファイルが消えてしまっていても。
ここで 、Linuxプロセス擬似ファイルシステム、つまり/procディレクトリの出番となる。システムに存在するプロセスは、自分と同じ名前のディレクトリをこの/procディレクトリ下に持つ。そのディレクトリにはさまざまなものが入っているが、その1つであるfd（” file descriptor ” ）サブディレクトリにはプロセスで開かれているすべてのファイルへのリンクが含まれる。ファイルをファイルシステムから削除した後も、データのコピーは以下の場所にある。
/ proc / process id / fd/ file descriptor
どこに行けばよいかは、ファイルを開いているプロセスのIDとファイル記述子を取得するとわかる。これらの情報は、 lsof で取得が可能だ。 lsof という名 は” list open files ” （開いているファイルをリストする）に由来する（実際にはそれ以上の機能があり、便利なツールなのでほとんどのシステムに標準でインストールされる。インストールされていない場合は、最新のバージョンを作者から直接入手できる）。
lsof から情報を取得すれば、データを/procからコピーできる。これで終わりだ。
以上の操作は実習してみるのが一番わかりやすいだろう。まず、削除してから復元するサンプルのテキスト・ファイルを作成する。
$ man lsof | col - b > myfile
次に、今作成したファイルの内容を表示してみよう。
$ less myfile
lsof の長大な man ページが、 less によってプレーンテキスト形式で出力される 。
次に Ctrl - Z を押して、 less の出力を中断する。シェルプロンプトで以下のコマンドを実行して、ファイルが存在することを確認する。
$ ls -l myfile - rw - r--r-- 1 jimbo jimbo 114383
Oct 31 16:14 myfile $ stat myfile File : `myfile '
Size : 114383 Blocks : 232 IO Block : 4096 regular file Device : 341h/833d Inode : 1276722 Links : 1 Access : ( 0644/-rw-r--r--)

よし、確かに存在する。さて、次に大失敗をやらかすことにしよう。
$ rm myfile $ ls -l myfile ls : myfile :
No such file or directory $ stat myfile stat : cannot stat `myfile ' :
No such file or directory $
ファイルは消えた 。
この時点では、ファイルを使用しているプロセスは残しておく必要がある。そうしないと、ファイルが本当に削除され、トラブルが深刻になる。このデモで使っているバックグラウンドの less プロセスは、キルするかシェルを終了しない限りどこにも行かないが、ビデオやサウンドのファイルを再生している場合は、ファイルを削除したことに気が付いた時点ですぐにアプリケーションの再生を一時停止するか、他の手段でプロセスをフリーズする必要がある。そうすれば、ファイルの再生がやがて終了し、プロセスが終了することを避けられる。
さて、ファイルの復元に取りかかろう。最初に、 lsof の出力を見てみる。
$ lsof | grep myfile less 4158 jimbo 4r REG 3,65 114383 1276722 /home / jimbo/myfile ( deleted )
1列目はプロセスに関連付けられたコマンドの名前、2列目はプロセスID、4列目の数字はファイル記述子である（” 4r” の” r ” は” regular file ” 、つまり通常のファイルを意味する）。この出力からわかるのは、プロセス4158がまだファイルを開いていること、ファイル記述子が4であることだ。あとは、この情報を/procからコピーする方法さえわかればよい。
ファイルを復元するのだから、 cp で - a フラグを使えばいいと思うかもしれない。だが、実際にはそれをしないことが重要なのである。もしこのコマンドを実行すると、ファイル内のリテラル・データをコピーするのではなく、元のディレクトリにリストされていた、今は壊れてしまったファイルへのシンボリック・リンクをコピーすることになる。
$ ls -l / proc/4158/fd/4 lr-x------ 1 jimbo jimbo 64 Oct 31 16:18 / proc/4158/fd/4 -> /home / jimbo/myfile ( deleted ) $ cp -a / proc/4158/fd/4 myfile.wrong $ ls -l myfile.wrong lrwxr-xr-x 1 jimbo jimbo 24 Oct 31 16:22 myfile.wrong -> /home / jimbo/myfile ( deleted ) $ file myfile.wrong myfile.wrong : broken symbolic link to ` /home / jimbo / myfile ( deleted ) ' $ file / proc/ 4158/fd/4 /proc/4158 / fd/4 : broken symbolic link to ` /home / jimbo / myfile ( deleted ) '
そこで、代わりに単純な古き cp でコピーする 。
$ cp / proc/4158/fd/4 myfile.saved
最後に、目的が達成されたことを確認する。
$ ls -l myfile .
saved -rw-r--r-- 1 jimbo jimbo 114383 Oct 31 16:25 myfile .saved $ man lsof | col - b > myfile.new $ cmp myfile.saved myfile.new
cmp で不一致は報告されない。復元はまごうことなき本物である。
余談だが、失われたファイルの復元以外にも、 lsof にはたくさんの便利な機能がある。

RUSSIA'S Prime Minister has pledged to boost the country 's military might , amid growing signs that he could emerge as President Vladimir Putin 's successor next year .
Viktor Zubkov , an old friend of the President who served as a low - profile bureaucrat until his recent dramatic elevation , spoke as British and Norwegian jets were again scrambled after two Russian bombers probed NATO air space in the latest of a spate of such incidents in the past two months .
Mr Zubkov , whose new position has been approved by Russia 's rubber - stamp Parliament , becomes the first Kremlin heavyweight to declare an interest in contesting presidential elections in March .
Mr Putin is constitutionally obliged to step down and Mr Zubkov seemed to win the President 's support for his bid .
After a raucous debate about what role - if any -- psychologists should play in U.S. government interrogations of terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay , the American Psychological Association voted overwhelmingly today to reject a measure that would have banned its members from those interrogations .
Instead , the association passed a competing measure that reaffirms the organization 's position against torture " and other cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment " of terror suspects .
For the first time on record , the resolution lists specific treatment that the association opposes , including mock executions , water - boarding , sexual humiliation and induced hypothermia .

Economy US Dollar Flirts with Parity amid Cascading Financial Crisis By Ryan McGreal
Published September 20 , 2007
This week , markets were aflutter with the news that the US Federal Reserve cut the key federal funds rate by half a percent in an attempt to prop up domestic consumer markets and insulate the beleaguered mortgage industry against more foreclosures .
The effect on the US dollar was immediate : after five years of steady declines in value , it dropped still further against the euro ( it now costs $ 1.40 to buy 1 euro ) and is flirting with parity against the Canadian dollar .
US Dollar Five Year Decline against Canadian Dollar ( Source : Yahoo ! Finance )
The Telegraph ( UK ) reports :
There is now a growing danger that global investors will start to shun the US bond markets .
The latest US government data on foreign holdings released this week show a collapse in purchases of US bonds from $ 97bn to just $ 19bn in July , with outright net sales of US Treasuries .
The danger is that this could now accelerate as the yield gap between the United States and the rest of the world narrows rapidly , leaving America starved of foreign capital flows needed to cover its current account deficit - expected to reach $ 850 bn this year , or 6.5 pc of GDP .
This is strong evidence of just how inflationary the Fed 's interest rate cut really is .
It also demonstrates the severity of the mortgage crisis , which started with bankruptcies in the subprime lending industry and has spilled over to prime mortgages and other financial institutions , even in the UK and Germany .
Robert Toll , CEO of the massive Toll Brothers home building company in the US and hence highly sensitive to market fears about the state of the housing market , responded to the dramatic cut by saying , " I would have done a quarter instead of a half because it signals we 're in deep doodoo . "
It looks more and more as though the long - predicted - and long - thwarted - collapse of foreign confidence in the US dollar is finally upon us .
The International Herald - Tribune reports :
" This is all pointing to a greatly increased risk of a fast unwinding of the U.S. current account deficit and a serious decline of the dollar , " said Kenneth Rogoff , a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and an expert on exchange rates .
" We could finally see the big kahuna hit . "
Financial institute bankruptcies and the slow dissolution of the petrodollar system are conspiring to erode foreign buyers ' willingness to keep taking a risk on dollars and dollar denominated assets .
It was Iraq , back in 2000 , that originally abandoned the petrodollar system , in which OPEC countries agree to sell oil exclusively for US dollars .
When Saddam started selling oil for euros , he gained 17 percent in revenue as the euro gained against the dollar and earned further enmity from an administration already chock - a- block with reasons to oust him .
After Iraq went off the dollar , Iran , Syria and Venezuela began to follow suit .
All became the targets of steadily escalating US threats , aggression , and interference , including an attempted coup d'etat in Venezuela and the gathering momentum to launch military strikes against Iran .
Iran has abandoned the petrodollar system completely , selling oil for a basket of other currencies including euros and yen , while Venezuela will trade oil for anything .
Even Saudi Arabia just announced that it will not follow the US lead in cutting interest rates , which effectiely de-pegs the Saudi economy from the dollar - not an abandonment of the petrodollar system per se but certainly a rebuke against it .
The only way the US is able to live beyond its means and import more than it exports every year is if the rest of the world continues to buy those excess US dollars , and the petrodollar system is a big incentive to keep buying .
The Fed cutting interest rates was a desperate act by a regulator torn between keeping domestic spending up ( and preserving over - exposed financial institutions from disaster if more Americans foreclose on their mortgages ) and reining in de facto inflation in the US dollar .
They decided in the short term to bail out the lenders and stop the spread of mortgage defaults into prime borrowers , but the result is a continued decline in the value of the dollar as foreign buyers turn down the opportunity to make less interest on an already risky currency .
Sooner or later - and probably sooner - the Fed is going to have to reckon with this , or the US will simply no longer be able to go on trading little green pieces of paper for its imports .
If and when the Fed does raise interest rates to try and attract foreign buyers , the effect at home will be to nail the last coffin in the housing boom and push the US into a deep recession .

foldl
type : foldl :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a
foldr
type : foldr :: ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> [ a ] -> b
The Haskell prelude defines the types for foldl and foldr as follows .
In Qi , I have followed that convention in the Qi Prelude .
The reason for defining it this way is fairly easy to see .
If we have a binary operator that works over one type and we have an element and a list of that type , then we can use one functions as a drop in replacement for the other .
The following code randomly selects foldr or foldl and uses it on a list .
( 47 - ) ( ( if (> ( random 2 ) 0 ) foldr foldl ) / 1 [ 1 2 3 ] )
3/2
( 48 - ) ( ( if (> ( random 2 ) 0 ) foldr foldl ) / 1 [ 1 2 3 ] )
1/6
( 26 - ) ( foldl + 1 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
16
( 27 - ) ( foldr + 1 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
16
( 28 - ) ( foldr * 1 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
120
( 29 - ) ( foldl * 1 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
120
( 30 -) ( foldr / 1 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
15/8
( 31 - ) ( foldl / 1 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
1/120
( 32 - ) ( foldr - 0 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
3
( 33 - ) ( foldl - 0 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] )
- 15
( define foldl *
{ A --> ( A --> B --> A ) --> [ B ] -->
A }
Z F Ls -> ( foldl F Z Ls ) )
( define foldr *
{ [ A ] --> ( A --> B --> B ) --> B -->
B }
Ls F Z -> ( foldr F Z Ls ) )
( 51 -) ( foldl * 10 - [ 1 2 3 4 ] )
0
( 52 - ) ( foldr * [ 1 2 3 4 ] - 10 )

Hugs > foldr (-) 10 [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]

But for as how humans tend to think about calling functions , these type orders make reasoning about foldr and foldl more difficult than they need to be .
Allow me a few examples to illustrate .
Obviously there is no difference between foldl and foldr for associative operators .
But when we have non-associative operators I think the type order ends up harming readability .
I will define a foldr * and foldl* with the type order that feels more natural to me , to display my point .
Perhaps this will serve as a useful guide to others who are attempting to understand the difference between foldl and foldr .
It should also serve as a reminder that when we try to make one type of programming task easy , we may end up making other reasoning tasks about programs more difficult .
I think this quite clearly shows that foldl starts from 10 and keeps subtracting to the right while foldr performs the 4 - 10 and moves to the left .
In fact , I think that this shows that even the names of foldl and foldr are backwards from the perspective of the neophyte programmer .
Nothing about a quick glance at the following gives away the fact that the first operation will be 4 - 10 .
the re-ordered version , where this is clear .
I believe that my reordering makes the purpose of foldl and foldr more clear .
We can instinctively feel , at a glance , that foldl is taking the list and pushing it left into the first argument by way of the operator .
Likewise , we can feel that foldr is " smooshing " the list to the right into the starting value .
I hope that this helps by giving both a little insight into how making code easier to be drop in replacements for other code can actually hurt readability and by helping people to better understand foldl and foldr .
As always , let me know what you think .

What a day .
Apparently getting John Lam 'd is worse than getting Slashdotted .
My team has been laughing at me all day ; we have no idea how I get into messes like this .
Rather than reply individually to the crush of email , I guess I 'll just do a bulk update .
But first : is anyone else as nonplussed as I am that of all the amazing things that were discussed in Foo Camp , my little improvised talk -- complete with a picture of me that for some reason looks as if I 'd just crawled out of a tent 20 minutes prior , hung over and disoriented and wondering why I was in a field in the middle of Sebastopol , CA , only to find that the night before I 'd apparently I 'd signed up to give a 10 am talk -- winds up being splashed all over everyone 's blog , not to mention my inbox ?
I mean , Foo Camp was truly amazing .
There were just insanely brilliant people there , all presenting slick , well - prepared talks and roundtable discussions on vitally important topics such as improving democracy through technology , measuring the health of social networks , addictive collaboration in programming competitions , and the future of Open Source software .
And here I was making the technological equivalent of armpit noises in an attempt to cover my complete lack of preparation , not to mention lack of a shower , and somehow that 's all I hear about when I get back .
Sigh .
So here 's the deal .
I work at Google .
No , let me put it a bit more accurately : I am privileged to work at Google .
It 's a privilege .
It 's something that I have no expectations about .
If you were a slovenly teenager with a rich uncle who for some reason liked you and let you play golf at his $ 250 k - per - year membership country club for free whenever you liked , you could n't have lower expectations than I do about how long it might last .
Not because my rich uncle wo n't last , mind you , but because teenagers just have a way of ruining situations like that .
You just enjoy it while you can .
In addition to working at Google , I also happen ( independently ) to have this ridiculously over - subscribed blog with almost no actual content and far too many lowbrow booger jokes .
Sometimes people seem to get a little confused , and think that maybe I ( the teenager ) have some sort of influence with my magnanimous uncle Google , or that I speak on his behalf , or some other such nonsense .
Let 's get real for a sec , folks .
I 'm nobody at Google .
I 'm a very comfy , very small fish in a sea full of large , toothy sea creatures , if I may ( * ahem * ) be permitted to invest the metaphor with its most flattering possible meaning .
And I certainly do n't speak for anyone but myself .
With that said , I figured I 'd give you the outline of my Foo Camp talk , which will hopefully answer most of the questions that have been flying around since I got back .
By way of background , I 'm on a really cool project in Kirkland -- one that I can't talk about , alas , except to say that I think it 's the veritable cat 's meow .
But I can't talk about it .
So it goes .
Among other things , this meowing project requires a snazzy , Ajax - enabled web frontend .
It 's part of a larger herd of projects purring along on Java infrastructure , so our project also has to run on the JVM .
One of the ( hundreds of ) cool things about working for Google is that they let teams experiment , as long as it's done within certain broad and well - defined boundaries .
One of the fences in this big playground is your choice of programming language .
You have to play inside the fence defined by C++ , Java , Python , and JavaScript .
My project 's playground is actually a bit smaller than that , since it has to run on the JVM .
But that 's still a pretty big playground , and trying out ( or creating ) new web frameworks is totally fair game for experimentation , even if you 're in a relatively high - profile domain .
Another boundary we have to play within is software engineering , including unit testing , documentation , code refactoring , security , scalability , internationalization , and a host of other non-negotiable criteria .
I hope you 're beginning to see , at least faintly , why I love working at Google .
It 's because the code base is clean .
And anything that takes more than a week of effort requires a design document , with specific sections that have to be filled out , and with feedback from primary and secondary reviewers of your choice .
The net result is that for any significant piece of code at Google , you can find almost a whole book about it internally , and a well - written one at that .
I 've never seen anything like it before , to be honest .
I do n't think you can get that kind of software - engineering discipline without doing it right from the start , and creating a culture that enforces and reinforces that discipline as the organization grows .
Whatever .
I digress .
My point is that as long as you play inside the fences , and you do n't foolishly disregard the wealth of infrastructure for distributed computing that Google offers , then you have a great deal of leeway for experimenting with new approaches .
As it happens , I kinda like Rails .
I like Ruby , too , independent of Rails .
But for making web pages , Rails is the nicest thing I 've used .
And given the surprising number of titles available about our heroine Rails and her mute little woodland creature sidekicks Prototype and Scriptaculous , not to mention the vast number of Rails clones out there in other languages , I 'd say DHH was really on to something unique and significant when he created it .
Kudos .
Ruby is on the other side of the fence .
We can see it over there , rolling around in the grass and pretending it 's having fun , hoping we 'll invite it in .
Sometimes it even comes snuffling right up to the edge of our playground , and we have to throw a giant knife switch to engage the high - voltage coils , and there 's a loud hum while Ruby 's hair stands all the way up , and it backs away slowly .
It tried digging a hole once , but ... well , you get the idea .
The thing is , Google 's decision to limit the number of languages allowed for production work is actually pretty smart .
It 's one of those things that might sting for a few weeks after you start ( and not to put too fine a point on it , but why are n't you sending me your resume ? ) , and if you 're a bumbling fool like me it might take you a little longer to figure it out .
But programming languages have a core of standard functionality that everyone knows , followed by a long tail of murky semantics that become increasingly difficult to figure out , especially for dynamic languages with no actual spec like Perl , Python , Ruby and their ilk .
Google very prudently keeps the number of languages as small as practical , so that we can build up large groups of experts on the semantics of the languages we 've chosen .
It 's also to cut down on the combinatorial explosion of components required for language interoperability -- a huge tax at other companies I 've been at , a tax that Google has managed , by and large , to minimize .
Google has set up an environment that makes it pretty easy for people to transfer between groups , and even between sites .
You have to be a grown - up about it , of course , and not ditch your team during some critical crunch time .
But provided you exercise mature judgment in the matter , you can pretty much switch teams whenever you want , and it does n't cause the company to grind to a halt , as such a policy would at other places I 've worked or visited .
It 's NOT easy to set up that kind of environment , and it 's certainly not easy to make it scale .
There are many ingredients to the full recipe , far beyond the scope of this little blog entry , but one of the keys is to make the code base homogeneous across projects , teams , sites , and even ( to the maximum extent practical ) languages .
That helps minimize the learning curve , and thus the resistance , when people are moving between groups .
So now you have all the key factors that went into my decision to port Ruby on Rails .
I like Rails , and wanted to use it on our fancy new project in Kirkland .
I needed to be on the JVM for interoperability with the rest of our code base .
( Take my word on this one -- it 's not something I could have solved by RPC calls ; I needed to be running on the JVM itself for this . )
Being on the JVM rules out C++ and ( native ) Python .
My only choices , then , were Java , Jython and Mozilla Rhino , which is an implementation of server - side JavaScript on the JVM .
Looking at the Rails APIs , which typically pass around hash literals as parameters , it did n't seem like Java was going to be a particularly good match .
Ruby has no method overloading , and both Ruby and Rails have all sorts of conventions for passing varargs or block ( function ) parameters .
Java 's different enough from Ruby that the impedance mismatch might have killed the effort , so I decided to stick with a dynamic language .
Jython seemed like the obvious choice at first , except that it has n't had much momentum since around 2001 .
It used to be arguably the best non-Java JVM language around ; Jim Hugunin did an amazing job with it .
Unfortunately it's had almost no love in the past six years , and it's now lagging the Python spec by several major versions ( 2.2 vs. soon - to - be 2.6 ) .
Rhino , in contrast , has a great deal of momentum .
It 's been around even longer than Jython ; it began life as a port of the SpiderMonkey ( Netscape / Mozilla ) JavaScript C engine , and it was written with an eye for performance .
The Rhino code base reads almost like C code : it avoids allocation and does as much as possible with jump tables to avoid the overhead of virtual method lookups .
It has two code paths : a bytecode interpreter that runs in a tight loop , and an optimizing Java bytecode compiler that turns many expensive - ish JavaScript property lookups into Java local or instance - variable lookups .
It 's a pretty serious piece of software .
When you start digging into Rhino , you find unexpected depth .
JavaScript ( unlike Perl , Python and Ruby , at least today ) actually has a real specification , and Rhino follows it rigorously , aiming for complete SpiderMonkey compatibility within the bounds allowed by the different language platforms .
Rhino also offers rich configurability , has well - defined multi- threading semantics , has a full set of hooks for debugging and profiling , and much more besides .
There 's a lot under the hood .
Oh , and Sun is now bundling it with the JDK ; it 's javax . script in Java 6 .
With that kind of endorsement it would have been hard to justify using anything else , even if some language other than Jython or JavaScript had been up for consideration .
Of course , the downside is that it 's JavaScript , right ?
JavaScript is admittedly a bit quirky , but keep in mind that this is server - side JavaScript we 're talking about , and on the JVM to boot .
So libraries are n't an issue ; there are plenty .
And browser incompatibilities are n't an issue either - there 's only one Rhino , and it works as advertised .
But we 've been able to go a step further and make some fundamental extensions that have made it almost Ruby - esque .
As just one example , in client - side JavaScript there 's currently no way to define a property that 's non-enumerable , which implies that you can't add new functions or properties to Object .
prototype , since they 'll suddenly start showing up in your object literals ( which are JavaScript 's hashes , more or less ) .
But in Rhino you just create a Java method that calls into the Rhino runtime to define non-enumerable properties , and you can extend Object .
prototype to your heart 's content .
So we went wild , and added pretty much every interesting Ruby ( and Python ) built - in method on the built - in classes ( Object , String , Array and the like ) .
JavaScript has also begun evolving again after a long hiatus , and its 1.7 features in Firefox 2 , mostly borrowed from Python , are really pretty snazzy .
Rhino does n't have those features yet , so we started a 20 % project to add them , and people all over the company are signing up to help .
Did I mention how cool it is to work for Google ?
Well , I mentioned it a few months back to Norris Boyd , the original author of Rhino , and he thought it sounded like a fine idea .
Now that he works for Google too , the Rhino 20 % work is charging along like a large , gray , scaly African land - beast , if I do say so myself .
And then there 's JavaScript 2.0 , but the Foo Camp crowd heckled me mercilessly when I brought that up , so we did n't get to talk about it much .
That 's what I get ... Last thing on the menu today : I 'll address the Rails port briefly , since I know there are questions .
There really is n't all that much to say , though .
Ports are kinda boring when you get right down to it .
I ported essentially all of ActionView , ActionController and Railties , plus a teeny bit of ActiveRecord , although for the most part we were already constrained in how we talk to our backends .
Long - term , I think the story is going to be Hibernate .
I did n't use a code generator , since I 've never met one that I liked .
I just used Good Ole Emacs and a whole lot of keyboard macros .
Initially I started by trying to do my own implementations of the Rails " spec " , as it were , based on the Pickaxe book , but I pretty quickly found that Rails is its own most succinct implementation , with very few exceptions .
( I think the routing engine could be cleaner , and there are a few spots here and there where the metaprogramming was a bit gratuitous , but otherwise the Rails code base is very clean and remarkably well - tested . )
We did some extensions here and there for security , performance , and internationalization support , but I 'm guessing I should n't talk too much about them just yet .
We 've also been building some nice tools support , including spiffy debuggers and other IDE functionality for Eclipse and Emacs .
But we 've also tried to stay as Rails - compatible as practical , so that new developers on our team ( in case you were thinking of applying , hint hint ) can get started just by picking up a Rails book .
We 've talked about open - sourcing our " Rhino on Rails " , but so far it 's been no more than idle chit-chat .
For one thing , work on the framework plays second fiddle to work on the actual application , so it 's progressing slowly , mostly as 20 % work .
For another , we 're dependent on various other Google infrastructure components that are themselves in the process of being open - sourced , although I do n't know if any of them have been announced yet .
The real key , though , is watching to see what happens in the Rails - ish web framework space on the JVM .
There are plenty of other Rails clones out there in varying stages of maturity , including JRuby on Rails , Grails , Phobos , TrimPath , and probably half a dozen others .
If one of them emerges over the next couple of years as the dominant player , and it meets Google 's internal quality bar for security , performance , scalability , internationalization support , and so on , then we'd be fools not to consider the possibility of migrating to it .
But platforms ( like languages and IDEs ) take years to flesh out , and they evolve fairly glacially , whether as open - source or as home - grown internal projects .
They need teams of users to build entire applications with them , and during each feedback cycle the framework ( or IDE , or language ) gets saddled with a few more years of work .
I have absolutely no idea how it 's all going to play out .
All I know is that Rhino on Rails is working out very nicely for our little team up in Kirkland , and that curious folks at other sites inside Google are keeping an eye on it to see whether it turns into something cool enough to try out .
And that 's about it .
Did I forget anything ?
If so , I 'm sure someone will let me know , probably by tying a nice note to a nice red brick and hurling it through my window .
You should see the email I get sometimes .
I promise to give you a status update in exactly one year , provided someone reminds me .
I can almost guarantee that at our current rate of framework progress , nothing interesting or newsworthy will happen to our Rails clone between now and then .
I encourage you to check the Rhino site if you want to be looped in on ( or participate in ) the Rhino enhancements .
It 's fun work , and they 'd love to have your help .
And with that , I 'm signing off to spend a little time working on my super - secret home project that should be ready for release later this year .
This one 's a bona - fide magic trick , which of course means I can't give it away .
Let 's just call it " NBE " for now , shall we ?
Yes , I think NBE sums it up nicely .
Betcha can't wait .

It 's Exactly This Kind Of Intellectual Humility And Willingness To Take Responsibility That 's Going To Win Us This War
This is from a transcript of Frederick Kagan , one of the intellectual architects of the " surge , " being interviewed in a new Frontline documentary :
KAGAN : I think it 's important to mention this -- we have really suffered from the fact that the opposition to the war has not been constructive and that there have been many , many opportunities for critics of the war to challenge the administration on the way that it was fighting the war that had been missed as critics through the end of the 2004 presidential campaign focused on whether we should have gone to war or not at all .
As it happens , I also have a transcript from a precocious 2 year - old Freddy Kagan speaking in 1971 :
KAGAN : I think it 's important to mention this -- we have really suffered from the fact that opposition to me smearing shit all over myself and the walls and everyone else has not been constructive .
There have been many , many opportunities for critics to challenge me on the way I 've been smearing shit on everything , but they have been missed as critics focused on whether I should have started smearing shit on everything at all .
AND : Let no one say the Bush administration has n't followed through on his 2001 inaugural address :
America , at its best , is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected ...
Our public interest depends on private character ...
I will live and lead by these principles ...

Yet another sex scandal -- this time , from a DoJ official .**
While this was a sting operation and there was no actual victim , the details released in this video make it clear that Atchison has had sexual contact with young children in the past .
As a word of caution for those with children , this video contains some graphic details which are not suitable for them .

Click On Detroit :
A U.S. Justice Department official has been arrested on suspicion of traveling to Detroit over the weekend to have sex with a minor .
John David R. Atchison , 53 , an assistant U.S. attorney from the northern district of Florida , was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Detroit Monday afternoon .
An undercover officer posed as a mother offering her child to Atchison for sex , according to police .
According to authorities , Atchison made contact with a detective working undercover for the Macomb County Sheriff 's department's .
The detective , acting as the child 's mother , allegedly arranged a sexual encounter between Atchison and her 5 - year - old daughter , police said .
In deposition , detectives said Atchison suggested the mother tell her daughter that " you found her a sweet boyfriend who will bring her presents . "

Back in January of 2005 I asked for Windows Explorer replacement recommendations .
A number of people stopped by and shared a long list of recommendations , however none of them came close to being acceptable to me .
I was contacted back in June 2006 by Jim Kueneman , a delphi component developer who was interested in piecing together a number of his components to create a full - featured Windows Explorer replacement like the one I was requesting : UltraExplorer .
Jim has just released UltraExplorer version 1.0 and has finally given me the go - ahead to announce it here .
Among the features I wanted :
Column view ( like Mac OS X Finder )
Favorites panel ( not a menu )
Drop Stack ( like Path Finder )
Tabbed interface ( like Path Finder and rumored OS X Finder in Leopard )
Integrated command line
UltraExplorer has them all .
It ’s not going to be perfect for everyone and it ’s the first public release , so view it accordingly .
But if you ’re stuck on a Windows machine you should really check it out .
An example of a " booby - trapped " legal brief
with the pages still joined together
I did this after it occurred to me one day that I 'd never won a Small Claims case against a spammer or telemarketer where the defendant had showed up in court .
Sometimes the judges said the spammers were not liable , sometimes they said that the subject line of the spam was not misleading enough , and sometimes they simply said that they were going to make an exception under the law ( " It was just one phone call " ) .
So I asked the handful of other people in Washington that I knew had sued spammers in Small Claims , and none of them had ever won a case against a spammer or telemarketer who appeared in court either .
( The only Small Claims victories had been out - of - court settlements and default judgments where the defendant did n't show up . )
It was n't because most judges said that the cases could n't validly be brought in Small Claims court , it was simply that the number of times the defendant appeared and the judge ruled against them , was zero .
Now , there were only a handful of us suing spammers and telemarketers in Small Claims , and the defendant only rarely showed up , so we 're talking about a sample size of dozens of cases , not hundreds , and I 'm sure some of those were cases where reasonable people could disagree .
But still .
Zero ?
I knew when I started suing spammers in 2001 that many judges would have attitudes similar to this guy :
Judge Nault :
You know what I think about these cases ?
Bennett Haselton : Uh ... what ?
Judge Nault :
They stink .
Bennett Haselton : Really ?
Why ?
Judge Nault : I do n't have to answer your questions , you have to answer mine .
Bennett Haselton : OK .
[...]
Judge Nault : I just think this is the stupidest law in the world .
But I did n't write the law and I 'm bound to follow it .
So I 'm gonna go ahead and give you your money .
But I 'm just saying , it just takes up court time and it's absolutely stupid .
Actually , I like honesty , and Judge Nault is like the hot chick who just tells you that she does n't like your looks instead of making up some crap about your personality .
But after getting similar ( but usually more subtle ) messages from so many different judges , I thought it was worthwhile to test whether the motions I was filing were being read at all .
The 6 test case motions were all filed as part of the formal cases , so the judges were at least theoretically required to read them -- and each one was about facts unique to that case ( that is , I was n't handing in a copy of something that I had already handed in a million times before , that was n't why they were being ignored ) .
I posted the complete list of all the test cases here
I realize , of course , that courts are overburdened and judges have to prioritize what they work on .
The problem I have with that excuse applied to these cases , is that often the judge spent so much time haranguing me for filing some " silly " lawsuit , that they could have read the brief forwards and backwards in the same amount of time .
More likely , most judges probably just do n't think spam is a real problem worth spending time on .
( Obligatory rebuttal . )
But , strictly speaking , that 's not the judge 's decision .
If the legislature has passed a law making spam punishable , the judges are simply supposed to apply that law , not to be influenced by their opinion about the law .
( If a judge asserts a bias in the other direction , that 's just as inappropriate , but that has been very rare . )
Well , shoot , I can't complain
If you feel you 've been wronged , there is a Commission on Judicial Conduct in Washington for processing complaints against judges for improper behavior .
For example , when a certain Judge Gary W. Velie got in trouble for saying " nuke the sand niggers " ( referring to the first Iraq war ) , and for saying in court that a defendant had " gone crazy from sucking too many cocks " and telling another lawyer in court that he looked like he had been " jacking off a bobcat in a phone booth " , the Commission flew ( by judicial standards , meaning , a little over a year later ) into action , and issued a reprimand .
Evidently this was an exceptional situation , since the CJC takes action in response to only about 3 % of submitted complaints in a typical year .
Apparently the last time the CJC actually barred someone from office was in 2005 , in the case of a judge who was convicted and imprisoned for molesting an 11 - year - old boy .
The Commission lists this decision as one of their accomplishments , although I think the judge probably would n't have been re-elected after that anyway .
Of the three test cases judges who got caught with the booby - trapped motions , two of them I thought were not really worse than most other judges anyway , but for the third one , I thought filing a complaint was probably justified .
This was a case where I had telephoned the spammer before the trial , pretending to be an interested customer , and tape - recorded him making such statements as " Well , I would blast out 5 million for $ 500 " and " It 's a United - States - based company but they pump everything through China and then it comes back to the United States " .
At the trial , presided over by Judge Karlie Jorgensen , the spammer did n't know I was the guy from the phone call , so he claimed that he did n't even know how to send spam and had no idea what I was talking about , while Jorgensen kept Judge - Judying me in between just about every other sentence for picking on this obviously innocent man .
After I brought out the recording , she became very flustered for a few moments and then started accusing me of " entrapment " .
( Entrapment , of course , is where you trick someone into doing something , and then sue them or arrest them for it .
That was n't the case here , since he spammed me first , and I called him afterwards just to get evidence that he was in the spamming business . )
In the end she dismissed the case , and never said anything about the statements the spammer had made under oath .
So , that 's when I filed my " motion to reconsider " with the pages stuck together , and after I got a letter that it had been denied ( no kidding ) , I went to the courthouse and found the pages still attached .
After the rest of the experiment was finished , I filed an official complaint with the Commission on Judicial Conduct saying that my motion had been rejected with the pages still stuck together , indicating the judge did n't read it .
A little over a year later , I got a letter saying the complaint had been rejected .
Making a federal case out of it
Fortunately , there is a way to bring future spam suits in federal court , where several lawyers have suggested to me that I 'm likely to get better results ( with their help , naturally ) .
First though , I am of course aware that most spam can't be traced to the original sender to sue them , and that a lot of spam is sent by some Russian hacker or some loser in his Mom 's basement who would n't be able to pay off a court judgment anyway .
However , quite a bit of spam can be traced indirectly to companies that paid the spammer to send the spam or paid them for the leads that they generated , and those companies are usually easier to find and easier to collect against .
For a while , every time I got a mortgage spam with a link to fill out a contact form , I would fill it out using a temporary phone number in a certain area code .
Then I 'd see which mortgage companies called me , and I 'd call them back saying , " The person who sold you this lead is generated them illegally ; you should stop buying leads from them , and should stop buying leads from people without asking where they came from . "
Then I 'd wait until the next similar mortgage spam came in , fill out the form with a new phone number in the same area code , see which mortgage companies called me , and repeat .
Sometimes the mortgage brokers apologized and said they 'd stop dealing with the person who sold them the lead .
Others were unrepentant and started hanging up on me by the second or third time that I called them to tell them their latest batch of leads was generated by a spammer .
The Washington law lets you sue anyone who " sends , or conspires with another to send " spam if the person " knows , or consciously avoids knowing " that the spam violates the law .
If I do file any future spam suits , what I 'll probably do is use this method to find mortgage companies that refuse to stop buying leads from spammers , and then sue them for the cumulative liability for all the spam that I got from their lead generators .
There are several advantages to doing it this way :
Unethical mortgage companies are easier to locate , sue , and collect against , than most spammers .
Rather than waiting for that rare spam that contains enough information to find and sue the spammer , you can almost always trace a mortgage spam to the company that is buying the leads , by filling it in with " bait " contact information .
If you reach more than $ 75,000 worth of liability , you can sue in federal court .
At least one good lawyer has said that if I built a case in this way against a spam - enabling mortgage company , he'd help file it for no up - front fee in exchange for a percentage of the winnings .
This last advantage is the big one .
Whatever most media figures say in their rants against judges , what they usually do n't mention is that there 's a dividing line between judges at the state and federal levels : to be a federal judge , someone has to put their reputation on the line and nominate you .
It 's a horribly politicized process , but at least it 's something .
At the state level on the other hand , any lawyer who wants to be a judge can run for office -- and even then , for most judicial positions there is only one candidate .
If we 're so cynical about lawyers and politicians , why on Earth do we give a pass to judges , when a state - level judge is just a lawyer who ran for office ?
In fact , to be a " pro tem " judge , filling in for a day for the regular judge , you do n't even have to win an election , you just take a class and then sign up for an available time slot .
Given the vastly greater seriousness of becoming a federal judge , I 'll bet that if one of them had been handling the Karlie Jorgensen case , and the spammer said he " knew nothing about any spam " right before being confronted with a tape of his past conversations , maybe the judge would n't have sent him to jail for perjury , but the judge probably would have mentioned something about it .
And if you had proof that a federal judge denied a motion without reading it , some cynics might not be surprised , but an official complaint at that level would probably be taken more seriously .
Besides , the nice thing about federal cases is that the defendant is likely to have a lawyer who will talk some sense into them and get them to settle out of court , instead of digging in their heels the way spammers often do in Small Claims .
They say the best lawyer is n't the one who wins in court but the one who keeps the case from going before the judge at all , and I 'm sure that 's true even with federal judges .
By that standard , I hope that every spammer that I sue in federal court , has a fantastic lawyer .

Of course the Congressional Black Caucus Institute , which co-sponsored the debate with Faux , does n’t acknowledge the major complaints arising from the blogosphere for the CBCI ’s role in lending legitimacy to a biased , racist GOP propaganda newschannel .
It ’s due to scheduling conflicts .
Of course Clinton , Edwards and Obama said long ago that they would n’t participate .
( Raw Story ) :
Fox News has canceled a debate of Democratic presidential candidates next month after several candidates dropped out because they said the cable news network would not provide a fair forum , the Associated Press reports .
Organizers hope to reschedule the debate .
The top three Democrats seeking the nomination — Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John Edwards — already indicated they would not participate in the debate , which is being cosponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus .
A statement from the CBC cites scheduling conflicts and does not mention complaints that had been raised about Fox News serving as host .
How on earth coud the CBCI support a partnership with a network that has allowed patently racist statements to be broadcast unchallenged —
Watch this video from Fox Attacks .
Many bloggers , including James Rucker and Color of Change , gave voice to the opposition to this debate , and let the CBC Institute know that this partnership was not only unacceptable , but embarrassing .
This is the network that ran the bogus “ Madrassa / terrorist ” story about Barack Obama , a “ newschannel ” where Mary Matalin called black civil rights leaders attending Coretta Scott King ’s funeral racist , a channel where Faux News host John Gibson called for the birth of more white babies because he ’s afraid of the country being overrun with minorities .
That debate wo n’t be missed .
Following up on our field trip to MetroNaps , let 's examine the dark side of sleep .
Back in Volume 3 , Issue 1 ( " Our Worst Issue " ) , Dr. Ken Carter discussed five sleep disorders that will keep you up at night .
Which could be a good thing .
Five Disorders That Make for Scary Slumbering
by Ken Carter , Ph.D .
According to the National Sleep Foundation , up to 72 percent of us experience some symptoms of a sleep disorder at least a few nights a week .
People with chronic symptoms , however , can develop a sleep disorder that interferes with their lives on a daily basis , leaving them impaired and miserable .
For most , it 's insomnia .
For others , the problem is much more unique .
1. Sleep Eating
Nocturnal Sleep - Related Eating Disorder , or Sleep Eating , is a condition similar to sleepwalking in which affected people will engage in nightly noshing while partially or totally asleep .
The most common Sleep Eating episodes entail a person sleepwalking to the refrigerator and munching on a midnight snack that they 'll probably never remember .
Other times , the episodes are more elaborate , and the fully asleep sufferers head to the kitchen to chop , stir - fry , bake or bust out the George Foreman .
In fact , reports indicate that up to one - third of Sleep Eaters have hurt themselves while preparing or eating food ( which is actually really low when you think about grillin ' up food Emeril - style while unconscious — bam ! ) .
The disorder is fairly rare , occurring in only about one and a half percent of the population .
Two out of three people with Sleep Eating are women , and three out of four eat nightly ( some up to eight times a night ) .
Most of them ( 84 percent ) are completely unaware of their nighttime snacks .
And ironically , in almost all cases , the behavior does n't appear to be hunger - related .
To make things even more strange , the food choices of Sleep Eaters can be , at times , very peculiar .
Case studies have revealed nighttime meals that include cat food , raw chicken , coffee grounds and milk , sandwiches made with fistfuls of salt , and even inedibles such as ammonia or buttered soda cans .
Keep reading for Sleep Paralysis , Sexsomnia and more ...
2. Sleep Paralysis
During normal sleep , your brain sends a signal to your body to inhibit your movement while you 're dreaming .
This keeps you from thrashing around and possibly hurting yourself .
But when Sleep Paralysis occurs , the brain either switches on your muscle inhibition feature too soon or does n't switch it off when you wake up , which can lead to very creepy experiences .
In addition to being unable to move , many people will dream while they 're awake — basically hallucinating .
The most common hallucinations that occur with Sleep Paralysis include sensing or seeing another person in the room , being touched , hearing footsteps , floating , or even hearing someone call your name .
And for some people , the sensation is so strong they think they 've had a stroke and are really paralyzed .
Episodes of Sleep Paralysis can last anywhere from 10 seconds to a terrifying 70 minutes .
But it could never happen to you , right ?
Wrong .
Studies suggest that about half of us have experienced at least one episode of hypnagogic Sleep Paralysis , the kind that occurs soon after we fall asleep .
Chronic Sleep Paralysis , however , only affects about six percent of adults .
Generally , the disorder is related to jet lag , sleep deprivation , stress or even your sleeping position .
It 's believed that supine sleep ( sleeping on your back ) can make a person five times more likely to have an episode of Sleep Paralysis than any other position .
If you do happen to wake one morning and find yourself paralyzed , try wiggling your toes .
The paralysis seems to affect larger muscles more than smaller ones , so a good way to get out of it is to try to make small movements .
If that does n't work , check for a crazed Kathy Bates lurching around your room Ã la Misery , and make sure your ankles are still intact .
3. Sexsomnia
It 's embarrassing enough to be told that you snore or mumble in your sleep , but imagine being told that you take off all your clothes , moan in ecstasy , and sometimes even pleasure yourself — all without any memory of doing so .
This is what happens with Sexsomnia .
Researchers at the Sleep Disorder Center at Stanford University have classified the sexual behaviors that occur during sleep into three categories .
The first involves actions that the researchers describe as " annoying , "  though not harmful .
Cases in this category include sexual moaning loud enough to be heard in adjoining rooms , attempts to remove clothing , and mumbling sexually inappropriate phrases .
The second category includes behaviors that are also considered annoying but are , at times , harmful to the person suffering from Sexsomnia .
Often , this involves violent masturbation that can cause bruising and soreness the next morning .
The last , and most severe , category is for actions that are harmful to others .
These cases involve inappropriate and violent sexual behavior .
When confronted , people with Sexsomnia have no memory of their actions and become confused and embarrassed .
One case study described a man who was so ashamed of his uncontrollable sexual behavior that he refused to share a bed with his wife and would restrain himself during the night to prevent any inappropriate conduct .
But even that did n't work .
According to the researchers , on one particular evening his Sexsomnia desires were so forceful that he not only broke his restraints , but also two fingers .
Most bed partners of those with Sexsomnia find the behavior disquieting and unwelcome .
There have even been cases of arrest for sexual battery .
Other cases are n't quite as severe , and the episodes of Sexsomnia may be indistinguishable from sex when awake .
One woman did n't realize that her husband was suffering from Sexsomnia for months .
Finally one night , she clued in when she noticed something different about her husband while they were having sex : he was snoring .
Some people think that the diagnosis of Sexsomnia is used to justify inappropriate sexual advances .
However , in nearly every case , doctors were able to document abnormal patterns of REM ( rapid eye movement ) or non-REM sleep , something impossible to fake .
The majority of cases also had other psychiatric diagnoses .
Fortunately , most patients with Sexsomnia can be successfully treated with psychotropic medications .
4. Pseudoinsomnia
We 've all had nights where we just could n't seem to get to sleep .
We toss and turn , punch our pillows , count sheep , and wonder what shirt will go best with the dark circles under our eyes the next morning .
This is classic insomnia , a condition that an estimated 20 million people experience on a nightly or nearly nightly basis .
Strangely , roughly five percent of these insomnia sufferers actually sleep much better than they realize .
Why ?
They do n't have insomnia , but instead a condition known as Sleep State Misperception , or Pseudoinsomnia .
People with this disorder have vivid dreams about not being able to sleep : tossing and turning and counting those sheep .
Consequently , they wake the next morning feeling exhausted and believing they spent the entire night wide awake .
Often a bed partner discovers the disorder by assuring their mate that he or she is actually sleeping through the night .
Other times , it 's diagnosed by a physician , but usually only after prescriptions for typical sleep inducers seem to fail .
Luckily , the simple diagnosis of Pseudoinsomnia is usually enough to do the trick in curing the disorder .
5. Sleep Terrors
Everyone knows that nightmares can be horrifying .
You wake terrified , sometimes in the midst of your own screaming , remembering vividly disturbing images .
That 's when it 's time to crawl into bed with Mom and Dad .
But nightmares , which occur late in our sleep cycles , are a lot different from Sleep Terrors , which happen earlier during non-REM sleep .
People with Sleep Terrors experience sudden episodes of concentrated fright .
To an observer , they will seem awake , but they 're not .
With eyes wide open , their breathing is intense and their heart rate has shot through the roof .
They might even scream at the top of their lungs in fear , look panicked , and act as if they 're in excruciating pain .
It 's okay to wake them " ¦ if you can .
But it 's very difficult to rouse some sleepers out of one of these episodes .
When they do wake up , most of the time they have no memory of the experience or the emotional upheaval it caused them ( and most likely , the people around them ) .
Sleep Terrors usually occur in kids .
About three percent of children report having at least one attack .
For adults , it 's even more infrequent , with less than one percent experiencing Sleep Terrors .

A little background info is in order .
A couple of months ago Google made a confidential complaint against Microsoft to the Justice department over Microsoft ’s indexing software .
Google ’s complaint was that Microsoft does n’t make it easy to turn off the default indexing software in Vista ( “ Instant Search , ” which allows you to search your hard drive ) if you chose to use a competitor ’s product like Google Desktop .
So you would be wasting system resources by running 2 indexing applications .
Last week , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said that Google ’s claims were “ baseless ” .
Well it seems that Microsoft and the Justice department have come to an agreement and will make changes to Vista that will allow users to select a third party application as the default search program .
This update will be available for testing by the end of the year .
Google has bought Zenter , a company that provides software for creating online slide presentations , as Google says .
Already , Google ’s Gmail includes a web - based PowerPoint preview feature , and Google said they want to go live with a web - based presentations editor by this summer .
The Zenter homepage does n’t reveal much anymore : it ’s mostly blank , reading “ Google has acquired Zenter . ”
Another day , another acquisition ... it ’s interesting how Google ’s snapping up several presentations - related companies ( Tonic came before ) ... or can we have reason to believe Google is just removing competition ( or clearing the field from acquisition candidates for larger competitors ) ?

Article on DDJ site
Finding the Convex Hull of a set of points is an interesting problem in computational geometry .
It is useful as a building block for a diverse set of applications , including thing such as :
Collision detection in video games , providing a useful replacement for bounding boxes .
Visual pattern matching / object detection
Mapping
Path determination
Just as an example , if one of the Mars rovers has to chart a path around a boulder , the convex hull can be used to provide the shortest path past the obstacle , given a map that shows the points where the boulder abuts the ground .
This article will go over the definition of the 2D convex hull , describe Graham ’s efficient algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points , and present a sample C++ program that can be used to experiment with the algorithm .
The Convex Hull
There are many ways to draw a boundary around a set of points in a two - dimensional plane .
One of the easiest to implement is a bounding - box , which is a rectangle that spans the set from its minimum and maximum points in the X and Y planes .
Creating a bounding - box is easy , but it does n’t form as tight a wrapper as we might like around a set of points .
Consider the bounding box around the three points shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 - A standard bounding box around three points
We can certainly wrap those points much more tightly using easy - to - compute straight lines , and Figure 2 shows an example that is significantly more compact :
Figure 2 - A convex hull around the three points from Figure 1
As it happens , Figure 2 is a convex hull .
So what is the definition of a convex hull ?
The common visualization analogy for a 2D convex hull is to imagine the set of points on the plane as nails pounded into a board .
If you wrap the entire set in an appropriately sized rubber band , the band will snap into place , forming a convex hull , which is the minimum - energy wrapper that encloses all the points .
An informal definition that has a little more precision but is still easy to understand might say that the convex hull meets the following properties :
The hull is a cycle graph whose vertices are composed of a subset of the the points in set S .
No points in S lie outside the graph .
All interior angles in the graph are less than 180 degrees .
Computing the Convex Hull
So given a set of points , how do we compute the convex hull without benefit of hammer , nails , and rubber bands ?
For some problems , a brute force solution is adequate .
In the case of a convex hull , a reasonable brute force algorithm might look like this :
for all points p in S for all points q in S if p != q draw a line from p to q if all points in S except p and q lie to the left of the line add the directed vector pq to the solution set if all points in S except p and q lie to the right of the line add the directed vector pq to the solution set
After running this algorithm , you ’ve got a list of point pairs that compose the solution set , and you simply have to put them together in the correct order .
This solution will work , but with just a quick look at the code you can see a big problem - a triply nested loop that runs over the magnitude of N , making this an O ( n3 ) algorithm .
That ’s not going to scale up as well as we might like .
Fortunately , a little searching will show you that there are algorithms that calculate a convex hull in a 2D space considerably faster - in O ( n·lgn ) time , as a matter of fact .
The Graham Scan
The algorithm I ’ll demonstrate here is referred to as the Andrew ’s variant of the Graham scan .
Ronald Graham ’s 1972 paper [ 1 ] proposed a convex hull construction algorithm that ran in O ( n·lgn ) time , and Andrews variation is a simplification that requires a bit less computation .
First I ’ll give the terse definition of the algorithm , then explain each step in more detail .
Algorithm ConvexHull ( S ) Sort all points in S based on their position on the X axis Designate point left as the leftmost point Designate point right as the rightmost point Remove left and right from S
While there are still points in S remove Point from S if Point is above the line from left to right add Point to the end of array upper else add Point to the end of array lower // // Construct the lower hull // Add left to lower_hull
While lower is not empty add lower [ 0 ] to the end of lower_hull remove lower [ 0 ] from lower while size ( lower_hull >=
3 and the last 3 points lower_hull are not convex remove the next to last element from lower_hull // // Construct the upper hull // Add left to upper_hull While upper is not empty add upper [ 0 ] to the end of upper_hull remove upper [ 0 ] from upper while size ( upper_hull >=
3 and the last 3 points upper_hull are not convex remove the next to last element from upper_hull // Merge upper_hull and lower_hull to form hull return hull
The details
The algorithm starts with an unordered set of points defined by cartesian coordinates - each point has a position on the X - axis and Y - axis .
To illustrate the algorithm we ’ll start with the points shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 - The raw points used as input to the algorithm
Before construction of the upper and lower hull can take place , we have to first sort the input data based on its X - axis value , then partition the resulting set into a leftmost point , a rightmost point , and the sets of points above and below the line between the leftmost and rightmost point .
Obviously once the data is sorted it ’s trivial to find the leftmost and rightmost points , and remove them from the set of points - these are just the first and last members of the sorted array .
Sorting the remaining points into the upper and lower sets requires that we have some function that determines whether a point is above or below a line .
I accomplish this using the following strategy .
Given a set of points on a line , p0 , p1 , and p2 , I first perform a coordinate translation so that p1 is at 0,0 .
I then take the determinant of p0 and p2 .
The resulting value will be negative if p2 angled off in the left direction , positive if it has moved to the right , and 0 if it is colinear with the first two points .
The matrix that is used to get this determinant looks like this :
A= ( p0 x - p1 x ) ( p2 x - p1 x ) ( p0 y - p1 y ) ( p2 y - p1 y )
For this 2x2 matrix , the formula for the determinant will be :
det = ( ( p0 x - p1 x ) x ( p2 y - p1 y ) ) - ( ( p2 x - p1 x ) x ( p0 y - p1 y ) )
Partitioning set S into upper and lower is simply a matter of iterating over each point , calculating the determinant , and moving it into lower for a value ≥ 0 , or upper for a value < 0 .
Once this is complete , the resulting partitions will look like the ones shown in Figure 4 .
Figure 4 - The set of points after partitioning
Green points are in the upper partition , red in the lower
Now that things are partitioned , the actual construction of the hull can begin .
From the algorithm description , you can see that the upper and lower hull construction steps are symmetrical .
Both proceed from right to left , starting at the leftmost point and moving to the rightmost point .
The only difference is the source of their input points , and the direction they check to insure convexity .
The upper or lower hull is started by simply adding left to the output hull .
Points are then added from the correct input source .
As each point is added , if the number of points in the working hull is equal to 3 or more , a test is made to see if the last three points have created a convex angle .
Testing for the convex angle is done using the same determinant formula as shown above .
If the hull has n points , we simply test to see if p n - 1 is above or below the line formed by p n - 2 and p n .
When constructing the lower hull , if we see that the point is above the line , we have violated convexity , and the middle point is removed from the hull .
The opposite test is made when constructing the upper hull .
This test - and - remove process is repeated until the last three points are convex , or there are fewer than 3 points in the working hull .
An animation of this process is shown in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 - An animation of the hull being built
The final step , merging the upper and lower hulls , is a trivial matter of appending one hull to the other , and removing the extra copy of right .
Once that is done , the actual convex hull definition can be given as a list of points , starting with left and moving counter - clockwise around the hull .
Figure 6 is the last frame in the animation , which shows the complete hull .

Test Code
A small demo program called graham.cpp implements this algorithm fairly faithfully .
In order to make the experimentation a little more interesting , graham provides two forms of output showing the results of the program :
Standard text output listing the various data sets used in the program
A command file ( gnuplot.cmd ) that can be used with gnuplot to visualize the process
The images shown in this article were collected using gnuplot 4 , which is a fully featured 2D and 3D plotting program , with excellent multiplatform support .
Seeing the algorithm operate visually in real time is very helpful in gaining a good understanding of how it works .
The C++ program utilizes a class called GrahamScan that takes care of all these details .
By creating the object and then calling its methods , creation and display of the convex hull is easy to follow .
In my test program , main ( ) executes the entire operation by creating the object and then calling its methods :
int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { std :: ofstream gnuplot_file ( " gnuplot.cmd " ) ; const int N = 20 ; GrahamScan g ( N , 0 , 100 , 0 , 100 ) ; g .
log_raw_points ( std :: cout ) ; g .
plot_raw_points ( gnuplot_file ) ; g . partition_points ( ) ; g . log_partitioned_points ( std :: cout ) ; g . plot_partitioned_points ( gnuplot_file ) ; // //
Build the hull // g . build_hull ( gnuplot_file ) ; g . log_hull ( std :: cout ) ; g . plot_hull ( gnuplot_file , " complete " ) ; return 0 ; }
If you ignore method calls that start with log_ or plot_ , the real work takes place in only three steps :
Construct the GrahamScan object .
This also creates the random set of points .
Partition the points into the upper and lower hull sets .
Build the convex hull .
The constructor
When calling the GrahamScan constructor , you will pass in five numbers : the number of points , and the min and max values for the X and Y axis .
The min and max values not only bound the range of the randomly generated points , they also determine the scope of the axes that will be displayed when the values are shown in gnuplot .
The bulk of the work in the constructor is in these few lines of code :
srand ( static_cast < unsigned int > ( time ( NULL ) ) ) ; for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < N ; i ++ ) { int x = ( rand ( ) % ( x_range .
second - x_range . first + 1 ) ) + x_range .
first ; int y = ( rand ( ) % ( y_range .
second - y_range .
first + 1 ) ) + y_range .
first ; raw_points .
push_back ( std :: make_pair ( x , y ) ) ; }
The data set is stored as std : : pair < int , int > objects in a vector aptly called raw_points .
After calling the constructor , the log_raw_points ( ) method can be called , which will product output like this :
Creating raw points : ( 97,90 ) ( 27,10 ) ( 59,8 ) ( 58,19 ) ( 85,90 ) ( 62,91 ) ( 94,42 ) ( 84,68 ) ( 16,21 ) ( 49,14 ) ( 31,84 ) ( 40,25 ) ( 59,95 ) ( 55,89 ) ( 81,95 ) ( 22,46 ) ( 27,80 ) ( 18,90 ) ( 59,37 ) ( 38,45 )
Calling plot_raw_points ( ) will create a gnuplot command file that produces output like that shown in Figure 3 .
The Partitioning Code
The algorithm definition tells us that the partition step needs to identify the leftmost point , the rightmost point , and the two sets of points above and below the line between leftmost and rightmost .
This is all accomplished in a straightforward manner :
void partition_points () { // //
Step one in partitioning the points is to sort the raw data // std :: sort ( raw_points . begin ( ) , raw_points .
end ( ) ) ; // //
The the far left and far right points , remove them from the // sorted sequence and store them in special members // left = raw_points .
front ( ) ; raw_points .
erase ( raw_points . begin ( ) ) ; right = raw_points .
back ( ) ; raw_points .
pop_back ( ) ; // //
Now put the remaining points in one of the two output sequences // for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < raw_points . size ( ) ; i ++ ) { int dir = direction ( left , right , raw_points [ i ] ) ; if ( dir < 0 ) upper_partition_points .
push_back ( raw_points [ i ] ) ; else lower_partition_points .
push_back ( raw_points [ i ] ) ; } }
Note that by storing the points in an std : : pair < int , int > , with x in the first member and y in the second member , we can use the standard library sort ( ) routine to order the array .
After sorting and then moving each point into one of the two partitions , we have the following members of GrahamScan defined and ready to use in building the hull :
left , the leftmost point in the set of points
, the leftmost point in the set of points right , the rightmost point in the set of points
, the rightmost point in the set of points upper_partition_points , the points above the line between left and right .
, the points above the line between and .
lower_partition_points , the points below or on the line between left and right .
If you call the log_partitioned_points ( ) method , you ’ll get output that looks something like this after partitioning :
Partitioned set : Left : ( 16,21 ) Right : ( 97,90 ) Lower partition : ( 27,10 ) ( 40,25 ) ( 49,14 ) ( 58,19 ) ( 59,8 ) ( 59,37 ) ( 84,68 ) ( 94,42 ) Upper partition : ( 18,90 ) ( 22,46 ) ( 27,80 ) ( 31,84 ) ( 38,45 ) ( 55,89 ) ( 59,95 ) ( 62,91 ) ( 81,95 ) ( 85,90 )
Calling the plot_partitioned_points ( ) creates a gnuplot command sequence that will display a plot like that shown in Figure 4 .
Creating the Hull
The actual creation of the hull is done by method build_hull , which calls method build_half_hull twice , once with the points on the lower hull , and once with the points on the upper hull .
The output of build_half_hull is sent on the first call to array lower_hull and next to array upper_hull :
void build_hull ( std :: ofstream & f ) { build_half_hull ( f , lower_partition_points , lower_hull , 1 ) ; build_half_hull ( f , upper_partition_points , upper_hull , - 1 ) ; }
So the bulk of the work is actually done in build_half_hull , which looks like this :
void build_half_hull ( std :: ostream & f , std :: vector < std :: pair < int , int > > input , std :: vector < std :: pair < int , int > > & output , int factor ) { //
The hull will always start with the left point , and end with the right // point .
Initialize input and output accordingly // input .
push_back ( right ) ; output .
push_back ( left ) ; while ( input . size ( ) != 0 ) { // //
Repeatedly add the leftmost point to the null , then test to see // if a convexity violation has occurred .
If it has , fix things up // by removing the next - to - last point in the output sequence until // convexity is restored .
// output .
push_back ( input . front ( ) ) ; input .
erase ( input . begin ( ) ) ; while ( output . size ( ) >= 3 ) { size_t end = output .
size () - 1 ; if ( factor * direction ( output [ end - 2 ] , output [ end ] , output [ end - 1 ] ) <= 0 ) { output .
erase ( output . begin ( ) + end - 1 ) ; } else break ; } } }
The main loop in this routine simply pulls points out of the input array , adds them to the output array , and then performs the check to make sure that convexity has not been violated .
If it has , points are removed until it is again correct .
Figure 5 gives a nice animated view of the process .
Once this is done , calling the log_hull routine produces output that looks like this :
Lower hull : ( 16,21 ) ( 27,10 ) ( 59,8 ) ( 94,42 ) ( 97,90 )
Upper hull : ( 16,21 ) ( 18,90 ) ( 59,95 ) ( 81,95 ) ( 97,90 ) Convex hull : ( 16,21 ) ( 27,10 ) ( 59,8 ) ( 94,42 ) ( 97,90 ) ( 81,95 ) ( 59,95 ) ( 18,90 ) ( 16,21 )
The plot_hull ( ) method can then be called to create a gnuplot command file that will display the convex hull , as shown in Figure 6 .
There are quite a few variations on the 2 - D convex hull building process , and this program ought to be amenable to trying out many of them .
If you use the existing data structures and just change the algorithms , you can use the existing gnuplot routines to animate your work and get a good feel for how it is working .
Enjoy !

The following are excerpts from John Trudel ’s Thanksgiving Day Address , made in 1980 .
Long , but powerful and a message sorely needed today .
“ I ’d like to thank all of you for coming here tonight and sharing this evening with us .
And tonight I ’d like to talk in honor of the water and the earth and our brother Leonard Peltier .
We ’re faced with a very serious situation in this generation .
There are insane people who wish to rule the world .
They wish to continue to rule the world on violence and repression , and we are all the victims of that violence and repression .
We as the indigenous people of the western hemisphere have been resisting this oppression for 500 years .
We know that the black people have been resisting it for at least that long .
And we know that the white people have had to endure it thousands of years .
And now it ’s come full swing to this generation that we live in ..
You see , this can not be .
We can not allow this to go on .
We can not do it .
We cannot expect that the pro-nuclear oppressor , that other side , we cannot expect that they ’re going to change for us .
They are going to become more brutal .
They are going to become more repressive because it ’s a matter of dollars and their illusionary concepts of power .
We have to re-establish our identity .
We have to understand who we are and where we fit in the natural order of the world , because our oppressor deals in illusions .
They tell us that it is power , but it is not power .
They may have all the guns , and they may have all the racist laws and judges , and they may control all the money , but that is not power .
These are only imitations of power , and they are only power because in our minds we allow it to be power .
But it ’s all an imitation .
Racism and violence , racism and guns , economics - the brutality of the American Corporate State way of life is nothing more than violence and oppression and it does n’t have anything to do with power .
It is brutality .
It ’s a lack of a sane balance .
The people who have created this system , and who perpetuate this system , they are out of balance .
They have made us out of balance .
They have come into our minds and they have come into our hearts and they ’ve programmed us .
Because we live in this society , and it has put us out of balance .
And because we are out of balance we no longer have the power to deal with them .
They have conquered us as a natural power .
See , we are power .
They deal in violence and repression , we are power .
We are a part of the natural world .
All of the things in the natural world are a natural part of the creation and feed off the energy of our sacred mother , Earth .
We are power .
But they have separated us from our spiritual connection to the Earth , so people feel powerless .
We look at the oppressor and we look at the enemy because they have the most guns and the most lies and the most money .
People start to feel powerless .
We are power , we are a natural part of the creation , we were put here on the sacred mother Earth to serve a purpose .
And somewhere in the history of people we ’re forgetting what the purpose is .
The purpose is to honor the earth , the purpose is to protect the earth , the purpose is to live in balance with the earth .
The earth is our mother .
And we will never free ourselves as human people , we will never free ourselves as sexual people , we will never free ourselves until we address the issue of how we live in balance with the earth .
Because all our resistance and all of our struggle is hollow , it ’s false , it ’s another one of the oppressor ’s hypocrisies .
If we do not look out for the welfare of the Earth first , because I do n’t care who it is , any child who turns on their mother is living in a terrible , terrible confusion .
The Earth is our mother , we must take care of the Earth .
They pollute - this oppressor , this machine that has gone mad and run amok , it is beserk .
They keep telling us , “ progress . ”
They keep telling us “ face reality . ”
Well , let ’s deal with reality .
Reality is the Earth can no longer take this attack .
We can no longer allow this thing to continue when it ’s polluting the air , it ’s polluting the water , polluting our food .
They pollute the air , they pollute the water , they pollute our food , they pollute our minds .
They put us out of balance .
They have made us be insecure with ourselves .
They have put us into a situation where we have to play many roles .
You know , we gotta be chauvinist , or we ’ve got to be on some kind of a class trip , or some kind of illusionary power trip .
We ’ve gotta play a role , see ?
We ’ve gotta play a role to communicate with other people .
We ’ve got to go through this charade because they have attacked our self confidence .
They have attacked our self confidence and they have made us to listen to * them . *
They have made us to believe that they are power .
But they are not - they are violent and they are brutal , but they are not power .
We are a natural part of the earth .
As a natural part of the Earth , we have the energy and the power that IS the Earth .
The Earth will take care of us if we will remember the Earth - in more than just our words .
If we will remember the Earth in our way of life ; we are all here to play a role .
And all of the animals , and all of the life on the earth is playing it ’s proper role except the human people .
Somehow we are betraying , we are betraying our purpose here and that is why we live in the confusion that we live in .
They tell us , they want us to believe , that we are powerless .
We are a natural part of the earth , we are an extension of that natural energy .
The natural energy which is Spirit , and which is power .
Power …
A blizzard is power .
An earthquake is power .
A tornado is power .
These are all things of power that no oppressor , no machine age , can put these things of power in a prison .
No machine age can make these things of power submit …
That is natural power .
And just as it takes millions and billions of elements to make a blizzard to happen , or to make the earthquake , to make the earth to move , then it ’s going to take millions and billions of us .
We are power .
We have that power .
We have the potential for that power .
I remember in the 60s and 70s I heard all these things about “ power to the people ” and I never really understood because everyone was saying “ power to the people ” when they were talking about demonstrating , they were talking about votes , they were talking about dealing on the terms of the oppressor .
Our power will come back to us , our sense of balance will come back to us , when we go back to the natural way of protecting and honoring the earth .
If we have forgotten how to do it , or we think that it looks overwhelming , or think that we can never accomplish it , all we have to do , each one of us , an individual , is to go and find one spot on the Earth that we can relate to .
Feel that energy , feel that power .
That ’s where our safety will come .
The Earth will take care of us .
We have to understand that the American Corporate State will not take care of us .
They do not care about us .
Maximize their profit , that is where their whole life ’s balance is placed upon - maximizing the profit .
They will turn us against each other to maximize the profit , because they have done it in the past …
Our obligations and our loyalty have to be to the Earth , and they have to be to our sense of community and to our people and our relations .
Our obligations and loyalty should not be to a government that will not take care of our needs .
Our obligations and loyalty should not be to a government that has proven time and time again that it is the enemy of the people unless the people are rich in dollars .
That has been the consistent history of Western civilization and the American Corporate State Government - that ’s reality .
They are not our friends , they do not care about us .
We have to face the reality that we have an enemy …
We have to come to a time in our lifetime - and it will come in our lifetime - where we are going to have to deal with the fact that the enemy has taken over your government .
The government is not your ally .
The government will use you , chew you up and spit you out .
You think that we are wrong ?
You think that we are talking unrealistically ?
Then go look at your elders and see what has happened to your elders in your machine age society .
See what kind of respect that they get .
See what kind of a voice they are allowed into your society , what kind of input they have .
See what their final reward of happiness is after working for this slave state for 30 or 40 years and allowing someone to exploit their labors .
What is racism ?
Racism is an act of war .
What is sexism ?
Sexism is an act of war .
It ’s a war against our human dignity and our rights to self respect .
This is the war that they wage there .
War !
They are war - like .
And we have to understand that the American Corporate State got to where it ’s at through the act of war .
For 500 years my people have resisted .
For 500 years we will resist again if it becomes necessary .
We want to be able to relate and communicate with all of the people who are living on this land , but we want to be able to relate and communicate from a position of truth .
You all gotta face the truth .
We have had to face it through 500 years of genocide , we have had to face the truth , we have had to live the truth .
We have had to die the truth .
Before we ’re gonna ever see our evolutionary liberation , the people that call themselves Americans are gonna have to face the truth also .
They tell us to “ be realistic , ” that “ progress ” means that all these things have to happen .
They tell us that we ca n’t go back to the old way .
They tell us “ be realistic . ”
But there is no old way , no new way , there is a way of life .
We must live in balance with the earth .
We MUST do it .
We have no choice .
If we allow ourselves to be apathetic , or we allow ourselves to be lied to , or tolerate their lies about what they ’re doing to the earth , then we are betraying our intention .
We are betraying our purpose here .
We cannot protect that 7th generation if we do not protect the earth .
We cannot protect ourselves if we do not protect the earth .
The Earth gives us life , not the American government .
The earth gives us life , not the multi-national corporate government .
The Earth gives us life , we need to have the Earth .
We must have it , otherwise our life will be no more .
So we must resist what they do .
They want to break our spirit .
They will do everything and anything to break our spirit , our will to live .
We must learn to resist , we must learn to see , we must learn to look .
We must learn to step out of this reactionary - ism .
All of our lives they ’ve had control of us through their schools , their TV , their electronic media .
They ’ve had control of us all of our lives .
They have programmed us , they have made us become reactionary .
We do n’t think , we react to what they do .
To everything that they do - we react to it .
They ’re setting us up in the 80’s because they know consistently throughout the past the people have always reacted to their manipulations of circumstance .
They know that the people always react .
They ’re counting on it ..
See , and they outnumber us with guns ,
They outnumber us with money .
They outnumber us with votes .
They control all the machines that count the votes .
They ’ve got it all stacked in their favor .
Except there ’s a key .
The key is we must start thinking , and stop reacting .
The oppressor has no thinkers , they have no philosophers , it ’s all scientific , it ’s all economic , it ’s all manipulative .
They have no thinkers .
You go look and you deal with the enemy and what the enemy does is : the enemy will send somebody out on the street to hit you in the head and the guy says “ I ’m only taking my orders . ”
And if you can come from a position of strength to this guy whose hitting you in the head and say “ Hey , you ’ve got to stop hitting me in the head , we want to talk . ”
Then he says “ Well I have to go to my superior to see . ”
They have no thinkers , either .
If we will start to think we will learn to see , to see what reality really is , and we will outnumber them through the thinking process .
We will take our minds away from them .
Because through their manipulation of our minds they control our spirit , and they know this is true .
They tell us , see , they want us to believe that we are powerless .
They want us to believe that we are becoming overwhelmed , that they can overwhelm us .
You see , but they are paranoid .
They are more paranoid than any of us are , no matter what happens to us .
You see , because they have to put people in here to come and listen to what we ’re saying , so they can go back and tell .
See , so they ’re afraid !
They ’re afraid because they know we ’re talking about reality !
Now why are they afraid ?
They are afraid because they know they are dealing with the illusions of power which are based on the realities of violence and brutality .
They ’re afraid !
See , they do n’t want people to think , they do n’t want people to be talking , and they do n’t want people to think about what they talk about .
Because they know .
They ’ve known it all along , that they built their whole THING on illusions .
And because they have drawn us in to giving this illusionary world all this power , they have taken our power away from us .
Because we believe in the illusions . “

Las Vegas , NV – Former Star Trek star Jonathan Frakes , with several henchmen in tow , staged a raid at the Las Vegas Star Trek Hilton to retrieve his allegedly " stolen " Star Trek memorabilia .
Police fear that this copycat of the recent O.J. Simpson fiasco may spur more stars into this sort of criminal activity .
Detective Ross Porline of the LVPD said , " Please tell me Gary Busey does n’t have anything worth auctioning .
I thought we were through with this crap when the last round of 80’s child stars put me through hell in the 90’s "
Porline revealed that sources close to Frakes overheard him a few days before the incident , exclaiming that " O.J. makes mistakes .
Number
One does n’t .
Let ’s show them how its done . "
Frakes ' “ crew ” known only as “ The Away Team ” consisted of several grips , cameramen , and one makeup artist from Star Trek : The Next Generation .
Frakes ' plot centered on hotel patrons and employees not recognizing his " Romulan counterpart " disguise .
Donning Picard 's Romulan make - up from ST : TNG episode 108 : Unification , Frakes stormed into the hotel demanding , among other things , his old uniform , a phaser on display , and a copy of the Playboy with Denise Crosby in it .
Unfortunately for Frakes , a room full of rabid fans , many of them also in Romulan garb , recognized him immediately .
In fact , it was the numerous prostrate fans surrounding him with praise that slowed his escape and allowed hotel security to close in .

I 've had the chance to review the Center for American Progress ' excellent new report on Iraq , Strategic Reset : Reclaiming Control of U.S. Security in the Middle East .
It 's a very serious report , though probably one the Very Serious People of the world wo n't be too pleased with .
By the same token , however , when the Center 's original Strategic Redeployment plan was released in Fall 2005 it was rejected as unserious , only to look prophetic within months .
Had their advice been taken back then , or back in spring 2006 when they released Strategic Redeployment 2.0 , it might be possible to view less drastic measures as viable today .
But mistakes have consequences .
For all the joking about Friedman Units , it 's actually true that the U.S. has faced a succession of windows of opportunity in Iraq , and now most of those windows have shut .
Realism about the nature of the situation and about American interests requires us , as they argue , to prioritize limiting the regional -- and global -- damage of the wreckage of the war rather than engage in further fantasies that a clever plan and a renewed emphasis on training can save Iraq .
To say that we have to leave Iraq expeditiously is n't to deny that bad things may results , but merely to acknowledge that " many events that some fear would result if U.S. troops left Iraq are unfolding now just as the U.S. troops presence is getting larger . "
The fundamental dynamic is unfolding according to its own logic , and while the course could change it 's clear that we do n't have any methods at hand to change it .
In terms of our moral and humanitarian obligations to Iraqis , CAP suggests we do what we can to address these directly -- increasing the number of Iraqi refugees we accept , pressuring regional allies to do the same , and dispersing US personnel and assistance in Iraq away from the central government to promising local actors , if any -- rather than trying to fulfill these obligations through a doomed effort to micromanage Iraqi political developments .
Similarly , they suggest that the regional fallout from our failure in Iraq be dealt with directly -- at the regional level , by returning our military forces to locations where they 're more welcome and easier to sustain , and through diplomacy guided by the reality that none of the major regional players want to see a spreading arc of chaos .
At any rate , read the report for yourself if you 're interested .
It 's very good stuff , and something the presidential candidates should embrace instead of these vague formulas about a residual training presence plus force protection to guard the trainers plus god knows what else to make that work .
The most important thing , as they note , is that this business of arming and training Iraqi security forces in the absence of a political solution is not just a waste of time and money , but directly counterproductive .
Our weapons and funding are fueling civil conflict in the face of deep political fragmentation and there are absolutely no guarantees as to who these arms will be turned against next year or the year after that .
" The medicine of more weapons and training for Iraq ’s security force may actually end up killing the patient — and will certainly end up killing more Americans , too . "
The training concept has become , in my view , a kind of psychological crutch for US elites who do n't want to face their own basic inability to improve things .
The idea that you could help resolve an ongoing multifaceted conflict by introducing greater quantities of lethal weaponry and better - trained fighters is absurd on its face .
At best , we 're in the position of arming several sides in a multi- pronged civil war in the vague hope that whoever prevails wo n't notice we were also arming their adversaries and be loyal to us down the road , which seems like a really , really , really stupid bet .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

ATI 's Vista Killing Driver
I 've been saying for sometime that NVIDIA Vista drivers are far from perfect .
In fact , they are little more than basic working drivers .
All the frills and thrills associated with those frills are well , non-existent at the moment .
However , they are heavenly compared to ATI 's Vista drivers .
Recently , we wrote about how the ATI Radeon X1950 GT graphics card had managed to obtain Vista certification without a working driver .
Well , the first working driver for the Radeon X1950 GT finally appeared on March 28 , 2007 .
Time to pop the champagne , eh ?
Well , not quite .
Let us take you on an amazing journey with ATI 's new Catalyst 7.3 driver set .
Then tell us whether you think ATI software engineers should be given a raise for their superb efforts or shot like rabid dogs .
ATI Catalyst 7.3
The ATI Catalyst 7.3 driver set actually consists of the AMD 8.351.3 display driver and the Catalyst Control Center ( CCC ) version 7.3 .
This is the first driver to officially support the Radeon X1950 GT .
We quickly downloaded it and gave it a run .
The installer loaded up without any issue , and proceeded to check for ATI hardware in the system .
If you read our previous editorial , this was where the installer informed me that no supported hardware were found .
Well , this time , it recognized the Radeon X1950 GT and proceeded to install the driver when ...
Up pops the error message " Driver Install : the INF file was not found " and the installer summarily quits on me .
What ???
INF file not found ??
I checked the installation folder and found the INF file .
I copied it into every subfolder used by the installer and tried again .
No go .
The installer still could n't find the INF file .
This is n't going well , is it ?
So , I went to the Device Manager to have the driver manually installed .
Hey , it worked !
I retried the installer .
This time , the installer did not give me the same error message .
It successfully installed the driver and CCC .
After a successful installation , it asked to reboot the system .
No problemo .
Clicked Yes and it rebooted ... straight into a BSOD !
The BSODs
Yes , my friends , I was hit by a BSOD right after the login screen loads .
Like all BSODs , there were plenty of mumbo- jumbo that only the wizards at Microsoft can decipher .
Let 's not bother with all that .
That 's not the interesting bit actually .
After it rebooted , I went into Vista Safe Mode to uninstall the driver and CCC .
Believe it or not , the Catalyst Install Manager informed me that it could not uninstall any of the components in Safe Mode .
I would have to boot up properly before it could proceed with any uninstallation procedures .
OMG ...
How am I supposed to boot up properly if I do n't uninstall the driver and CCC ???
Again , I went manual and ran the installation routine to uninstall the driver and CCC .
But when the installer scanned the system for ATI - related components , two error messages popped up , stating that the scan module could not be loaded .
Then it hung .
I had to kill it using the Task Manager .
Fantastic .
To Boot Up In Normal Mode Again ...
Guess what I had to do to get Windows Vista to boot up in normal mode without facing another BSOD ?
Remove the ATI Radeon X1950 GT and replace it with a non-ATI card .
NVIDIA cards work well for this purpose .
After I successfully booted up in Windows Vista proper , I tried uninstalling the driver and CCC again .
This time , the scan was successful .
But I was left baffled when the Catalyst Install Manager reported that " There are no components currently installed " .
Picture me banging my head on the wall and repeat that a thousand times .
Oh God , the stupidity of it all ...
When it comes to such idiocy , there was only ONE solution - the manual and forceful removal of the offending driver and CCC files .
With the wrath of a righteously pissed - off user , I proceeded to delete both the ATI and ATI Technologies folders from Program Files and key ATI registry entries .
Oh , the joy of pressing the Delete button on every instance of the word ATI .
Delete , delete ...
DELETE !!!!!
After swapping in the Radeon X1950 GT card and booting up again , I finally breathe a sigh of relief when it loaded up with the basic VGA driver .
Okay , the card was still useless in Windows Vista , but at least there were no more BSODs .
Now what ?
THE language of life has 64 words , and three of those words mean “ stop ” .
When you have such a restricted lexicon , this redundant negativity seems gratuitous .
So Lei Wang of the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , has been trying to change the meaning of one of those words to something more constructive .
The words in question — the other 61 of them , anyway — are genetic instructions for amino acids , the building blocks of proteins which , in turn , make bodies and the biochemicals needed to run them .
Read off in order from a protein - coding gene , the letters describe how to make a particular protein .
In normal circumstances , there are 20 types of amino acid corresponding to those 61 words ( it is not only in the matter of stopping that the language of genes is a language of synonyms ) .
Dr Wang is now able to add to that in mammals , taking the total to 21 .
He and his colleague Peter Schultz have been able to pull off this trick in bacteria since 2001 , and in yeast since 2003 .
But mammal cells are far more complex .
So to get them to use a 21st type of amino acid as well , Dr Wang and his colleagues had to embrace some fancy biochemistry — as they describe in the latest issue of Nature Neuroscience .
Then , to show that this is not merely an academic conjuring trick , they did a piece of practical science with their invention .
To create a new genetic instruction , Dr Wang 's team needed not only to identify which new word they wished to add but also to find something that would carry it and to glue the two together .
They began by finding a molecule that would carry a novel amino acid to a mammal cell 's protein factories .
To prevent the genetic code getting lost in translation , that molecule ( called a transfer RNA , or tRNA ) had to be picky enough to carry only the desired sort of amino acid .
Such a component is easier to borrow than to make , so Dr Wang pinched an appropriate tRNA he had previously run up for a bacterium and fiddled with the gene which encodes it to ensure that it would work in a mammalian cell .
Next , he and his colleagues searched for an enzyme capable of sticking the bacterial tRNA to their synthetic amino acid .
For this task they looked to the other type of cell with which they are familiar , yeast .
Although yeast is a simple organism , its molecular biology is a lot more mammal - like than a bacterium's .
Dr Wang took the enzyme that normally attaches one of the 20 natural amino acids to his tRNA in bacteria , and mutated it in about a billion ways in yeast cells in the hope that one of the mutants would fit the mammalian bill perfectly — which , indeed , one of them did .
Having assembled and tested the machinery , he then wanted to do something useful with it .
The useful thing in question was to adjudicate between two competing models of how nerve cells operate .
Nerve cells transmit their signals using electrically charged atoms ( called ions ) of sodium and potassium , which work rather like electrons in a metal wire .
To transmit signals , the ions move in and out of the cell through pores — and these openings in the cell walls must snap shut at the end of a transmission .
There are two ideas about how this may happen .
One proposes that the pore closes when a plug shaped like a ball and chain obstructs the hole .
The second suggests that a rod - like plug can block the hole by slipping across it sideways and stopping large ions from passing , rather like a drain cover stops leaves from entering the mouth of a pipe .
An established method — that of taking images of the electron densities of the relevant atoms in order to work out the shape of a molecule — does not offer any clues as to which model is right .
Neither does standard genetic engineering , in which some amino acids in the plug are swapped for other natural amino acids .
Indeed , Dr Wang tried that by switching an amino acid in the plug for a larger one .
His idea was that if the ball - and - chain model were correct , a larger “ ball ” would not alter its effectiveness as a plug .
Should it stop the pore closing , however , it would imply that the rod could no longer get into position .
In fact , nothing did happen , but Dr Wang was not convinced that this proved the ball - and - chain hypothesis .
He repeated the experiment with an even bigger “ ball ” , an artificial amino acid called OmeTyr .
Its extra girth made the difference and prevented the pore from closing .
To corroborate the result he also tried p-benzoylphenylalanine , a second large and unnatural addition to the amino - acid dictionary .
That also prevented the pore from closing .
So , Dr Wang concludes , it looks as though the ball - and - chain model is wrong and the rod model is right .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon is preparing to build a military base near the Iraq - Iran border to try to curtail the flow of advanced Iranian weaponry to Shiite militants across Iraq , the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday in its online edition .
Quoting Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch , the commander of the Army ’s 3rd Infantry Division , the Journal said the Pentagon also plans to build fortified checkpoints on major highways leading from the Iranian border to Baghdad , and install X - ray machines and explosives - detecting sensors at the only formal border crossing between the two countries .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said U.S. commanders have previously spoken about need for heightened border security but declined to provide details about the base .
“ I think what it demonstrates is the importance of border security , ” Whitman told reporters .
“ We ’ve said all along that border security is important in making sure that along these long and somewhat porous borders , that you ’re able to provide the type of integrity that you need to as a nation - state , ” he said .
The base will be located about four miles from the Iranian border and will be used for at least two years , according to the report .
U.S. officials told the paper it is unclear whether it will be among the small number of facilities that would remain in Iraq after any future large - scale U.S. withdrawal .
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Withington told Reuters on Monday he could not comment on the specifics of the report , but said :
“ Coalition and Iraqi partners will continue to put pressure on the enemy , including disruptions of any supply lines , in an effort to reduce violence and to protect the Iraqi people . ”
Lynch told the paper , “ We ’ve got a major problem with Iranian munitions streaming into Iraq .
This Iranian interference is troubling and we have to stop it . ”
U.S. officials accuse Iran of fomenting violence to destabilize Iraq and of seeking to build nuclear weapons under cover of civilian nuclear program , charges Iran denies .
Maj .
Toby Logsdon , the U.S. officer overseeing the project , told the Journal that the new outpost will have living quarters for at least 200 soldiers , who could arrive in November .
“ Iran will know this is here -- they will have to rethink how they do things , and the smugglers will have to rethink how they do things , ” Logsdon told the Journal .
Stanley Allen Meyer 's idea for fueling his dune buggy with water may have been crazy -- and quite possibly may have never succeeded on a significant scale -- but the strange occurrences of his life and death will ensure his cult status and inspiration for individualistic inventors and story lovers .
A recent article from the Columbus Dispatch gives a summary of Meyer 's research , his claim of a dune buggy that could cross the US on 22 gallons of water , and his mysterious death nine years ago .
Meyer , his twin brother Stephen , and two Belgian investors were celebrating Meyer 's creation of a dune buggy that could turn water into hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to power the vehicle in lieu of fossil fuels .
It was March 20 , 1998 , in a Cracker Barrel in Grove City , Ohio .
After a sip of cranberry juice , Meyer clutched his throat , ran outside , vomited profusely , and died .
According to his brother , his last words were : " They poisoned me . "
Stephen was confused at the sudden death of his 56 - year - old brother .
But when he told the Belgian investors the next day that his brother had died , their complete silence and lack of sympathy aroused his suspicions .
Local police investigated the death for three years , but in the end , the coroner 's report listed the cause of death as a brain aneurysm .
After nine years , why is Meyer 's story resurfacing now ?
According to the Dispatch , Meyer 's more than 20 patents on his water - fuel technology will be expiring by the end of the year .
In this time of leaving no rock unturned in the quest for alternative fuels , curious researchers may be interested in looking into Meyer 's idea .
Once and for all , the controversial science will be either confirmed , or discounted as science fiction .
Many times in his life , Meyer was called a fraud and suffered humiliating defeats .
He was sued numerous times by unpleased investors , but otherwise ignored by most of his local community .
Meyer is not completely forgotten , however .
Besides his self - created documentary in 1980 , he was featured in a BBC documentary in 1995 , and is part of a book by Kentucky Water Fuel Museum owner James Robey called Water Car published in 2006 .
In the BBC documentary , called It Runs on Water and narrated by science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke , Meyer demonstrated his " water fuel cell " in a car .
He said that his 1.6 liter Volkswagon Dune Buggy could cross the US on 22 gallons of water .
This is because the car could supposedly run perpetually without fuel since the car 's battery could be continuously recharged .
He never demonstrated this claim , though , and lawsuits followed .
The idea behind Meyer 's innovation is the simple process of electrolysis .
By passing an electrical current through water , the bonded hydrogen and oxygen can be separated and burned to power a car engine .
Electrolysis has been known since at least the 1800s , and is used today to create a small amount of hydrogen in power plants , to produce certain elements , and to produce the oxygen breathed by astronauts in space .
High - temperature electrolysis ( HTE ) is even currently being investigated for hydrogen car fuel , although scientists explain that HTE is much less efficient than other methods for producing hydrogen .
That 's where Meyer 's claims become dubious to experts .
According to Michael Faraday 's First Law of Electrolysis in 1832 , the amount of elements separated by an electrical current is proportional to the amount of charge applied .
This amount of electrical energy is very large , and as a law of physics , it can't be changed .
Meyer 's work , however , claims an ultra-high conversion efficiency - in essence , defying the law of conservation of energy .
Yet , a few of his inventions did work .
For example , Charles Hughes , who gave Meyer use of his garage for private work space in the late ‘ 70s , said that Meyer repaid him by making him things , some of which worked and some did n't .
One invention that worked was rigging up Hughes ' tractor to run on well water for 15 minutes .
Hughes said that , when he smelled the exhaust , there were no fumes - only pure clean air .
Like all science , Meyer 's claims can't be believed until thoroughly tested and validated , if anyone ever takes that initiative ( and finds funding ) .
Even if his ideas went a bit too far , his innovations can be considered one of the earliest investigations into an improved hydrogen fuel .
From reading about his buyout offers and threats to stop his work by foreign governments , it 's clear that at least some people believed in his work .
More information on Meyer 's research , lawsuits , interviews , and patents can be found on Wikipedia 's Water Fuel Cell page , as well as many more controversial sites throughout the Web .

The Kashagan oilfield is the biggest found for 30 years
Kazakhstan 's parliament has passed a law allowing the government to break contracts with foreign companies .
The law still needs to be ratified by the president .
But it comes at a time when foreign investors in the oil rich central Asian republic are already feeling uneasy .
There is currently a dispute between the government and a consortium of Western oil companies over the massive Kashagan oilfield .
In an interview with the BBC , the country 's prime minister Karim Masimov said that his government will take the consortium to arbitration , if the sides do n't find a speedy solution to the dispute .
Kashagan is the biggest oilfield discovered anywhere in the world in the past three decades .
A month ago , the Kazakh government ordered Agip KCO , the Italian operator of the project , to halt work at Kashagan and began renegotiating terms of the contract they signed back in 2001 .
Asked why the government was not willing to honour the contract , Mr Masimov said the agreement should have been respected by all sides and that the consortium of companies , led by Italy 's Eni , that breached the agreement .
' Plan B '
The prime minister accused the consortium , which includes Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell , of delaying production and violating a number of environmental and tax regulations .
" We want our national company to be a co-operator on this project and if we do n't find an agreement with a potential consortium , we have a plan B , " the prime minister warned .
" Everyone involved in the negotiation knows exactly what that plan B is , but its too early for me to announce it , " he added .
He said international arbitration was definitely a possibility .
Resource nationalism
In the meantime , the parliament is in the process of adopting a law that would make it easier for the state to terminate or change contracts with foreign investors .
For many , all of this is part of an emerging regional trend towards resource nationalism .
But Mr Masimov dismissed comparisons between Kazakhstan and Russia , where BP recently faced a similar problem .
" Russia is Russia and it's not my story , but I can say for sure that in Kazakhstan the dispute over Kashagan has nothing to do with nationalisation of resources , " Mr Masimov said .
He added that it was a one - off case and that investors should not see it as the start of a trend .
" Chevron is working here without any problems , " he said .
" I recently met with the president of Chevron and chief executive of British Gas , and we talked and we have no problem with them . "
" But I told them , if they do n't fulfil what they promised we will have questions for them too . "
Many Western businessmen here in Kazakhstan say they have mixed feelings about the dispute over Kashagan and the consequences it will have for the investment climate .
Many of them say that the government has good reasons to question the management of the project and delays in production .
But at the same time , they worry that this oil rich country , which used to be so open to western investment , is becoming more assertive and more difficult to deal with .
A new survey by the British polling agency ORB reports over one million Iraqis have been killed by violence since the 2003 invasion .
This number is even higher than that derived from the so - called " Lancet study " of Gilbert Burnham et al that last summer found about 650,00 total excess deaths from violence and deteriorating health conditions .
The Lancet study has been subjected to relentless attack by the American and British governments , by Iraq Body Count , by those alleging that its methodology had a " main street bias , " and by others .
During the controversy , independdent erplication of the Lancet findings were sorely missing .
While it 's early to be sure , as details are not yet available , this new survey provides the potential replication , supporting the claim that violent deaths in Iraq are in the many hundreds of thousands .
Here is the press release [ See also the LA Times article . ] :
PRESS RELEASE
More than 1,000,000 Iraqis murdered since 2003 invasion
In the week in which General Patraeus reports back to US Congress on the impact the recent ' surge ' is having in Iraq , a new poll reveals that more than 1,000,000 Iraqi citizens have been murdered since the invasion took place in 2003 Previous estimates , most noticeably the one published in the Lancet in October 2006 , suggested almost half
this number ( 654,965 deaths ) .
These findings come from a poll released today by O.R.B. , the British polling agency that have been tracking public opinion in Iraq since 2005 .
In conjunction with their Iraqi fieldwork agency a representative sample of 1,461 adults aged 18 + answered the following question :-
Q How many members of your household , if any , have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age ) ?
Please note that I mean
those who were actually living under your roof .
None 78 % One death 16 % Two deaths 5 % Three deaths 1 % Four + deaths 0.002 % Given that from the 2005 census there are a total of 4,050,597 households this data suggests a total of 1,220,580 deaths since the invasion in 2003 .
Detailed analysis ( which is available on our website ) indicates that almost one in two households in Baghdad have lost a family member , significantly higher than in any other area of the country .
The governorates of Diyala ( 42 % ) and Ninewa ( 35 % ) were next .
The poll also questioned the surviving relatives on the method in which their loved ones were killed .
It reveals that 48 % died from a gunshot wound , 20 % from the impact of a car bomb , 9 % from aerial bombardment , 6 % as a result of an accident and 6 % from another blast / ordnance .
This is significant because more often that not it is car bombs and aerial bombardments that make the news – with gunshots rarely in the headlines .
As well as a murder rate that now exceeds the Rwanda genocide from 1994 ( 800,000 murdered ) , not only have more than one million been injured but our poll calculates that of the millions of Iraqis that have fled their neighbourhoods , 52 % have moved within Iraq but 48 % have crossed its borders , with Syria taking the brunt of refugees .
And for those left in Iraq , although 81 % may describe the availability of basic groceries such as bread and fresh vegetables as " very / fairly good " , more than one in two ( 54 % ) consider them to be " expensive " .

CNN 's Baghdad reporter : Beware of ' smoke and mirrors from the administration ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 17 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?
Get headlines instantly with RSS .
CNN 's Wolf Blitzer spoke on Tuesday with Baghdad correspondent Michael Ware , asking him about the newly - released National Intelligence Estimate which " suggested al Qaeda is seeking to leverage al Qaeda in Iraq for attacks against US targets outside of Iraq . "
" That statement in the NIE is about three years too late , " Ware responded .
" Al Qaeda has reorganized itself through the war in Iraq that America handed it on a silver platter in its own backyard .
...
The war here ... has energized the jihadi community across the globe . "
Ware asserted that " Iraq veterans " among foreign terrorists " are creating a whole new momentum back in their homelands , " but said that " the true danger of al Qaeda in Iraq is the template or the model it offers " even to those who have never been to Iraq .
Equally quick to insist that the NIE should not be taken too literally , Ware said , " We must be aware of the spin , the smoke and mirrors from the administration , trying to reshape the message on Iraq being specifically about al Qaeda ... trying to evoke some Pavlovian response from the American public to fear them into again supporting the war .
That does n't quite hold water . "
Blitzer asked Ware about the statement by Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , that he has seen a " sea change " in the security situation on his current visit to Iraq .
" With the greatest of respect ... I think the general , unfortunately , is suffering from the luxury of distance , " replied Ware .
" I think he 's expecting far too much to be able to peer through the US bubble of protection . "
Ware pointed out , for example , that attacks against US forces by al Qaeda in Anbar Province may have dropped significantly , but only because " America 's subcontracted out the fight against al Qaeda to the Baathist insurgents and the tribes . "
" Is there a sea- change in Baghdad ? "
Ware concluded .
" Well , if he 's seeing one , I 'm afraid I 'm not .
Maybe you can see it from the Green Zone , but you can't see it out here in the Red Zone where Iraqis live . "

A U.S. citizen who had been in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department before he disappeared in May after being wrongly deported to Mexico was found this week and ordered released to his family .
Pedro Guzman , 29 , who is developmentally disabled , was taken into custody Sunday while trying to cross the border at Calexico , Mexico , said Michael Soller , a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California .
The ACLU has represented Guzman ’s family in its attempts to get the federal government to help find him .
Guzman , of Lancaster , was transported to the Los Angeles County Jail .
On Tuesday at a hearing in the Antelope Valley , Superior Court Judge Carlos Chung ordered him released to his family .
Guzman , who cannot read or write , spent much of the 89 days in Baja , California , on foot , avoiding human contact , eating from garbage cans and bathing in rivers , family members said at an afternoon news conference at the ACLU ’s Los Angeles office .
Guzman , who was said to be malnourished and afraid of people , remained at home in Lancaster with relatives .

“ They did n’t return me back my whole son , ” said his mother , Maria Carbajal , who broke down sobbing .
“ They returned half my son to me .
He is n’t normal . ”
Carbajal said Guzman tried to cross the border on several occasions but was turned away by U.S. officials .
She said he had probably walked about 100 miles during his ordeal .
Guzman was arrested earlier this year on charges of trespassing and spraying graffiti at an airplane junkyard in Lancaster .
In April , he was sentenced to 120 days in jail , but that was reduced to 40 days .
On May 11 , before his sentence was up , Guzman called his family from Tijuana and told them he had been deported .

Sheriff ’s officials had turned Guzman over to federal immigration agents after he apparently indicated that he was born in Mexico .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials denied at the time that anything improper was done , issuing a statement that said it deports individuals only “ when all available credible evidence suggests the person is an alien .
That process was followed here and ICE has no reason to believe that it improperly removed Pedro Guzman . ”
On Tuesday , an immigration official reiterated the agency ’s position .
“ We ’re confident our standards and procedures were followed correctly , ” spokeswoman Lori Haley said .
Immigration officials declined to comment on Guzman ’s apprehension at the border because of pending litigation brought against the agency by his family .
Mark Rosenbaum , the legal director for the ACLU ’s Southern California chapter , lambasted the federal government for deporting Guzman , and then for not helping to search for him .
The ACLU sued the government unsuccessfully to force it to look for Guzman .

After a June hearing , U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson said he was not convinced that he had the authority to order the government to help in the search for Guzman , but that it would be the right and moral thing to do .
Rosenbaum said that job ultimately fell to the family .
He said Carbajal had to leave her job as a cook at Jack in the Box to look for her son , while other family members traveled repeatedly to Tijuana to help in the search .
“ The family spent all of its savings and most of the last three months living at a fruit warehouse in Tijuana and sleeping in cars while they searched for Guzman , using up all their savings in the process , ” Rosenbaum said .
“ For the past 88 days , our government failed its defining purpose . . . only perhaps redeemed by a family that would not be swayed . ”

In a programming language with constrained types we can construct a type like " the type of pairs of X's where the two X's are distinct " .
But can we make such a type in Haskell ?
Answering this question will take us on a long journey which I think I 'm going to split over three parts .
And as usual , just put this blog post into a file called main.lhs and you can run it withWe can write our question a little more formally .
Given a type X , can we form a type U with the property that The idea is that the = sign is an isomorphism with the property that the diagonal in X , ie .
elements of the form ( x , x ) , get mapped to the right component of U+X .
When we are able to do this , we 'll call U the antidiagonal of X , and say that X is splittable .
We can express the relationship between U and X through a multiparameter type classThe isomorphism between Xand X+U is given byand .
But to save writing similar code over and over again , and to ensure we really are mapping the diagonal of Xcorrectly , we define these in terms ofand .
( Note thatis partial , it 's only guaranteed to take a value off the diagonal . ) Just to get into the swing of things , here 's a simple example :
It 's not hard to check thatandare mutual inverses and that .
You can view this as a special case of 2=2+2 as 2 is essentially a synonym for
It looks a lot like what we 're trying to do is subtract types by forming X - X or X ( X - 1 ) .
Much as I 've enjoyed trying to find interpretations of conventional algebra and calculus in the context of the algebra of types , subtraction of types , in general , really does n't make much sense .
Consider what we might mean by X - 1 .
If X=then we could simply defineThis certainly has some of the properties you might expect of - 1 , such as having only one instance .
But it 's not very natural .
How should we embed this type back in ?
There are two obvious ways of doing it and neither stands out as better than the other , and neither is a natural choice .
But what we 've shown above is that there is a natural way to subtract X from Xbecause a copy of X appears naturally in Xas the diagonal .
So the question is , can we extend this notion to types beyondHow about a theorem .
( I 'll give a more intuitive explanation below . )
In any commutative semiring fix a and b .
If the equation a=u+a has a solution , and the equation b=v+b has a solution , then the equations ( a+b ) =x + ( a+b ) and ( ab ) =y+ab also have solutions .
Simply defineandQEDSo if some types are splittable , so are their sums and products .
As types form a commutative semiring we see that this theorem , twined with 1=1+0 allows us to form " X ( X - 1 ) " for any type X built purely using non-recursive Haskell data declarations .
In fact , we can use the above theorem to define " X ( X - 1 ) " for types , and use the notation Xfor this .
( I hope your browser shows that the exponent here is underlined . )
There 's a reason I use this notation which I 'll get to later .
So ( a+b ) =a+b+2 ab and ( ab ) =ab+ba+aHere 's a more intuitive explanation of that theorem above .
Suppose u and v are both in .
Then there are several ways they could be different to each other .
For example , they could both be of the formin which case u =and v =and u' and v' must be distinct .
They could be of the formandin which case it does n't matter what u' and v' are .
A little thought shows there are four distinct cases in total .
These can be written in algebraic notation as u+v+ab+ba=u+v+2ab .
To make this clearer , here 's an implementation : A similar argument can be carried through forleading to :
This all works very well , but at this point it becomes clear that Haskell has some weaknesses .
The typeis isomorphic toso we should be able to use the above code to construct the antidiagonal ofautomatically .
But Haskell does n't give us access to that information .
We can't ask , at runtime , ifis the sum of more primitive types .
There are a number of solutions to this problem - we can use various more generic types of Haskell , or use Template Haskell .
But I 'm just going to stick with Haskell and manually construct the antidiagonal .
( I wonder what Coq has to offer here . )
So I 've solved the problem for ' finite ' types built from singles , addition and multiplication .
But what about recursive types .
Before doing that , let 's consider an approach to forming the antidiagonal of the naturals .
Haskell has no natural type but let 's pretend anywayThere 's an obvious packing of a distinct pair of naturals as a pair of naturals : ( I had to useto work around a blogger .com HTML bug ! )
It 'd be cool if the code above could have been derived automatically , but alas it 's not to be .
But we can get something formally similar .
Define the natural numbers like this : A natural is zero or the successor of a natural .
Algebraically this is just N=1+N .
Now we wish to find N. Using 1=0 and the earlier theorem we get M=1+N+2N , ie .
M=M+2N .
Let 's code this up : Note that I 've more or less just coded up the same thing as what I did forabove .
Can you see that that this is a disguised version of the code for the antidiagonal ofabove ?
Think about the type N=1+N .
We can view this as the set of paths through this finite state diagram , starting at N and ending at 1 : Essentially there 's just one path for each natural number , and this number counts how many times you loop around .
Now consider the same sort of thing with the type M=M+2N , starting at M and ending at 1 : We can describe such paths by the number of loops taken at M , the number of loops taken at N , and aspecifying whether we took path 0 or 1 from state 2 to state N .
In other words , M is much the same thing asabove !
M is a kind of ' compressed ' version of a pair of N's .
Suppose we want toand .
Both of these share apart .
What the type M does is allow you to factor out this part ( that 's the part that goes into ) and the remainder is stored in thepart , with a boolean specifying whether it was the first or second natural that terminated first .
Let 's step back or a second .
Earlier I showed how for any type X , built from addition , multiplication and 1 , we could form X . Now we 've gone better , we can now form Xeven for recursive types .
( At least for data , not codata . )
We have n't defined subtraction in general , but we have shown how to form X ( X - 1 ) in a meaningful way .
Let 's try lists of booleans next , .
We can write this type as L=1+2L .
Let 's do the algebra above to find P = LIn other words P = 4P+6L .
The easiest thing is to code this up .
Remember that each ' = ' sign in the above derivation corresponds to an isomorphism defined byandso after lots of unpacking , and rewriting 4P+6L as 2L+2L+2P+2L+2P
we get This looks pretty hairy , but it 's really just a slight extension of the M=M+2N example .
What 's happening is that if two lists have the same prefix , thenmakes that sharing explicit .
In other words this type implements a form of compression by factoring out shared prefixes .
Unfortunately it took a bit of work to code that up .
However , if we were programming in generic Haskell , the above would come absolutely for free once we 'd defined how to handle addition and multiplication of types .
What 's more , it does n't stop with lists .
If you try it with trees you automatically get factoring of common subtrees and it works with any other datatype you can build from a Haskell data declaration ( that does n't use builtin primitive types likeor ) .
So now I can say why I used the underlined superscript notation .
It 's the falling factorial .
More generally X=X ( X - 1 ) ... ( X - n+1 ) .
You may be able to guess what this actually means - it's an n-tuple with n distinct elements .
Unfortunately , you can probably see that generalising the above theorem to n from 2 gets a bit messy .
But ( and this is what I really want to talk about ) there 's an amazing bit of calculus that allows you to define a generating function ( more like generating functor ) that gives you all of the Xin one go .
But before I can talk about that I need to write a blog about generalised tries ... Here are some exercises .
(1) Can you code up the antidiagonal of binary boolean trees , T = 2 +T( 2 )
There are more efficient ways to define the naturals than through the successor function .
Can you come up with a more efficient binary scheme and then code up its antidiagonal ?
(3) The antidiagonal of the integers can be approximated by .
This seems a bit useless - after all , the whole point of what I 've written above is to split this up .
But we can use this approximation to construct approximations of other types where you do get a payoff .
Implement an approximation tothis way so that you still get the benefit of prefix sharing .
This looks a lot like traditional tries

Look Ma , No Han !
How do you secure your nerd - cred for eternity ?
By acquiring a life - size replica of Han Solo in Carbonite , having Han 's face removed , and replacing it with your own .
At least that 's how you do it if you 're my friend , Rob .
( In case you 're not familiar with Carbonite , in The Empire Strikes Back it 's the substance Han Solo was frozen in until he was rescued by Luke and Leia . )
Rob explains how this all came to be ...
Hello , nerds .
Yes , that is me , finally fulfilling a mother 's dream by being encased in Carbonite .
It is cold , it is hot , and worst of all , it is being loaded onto Boba Fett 's ship , so stop reading this and help me !
Actually , this is a full - sized replica of the famous " Han Solo " in Carbonite .
It is made from fiberglass , and the short story is that a friend who is a special effects guy owned the piece , which was a direct casting off the original prop .
He was moving , ( aka getting married and yelled at ) and asked me if I wanted it .
I screamed a huge lispy " Yes ! " , and picked it up , but knew I wanted to do something cool with it .
So I called my other nerdy special effects pals , and they offered to replace Harrison Ford 's face with mine .
I was so tired of hearing this offer in my daily life , but decided to finally consider it , so off it went .
KNB
Effects in the valley took an algae mold of my entire head , then cut off Han Solo's , and replaced it with mine .
They even added the frozen saliva that rushed out when Han got frozen .
The one thing I did n't know until later was that my friend Dana had been holding his bare ass and balls directly in front of my algae covered face while my head was encased .
Talk about a missed opportunity .
Anyhoo , the full size me in Carbonite now resides in my garage , where it has successfully scared off many ladies , and one creepy dude who keeps coming by wearing some stained " Punch it , Chewy " underpants .
Enjoy .

You can take a closer look at Rob in Carbonite , right here .
Thanks ,

So you 've learned all about method stubs , mock objects , and fakes .
You might be tempted to stub out slow or I /O - dependent built -ins .
For example :
def Foo(path ) :
if os.path.exists ( path ) :
return DoSomething ()
else :
return DoSomethingElse ( )
def testFoo( self ) : # Somewhere in your unit test class
old_exists = os.path.exists
try :
os.path.exists = lambda x : True
self.assertEqual( Foo(' bar ' ) , something )
os.path.exists = lambda x : False
self.assertEqual( Foo(' bar ' ) , something_else )
finally :
# Remember to clean - up after yourself !
os.path.exists = old_exists
Congratulations , you just achieved 100 % coverage !
Unfortunately , you might find that this test fails in strange ways .
For example , given the following DoSomethingElse which checks the existence of a different file :
def DoSomethingElse ( ) :
assert os.path.exists(some_other_file )
return some_other_file
Foo will now throw an exception in its second invocation because os .
path.exists returns
False so the assertion fails .
You could avoid this problem by stubbing or mocking out DoSomethingElse , but the task might be daunting in a real - life situation .
Instead , it is safer and faster to parameterize the built - in :
def Foo(path , path_checker= os.path.exists ) :
if path_checker ( path ) :
return DoSomething ()
else :
return DoSomethingElse ( )
def testFoo( self ) :
self.assertEqual( Foo(' bar ' , lambda x : True ) , something )
self.assertEqual( Foo(' bar ' , lambda x : False ) , something_else )

In October 1963 , two cartographers with the Air Force Aeronautical Chart and Information Center saw a strange glow on the moon .
Using the 24 - inch refractor telescope at Lowell observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , James Greenacre and Edward Barr saw a deep , ruby - red glow coming from the crater Aristarchus .
The sighting might have been glowing gas from volcanic activity , and a second sighting in November of that year was verified by Dr. John Hall , Director of the observatory at the time .
Throughout history , there have been many more .
There have been rumbles from other areas on the moon as well .
For example , when Dr. Yosio Nakamura of the University of Texas , Austin , and his colleagues reviewed seismology data from the Apollo missions , they discovered there was a magnitude 5.7 moonquake near the lunar south pole , a possible site for a future lunar base .
The moon is not dead yet , nor has it revealed all its secrets .
Scientists do n't even agree how it got here in the first place .
As part of NASA 's vision for space exploration , astronauts will return to the moon by 2020 .
They plan to test new technology for human missions to more remote destinations , like Mars .
However , there are still many discoveries to be made about the moon itself , and lunar exploration is an important part of the plans .
As part of an effort to develop new opportunities to conduct important science investigations during the planned renewal of human exploration of the moon , NASA chose seven proposals from more than 70 submissions under the Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities ( LSSO ) Program .
The seven selected proposals will result in advanced development for simple , automated instrument packages deployed on the lunar surface by astronauts .
Such " suitcase science " packages could open up a wide variety of research applications regarding the moon and the lunar environment .
Two proposals from scientists at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , were chosen ; one to study moonquakes , called " Seismology and Heat flow instrument package for Lunar Science and Hazards , " and another to search for possible frozen water deposits at the lunar south pole , called " Volatile Analysis by Pyrolysis of Regolith ( VAPoR ) on the Moon using Mass Spectrometry " .
Scientists are interested in establishing a lunar base at the south pole of the moon because the possibility that a vital resource – water in the form of ice – may exist there .
The depths of some craters in the polar regions may be in permanent shadow because the moon is only very slightly tilted from its spin axis .
These regions would be very cold , and able to trap water as ice for billions of years if somehow ice was transported there .
Some astronomers believe vapor from comet impacts could migrate to the poles and become embedded in the lunar soil at the bottom of permanently shadowed craters .
Others believe hydrogen from the solar wind could become embedded in the lunar soil and combine with oxygen there to form water molecules .
If water ice exists in the eternal shadows of the lunar poles , and it is practical to extract water from the lunar soil , the water could be used for drinking , or it could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel and breathable air .
Volatiles are things that vaporize easily , like frozen water , and a major part of the VAPoR volatile mission is to discover how much ice , if any , exists at the lunar poles .
" Remote missions , like Lunar Prospector , have detected hints that ice may exist at the lunar poles , but the only way to know for sure is to go there and see how much is trapped in the lunar soil ( regolith ) , " said Goddard 's Dr. Daniel Glavin , Principal Investigator for the proposed mission .
The mission will use a small oven to vaporize volatiles in lunar soil .
The resulting gasses will be analyzed with a mass spectrometer instrument , which uses electric fields to separate molecules by their mass .
If the mission discovers water , it can also reveal its origin by analyzing isotopes , elements with similar chemical properties but different masses .
For example , the isotope deuterium is chemically similar to its lighter cousin , hydrogen , a component of water .
Deuterium is much less common than hydrogen .
However , like hydrogen , deuterium can bond with oxygen to form water .
By measuring the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in water , scientists can tell where it came from .
Water from a comet will have a higher deuterium to hydrogen ratio than solar wind implanted hydrogen or water derived from Earth contamination .
Part of the goal for the moonquake mission is to evaluate safety .
" We 're not sure it 's a good idea to put your mobile home on the edge of Shackleton crater with all the moonquake activity , " said Goddard 's Bruce Milam , who is helping the team design the drill needed to bury the instruments .
The mission will also measure heat flow from the moon , which will help gauge the potential for lunar volcanic activity .
" Many moonquakes are from meteorite impacts or tidal stress from Earth 's gravity , but there are these other moonquakes that we can't explain , " said Goddard 's Dr. Patrick Taylor , Principal Investigator for the mission .
" Our mission will help understand their cause by revealing the layers of the moon , its composition , and how it is cooling .
" Both mission proposals were awarded a nine - month contract to refine their design and evaluate alternatives , like various locations and different drill designs for the moonquake mission , or robotic versus human deployment for the VAPoR mission ( NASA is not sure how risky it is to send astronauts to the bottom of a deep lunar crater ) .
" The proposals we received show that the scientific community is excited about the opportunity to capitalize on the nation 's planned lunar outpost .
The moon has much to teach us about itself , the history of our solar system , and even the history of the sun .
In the future , more and more scientists will be able to participate in lunar research as we focus attention on Earth 's fascinating satellite , " said Dr. Alan Stern , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate .

Is Capitalism Sustainable ?
John Ikerd
I realize most readers of this magazine are operators of small farms .
But , some questions are simply too important to leave the economists and politicians .
If our capitalistic economy is not sustainable , neither are our farms or ultimately our society or humanity .
Some questions are so important that no one can afford to remain uninformed , uncommitted , and uninvolved .
Is capitalism sustainable ?
Not the type of capitalism that dominates American and most global economies today .
This is not a matter of personal opinion , but a direct consequence of the most fundamental laws of science .
Sustainability ultimately depends upon energy because anything that is useful in sustaining life on earth ultimately relies on energy .
All material things that are of any use to humans � food , clothes , houses , automobiles , � require energy to make and energy to use .
All useful human activities � working , thinking � require human energy .
Physical scientists lump all such useful activities together and call them �work .�
All work requires energy .
In performing work , energy is always changed in form .
In fact , the natural tendency of energy to change from more concentrated to less concentrated forms gives energy its ability to perform work .
All material things , such as food , gasoline , plastic , and steel , are just highly concentrated forms of energy .
Matter can be converted into energy , as in eating food or burning gasoline , and the form of energy can be changed , as in using heat to make electricity and electricity to produce light .
However , even though work invariably changes matter to energy or changes the form of energy , no energy is lost .
This is the first law of thermodynamics , the law of energy conservation , as in Einstein 's famous E=MC2 .
At first , it might seem that energy could simply be recycled and reused forever , as if sustainability would be inevitable .
However , once energy is used to perform work , before it can be used again , it must be reconcentrated , reorganized , and restored .
Unfortunately , it takes energy to reconcentrate , reorganize , and restore energy .
And , the energy used to reconcentrate and restore energy is simply no longer available to do anything else .
It has lost its usefulness .
This is the law of entropy , the second law of thermodynamics ; the tendency of all closed systems to tend toward the ultimate degradation of matter and energy ; toward inert uniformity ; an absence of structure , pattern , organization , or differentiation .
The barren surfaces of the Moon or Mars are examples of systems near entropy .
Since loss of useful energy to entropy is inevitable , it might seem that sustainability is impossible .
Even if waste and pollution could be completely avoided in the processes of using and reusing energy , the tendency toward entropy would continue .
In fact , life on earth would not be sustainable without the daily inflow of new solar energy .
Sustainability ultimately depends upon the use of solar energy to offset the unavoidable effects of entropy .
Capitalism is a very efficient system of energy extraction , but it provides no incentive to reconcentrate and restore energy to offset entropy .
Capitalists have no economic incentive to invest in energy renewal for the benefit of those of future generations .
Capitalists reduce waste and pollution or reuse resources only when it is profitable to do so , meaning only when it is in their individual self - interest to do so .
Capitalists have incentives to use renewable energy to support current consumption , but not to re-storing energy for future generations .
Capitalism inevitably tends toward physical entropy .
The law of entropy applies to social energy and well as physical energy .
All forms of human energy � labor , management , innovation , creativity � are products of social relationships .
Humans cannot be born , reach maturity , and become useful without the help of other people who care about them personally .
People must be educated , trained , civilized , and socialized before they can become productive members of complex societies .
All organizations � including business organizations , governments , and economies � depend on the ability of people to work together for a common purpose , which in turn depend upon the sociability and civility of human societies .
Human productivity is a direct result of healthy personal relationships , within families , friendships , communities , and societies .
Capitalism inevitably dissipates , disperses , and disorganizes social energy because it weakens personal relationships .
Maximum economic efficiency requires that people relate to each other impartially , which means impersonally .
People must compete rather than cooperate , if market economies are to function efficiently .
When people spend more time and energy working � being economically productive � they have less time and energy to spend on personal relationships within families and communities .
When people buy things based solely on price rather than buy from people they know and trust , personal relationships within communities suffer from neglect .
Capitalism devalues personal relationships and disconnects people and thus dissipates , disperses , and disorganizes social energy .
Capitalistic economies use people to do work , while doing nothing to restore the �social capital� needed to sustain positive personal relationships .
There is no economic incentive for capitalists to invest in families , communities , or society for the benefit of future generations .
Capitalists build relationships or contribute to social causes only when such contributions are expected to contribute to their profits or growth .
Capitalists do not waste energy by investing in social capital .
Capitalism inevitably tends toward social entropy .
Economies are simply the means by which people facilitate their relationships with other people and with their natural environment in complex societies .
Economies actually produce nothing ; they simply transform physical and social energy into raw materials and human labor , which can be exchanged in impersonal marketplaces .
All economic capital is extracted from either natural or social capital .
Once all natural and social capital has been extracted , there will be no source of economic capital .
Without capital , an economy loses its ability to produce ; it tends toward economic entropy .
Today 's capitalistic economies quite simply are not sustainable .
A sustainable economy must be based on a fundamentally different paradigm , specifically , on the paradigm of living systems .
Living things by nature are self - making , self - renewing , reproductive , and regenerative .
Living plants have the natural capacity to capture , organize , and store solar energy , both to support other living organisms and to offset the energy that is inevitably lost to entropy .
Living things also have a natural propensity to reproduce their species .
Humans , for example , devote large amounts of time and energy to raising families , with very little economic incentive to do so .
Obviously , an individual life is not sustainable because every living thing eventually dies .
But , communities and societies of living individuals clearly have the capacity and natural propensity to be productive , while devoting a significant part of their life 's energy to conceiving and nurturing the next generation .
Relationships within healthy living systems must be mutually beneficial , and thus must be selective in nature .
All living organisms are made up of cells and each living cell is surrounded by a selective or semi-permeable membrane .
These semi-permeable boundaries keep some things in but let other things out and keep some things out but let other things in .
Living organisms likewise are defined by boundaries � skin , bark , scales , � that selectively allow different elements � air , water , food , waste , � to enter and to leave the body of the organism .
If these boundaries were either completely permeable or impermeable , the organism would be incapable of life , and thus incapable of producing or reproducing .
The same principle holds for all living systems : ecosystems , families , communities , economies , cultures .
The relationships among elements of healthy natural ecosystems are by nature mutually beneficial .
However , relationships among humans and between humans and nature are matters of choice , and thus must be consciously and purposefully selective .
People must be willing and able to choose to maintain positive relationships with other people and to choose to take care of the earth , not only to benefit themselves , but also to benefit those of future generations .
Capitalism provides no economic incentives to sustain life on earth , but humans have the innate capacity and natural tendency to do so .
Throughout human history , people have chosen families , communities , and societies over isolation , even when it was not in their short run , individual self - interests to do so .
Throughout human history , people have shown a sense of respect and reverence toward the earth , and have attempted to care for the earth , even when here was no incentive to do so .
It 's only within the past few decades that humans in large numbers have abandoned their basic nature as living , caring beings in pursuit of their narrow , individual self - interests .
Not until the last few decades , were the social and ethical constraints removed , turning capitalism into an unsustainable system of extraction and exploitation .
To restore sustainability , people must make conscious , purposeful decisions to rely on renewable energy , not just for consumption , but also to rebuild stocks of natural capital for the benefit of future generations .
To restore sustainability to capitalism , people must make conscious , purposeful choices to rebuild positive , mutually beneficial relationships with other people , not just for economic gains , but also to restore depleted stocks of social capital .
No other economic system even approaches the efficiency of capitalism in utilizing economic capital to meet individual material human needs and wants .
But , natural and social capital must be continually renewed and replenished to sustain economic capital .
The sustainability of capitalism is simply too important to be left to the politicians and economists .
Is capitalism sustainable ?
This question ultimately must be addressed by all people , including those who operate small farms .

Looking Beyond Iraq
Beyond trying to influence the historical record , Ms. Rice is trying hard to rewrite her legacy to include something more than Iraq .
Her colleagues and friends say that she has accepted that Iraq is a stain that she probably cannot remove before she leaves office .
So she has thrown herself into shoring up the rest of her legacy , zeroing in in recent months on Arab - Israeli peace , as a possible source of redemption .
In Washington and around the world , many now believe that Ms. Rice , after two and a half years on the job , is a far better secretary of state than she was national security adviser .
As President Bush ’s top diplomat , she has lowered tensions somewhat between America and its allies , after four years of a go - it - alone diplomacy that had chilled trans -Atlantic relations .
Despite criticism from conservatives within the administration , she has allowed her North Korea aide , Christopher R. Hill , enough space to negotiate a truce that led to the North ’s shutdown of its main nuclear reactor in July .
She has cobbled together a six-nation diplomatic effort to rein in Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions which , although unsuccessful so far , has managed for more than a year to hold together on a series of United Nations sanctions against Iran .
And perhaps most important , she has used those sanctions , along with tough rhetoric , to tamp down the national - security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office who have argued for greater consideration of military strikes against Iran .
But none of that has been enough to erase the view that as national security adviser she largely served as a rubber stamp for a series of foreign policy blunders , during a period that critics say will ultimately weigh most heavily on her legacy .
“ It turned out to be a very disastrous four years in my view , ” said Lawrence B. Wilkerson , Mr. Powell ’s chief of staff at the State Department while Ms. Rice was national security adviser .
Richard L. Armitage , Mr. Powell ’s deputy secretary of state , said he became so frustrated that he once went to the White House and complained privately to Ms. Rice that he felt like he was getting on a “ gerbil wheel ” every morning “ and nothing would be resolved , and we ’d get off at night , and the next morning we would get back on and do it all over again . ”
But Mr. Armitage said his view of Ms. Rice had since mellowed .
“ I ’ve become more conscious of the fact that the president got the national security adviser he wanted , ” he said in an interview this week .
“ It just was n’t the national security adviser that I wanted . ”
Ms. Rice is rarely , if ever , self - reflective .
But in an interview with The New York Times this month , she acknowledged , ever so obliquely , that her first four years working for the Bush administration were not her best .

Abstract
cons
( lambda ( x ) ( cons 1 x ) )
The mechanism proposed here allows to write this sort of specialization in a simple and compact way .
The mechanism is best explained by a few examples :
( cut cons (+ a 1 ) <> ) is the same as ( lambda ( x2 ) ( cons (+ a 1 ) x2 ) ) ( cut list 1 <> 3 <> 5 ) is the same as ( lambda ( x2 x4 ) ( list 1 x2 3 x4 5 ) ) ( cut list ) is the same as ( lambda ( ) ( list ) ) ( cut list 1 <> 3 <...>) is the same as ( lambda ( x2 . xs ) ( apply list 1 x2 3 xs ) ) ( cut <> a b ) is the same as ( lambda ( f ) ( f a b ) )
As you see , the macro cut specializes some of the parameters of its first argument .
The parameters that are to show up as formal variables of the result are indicated by the symbol <> , pronouced as " slot " .
In addition , the symbol <...> , pronounced as " rest- slot " , matches all residual arguments of a variable argument procedure .
As you can see from the last example above , the first argument can also be a slot , as one should expect in Scheme .
In addition to cut , there is a variant called cute ( a mnemonic for " cut with evaluated non-slots " ) which evaluates the non-slot expressions at the time the procedure is specialized , not at the time the specialized procedure is called .
For example ,
( cute cons (+ a 1 ) <> ) is the same as ( let ( ( a1 (+ a 1 ) ) ) ( lambda ( x2 ) ( cons a 1 x2 ) ) )
As you see from comparing this example with the first example above , the cute - variant will evaluate (+ a 1 ) once , while the cut - variant will evaluate it during every invokation of the resulting procedure .
The mechanism proposed in this SRFI allows specializing any subset of the variables of a procedure .
The result can be of fixed arity or of variable arity .
The mechanism does not allow permutation , omission , duplication or any other processing of the arguments ; for this it is necessary to write to use a different mechanism such as lambda .
Rationale
( cons 1 )
Yet , Scheme is not a curried language --- the number of arguments passed to a procedure must match the number of its parameters at all times .
This allows zero - and variable - arity procedures but in order to specialize parameters one usually has to write down a lambda - expression and invent some irrelevant identifiers for its formal variables ( x in the example ) .
For this reason , the mechanism proposed in this SRFI provides a simple and compact notation for specializing any subset of the parameters of a procedure .
Note :
The mechanism proposed here is not currying !
The purpose of the mechanism proposed here is to make the benefits of currying available within the programming language Scheme .
There are two primary benefits of currying in practice :
Higher - order types are substantially simplified and there is a simple notation for specializing parameters .
The type aspect is irrelevant as Scheme has latent typing .
The specialization aspect is largly covered with this SRFI .
Here are a few more examples for illustration :
( map ( cut * 2 <> ) ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) ) ( map ( cut vector - set ! x <> 0 ) indices ) ( for - each ( cut write <> port ) exprs ) ( map ( cut <> x y z ) ( list min max ) ) ( for -each ( cut <> ) thunks )
Specification
< cut - expression > --> ( cut < slot - or - expr > < slot - or - expr > * ) | ( cut < slot - or - expr > < slot - or - expr > * <...>) ; with " rest - slot " | ( cute < slot - or - expr > < slot - or - expr > * ) ; evaluate non-slots at specialization time | ( cute < slot - or - expr > < slot - or - expr > * <...>) ; with " rest- slot " < slot - or - expr > --> <> ; a " slot " | < expression > ; a " non-slot expression "
The macro cut transforms a < cut - expression > into a < lambda expression > with as many formal variables as there are slots in the list < slot - or - expr > * .
The body of the resulting < lambda expression > calls the first < slot - or - expr > with arguments from < slot - or - expr > * in the order they appear .
In case there is a rest - slot symbol , the resulting procedure is also of variable arity , and the body calls the first < slot - or - expr > with all arguments provided to the actual call of the specialized procedure .
The macro cute is similar to the macro cut , except that it first binds new variables to the result of evaluating the non-slot expressions ( in an unspecific order ) and then substituting the variables for the non -slot expressions .
In effect , cut evaluates non -slot expressions at the time the resulting procedure is called , whereas cute evaluates the non-slot expressions at the time the procedure is constructed .
Implementation
cut
cute
< slot - or - expr ; >
( param ... slot )
Finally , there is a small collection of confidence tests .
It checks some special cases of the mechanism defined in this SRFI and signals an error in case something is wrong .
Passing the tests does not mean a correct implementation .
Design Rationale
Why not real currying / uncurrying ?
cut
Why not a more general mechanism , also allowing permutation , omission and duplication of arguments ?
Why are the macro called cut / cute and not [ enter your favourite here ] ?

A spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch & Company , where she told people she worked at the time of the terror attack , said the company had no record of employing a Tania Head .
And few people , it seems , who embraced the gripping immediacy and pain of her account ever asked the name of the man whose ring she had returned , or that of the hospital where she was treated , or the identities of the people she met with in the south tower on the morning of 9/11 .
“ She never shared those details , and it was nothing we wanted to probe , ” said Alison Crowther , the mother of Welles Remy Crowther , a man who died on 9/11 and who is credited with rescuing a number of people from the south tower , including , by Ms. Head ’s account , Ms. Head .
“ I felt it was too private and painful for her . ”
In recent weeks , The New York Times sought to interview Ms. Head about her experiences on 9/11 because she had , in other settings , presented a poignant account of survival and loss .
But she canceled three scheduled interviews , citing her privacy and emotional turmoil , and declined to provide details to corroborate her story .
During a telephone conversation on Tuesday , she would not explain her reticence , saying only that she had not filed any claims with the federal Victim Compensation Fund .
“ I have done nothing illegal , ” Ms. Head said .
She has retained a lawyer , Stephanie Furgang Adwar , to represent her .
Also on Tuesday , in response to a question about the accuracy of Ms. Head ’s account , Ms. Adwar said in an e-mail message , “ With regard to the veracity of my client ’s story , neither my client , nor I , have any comment . ”
No one has suggested that Ms. Head did anything to profit financially from her position as an officer with the Survivors ’
Network , the nonprofit group for which she helped to raise money .
But the organizations with which she has been affiliated have also questioned her account after learning of the inquiries from The Times .
For several weeks , colleagues who said they respected the good work she had done as a fixture in the survivor community have pressed her to come forward with clarifying details .
But they said that they had been unable to persuade her or , in other cases , that she made representations that contradicted previous versions she had given .
Four necks .
Two sound holes .
42 strings .
Two access doors ; one on the upper player 's side and one at the tail block .
Created by luthier Linda Manzer for guitarist Pat Metheny , the instrument took 2 years to build ( approximately 1000 hours ) , and when the 42 strings are strung up to high tension , the Pikasso is under approximately 1000 lbs pressure .
It weighs 6.7 kg or 14 3/4 lbs .
The body is tapered so that the side closest to the player is thinner than the side that rests on the players knee , thus leaning the top back towards the player for a more aerial view .
This is also more comfortable under the player 's arm .
The instrument is outfitted with a complete state of the art piezo pickup system .
( Designed and installed by Mark Herbert , Boston )
This included a hexaphonic pickup on the 6 string section that allowed Metheny to access his Syclavier computer system thus triggering any sound including sampled sounds .
Two mounting holes on the treble side ( knee side ) so that the guitar can be mounted on internal brass insets attaching to a stand , leaving hands free for playing or viewing .

The Beavan family compost their food waste with worms
It is a bit dark and there are no lights on .
There is a strange quiet feel to the flat , perhaps due to the lack of any appliances - no fridge humming , no TV interference , even no air conditioning , though it is hot and humid outside .
Walk into the bathroom , and you will notice that there is no toilet paper , no bottles of shampoo or toiletries .
In the kitchen , berries and cheese are laid out on the counter and there are candles on the dining table .
This is the home of No - Impact Man , aka Colin Beavan , who describes himself on his blog as a " guilty liberal who finally snaps , swears off plastic ... turns off his power ... and while living in NYC turns into a tree - hugging lunatic who tries to save the polar bears " .
While there are a lot of people who think that we 're freaks , our friends have been really supportive , and they do come over and play Scrabble with us in the dark
Michelle Beavan
He has dragged his wife , Michelle , and young daughter Isabella , along for the ride .
" The concept is that we should have no net environmental impact , which is , of course , technically not feasible , " says Colin .
" So the idea is that we would reduce our negative impact and increase our positive impact . "
Cutting the trash
The 43 - year - old writer says he is not manically trying to offset everything , but he tries to get involved in environmentally friendly or sustainable projects around the city .
The first stage of the one - year experiment was to reduce rubbish .
The family buys only second - hand goods and takes a hamper to the market .
Colin uses a glass jar he picked up from the trash as a reusable cup when he orders take - out coffee or juice .
Baking soda , vinegar and borax are used as cleaning products
Food is bought every other day from the nearby farmers ' market on Union Square , and put in the hamper without wrapping .
The family then stopped using all carbon - producing transport , so they now walk or cycle .
They then shut down electricity in the flat - no more dishwasher , fridge or washing machine .
Now they are trying to reduce the amount of water they use , from the 80 - 100 gallons ( 303-379 litres ) a day used by the average American , down to seven .
The more the experiment advances , the more drastic the changes become .
" I was a typical American consumer - I shopped a lot , I ate most of my meals in take - out containers , I took cabs everywhere , " said Michelle , a journalist with a weekly business magazine .
Although she still goes to the office every day ( on her bike ) , uses the elevator to get to the 43rd floor , turns on her computer and uses a mobile phone , she has had to redesign her whole life .
" It has been a shock to the system . "
Michelle admits there were times when she regretted agreeing to the no-impact experiment , but says it has been one of the best adventures of her adult life .
" In essence , the project has really slowed down time , which is pretty amazing considering how fast time has become , and especially with us living in New York - you come home to a quiet , soothing cocoon . "
Worm farm
For news from the outside world , there is the solar - powered crank - up radio , although the family rarely uses it .
A solar panel on the roof provides power for a laptop and one light .
From the kitchen , Colin brings out a wooden box with air holes on the sides .
He opens the lid and scoops up a handful of dark brown matter that looks and smells like earth .
In fact , it 's a combination of fruit and vegetable peels and worms .
" This is the compost box , the worms take the food scraps and they turn it into compost , " explains Colin .
The Beavans make sure they carry on recycling outside the home
What happens in the toilet , where there 's no toilet paper ?
" What I 'll tell you , is this :
There are many places all over the world that do n't use toilet paper , " is all he will say at first .
He then adds that because people wash , it is a lot more hygienic .
For detergents , laundry , body soap and toothpaste , they use a combination of vegetable oil , baking soda , vinegar and borax .
The Beavans realise that not everybody can afford to embark on a similar radical experiment or live like that long - term .
They also make clear that it is an experiment , and they have had their doubts about what works and what really makes a difference .
They insist they do not want to force their ideas on anyone else , but they feel happy about the difference it has made to their own lives .
Their life is now centred around the kitchen table , as well as activities such as riding bikes together .
" While there are a lot of people who think that we 're freaks , our friends have been really supportive , and they do come over and play Scrabble with us in the dark , " Michelle says .
Creature comforts
But is it really possible to have no impact on the environment while living in a city where any resident is inevitably part of the system ?
" There 's no question that this city has an infrastructure and some of the impact of the city itself should get credited to us , " said Colin .
" But the fact is that it is actually easier to live an efficient life in this city , and this is well documented .
Here in New York , we emit about a third of the carbon per member of the population of the rest of the country , and it 's because of the efficiencies of scale of this city . "
We 're not going to bring the air - conditioner back .
We 're going to continue to ride our bikes everywhere .
The fridge will come back , but will be used minimally
Colin Beavan
The Beavans say that when the experiment is over , they will not simply revert to their old way of living .
" We 're not going to bring the air - conditioner back .
We 're going to continue to ride our bikes everywhere .
The fridge will come back , but will be used minimally , " says Colin .
Michelle cannot wait to turn on the washing machine again .
Hand - washing clothes has been the toughest change and a chore that has meant laundry is often not done , though Isabella enjoys stomping the clothes in the bathtub .
Colin is planning to write a book about his year as No - Impact Man - his publishers are looking at sustainable ways of publishing .
It may be a worthwhile experiment in the eyes of some , or a total waste of time by a tree hugger for others .
But whatever you think of the Beavans , somehow when you leave their flat it feels like there is only one option - to walk down the nine flights of stairs .
Abstract
We introduce an optical method based on white light interferometry in order to solve the well - known NP –complete traveling salesman problem .
To our knowledge it is the first time that a method for the reduction of non–polynomial time to quadratic time has been proposed .
We will show that this achievement is limited by the number of available photons for solving the problem .
It will turn out that this number of photons is proportional to NN for a traveling salesman problem with N cities and that for large numbers of cities the method in practice therefore is limited by the signal –to–noise ratio .
The proposed method is meant purely as a gedankenexperiment .

I had never heard of it before , but saw a pic on the BBC news site , so investigated .
Honestly , all the pics are interesting , but this one stood out the most - seems kind of like broom riding lessons in the first Harry Potter movie .....
I really need to try this .
How hurt can I get ?
I could n't find specific photo credits for this image but it's from the Wikipedia Flyboard page ( click on the Merritt Island link )

Throughout the Senate debate , Republicans are invoking the specter of Al Qaeda .
That ’s a vintage Bush / GOP talking point .
Only problem is that while the U.S. has been totally distracted by the Iraq war that Bush and the GOP Senators continue to defend , Al Qaeda has been getting stronger .
Might do those GOP Senators some good to read the front page article in today ’s NY Times about the Al Qaeda resurgence in Pakistan .
It ’s another manifestation of Bush ’s failed policies and you ’d think this would be a concern for Republicans :
President Bush ’s top counterterrorism advisers acknowledged Tuesday that the strategy for fighting Osama bin Laden ’s leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan had failed , as the White House released a grim new intelligence assessment that has forced the administration to consider more aggressive measures inside Pakistan .
The intelligence report , the most formal assessment since the Sept. 11 attacks about the terrorist threat facing the United States , concludes that the United States is losing ground on a number of fronts in the fight against Al Qaeda , and describes the terrorist organization as having significantly strengthened over the past two years .
The GOP Senators are n’t challenging Bush on his failure to vanquish Al Qaeda .
No , they ’re too busy helping Bush stay the course in Iraq , which , in turn , continues to strengthen Al Qaeda .
But , hey , they still have the Al Qaeda talking point .
Why People Ignorant of Economics Hate and Fear the Free Enterprise System
DIGG THIS
This column is dedicated to the memory of Loyola political science senior Anthony Torres who on August 28 , 2007 died in a traffic accident , and to all other members of our Loyola community who make up our tragic national highway fatality statistics .
For zillions of years , the human race lived in small groups of 25 — 50 people or so .
We became hard wired to appreciate explicit cooperation : I scratch your back , you scratch mine ; I ’ll feed you when you ’re hungry and / or sick ; you reciprocate .
Those who would n’t or could n’t do this did n’t tend to leave their genes to the next generation .
That is one of the reasons why the family is even today such a powerful institution .
However , in an economy of 6 billion , we ca n’t all cooperate this way .
Rather , we can only cooperate through markets .
That is , implicitly , not explicitly .
To illustrate this point , take the recent history of New Orleans .
When Katrina struck , prices of oil , gas , milk , water , orange juice , batteries , candles and other such items catapulted .
This was implicit cooperation in action .
How so ?
Higher prices means that those first in line at the grocery do n’t get everything on the shelves .
Elevated prices have a rationing function ; at normal costs , people would tend to stock up ; if the prices are very much higher , they will in effect if not by benevolent intention leave something for others
This is part and parcel of Adam Smith ’s " Invisible Hand " at work .
Also , higher prices in post Katrina New Orleans would encourage , through greater profit margins , businessmen from outside of the struck area to bring these goods to those here who needed them the most .
This embodies yet another aspect of Adam Smith ’s " Invisible Hand . "
But were people in NO satisfied with these salutary rising prices ?
Did they understand their economic function ?
To ask this is to answer it : they were not happy campers .
Flesh and blood politicians also biased against markets by their biology , sensed this ; they lambasted entrepreneurs as price gougers , and threatened stiff legal penalties
Charging higher prices during emergencies is good implicit cooperation .
But we ’re not hard wired , biologically , to accept any such thing .
Unless we know a bit of economics , we recoil in horror from such goings on .
We characterize them as ruthless , uncaring , selfish , callous , etc .
We are not biologically situated in a way so as to welcome such behavior .
Rather , we , in our gut , expect our fellow creatures to cooperate with us explicitly , the way family members treat each other .
Appreciation of the finer points of economic cooperation simply conferred no biological advantage all those zillions of years ago .
Nor are university students and even faculty members exempt from these irrational ( in the modern context ) feelings .
Unless you are reasonably cognizant of economic theory , higher prices in such situations will seem like greed run amuck .
Let us consider another example .
Some 40,000 people die on our nation ’s roadways each year .
Most people — innocent of economic reasoning — think this is ordained by some Higher Power if they think about this at all .
Or , they attribute it to things like speed , drunkenness , vehicle malfunction or other driver error .
But these are merely proximate causes ; the ultimate cause is of course poor roadway management .
And who is in overall charge of vehicular traffic ?
Why , government , of course .
The problem is that in this sector of the economy , there is no automatic negative feedback mechanism .
Those responsible for not satisfactorily dealing with the proximate causes of our dying like flies on the highways continue in business .
Ditto for the Army Corps of Engineers , FEMA , the post office , the FDA , indeed , all government agencies .
In sharp contrast , the reason we have no national crises concerning pizza , rubber bands , computers , Disney World , WalMart etc. , is that these enterprises are in the private sector .
There , fail to satisfy consumers , and you are history .
The obvious solution to massive highway deaths is to privatize this amenity .
But such a turn away from highway socialism will appear anathema to most of us , who are victimized by our biology , and simply unable to appreciate the rather subtle economic reasoning underlying such a proposal .
The Best of Walter E. Block
A lot of the time it ’s rather tiring to start writing about Iraq yet again .
When I started the original version of this site in December of 2005 , the Iraq Fiasco was already dragged on far longer than the nation had signed on for .
A year before that the left was bemoaning the prospect of a second Bush term , having hoped that John Kerry would have been able to get us out of there .
As the Iraq occupation chugs along in its fourth year and the Afghanistan battle in its fifth , I keep seeing the same criticism thrown at not only myself but the American public at large .
So the argument goes , the American people are impatient and it is the length of the war that has caused the civil unrest .
This assertion is false on its face .
The American people may not be known for their patience , but that is not the reason we are showing a lack of such when it comes to this battle .
We may be a country whose attention span has been drastically reduced by the likes of the internet and sound - byte based television shows , but the reason we want out of Iraq ASAP and are growing tired of a lack of effort to accomplish this is thanks to those who sold us the invasion in the first place .
Take a trip back to late 2002 .
At the time the nation was still rattled by the attacks of 9/11 and jumping at every shadow .
The mere possibility of another nation who would want to attack us , had the ability to do so , and had any likelihood of following through was enough to put most of us on edge and clamor for a preemptive strike .
Though generally not a country who supports preemption , being attacked once changed that view , at least temporarily .
The first of two causes of American impatience was brewed here .
Preying upon our fears , we were told of the dire threats that the Hussein regime posed to us .
They were linked to Al Qaeda , Bush said , having “ high level contacts that go back a decade . ”
We were told of Mohammad Atta ’s meeting with Iraqi officials in Prague .
Conflations of Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein were made so frequently that it seemed as though the inhale of “ Iraq ” was the natural followup to the exhale of “ Al Qaeda ” .
Then , of course , there was the weapons capability .
Either anthrax or a nuclear threat , it did n’t matter .
Both were thrown into the public eye ad nauseum .
Colin Powell , for all his current apologetic attitude and newly grounded mindset , led the charge with his famous speech to the United Nations .
Those watching saw a small vial of “ anthrax ” wielded , and computer simulations of mobile biological weapons labs ( simulations , we found out , because there was no evidence of real ones ) .
There were satellite photographs of what were purportedly weapons bunkers .
Holding the vial of anthrax was a conscious decision , just as was Bush ’s description of the necessary amount of enriched uranium for a warhead : “ a single softball . ”
This gave the weapons are more “ real ” feel , realer than they ever truly were .
In Bush ’s case , it was to make it seem as though it were n’t much at all .
A softball is n’t particularly large , and so most of the world assumed it would be incredibly easy for Saddam to get a hold of it .
Thus , we must act now .
Americans may have little patience for many things , but vanquishing an enemy is something we can all buck up and deal with .
In an age where video games and movies back on World War II were incredibly popular , it was n’t hard to drum up support to defeat a crazed mustached lunatic who conspired to conquer the world .
He had already , so we were led to believe , been involved on a small scale attack on American soil .
If he were to get a nuclear weapon , what would he do then ?
That ’s why the twofold link was so important .
It would have been one thing to display that Saddam had nuclear weapons and would be able to use them , but it was only by implicitly ( and occasionally explicitly ) linking his regime to 9/11 that Bush and his cabal created the real fear that he would attack us if capable .
We had seen the smoke in Manhattan , and the idea that the next would be a mushroom cloud was not something anyone cared to risk .
Of course , there were no links with Al Qaeda and there was no weapons program .
The illustrations of mobile labs were fraudulent and the stationary ones no less so .
As it turned out , Saddam was a threat to his people , but unable to even exert strength across his own borders .
We were in less danger of an attack by Iraq than we were of an attack by space aliens a la Independence Day .
The President joked about it , making a small movie showing him looking for WMD around the White House .
Many laughed , indirectly mocking the American soldiers who were risking their lives under the auspices that they were protecting us from those phantom nukes , mocking as well the tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians who had died while our military attempted to dismantle the nonexistent weapons program .
Worse still , they had known this from the beginning .
The consequences of not invading Iraq were presented as a doomsday scenario that rivals any other .
Any second guessing or hesitation would lead to our annihilation .
From the various reports concerning Iraq ’s threat to America , the most pessimistic and apocalyptic were adopted and relayed to the nation .
Conversely , only the most sunny and optimistic of post - war predictions were adopted .
Far from a long and difficult war that would eliminate only a marginal threat , we were told of a nearly cost - free war .
A two month campaign that would be so easy that most would hardly knew it happened , and that it would eliminate this dire threat .
From Cheney ’s repeated declarations that we would be greeted as liberators to Kanan Makiya ’s prediction of “ sweets and flowers , ” it seemed as though the military would walk into Baghdad and the next morning Iraq would be free and happy .
When Donald Rumsfeld gave the prediction of the “ conflict ” lasting “ six days , six weeks , I doubt six months , ” that paired with the sunny optimism concerning post - war success had the nation believing that our men and women in uniform would be able to storm into Iraq after Easter and make it home by Thanksgiving .
All we had to do was knock out Saddam and the Iraqi people would take it upon themselves to fix things up .
Then there was the money .
From Paul Wolfowitz and others claiming that the war would pay for itself to the phenomenally low claim that only $ 1.7 billion would be spent on reconstruction , it seemed that not only would we be “ at war ” for hardly the full summer , but its cost would be a drop in the bucket compared to anything else .
The war would happen without being felt by the public .
Monumentally low predictions for necessary troop levels added to this .
Just like the assessment of Saddam ’s threat to the United States , this was later proved horrendously wrong .
We now sit , nearly five years after the war resolution was passed , looking at a permanent occupation of 130,000 troops in Iraq .
Permanent occupation .
Have Americans lost patience ?
Not at all .
It ’s not the time that has worn down the public ’s support for the war , it is what we have learned during that time .
If WMDs had been found , and connections to Al Qaeda existed , it would be obvious that the invasion was necessary and even though the post - war had been terribly mismanaged , that would be offset by the assurance that the actions had saved us all from nuclear annihilation .
On the flip - side , had the post - war been as we were told and Iraq was currently a blossoming democracy , we may dislike the pretenses for the invasion but would be unable to deny its success and that the world at large is better off .
Instead , we watch as hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died and millions have been displaced , thousands of American lives lost , hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars are spent .
We hear our leader talk about withdrawing a handful of troops as evidence of success immediately after having added two handfuls .
We read that a permanent occupation is Bush ’s endgame , not a swift and decisive victory after which our military can come home .
Many supported the war in order to save the oppressed Iraqis , but with body counts ranging from 80,000 to over a million it seems undeniable that far more have died under American occupation than Saddam ’s rule .
An Iraqi woman quoted in a Pittsburgh magazine noted that under Saddam they were not safe if they spoke against the regime .
Now , they are n’t safe anywhere .
Many supported the war in order to defeat terrorism in general , but with Al Qaeda stronger than ever and enjoying a new foothold in Iraq that it had previously been denied thanks to the secular Saddam ’s leadership , that is also an untenable claim .
Nothing , not one thing , that were told prior to the March 20th invasion has proven true .
This is why support is lost , and it ’s amazing any piece of the public supports the war at all at this point .
We were sold poison in a medicine bottle and were told it would cure us of a disease we did not have .
So no , we have not lost patience .
What we have lost is the war we had patience for , and in its place have been given a war we would have had no patience for from the beginning .
It is the fault of the sellers of the war for the climate of unrest now , not an impatient American public who needs to grow up and stop whining .
The battle over public access to scientific literature stretches back to the late 1990s when Nobel Prize winner Harold Varmus began plans for PubMed Central — a repository for all research resulting from National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) funding — and , a few years later , launched the Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) .
These easily accessible journals and repositories have struck fear into the hearts of traditional publishers , who have enlisted the " pit bull " of public relations to fight back , reports news@nature .
The Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers hired Eric Dezenhall , head of Dezenhall Resources , a public relations firm that specializes in " high stakes communications and marketplace defense , " to address some of its members this past summer and potentially craft a media strategy .
Dezenhall declined to comment for this article , citing " our longstanding policy due to strict confidentiality agreements neither to identify our clients nor comment on the work we do for them , " in an e-mail response to a request for an interview .
But " nobody disagrees on the goals of high - stakes communications — sell a controversial product , win an election , defuse conflict and so forth , " Dezenhall notes in the " manifesto " on the firm 's Web site .
" The life - or - death public relations struggles facing businesses today are not about information , they are about power . "
In this case , the struggle is over access to scientific information .
Specifically , according to Dezenhall 's suggestions in a memo to the publishers that they should " develop simple messages ( e.g. , Public access equals government censorship ; Scientific journals preserve the quality / pedigree of science ; government seeking to nationalize science and be a publisher ) for use by Coalition members . "
In addition , Dezenhall suggests " bypassing mass ' consumer ' audiences in favor of reaching a more elite group of decision makers , " including journalists and regulators .
This tack is necessary , he writes , because : " it 's hard to fight an adversary that manages to be both elusive and in possession of a better message : Free information . "
Finally , Dezenhall suggests joining forces with think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and National Consumers League in an attempt to persuade key players of the potential risks of unfiltered access .
" Paint a picture of what the world would look like without peer - reviewed articles , " he adds .
Of course , open access does not mean no peer review .
While the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) is not in the business of peer review , according to Norka Ruiz Bravo , NIH 's deputy director for extramural research , the entirety of PLoS journals are peer - reviewed .
" Open-access journals are peer - reviewed to the same standards , " notes Mark Patterson , PLoS 's director of publishing .
" We wanted to provide an open - access alternative to the best journals to allow the very best work to be made publicly available . "
To do that , PLoS shifted from the old model of subscribers paying to read content to an author - payment business model , in which scientific researchers pay the costs ( from $ 1,250 to $ 2,500 , depending on the journal ) of immediately publishing their work , Patterson says .
" The flagship journals PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine are more expensive to run than the journals that are run by the community , " he adds .
The American Association of Publishers declined to comment on Dezenhall 's advice , but said in a statement : " Some commentators have expressed surprise that the publishing industry is making its case about an important issue that could affect the future of research and science .
We believe it 's important to be clear about serious unintended consequences of government mandated open access .
& Legislation that would undermine the quality , sustainability and independence of science would have consequences on all those who rely on sound science . "
One such piece of legislation was introduced in the Senate last year by Sens. Joseph Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and John Cornyn ( R - Tex . ) that would require any published paper derived from U.S. - government - backed research to be published online within six months .
PubMed Central , published by the NIH — a federal institution — has come under especially intense fire .
Their efforts have been dubbed " socialized science , " by Rudy Baum , editor in chief of the American Chemical Society 's ( ACS ) Chemical and Engineering News .
" Open access , in fact , equates with socialized science , " he wrote in a 2004 editorial .
" I find it incredible that a Republican administration would institute a policy that will have the long - term effect of shifting responsibility for communicating scientific research and maintaining the archive of science , technology and medical ( STM ) literature from the private sector to the federal government . "
In fact , the ACS paid lobbying firm Hicks Partners LLC at least $ 100,000 in 2005 to try to persuade congressional members , the NIH , and the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) that a " PubChem Project " would be a bad idea , according to public lobbying disclosures , and paid an additional $ 180,000 to the Wexler & Walker Public Policy Association to promote the " use of [ a ] commercial database . "
It also reportedly spent a chunk of its 2005 $ 280,000 internal lobbying budget as well as part of its $ 270,000 lobbying budget last year to push the issue , according to disclosure documents .
The ACS publishes more than 30 journals covering all aspects of chemistry , and the organization did not return phone calls for comment .
Efforts for a PubChem Central have come to naught thus far and the NIH 's efforts with PubMed Central have met with limited success .
Of the as many as 65,000 articles derived from NIH - funded research , only 10,000 or so are available at PubMed Central .
" We have authors sending in 4 percent of articles , " says Neil Thakur , Ruiz Bravo 's special assistant .
" An additional 10 to 12 percent are submitted by publications . "
" Having been at a research institution , if something is not mandatory for me and I 'm a scientist and I 'm focused on the science , then doing something like this is not something that I am going to pay attention to , " Ruiz Bravo adds .
" We could go to a mandatory policy with a six month deadline .
We 've been considering that . "
The open - access movement is not confined to the U.S. , of course .
The Wellcome Trust in the U.K. has begun providing funds to its researchers explicitly to cover the costs of publishing in open - access journals .
And the NIH has signed agreements with international repositories to make its publicly available material available there .
This open - access groundswell , ranging from the physics community 's preprint arXiv to centralized , postprint PubMed Central , threatens many traditional publishers , though the most prestigious journals , such as the weekly Nature appear unthreatened .
Nature declined to comment for this story ( Note : Both Scientific American and Nature are owned by the same company : Holtzbrinck Publishers ) .
Rather , it is the niche publishers that may have the most to lose .
" If you are published in a journal that publishes every other month or quarterly and there is mandatory open - access in six months , then , as a librarian , you are going to cancel it , " notes Martin Frank , executive director of the American Physiological Society ( APS ) , which publishes 14 journals , including the American Journal of Physiology ( started in 1898 ) .
" We consider ourselves a delayed open - access journal . "
The APS makes all of its content free after 12 months or asks authors to pay for immediate free publication online , an opportunity 18 percent of authors have taken , Frank says .
He also leads the Washington , D.C. , Principles for Free Access to Science group , a coalition of not - for - profit publishers advocating such a middle way .
" The author - pays business model has yet to be demonstrated to be viable , " he notes .
" Something can only be eclipsed if something else has been demonstrated that is better than it . "
" I agree with public access , but it does n't have to be immediate , " he adds .
" If it 's immediate , it has to be paid for . "
For example , the NIH could pay for publication as the Wellcome Trust does .
At $ 3,000 per article that translates to roughly $ 200 million a year .
" That 's not a lot of money compared to $ 28 billion , " the NIH budget in fiscal year 2006 , Frank notes , " but that represents 100 research grants . "
Dezenhall expressed a similar sentiment in his memo to publishers : " In theory , this may provide free taxpayer access to research that they fund , but they will pay eventually with substandard articles and their money being used to develop and maintain an electronic article depot rather than to fund new research . "
Regardless of the " attack dogs " hired by traditional publishers to craft their message , public access advocates remain undeterred .
" We 've got the technology to make this happen with the Internet .
The only thing that 's holding it back is this adherence to an old business model , which made sense in the world of print , but no longer makes sense , " PLoS 's Patterson says .
" It 's great for authors : anyone with an interest in their work can access it . "
" There are some folks who feel very threatened by PubMed Central , " the NIH 's Ruiz Bravo adds .
" We really are committed to having an archive .
We will do everything we can to make this a successful endeavor . "
" Change is in the wind , and change is hard , " she continues .
" I think this is inevitable . "

The potential presence of a further 100bn barrels in the western desert highlights the opportunity for Iraq to be one of the world ’s biggest oil suppliers , and its attractions for international oil companies – * if * the conflict in the country can be resolved .
Iraq could hold almost twice as much oil in its reserves as had been thought , according to the most comprehensive independent study of its resources since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The story made it to the front page of the Financial Times ( Europe 's main English - language business paper ) this week , so you 'd think it is big news - and the headlines is nicely attention grabbing , but what 's behind it ?
If confirmed , it would raise Iraq from the world ’s third largest source of oil reserves with 116bn barrels to second place , behind Saudi Arabia and overtaking Iran .
The study from IHS , a consultancy , also estimates that Iraq ’s production could be increased from its current rate of less than 2 m barrels a day to 4 m b/d within five years , * if * international investment begins to flow .
(...)
Ron Mobed of IHS said : “ Obviously the security situation is very bad , but when you look at the sub - surface opportunity , there is n’t anywhere else like this .
Geologically , it ’s right up there , a gold star opportunity . ”
Of Iraq ’s 78 oilfields identified as commercial by the government , only 27 are currently producing .
A further 25 are not yet developed but close to production , and 26 are not yet developed and far from production .
Iraq ’s government has estimated that it would need $ 20 bn - $ 25 bn of investment from foreign companies to get production up to its full potential .
I actually went to the website of IHS and found the underlying press release .
It 's transparently an attempt to sell their maps to oil producers seeking new oil fields .
While IHS is a respected player in the industry , and is known to have one of the most extensive proprietary databases on world oil fields , it is a lot harder to gauge the reliability of this new publication .
Iraq has been largely inaccessible and unexplored for most of the past 25 years , and the situation has not really changed in the past few years ...
While I have no doubt that IHS has been able to put its hands on data on known oil fields , I just do n't see how their number for additional resources is anything other than a marketing coup based on wild - assed guesses , as they themsleves admit :
The Iraq Atlas estimate of up to another potential 100 billion barrels of oil reserves is largely based on the establishment of new play concepts in the Western Desert of Iraq , which have been generated from a recent study of the Western Arabian Platform .
The Western Desert of Iraq is widely regarded as being substantially under explored with only one commercial discovery in the region largely because Iraq has had a surplus of oil to date and little incentive for exploration .
And of course , as the FT article above notes ( those innocuous * if * I bolded ) , and as I have pointed out before in my comments on the new Iraqi oil law ( see this story here on TOD : New Iraqi oil law : some facts on PSAs ) , there is the small issue of the lack of security and , more importantly , the lack of legitimacy of the current government , which makes it certain that
- no money will be invested ( as opposed to " deals of the century " mooted , announced or even signed ) as long as the civil war rages , i.e. for a bit longer than American forces will be in the country ;
- any contract signed today will be re-negotiated in full when a new regime finally emerges .
Did Bush and Cheney genuinely expect a " cakewalk " ?
Are they just playing a cynical game to deny oil to the market ( in the short term ) and to preserve the biggest untapped reserves on the planet ( in the long term ) ?
Did they simply expect to get US companies to replace the French and the Russians that were sniffing around Iraq 's oil fields under Saddam Hussein ?
I 'm not sure we 'll know that any time soon , but it 's certain that this oil will attract the attention of all oil players for as long as it's there , and will allow smart players like IHS to sell a portion of the dream .
And as it's likely to remain there for a while , expect more breathless announcements ...
WHEN THE EAGLE LUNAR MODULE TOUCHED DOWN ON JULY 20 , 1969 , all eyes were on astronaut Neil Armstrong .
But Stan Lebar 's ass was on the line .
A young electrical engineer at Westinghouse , Lebar had been tasked with developing a camera that could capture the most memorable moment of the 20th century – the Apollo 11 moon landing .
The goal of the mission was n't merely to get a man on the moon .
It was to send back a live television feed so that everyone could see it – particularly the Soviets , who had initiated the space race in 1957 by launching Sputnik .
If the feed failed , Lebar , the designated spokesperson for the video setup , would turn the camera on himself at Mission Control in Houston and apologize to more than half a billion TV viewers .
" It was my responsibility , " he says .
" I 'd have to stand up and take the hit . "
Building a camera that could survive the crushing g forces of liftoff and then function in near - weightlessness on the moon was only part of the challenge for Lebar .
The portion of the broadcast spectrum traditionally used for video was sending vital ship data to Earth , and there was no room left for the standard black - and - white video format of the era : 525 scan lines of data at 30 frames per second , transmitted at 4.5 MHz .
So Lebar helped devise a smaller " oddball format " – 320 scan lines at 10 fps , transmitted at a meager 500 kHz .
Tracking stations back on Earth would take this so - called slow - scan footage , convert it for TV broadcast , and beam it to Mission Control , which would send it out for the world to see .
And that was the easy part .
To ensure a direct transmission signal from the moon , NASA had to maintain stations in three continents – two in Australia ( the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra and the Parkes Radio Observatory surrounded by sheep paddocks west of Sydney ) ; one at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in the Mojave Desert of California ; and one at the Madrid Manned Flight Tracking Site in Spain .
As Armstrong suited up for his first moonwalk , Dick Nafzger , the 28 - year - old coordinator of the tracking stations ' TV operations , was as nervous as Lebar .
Nafzger was the guy at Mission Control charged with monitoring ground equipment and the conversion of the slow - scan footage to US broadcast standards .
" We were all going to be involved in something of monumental historic importance , " he says .
When Armstrong opened the hatch on the lunar module , stepped out onto the moon , and uttered his famous words about mankind 's giant leap , the tracking stations with a direct line on the Apollo 's signal were the ones in Australia .
The 200 - foot - diameter radio dish at the Parkes facility managed to withstand freak 70 mph gusts of wind and successfully captured the footage , which was converted and relayed to Houston .
" When the door opened , I knew the camera was working , " Lebar says , " It was pure elation . "
The world watched in awe as Armstrong took his first steps , and the camera engineers at Mission Control started popping the champagne corks .
Amid the celebration , though , Lebar scrutinized the video , and his joy vanished .
He had known the converted footage would n't be as good as a standard TV signal .
But as Armstrong bounded through the Sea of Tranquility , the astronaut looked like a fuzzy gray blob wading through an inkwell .
" We knew what that image should look like , " Lebar says , " and what I saw was nothing like what I 'd simulated .
We looked at each other and said , ' What happened ? ' "
With the rush of history upon him , Lebar let the concern pass .
" As much as we may have found it disturbing , " he says , " the public did n't seem to mind .
Everyone seemed happy to see the guy on the moon . "
Lebar never even saw the raw transmission ; only the few tracking - station engineers did .
But as they converted the feed for Mission Control and the worldwide audience , they also recorded it onto huge reels of magnetic tape that were promptly sent to NASA to be filed for safekeeping .
Not long ago , Lebar learned why the footage had looked like mush :
The transfer and broadcast had degraded the image badly , like a third - generation photocopy .
" What the world saw was some bastardized thing , " says Lebar , now 81 .
" Posterity deserves more than that . "
Good thing the engineers in Australia recorded the raw feed .
Now Lebar and a crew of seasoned space cowboys are trying to get that original footage and show it to the world .
There is just one problem : NASA has lost the tapes .
EVERY YEAR , NASA buffs and vets of the Apollo 11 mission reunite for a picnic near Canberra at the site of the Honeysuckle Creek station , which was shuttered in 1981 .
Seventy - year - old Bill Wood , an engineer at Goldstone during the moonwalk , describes the event as " a bunch of old guys in hard hats looking at an antenna while local TV follows us around . "
Sometimes , talk turns to the effort to persuade the Australian government to erect a fitting commemorative on the site .
But mostly , they just chat and show off old pictures and memorabilia .
During the 2002 reunion , one of the retirees produced a souvenir he had rediscovered in his garage : a 14 - inch reel of magnetic tape from the Apollo era .
They passed it around , marveling at how big and clunky it was , and then went back to their barbecue .
The next year , a couple of Honeysuckle Creek vets showed up with keepsakes even more impressive : still photos they had snapped of the monitors in the station showing the moonwalk .
The images displayed the original slow - scan footage , not the version converted for television .
" When we saw them , we realized they were significantly better than what had been seen in Houston , " says Colin Mackellar , a local minister and self - described space nut .
He was only 12 during the Apollo 11 mission , but watching it on TV shaped his life .
When he's not tending his flock at Greystanes Anglican Church , he 's updating his Web site , honeysucklecreek.net , a tribute to the tracking station and the radio wonks he idolized .
Wood dug through his files and found an old Polaroid that showed the slow - scan footage as it appeared on a monitor at Goldstone .
Like the Honeysuckle Creek photos , it was of a much higher quality than anyone had imagined .
Curious and perplexed , he was determined to figure out whether the raw images of the moonwalk really were more crisp than what the world had seen in 1969 .
The potential historical and educational value of the original tapes would be enormous .
Late last year , an audio expert caused a big stir when he proved that Neil Armstrong actually said , " That 's one small step for a man , " not " one small step for man , " during his famous walk on the moon .
Surely the discovery of a better version of video so iconic that it served as the original network identification for MTV would cause an even greater uproar .
Mackellar urged the grizzled crew to send NASA what he calls the " bootleg " magnetic tape reel discovered the year before .
Maybe some of the original moonwalk footage was on it .
But the 14 - inch reels were an archaic format , almost completely forgotten even at the space agency .
After some sleuthing , Mackellar and his comrades discovered the one guy inside NASA who had the know - how – and the interest – to help them : Dick Nafzger .
He was the last of the old Apollo video engineers still employed at the space agency ; the rest had either retired or died .
Nafzger tracked down a buddy at the Data Evaluation Lab at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
The lab was used to record and analyze spacecraft data captured during the agency 's golden age .
The central treasure there was the analog recorder – a 7 - foot - high gray machine with big black knobs and huge reel - to - reel spools .
It looked like a prop from the '60s TV show Lost in Space , but the hulking gizmo was the only known piece of equipment that could read data from the ancient tapes .
Nafzger spun the 14 - inch reel through the analog recorder , and his heart sank .
The tape predated Apollo 11 and contained no video – just audio and data from an earlier mission .
But the good news was that the device was able to read it , proving that the tape had not degraded , even after sitting in a garage for decades .
The data of the moonwalk might be recoverable after all , if they could just find the right reel in NASA 's vast archives .
Lebar , who understood the slow - scan system better than anyone else , had also joined the hunt .
Retired since 1987 , he had been building educational astronomy installations in public parks around his home in Maryland and taking the occasional trip to Europe with his wife .
Like a good engineer , he greeted word of the tapes with skepticism .
" I 'm not going to go turn NASA upside down based on someone 's memory of 35 years ago , " he told the Honeysuckle Creek posse .
Then the guys showed him the evidence .
Mackellar had posted the sharp photos of the original slow - scan footage and the murky TV broadcast stills side by side on his Web site .
When Lebar saw the two together , his jaw dropped .
That sinking feeling he had experienced in Houston had plagued him for decades .
Had the world seen a lame version of the moonwalk ?
One look at these pictures and he knew that his camera had worked properly .
" We simulated this and watched it on a 10 - frame - rate monitor .
This was what I remembered , " Lebar says , " and here was my proof . "
Lebar and Nafzger were both eager to find the tapes , and they both lived within an hour 's drive of Goddard .
There was one hitch , though :
The space agency itself was n't being helpful .
After a few inquiries into the current whereabouts of the tape , the gang ran into red tape and , more surprisingly , indifference .
" NASA had so many budget cuts , when we said we were looking for the Apollo 11 tapes , they said , ' Well , that 's nice , ' " Wood recalls .
" It was difficult to get help . "
So Nafzger told Lebar , " NASA 's not paying me to look for tapes , but I can look unofficially . "
These guys had transmitted data across 240,000 miles of space before the invention of the microprocessor .
A little government bureaucracy was n't going to stop them .
THERE ARE 4 MILLION musty boxes at the Washington National Records Center , a squat brick building in Suitland , Maryland , that 's been housing inactive federal records since 1967 .
The boxes are stacked on gray girders that rise about 20 feet and would cover the equivalent of 14 football fields of cold concrete bunkers .
" We have income tax records , passport applications , patent records , trademark records , " says Alan Kramer , division director at the center .
" And we have records from NASA , too . "
The building grows more crowded every day .
In 1950 , the federal records totaled 45,000 cubic feet .
Today they cover 25 million , and bureaucrats add more than 500,000 cubic feet every year .
Digital migration was supposed to lighten the load .
It has n't .
" People do n't trust computers , so they print out everything , " Kramer says .
When the search for the Apollo tapes began , Nafzger , Lebar , Wood , and their crew of enthusiastic Apollo vets knew their journey would start here .
They hoped it would end here as well .
Nafzger had unearthed a tracking document that showed the boxes going from the Goddard Space Flight Center to the National Records Center in the fall of 1969 , a few months after the flight .
While sympathetic clerks looked the other way , Lebar and Nafzger waded into the Records Center .
But they quickly discovered the government 's data storage system is a shambles .
" There are no people who have any idea what 's there , " Nafzger says .
There 's no barcoding or computerized tracking ; when a box is checked out , the only record of its removal is a sheet of paper placed loosely on the shelf in its place .
The placeholders can sit there yellowing for decades – assuming they do n't fall behind the stacks .
" That happens , " Kramer says matter - of - factly .
So do accidents .
In July , the sprinkler system went haywire , soaking 16,000 boxes .
The damaged goods had to be shipped off to be freeze - dried .
Permanent records are kept at a constant temperature and humidity , but time still does not serve cardboard well .
Boxes , stacked 14 feet high and two columns deep , peel and rot .
It 's hardly the conditions you 'd want for your old Mad magazines , let alone the original tapes of the moonwalk .
After schmoozing his way into the stacks and sifting through boxes for months , Lebar found evidence that more than 140,000 tapes from the Apollo era had been checked out of the Records Center between 1979 and 1985 and sent back to the Goddard Space Flight Center .
But from there , Lebar fell straight into a black hole .
At Goddard , there was no record of where the footage had gone .
So the tape hunters hit the phones and the Net , scouring the globe for Goddard retirees who might recall the boxes .
It did n't go well .
" We 're dealing with memories here , " Nafzger says , " and those are pretty frail . "
Goddard 's deputy director , Dolly Perkins , admits that there 's no central administrator or database to track what comes into and out of NASA .
It 's the domain of each NASA facility to " make decisions about what 's valuable or not , " Perkins says .
That means the boxes can come out of the Records Center and sit in someone 's office forever – or be decommissioned and trashed .
Then Wood got a good tip .
Some of his sources recalled sending 14 - inch magnetic reels to a storage area in a building called Goddard Corporate Park .
" I thought I 'd hit the mother lode , " Wood says .
He was wrong .
Wood soon discovered that storage facility had been closed for years .
" Nearly all the stuff that was there was destroyed , " he says .
Then he hesitates .
" I need to be careful here .
Would you cross out the word destroyed ? "
It was also possible that the tapes were " degaussed " – erased so they could be used again , a fairly standard practice at the time .
In short , no one knows what became of these priceless minutes of historic footage .
It 's a sad and confusing result , fitting for NASA .
Once , the moon landing seemed like the prelude to all our sci - fi fantasies made real .
The manned conquest of the solar system would surely follow .
But budgets and ambitions have been scaled back so drastically that even the precious data logged during the golden age of space exploration may be lost forever .
Part of the problem was Cold War secrecy : Many key technological innovations of the space program were purposely destroyed so they would never fall into the wrong hands , but most of the loss can be attributed to more mundane issues , like poor record keeping , outdated storage systems , and mortality .
In 1999 , Joe Miller , a USC neurobiologist investigating microbial life on Mars , asked to see tapes from the ' 70s Viking probe – only to discover that NASA had n't maintained official archives .
" The programmers who knew the format had died , " Miller says .
( Luckily , the original investigators had saved hard copies . )
IN OCTOBER 2006 , Lebar and Nafzger visit the Data Evaluation Lab .
It 's about to be shut down as a cost - cutting measure .
Floor tiles are missing , gutted computers are everywhere , and intestine - like coils of electrical cables burst from the ground .
" Anything hot in here ? "
Nafzger asks as he steps gingerly over a wire , his necktie flapping against his short - sleeved button - down shirt .
They show me the analog recorder , the last link to the original data .
This device was slated for the scrap heap as well .
But thanks to the persistent pestering of the old Apollo vets , the device and the facility will be spared for the duration of the search .
Nafzger is holding out hope that the tapes will surface .
If and when they do , they 'll be looped through the machines – and history , once and for all , will be properly preserved .
In the meantime , he 'll keep firing up the recorder every couple of weeks to make sure it still functions .
" If you do n't allow it to work once in a while , " Nafzger says , " it will die . "
Halfway across the world in Australia , Mackellar is keeping the faith .
" I 've prayed for the tapes to be found , " he confesses in a late - night email .
" Obviously , I would like to see the better TV image – and I know that those who worked hard to get the pictures from the moon would be delighted to see what they have missed all these years .
But I 'm praying for something more than that – that somehow this whole thing may help the men and women who think about this to reflect on their own mortality .
The tapes wo n't last forever – and neither will our lives on this earth . "
NASA now officially acknowledges that the tapes are missing and has given Nafzger permission to spend part of his workday searching for them .
They may yet turn up : Scores of reels of telemetry data from lunar - surface experiments were recently uncovered in a basement at Curtin University of Technology in Perth , Western Australia .
In the meantime , the agency considers Apollo 11 a job well done .
" We , as citizens , will be disappointed if we cannot find the tapes , " Perkins says .
" But NASA met the requirement of the mission . "

— An Air Force enlisted woman who claimed to be the victim in a rape case at Pope Air Force Base but then opted not to testify at a court martial , has become a defendant accused of committing indecent acts with the men involved .
Airman 1st Class Cassandra M. Hernandez , now 20 , also is being charged with dereliction of duty for drinking alcohol when she was less than 21 years old .
Hernandez said she was gang - raped at a party on May 13 , 2006 .
The Air Force charged Airman Russell J. Basile in the incident .
Later , however , Hernandez said she felt pressured by the Air Force judicial process and intimidated by Basile ’s defense attorney , an Air Force lawyer , who she said interviewed her without her victim ’s advocate present .
“ I just wanted to go to work and not have this hanging over my head .
I just wanted to be normal , ” Hernandez said Wednesday .
Capts .
Christopher Eason and Omar Ashmawy , who are representing Hernandez , say the Air Force failed to follow its own procedures and is persecuting her .
“ I do n't know why people made the decision they made , ” Ashmawy said .
“ I know policies were not followed , policies laid out by the Department of Defense .
And I know this is the wrong thing to do to Airman Hernandez . ”
A Pope spokesperson provided a addressing the status of the case and a summary of information related to the case .
" It 's unusual that we would involve ourselves with the media , ” Ashmawy said , “ but this is a very unusual situation . "
Hernandez faces a special court martial and is due in court on Sept. 24 .
In February , Lt. Col.
David Knight , the commander of her unit , the 43rd Operations Support Squadron , signed papers charging Hernandez with committing an indecent act by having sexual relations with Airman 1st Class Jerrell W. Apache while Basile and Airman Rotez J. Butler Butler watched .
In written statements to her attorneys , the three accused airmen call the sex consensual .
One said Hernandez wore " skin tight " clothes , danced in a " promiscuous way " and later stripped naked .
Hernandez said that is not how it happened .
“ What those guys did was wrong .
There 's nothing worse than being raped and people not believing you , ” she said .
A book author and researcher on rape issues who is helping Eason and Ashmawy , John Foubert , said that charging a rape victim with having consensual sex “ when the evidence clearly points the other way is an insult to every American and every individual who has worn the uniform . ”
Hernandez , who is from Texas , has written to Gov. Mike Easley , Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the North Carolina and Texas congressional delegations to ask for support .
In her memo to Perry , Hernandez said , “ Under enormous stress and after consultation with the legal office , I made the decision not to testify — the pressure of the judicial process was too much for me , and I felt like no one was looking out for my interests . ”

Free trade is supposed to be a win -win situation .
You sell me your televisions , I sell you my software , and we both prosper .
In practice , free - trade agreements are messier than that .
Since all industries crave foreign markets to expand into but fear foreign competitors encroaching on their home turf , they lobby their governments to tilt the rules in their favor .
Usually , this involves manipulating tariffs and quotas .
But , of late , a troubling twist in the game has become more common , as countries use free - trade agreements to rewrite the laws of their trading partners .
And the country that is doing this most aggressively is the United States .
Our recent free - trade agreement with South Korea is a good example .
Most of the deal is concerned with lowering tariffs , opening markets to competition , and the like , but an important chunk has nothing to do with free trade at all .
Instead , it requires South Korea to rewrite its rules on intellectual property , or I.P. — the rules that deal with patents , copyright , and so on .
South Korea will now have to adopt the U.S. and E.U. definition of copyright — extending it to seventy years after the death of the author .
South Korea will also have to change its rules on patents , and may have to change its national - health - care policy of reimbursing patients only for certain drugs .
All these changes will give current patent and copyright holders stronger protection for longer .
Recent free - trade agreements with Peru and Colombia insisted on much the same terms .
And CAFTA — a free - trade agreement with countries in Central America and the Caribbean — included not just longer copyright and trademark protection but also a dramatic revision in those countries ’ patent policies .
Why does the U.S. insist on these rules ?
Quite simply , American drug , software , and media companies are furious about the pirating of their products , and are eager to extend the monopolies that their patents and copyrights confer .
These companies are the main advocates for such rules , and the big winners .
The losers are often the citizens in developing countries , who find themselves subject to a Draconian I.P. regime that reduces access to new technologies .
Intellectual - property rules are clearly necessary to spur innovation : if every invention could be stolen , or every new drug immediately copied , few people would invest in innovation .
But too much protection can strangle competition and can limit what economists call “ incremental innovation ” — innovations that build , in some way , on others .
It also encourages companies to use patents as tools to keep competitors from entering new markets .
Finally , it limits consumers ’ access to valuable new products : without patents , we would n’t have many new drugs , but patents also drive prices of new drugs too high for many people in developing countries .
The trick is to find the right balance , insuring that entrepreneurs and inventors get sufficient rewards while also maximizing the well - being of consumers .
History suggests that after a certain point tougher I.P. rules yield diminishing returns .
Josh Lerner , a professor at Harvard Business School , looked at a hundred and fifty years of patenting , and found that strengthening patent laws had little effect on the number of innovations within a country .
And , in the U.S. , stronger patent protections for things like software have had little or no effect on the amount of innovation in the field .
The benefits of stronger I.P. protection are even less convincing when it comes to copyright : there ’s little evidence that writers and artists are made more productive or creative by the prospect of earning profits for seventy years after they die , and the historical record suggests only a tenuous connection between stronger I.P. laws and creative output .
The U.S. , in its negotiations , insists on a one - size - fits - all approach : stronger rules are better .
But accepting a diverse range of I.P. rules makes more sense , especially in light of the different economic challenges that developing and developed countries face .
Lerner ’s study found that the benefits of stronger patent laws were reduced in less developed countries .
And developing countries , being poorer , obviously have more to gain from shorter patent terms for foreign innovations , since that facilitates the spread of new technology and the diffusion of ideas .
Tellingly , this is the approach the U.S. takes when it comes to labor standards , arguing that we should n’t impose developed - country standards on developing countries .
But in the case of intellectual property the government ’s position is exactly the opposite .
The only difference , it seems , is whose interests are at stake .
The great irony is that the U.S. economy in its early years was built in large part on a lax attitude toward intellectual - property rights and enforcement .
As the historian Doron Ben-Atar shows in his book “ Trade Secrets , ” the Founders believed that a strict attitude toward patents and copyright would limit domestic innovation and make it harder for the U.S. to expand its industrial base .
American law did not protect the rights of foreign inventors or writers , and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , in his famous “ Report on Manufactures , ” of 1791 , actively advocated the theft of technology and the luring of skilled workers from foreign countries .
Among the beneficiaries of this was the American textile industry , which flourished thanks to pirated technology .
Free - trade agreements that export our own restrictive I.P. laws may make the world safe for Pfizer , Microsoft , and Disney , but they do n’t deserve the name free trade . ♦
Note to Senator Biden : The President is Not " The Decider "

I often think of the letters that come into the Tomdispatch email box as the university of my later life  messages from around the world , offering commentary , criticism , encouragement , but mainly teaching me about lives ( and versions of life ) I would otherwise know little or nothing about .
Then again , the Internet has a way of releasing inhibitions and , from time to time , the Tomdispatch email box is also a sobering reminder of the mindless hate in our world  of every sort , but sometimes of a strikingly anti-Semitic sort , letters that are wildly angry and eager , above all , to shut down or shut up commentary or debate of any sort .
It ’s ironic , then , that the threat of sparking such “ anti-Semitism , ” as well as charges of being functionally anti-Semitic , have been used for a long time in this country as a kind of club to enforce , within the Jewish community , an exceedingly narrow range of correct opinion on Israel and its behavior in the world .
In recent months , such attacks from within the Jewish establishment seem to have escalated whenever any professor or critic steps even slightly out of line , and the recent controversial book , The Israeli Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by John Mearsheimer and Steven Walt has caused a little storm of consternation .
Tony Karon , who runs the always provocative Rootless Cosmopolitan website , suggests that these attacks may not be what they seem , that the need to turn back every deviation from Jewish orthodoxy may actually reflect a loosening of control within the political world of American Jews , and a new opening , a Jewish glasnost .
Tom
Is a Jewish Glasnost Coming to America ?
By Tony Karon
First , a confession :
It may tell me that I hate myself , but I ca n’t help loving Masada2000 , the website maintained by militant right - wing Zionist followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane .
The reason I love it is its D.I.R.T. list  that ’s “ Dense anti-Israel Repugnant Traitors ” ( also published as the S.H.I.T. list of “ Self - Hating and Israel - Threatening ” Jews ) .
And that ’s not because I get a bigger entry than  staying in the Ks  Henry Kissinger , Michael Kinsley , Naomi Klein , or Ted Koppel .
The Kahanists are a pretty flaky lot , counting everyone from Woody Allen to present Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on their list of Jewish traitors .
But the habit of branding Jewish dissidents  those of us who reject the nationalist notion that as Jews , our fate is tied to that of Israel , or the idea that our people ’s historic suffering somehow exempts Israel from moral reproach for its abuses against others  as “ self - haters ” is not unfamiliar to me .
In 1981 , my father went , as a delegate of the B’nai B’rith Jewish service organization , to a meeting of the Cape Town chapter of the Jewish Board of Deputies , the governing body of South Africa ’s Jewish communal institutions .
The topic of the meeting was “ Anti-Semitism on Campus . ”
My father was pretty shocked and deeply embarrassed when Exhibit A of this phenomenon turned out to be something I ’d published in a student newspaper condemning an Israeli raid on Lebanon .
By then , I was an activist in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa , which was consuming most of my energies .
Having been an active left - Zionist in my teenage years , I had , however , retained an interest in the Middle East  and , of course , we all knew that Israel was the South African white apartheid regime ’s most important ally , arming its security forces in defiance of a UN arms embargo .
Even back then , the connection between the circumstances of black people under apartheid , and those of Palestinians under occupation in the West Bank and Gaza , seemed obvious enough to me and to many other Jews in the South African liberation movement :
Both were peoples harshly ruled over by a state that denied them the rights of citizenship .
Still , this was a first .
I could recite the kiddush from memory , sing old kibbutznik anthems and curse in Yiddish .
I had been called a “ bloody Jew ” many times , but never an anti-Semite or a self - hating Jew .
What quickly became clear to me , though , was the purpose of that “ self - hating ” smear  to marginalize Jews who dissent from Zionism , the nationalist ideology of Jewish statehood , in order to warn others off expressing similar views .
What I like about the S.H.I.T. list ’s approach to the job  other than the “ Dangerous Minds ” theme music that plays as you read it  is the way it embraces literally thousands of names , including many of my favorite Jews .
Memo to the sages at Masada2000 :
If you ’re trying to paint dissenters as demented traitors , you really have to keep the numbers down .
Instead , Masada2000 ’s inadvertent message is : “ Think critically about Israel and you ’ll join Woody Allen and a cast of thousands … ”
A New Landscape of Jewish Dissent
The Kahanists are a fringe movement , but their self - defeating list may nonetheless be a metaphor for the coming crisis in more mainstream nationalist efforts to police Jewish identity .
The Zionist establishment has had remarkable success over the past half - century in convincing others that Israel and its supporters speak for , and represent , “ the Jews . ”
The value to their cause of making Israel indistinguishable from Jews at large is that it becomes a lot easier to shield Israel from reproach .
It suggests , in the most emphatic terms , that serious criticism of Israel amounts to criticism of Jews .
More than a millennium of violent Christian persecution of Jews , culminating in the Holocaust , has made many in the West rightly sensitive towards any claims of anti-Semitism , a sensitivity many Zionists like to exploit to gain a carte blanche exemption from criticism for a state they claim to be the very personification of Jewishness .
So , despite Israel ’s ongoing dispossession and oppression of the Palestinians in the occupied territories , then - Harvard president Larry Summers evidently had no trouble saying , in 2002 , that harsh criticisms of Israel are “ anti-Semitic in their effect if not in their intent . ”
Robin Shepherd of the usually sensible British think - tank Chatham House has gone even further , arguing that comparing Israel with apartheid South Africa is “ objective anti-Semitism . ”
Says Shepherd : “ Of course one can criticize Israel , but there is a litmus test , and that is when the critics begin using constant key references to South Africa and the Nazis , using terms such as ‘ bantustans . ’
None of these people , of course , will admit to being racist , but this kind of anti-Semitism is a much more sophisticated form of racism , and the kind of hate - filled rhetoric and imagery are on the same moral level as racism , so gross and distorted that they are defaming an entire people , since Israel is an essentially Jewish project . ”
I ’d agree that the Nazi analogy is specious  not only wrong but offensive in its intent , although not “ racist . ”
But the logic of suggesting it is “ racist ” to compare Israel to apartheid South Africa is simply bizarre .
What if Israel objectively behaves like apartheid South Africa ?
What then ?
Actually , Mr. Shepherd , I ’d be more inclined to pin the racist label on anyone who conflates the world ’s 13 million Jews with a country in which 8.2 million of them  almost two thirds  have chosen not to live .
Although you would n’t know it  not if you followed Jewish life simply through the activities of such major Jewish communal bodies as the Conference of Presidents of American Jewish Organizations and the Anti-Defamation League  the extent to which the eight million Jews of the Diaspora identify with Israel is increasingly open to question ( much to the horror of the Zionist - oriented Jewish establishment ) .
In a recent study funded by the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies ( an important donor to Jewish communal organizations ) , Professors Steven M. Cohen and Ari Y. Kelman revealed that their survey data had yielded some extraordinary findings :
In order to measure the depth of attachment of American Jews to Israel , the researchers asked whether respondents would consider the destruction of the State of Israel a “ personal tragedy . ”
Less than half of those aged under 35 answered “ yes ” and only 54 % percent of those aged 35 - 50 agreed ( compared with 78 % of those over 65 ) .
The study found that only 54 % of those under 35 felt comfortable with the very idea of a Jewish state .
As groups such as the Jewish Agency in Israel ( which aims to promote Jewish immigration ) and the American Jewish committee expressed dismay over the findings , Cohen and Kelman had more bad news :
They believed they were seeing a long - term trend that was unlikely to be reversed , as each generation of American Jews becomes even more integrated into the American mainstream than its parents and grandparents had been .
The study , said Cohen , reflected “ very significant shifts that have been occurring in what it means to be a Jew . ”
Cohen ’s and Kelman ’s startling figures alone underscore the absurdity of Shepherd ’s suggestion that to challenge Israel is to “ defame an entire people . ”
They also help frame the context for what I would call an emerging Jewish glasnost in which Jewish critics of Israel are increasingly willing to make themselves known .
When I arrived in the United States 13 years ago , I was often surprised to find that people with whom I seemed to share a progressive , cosmopolitan worldview would suddenly morph into raging ultranationalists when the conversation turned to Israel .
Back then , it would have seemed unthinkable for historian Tony Judt to advocate a binational state for Israelis and Palestinians or for Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen to write that “ Israel itself is a mistake .
It is an honest mistake , a well - intentioned mistake , a mistake for which no one is culpable , but the idea of creating a nation of European Jews in an area of Arab Muslims ( and some Christians ) has produced a century of warfare and terrorism of the sort we are seeing now . ”
Unthinkable , too , was the angry renunciation of Zionism by Avrum Burg , former speaker of Israel ’s Knesset .
And , in those days , with the internet still in its infancy , the online Jewish dissident landscape that today ranges from groups in the Zionist peace camp like Tikkun , Americans for Peace Now , and the Israel Policy Forum , among others , to anti-Zionist Jews of the left such as Not in My Name and Jewish Voices for Peace , had not yet taken shape .
Indeed , there was no Haaretz online English edition in which the reality of Israel was being candidly reported and debated in terms that would still be deemed heretical in much of the U.S. media .
Thirteen years ago , there certainly was no organization around like “ Birthright Unplugged , ” which aims to subvert the “ Taglit - Birthright Program , ” funded by Zionist groups and the government of Israel , that provides free trips to Israel for young Jewish Americans in order to encourage them to identify with the State .
( The “ Unplugged ” version encourages young Jews from the U.S. to take the Birthright tour and its free air travel , and then stay on for a two - week program of visits to the West Bank , to Israeli human rights organizations , and to peace groups .
The goal is to see another side of Israel , the side experienced by its victims  and by Israelis who oppose the occupation of the West Bank . )
Clearly , much has changed , and the ability of the Zionist establishment  the America Israel Political Action Committee , the American Jewish Committee , the Anti-Defamation League , and others  to impose nationalist boundaries on Jewish identity is being eroded .
It ’s worth remembering in this context that anti-Zionism was originally a Jewish movement  the majority of European Jews before World War II rejected the Zionist movement and its calls for a mass migration from Europe to build a Jewish nation - state in Palestine .
The most popular Jewish political organization in Europe had been the Yiddishe Arbeiter Bund , a Jewish socialist party that was militantly anti-Zionist .
Even among the rabbis of Europe , there was considerable opposition to the idea of Jews taking control of Zion before the arrival of the Messiah ( and there still is , of course , from a sizable minority of the ultra-Orthodox ) .
Of course , the Holocaust changed all that .
For hundreds of thousands of survivors , a safe haven in Palestine became a historic necessity .
But the world has changed since then , and as the research cited above suggests , the trends clearly do n’t favor the Zionists .
I was reared on the idea that a Jewish nation - state in the Middle East was the “ manifest destiny ” of the Jews .
I learned in the Zionist movement that Jewish life in the Diaspora was inevitably stunted and ultimately doomed .
But history may have decided otherwise .
The majority of us have chosen to live elsewhere , thereby voting with our feet .
Indeed , according to Israeli government figures , some 750,000 Israeli Jews ( 15 % of Israel ’s Jewish population ) are now living abroad , further undermining the Zionist premise that the Diaspora is an innately hostile and anti-Semitic place .
The Ferocity of Nationalism , The Universality of Justice
Increasingly anxious that most of us have no intention of going to Israel to boost Jewish numbers , the Israel - based Jewish Agency  apparently oblivious to irony of its own actions  has complained to Germany over official policies that make life there so attractive to Jewish immigrants from former Soviet territories , thus discouraging them from going to Israel .
More immediately threatening to the Zionist establishment , however , is another reality : Many Jews are beginning to make once unthinkable criticisms of Israel ’s behavior .
If you want to bludgeon Jewish critics with the charge of “ anti-Semitism ” when they challenge Israel ’s actions , then it ’s hardly helpful to have other Jews standing up and expressing the same thoughts .
It undermines the sense , treasured by Israel ’s most fervent advocates , that they represent a cast - iron consensus among American Jews in particular .
That much has been clear in the response to the publication of John Mearsheimer and Steven Walt ’s controversial new book The Israeli Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , which challenges the wisdom and morality of the unashamed and absolute bias in U.S. foreign policy towards Israel .
In an exchange on the NPR show Fresh Air , Walt was at pains to stress , as in his book , that the Israel Lobby , as he sees it , is not a Jewish lobby , but rather an association of groupings with a right - wing political agenda often at odds with majority American - Jewish opinion .
Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League , argued exactly the opposite : Walt and Mearsheimer , he claimed , were effectively promoting anti-Semitism , because the Israel lobby is nothing more ( or less ) than the collective will of the American Jewish community .
Which , of course , it is n’t .
In fact , in the American Jewish community you can increasingly hear open echoes of Mearsheimer and Walt ’s skepticism over whether the lobby ’s efforts are good for Israel .
But Foxman ’s case is undercut by something far broader  an emerging Jewish glasnost .
Of course , like any break with a long - established nationalist consensus , the burgeoning of dissent has provoked a backlash .
Norman Finkelstein  the noted Holocaust scholar and fierce critic of Zionism recently hounded out of De Paul University in a campaign of vilification based precisely on the idea that fierce criticism of Israel is the equivalent of “ hate speech ”  could be forgiven for being skeptical of the idea that the grip of the ultranationalists is weakening .
So , too , could Joel Kovel .
After all , he found his important book Overcoming Zionism pulled by his American publisher , the University of Michigan Press , also on the “ hate speech ” charge .
Jimmy Carter  who was called a “ Holocaust denier ” ( yes , a Holocaust denier ! ) for using the apartheid analogy in his book on Israel  and Mearsheimer and Walt might have reason for skepticism as well .
But I ’d argue that the renewed ferocity of recent attacks on those who have strayed from the nationalist straight and narrow has been a product of panic in the Jewish establishment  a panic born of the fact that its losing its grip .
As in the former Soviet Union with the actual glasnost moment , this is a process , once started , that ’s only likely to be accelerated by such witch - hunting .
Last year , a very cranky academic by the name of Alvin Rosenfeld , on behalf of the oldest Jewish advocacy group in the U.S. , the American Jewish Committee , got a flurry of attention by warning that liberal Jews such as playwright Tony Kushner , Tony Judt and Richard Cohen , all of whom had recently offered fundamental criticisms of Israel , were giving comfort to a “ new anti-Semitism . ”
“ They ’re helping to make [ anti- Semitic ] views about the Jewish state respectable  for example , that it ’s a Nazi - like state , comparable to South African apartheid ; that it engages in ethnic cleansing and genocide .
These charges are not true and can have the effect of delegitimizing Israel . ”
In reality , though , whether or not you agree with the views of those critics , they simply ca n’t legitimately be called anti-Semitic .
Actually , I doubt any of those he cited have accused Israel of genocide or compared it in any way to the Nazi state .
( Former Israeli Knesset Speaker Avram Burg , however , recently did write , in reference to Israeli militarism and hostility to Arabs , “ It is sometimes difficult for me to distinguish between the primeval National - Socialism and some national cultural doctrines of the here - and - now . ” ) .
But the ethnic - cleansing in which the Israelis expelled 750,000 Palestinians in 1948 and the apartheid character of Israel ’s present occupation of the West Bank are objective realities .
Rosenfeld is suggesting that , to take an honest look at either the occupation or the events of 1948 , as so many Israeli writers , journalists , and politicians have done , is to “ delegitimize ” Israel and promote anti-Semitism .
Just last week , Danny Rubinstein , senior correspondent covering Palestinian affairs for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , was slated to speak to the British Zionist Federation  and then , at the last minute , his speech was canceled .
The reason ?
Rubinstein had pointed out that “ today Israel is an apartheid state with different status for different communities . ”
( While many liberal Jewish Americans ca n’t bring themselves to accept the apartheid comparison , that ’s not true of their Israeli counterparts who actually know what ’s going on in the West Bank .
Former education minister Shulamit Aloni , for example , or journalist Amira Hass use the comparison .
( The comparison first occurred to me on a visit to Kibbutz Yizreel in 1978 , when the elders of my Zionist youth movement , Habonim , who had emigrated from South Africa to Israel , warned that the settlement policy of the then - new Likud government was designed to prevent Israel letting go of the West Bank .
The population there , they told us , would never be given the right to vote in Israel , and so the result would be , as they presciently put it , “ an apartheid situation . ” )
Use of the term “ apartheid ” in reference to the occupation does draw the attention of those who prefer to look away from the fact that Israel is routinely engaged in behavior democratic society has deemed morally odious and unacceptable when it has occurred in other contexts .
It is precisely because that fact makes them uncomfortable , I suspect , that they react so emotionally to the A - word .
Take black South Africans who suffered under apartheid on a visit to the West Bank  a mild - mannered moderate Nobel Peace Prize winner such as Bishop Desmond Tutu , for example  ask them about the validity of the comparison , and you know the answer you ’re going to get .
Moreover , it ’s an answer with which a growing number of Jews , who place the universal , ethical and social justice traditions of their faith above those of narrow tribalism , are willing to deal .
In an earlier commentary , perhaps presaging his break with Zionism , Burg noted in 2002 :
“ Yes , we Israelis have revived the Hebrew language , created a marvelous theater and a strong national currency .
Our Jewish minds are as sharp as ever .
We are traded on the Nasdaq .
But is this why we created a state ?
The Jewish people did not survive for two millennia in order to pioneer new weaponry , computer security programs or antimissile missiles .
We were supposed to be a light unto the nations .
In this we have failed .
It turns out that the 2,000 - year struggle for Jewish survival comes down to a state of settlements , run by an amoral clique of corrupt lawbreakers who are deaf both to their citizens and to their enemies .
A state lacking justice cannot survive .
More and more Israelis are coming to understand this as they ask their children where they expect to live in 25 years .
Children who are honest admit , to their parents ’ shock , that they do not know . ”
Although I am not religious , I share Burg ’s view that universal justice is at the heart of the Jewish tradition .
Growing up in apartheid South Africa was an object lesson in Jewish ethics .
Yes , there was plenty of anti-Semitism in the colonial white society of my childhood , but the mantle of victimhood belonged to others .
And if you responded to the in - no - way - exclusively - so , but very Jewish impulse to seek justice , you found yourself working side by side not only with the remarkable number of Jews who filled leadership roles in the liberation movement , but also with Christians , Muslims , Hindus , and others .
Judaism ’s universal ethical calling can’t really be answered if we live only among ourselves  and Israel ’s own experience suggests it ’s essentially impossible to do so without doing injustice to others .
Israel is only 59 years old , a brief moment in the sweep of Jewish history , and I ’d argue that Judaism ’s survival depends instead on its ability to offer a sustaining moral and ethical anchor in a world where the concepts of nation and nationality are in decline ( but the ferocity of nationalism may not be ) .
Israel ’s relevance to Judaism ’s survival depends first and foremost on its ability , as Burg points out , to deliver justice , not only to its citizens , but to those it has hurt .

“ Rootless Cosmopolitan ” was Stalin ’s euphemistic pejorative for “ Jew ” during his anti-Semitic purges of the late 1940s , but Karon , who grew up in South Africa and whose family roots lie in Eastern Europe , and before that France , takes the term as a badge of honor .
Karon was a teenage activist in the left - Zionist Habonim movement before finding his way into the big tent of the anti-apartheid liberation struggle , an experience that prompted him to re-imagine what it meant to be a Jew in the world .

Introduction
Thanks to the increasing use and education of efficient JavaScript techniques in today ’s web applications , JSON has become the data format de jour of the enterprising young web developer .
JSON is particularly useful at loading state — passing and loading data that is unique to a particular client .
The question we ’ve run into around here , is what is the best way to get data off of our server and into a JSON object so it can be processed by the browser ?
Turns out , there ’s a few ways to handle it and they each come with a few caveats .
Today we ’re going to examine four different approaches to creating a JSON object on page load ( Ajax , innerHTML , Embedded Script Tags and Server Processed JavaScript ) and discuss the pros and cons of each method .
Note : Some of the example code presented below uses the JSON Parser and Prototype Framework .
You may need to grab yourself a copy of each if you want to follow along .
The Concept
Just to make sure we ’re all on the same page , let ’s do a quick rundown of why it ’s important to figure out how to load a JSON object on page load .
A typical web page may pull data from the server , and arrange all the data in proper XHTML markup form with only server side processing ( like PHP ) .
But on JavaScript intensive web sites ( like most web applications ) , JavaScript may be needed or involved in the initial page load before everything is ready to play and interact with .
In these cases , the data is pulled from the server , sent to JavaScript ( via a JSON friendly format ) where the script then places the data into the markup accordingly .
Imagine the data was static , the JavaScript may look similar to this :
user = { " first " : " Ryan " , " last " : " Campbell " } drawName ( user ) ; function drawName ( user ) { // modify the DOM with the information }
An object is created , and the data from that object is placed into the DOM .
Unfortunately , most sites have data coming from a database and are n’t static .
So how is that a user object is created ?
That ’s what we ’ll look at with the following four approaches .
For each approach , we will take a look at the code required to populate the user object with the necessary data .
Ajax
Everyone ’s favorite new candy .
What better way to load data than with the ever popular Ajax ?
Well , it is n’t exactly the best approach performance - wise in my opinion , but it does have its uses depending on your development preferences .
Here ’s how it usually works : onload a script executes an Ajax request that queries the server for a JSON string .
The server sends back the string , and the string is then converted into an object .
var myAjax = new Ajax .
Request ( ' url - to - server ' , {method : ' post ' , parameters : ' action=lookupUser&id=23 , onComplete : function ( r ) { user = JSON.parse(r.responseText ) ; } } ) ;
Once the server sends back the response , JSON.parse ( ) then converts our string into the actual JavaScript object .
From there , we can then have JavaScript modify the DOM with the data .
While I have n’t seen this method used much in my experience , there are two definite benefits : it provides consistency and you do n’t have to depend on a global variable .
For an example of consistency , we can look at something like paging .
When the user clicks on a “ Next ” link to receive something like the next 20 results from a search , the Ajax request that fires onclick is exactly the same every single time .
With the Ajax method , we can also use the very same request to run onload , so that you can isolate where your data is coming from ahead of time .
The important thing is to analyze the usage of common objects on the server .
Also , it ’s nice to know exactly where your user object is being created .
As we ’ll see in some of the other approaches , the user object must be initialized in a global variable .
What ’s wrong with this method ?
Well , usually when a page loads up , the server establishes a database connection and initializes common objects .
That means calling a simple function , such as lookupUser ( 23 ) , takes very little additional resources since only one extra query is being made .
To call this same function through an Ajax request requires us to create a new HTTP request , a new database connection , and the re-initialization of common objects .
The performance hit to me just is n’t worth it if the other methods are available .
innerHTML
The innerHTML approach relies on populating HTML elements ( like a hidden div ) with data from the server and them having JavaScript fetch the innerHTML of those elements onload via the very quick document .
getElementById or popular $ ( ) function .
// The HTML < div id =" jUser " class = " hide " >{ " first " : " Ryan " , " last " : " Campbell " } </div >// The JavaScript user = JSON.parse ( $ (' jUser ' ).innerHTML ) ;
Using innerHTML to send JSON to the client has promise , but the practical usage is limited because of it ’s strike against the separation of layers .
In our ideal programming environment , CSS , HTML and JavaScript are individual layers .
This works out nice so that designers can make changes without having to look at code , and developers can make changes without considering CSS .
While you could think of JSON as just content and therefore justify to yourself that it does have its place in the markup , it ’s a bit of a stretch .
Let ’s examine if the JSON object is describing the appearance or layout of the page .
The following code tells the JavaScript what type of user is being loaded .
After the JSON is read by the JavaScript , the JavaScript could then add / remove markup accordingly .
{ " first " : " Ryan " , " last " : " Campbell " , " rank " : " Admin " , " country " : " United States " , " template " : " header " }
Given the JSON , the JavaScript could display a different , customized header for each type of user .
Also , the designer can go in and change the fairly human readable string without having to open a JavaScript file , which will then change the appearance of the page .
Another benefit of this method is , like the Ajax approach , it removes dependencies on global variables .
They share the same weakness as well in the fact that a JSON parser is needed to read the string .
One major hassle with the innerHTML approach is escaping in JSON strings .
Escaping an actual JSON object in JavaScript is weird enough , but then trying to escape an HTML string that will be parsed into JSON seems to multiply the confusion .
Here is an example of escaping a link in JavaScript :
obj = { " item " : " < a href= \" particletree.com \ " >
link </a>" } ;
If we were to place that same code into the HTML , the parser would break .
If the tags are replaced with < and > it will work , but they would have to be converted back to tags on the JavaScript side .
Overall , it leads to some serious code ugliness .
Embedded Script Tags
Instead of putting a JSON formatted string into the markup , we can instead place an actual JSON object with an embedded script tag .
Similar to the innerHTML approach , the server will load up the content in the flow of the markup .
This time , though , it will print out script tags containing the information instead of placing it inside of an element .
< script type =" text / javascript " > <!-- user = { " first " : " Ryan " , " last " : " Campbell " } --> </ script >
With this , any other JavaScript file can reference our global user object .
Other than the reliance on a global variable , this method is fairly rock solid .
Since JSON is native to JavaScript , no outside library or parser is needed .
While the speed increases are actually minimal , it is still pretty good practice to trim down code when possible .
It also creates a healthy dose of separation .
Even though the JSON is still in the HTML file , it is in a separate script section and can still be easily configured .
Finally , all character escaping is based off of JavaScript rules rather than a quirky combination of HTML and JavaScript .
Server Processed JavaScript
This approach is identical in concept to embedded script tags , but it takes things a step further .
By setting up the server to process JavaScript as PHP ( or any desired server language ) , we can include PHP processed strings right in the JavaScript .
If we process js files as PHP ( with a little htaccess tweaking ) , the following code would still produce valid JavaScript :
user = <? php lookupUser ( 23 ) ; ?>;
The code above will execute with the rest of the server code , and will ultimately output :
user = { " first " : " Ryan " , " last " : " Campbell " }
Like embedded script tags , a global user object is created , but this time , the object is actually created in the JavaScript file , and not on the HTML page .
This allows for complete separation .
By including the JavaScript file in the HTML page , everything just works regardless of what is on the HTML page .
It ’s also nice to know that all resources needed by the JavaScript file are located within the JavaScript file .
This makes everything easier to track , and reduces confusion when you ’re trying debug .
As always , nothing is perfect .
While this method is great in plug and play reusability , it makes caching the JavaScript file an impossibility and turns out to be limited in catch all circumstances .
For example , we have a global JavaScript file on every page using this technique .
However , we do n’t want the JavaScript to execute on every page .
For the three other methods , we can just place code to catch it :
if ( user ) doSomething ( ) ;
By excluding the JSON , you prevent something from happening .
In this case , the user object will always be created .
Now , on the PHP level a check could be made to make the user object null in certain circumstances , but that leads to inevitable complications .
It is much easier to just not include something in the innerHTML div or between our embedded script tags .
Which to Choose
I have used all four of these methods in projects , and they all get the job done .
For most smaller scale operations , any of these will work and you wo n’t have to think twice about it .
Personally , I find embedded script tags to be superior because they allow for flexibility , do n’t require custom server configurations , and are native to JavaScript .
And I try to stay away from the Ajax version the most mainly because the hits to the server really are n’t worth it when there are satisfactory alternatives available .
The key is to pick one method and stick with it as often as possible for the sake of consistency .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski likened U.S. officials ' saber rattling about Iran 's alleged nuclear ambitions to similar statements made before the start of the Iraq war .
Machines use yellow cake to produce uranium hexafluoride near Tehran in February .
" I think the administration , the president and the vice president particularly , are trying to hype the atmosphere , and that is reminiscent of what preceded the war in Iraq , " Brzezinski told CNN's " Late Edition " on Sunday .
But Henry Kissinger , the former national security adviser and secretary of state under President Nixon , appeared not to doubt Iran 's alleged ambitions .
" I believe they are building a capability to build a nuclear bomb , " Kissinger told CNN .
" I do n't think they 're yet in a position to build a nuclear bomb , but they may be two or three years away from it . "
Earlier this month during a televised speech asserting that U.S. troops should not be immediately withdrawn from Iraq , President Bush said , " Iran would benefit from the chaos and would be encouraged in its efforts to gain nuclear weapons and dominate the region . "
However , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS ' " 60 Minutes " that " insecurity in Iraq is detrimental to our interests . "
Ahmadinejad landed in New York on Sunday to attend the U.N. General Assembly session , which opens Monday .
Watch New Yorkers prepare for Ahmadinejad »
Brzezinski also disapproved of Bush 's statement .
" When the president flatly asserts they are seeking nuclear weapons , he 's overstating the facts , " he said .
" We are suspicious .
We have strong suspicions , but we do n't have facts that they are . "
Brzezinski , who served under President Jimmy Carter , said he is not sure how to interpret Iran 's intentions .
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes .
" I think it 's quite possible that they are seeking weapons or positioning themselves to have them , but we have very scant evidence to support that , " he said .
" And the president of the United States , especially after Iraq , should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions . "
Brzezinski , who is advising the Democratic presidential campaign of Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , urged American officials to be patient , whatever Tehran 's intentions may be .
" If we escalate the tensions , if we succumb to hysteria , if we start making threats , we are likely to stampede ourselves into a war , which most reasonable people agree would be a disaster for us , " he said .
" And just think what it would do for the United States , because it would be the United States which would be at war .
We will be at war simultaneously in Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
And we would be stuck for the next 20 years . "
Kissinger said the international community should enlist support from countries opposed to Iran becoming a nuclear power .
" The current objective has to be to unite the countries that will suffer directly from Iranian nuclear weapons , the members of the Security Council and other countries in a program of diplomacy , " he said .
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice reiterated last week that Bush was committed to diplomacy when dealing with Iran , but has not taken any options off the table .
" We believe the diplomatic track can work , " she said .
" But has to work both with a set of incentives and a set of teeth . "
During the " 60 Minutes " interview , Ahmadinejad denied claims by the administration that Iranian weapons are being used against American troops in Iraq .
" We do n't need to do that .
We are very much opposed to war and insecurity [ in ] Iraq . "
Ahmadinejad said U.S. officials are blaming his country for problems caused by the American - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
" American officials , wherever around the world that they encounter a problem which they fail to resolve , instead of accepting that , they prefer to accuse others , " he said .
" I 'm very sorry that , because of the wrong decisions taken by American officials , Iraqi people are being killed and also American soldiers . "
Ahmadinejad also said Iran has no use for an atomic bomb .
" If it was useful , it would have prevented the downfall of the Soviet Union , " he said .
" If it was useful , it would [ have ] resolved the problem the Americans have in Iraq .
The time of the bomb is passed . "
The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week it has verified that Iran 's declared nuclear material has not been diverted from peaceful uses , though inspectors have been unable to reach conclusions about some " important aspects " of Iran 's nuclear work .
Kissinger and Brzezinski also disagreed over whether Columbia University in New York should have offered to present a lecture by Ahmadinejad , scheduled for Monday .
Ahmadinejad has questioned whether the Holocaust happened and has made statements suggesting that Israel be politically " wiped off the map , " though he insists that can be accomplished without violence .
Kissinger said Sunday on CNN that Columbia 's invitation to the Iranian president to speak was not " appropriate . "
Kissinger clarified , " I do not oppose his speaking .
I oppose its sponsorship by Columbia University . "
Brzezinski said Ahmadinejad should be able to speak .
" It seems to me a university 's a place where ideas , issues -- very controversial issues -- should be discussed , can be discussed , " Brzezinski said .
" Look , if his views are odious , we can say so , but we have a society of openness , " he said .
" If we start censoring in advance what it is we like to hear and what we do n't hear , we 're on a slippery slope . "
Prior to departing Tehran , Ahmadinejad called his planned address to the General Assembly " a good opportunity for presenting the Iranian people 's clear views regarding the problems of the world and materialization of peace and tranquility , " IRNA , Iran 's state - run news agency , reported Sunday .
Some students and Jewish leaders planned to protest at the Ivy League school , which last year withdrew a speaking invitation it had extended to the Iranian president after citing security concerns .

All About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Iran • Iraq
The breast bud popped up about six months ago , and Marty knew something had to be done .
It was the slightest of puckers , just on one side , so small you would n't even notice it through a T - shirt .
Still , boys do n't get breasts , and this had the unsettling potential to blow his cover big - time .
That 's because Marty was born , by conventional measures of modern science , a girl .
Marty has two X sex chromosomes , like most females , and the hardware concurs .
Yet ever since Marty 's parents flew back from China in 1998 with their 11 - month - old adopted baby , their daughter seemed to be programmed male .
She refused dresses by age two and half and mastered peeing while standing by three .
She would identify herself as a girl only when grilled .
When Marty was about six , doctors said she was no tomboy .
She seemed to fit the diagnosis of gender identity disorder ( GID ) , and though dubbing it a disorder whips up a maelstrom of controversy , the basic sentiment is this : not only feeling an intense discomfort with one 's biological gender , but also feeling profoundly , compellingly , like the other .
Enrolled in a new school last year as a boy where only the staff knew otherwise , the nine - year - old passed without a hitch in his wardrobe of Nike trainers and T - shirts , paired with a crew cut , boyish build , and aggressive basketball moves at recess .
( To keep his secret , the names of the boy and his parents have been changed . )
But the days when the only outward markers of gender lie in haircuts , clothes , and personality only last so long .
Deep inside Marty 's brain , a time bomb known as the hypothalamus waited to stage a hormone - armed mutiny .
Breasts would sprout .
Hips would widen .
The uterus would shed blood on a monthly basis .
Marty did n't want any of it .
So when the bud appeared , his Bay Area parents hustled him to an appointment with an endocrinologist at Children 's Hospital and Research Center Oakland , who said the bud might progress no further and puberty could still be a few years off , his parents recall .
They were temporarily relieved .
Marty treated the bump as a boy would  poking at it at the dinner table , feeling it through his button - down shirts .
Waiting .
Then , in May , Marty came to his mom frantically : " Mommy , feel this lump !
You have to do something ! "
The other breast had budded .
His parents called Children 's because now , due to the efforts of a small but growing number of doctors around the world , something actually could be done about emerging puberty .
The endocrinologist agreed that Mother Nature was revving up , preparing to take Marty the way of trainer bras , Tampax , and , as his parents and doctors predicted , increasing distress as his body developed into a sex that to him seemed a cruel trick of birth .
The changes would make living as a boy impossible in the present , and he 'd potentially face scarring surgery to remove unwanted breasts down the road .
What 's more , the upsurge in estrogen would slow and stop his growth , making it harder for him to ever pass as a male .
Of course , that 's if Marty would end up living as a man .
As boyish as Marty is , no one could know for sure .
But in the present , nature could be tricked .
If they all agreed , Marty would never have to develop into a woman .
It was time to put puberty on hold .
The preferred drug for the controversial process is Lupron Depot .
Slogan for the pediatric version : " Pause the child within . "
It 's potent , yet reversible , and incredibly expensive , and for transgender kids backed by increasingly supportive parents , it 's ushering in a new era .
Boys who 've always known they were girls wo n't get beards or deep voices .
Girls who feel like boys will never have to grow breasts or tinker with a tampon .
Long prescribed to temporarily stave off puberty in kids who start developing too young , the drug blocks the brain 's release of the compound that triggers the chain of hormonal reactions , body mutations , and moody angst .
Now an unknown number of doctors in the Bay Area , the country , and across the globe are following the lead of a fledgling treatment pioneered at a Dutch clinic that 's sparked debate in medical and ethical circles alike .
The Dutch clinicians are suspending kids in physical childhood to buy them time to decide if they wish to begin the sexual reassignment process .
If so , after a few years of continued psychological monitoring , they can start hormones to induce an " opposite - sex puberty . "
If not , the teen can stop taking the periodic Lupron injections and appear to develop normally , as kids treated with the drug for early puberty have for years .
Although treating transgender kids is a non-FDA - approved or " off- label " use of the drug ( which is legal , and is done frequently with other medications ) the treatment is fast gaining legitimacy in the medical world .
The world 's largest association of health professionals who specialize in transgender issues approved the procedure in its most recent treatment guidelines .
A handful of doctors have touted the procedure at big - name medical conferences .
More doctors are catching on .
" It 's time we have something going here in the Bay Area , because we should be at the forefront of this , " says Herb Schreier , a psychiatrist at Children 's Hospital Oakland .
Advocates say the treatment saves kids the anguish of continuing to develop into a gender they do n't identify with  reducing the risk of everything from depression to self - mutilation to suicide attempts  as well as later surgeries to undo what Mother Nature has done .
By sitting out the irreversible changes of biological puberty , patients will pass more easily as the target sex , protecting them from potential discrimination and even violence .
And transphobic violence is something that the Bay Area has been known for at least once , when partygoers beat and strangled 17 - year - old Gwen Araujo of Newark to death in 2002 upon discovering she was a biological male living as a female .
In March , the body of Ruby Ordenana , a transgender Nicaraguan immigrant , was found near a highway off - ramp in Potrero Hill .
By treating such terrorists as combatants , however , we accord them a mark of respect and dignify their acts .
And we undercut our own efforts against them in the process .
Al Qaeda represents no state , nor does it carry out any of a state ’s responsibilities for the welfare of its citizens .
Labeling its members as combatants elevates its cause and gives Al Qaeda an undeserved status .
If we are to defeat terrorists across the globe , we must do everything possible to deny legitimacy to their aims and means , and gain legitimacy for ourselves .
As a result , terrorism should be fought first with information exchanges and law enforcement , then with more effective domestic security measures .
Only as a last resort should we call on the military and label such activities “ war . ”
The formula for defeating terrorism is well known and time - proven .
Labeling terrorists as combatants also leads to this paradox : while the deliberate killing of civilians is never permitted in war , it is legal to target a military installation or asset .
Thus the attack by Al Qaeda on the destroyer Cole in Yemen in 2000 would be allowed , as well as attacks on command and control centers like the Pentagon .
For all these reasons , the more appropriate designation for terrorists is not “ unlawful combatant ” but the one long used by the United States : criminal .
The second major problem with the approach of the Bush administration is that it endangers our political traditions and our commitment to liberty , and further damages America ’s legitimacy in the eyes of others .
Almost 50 years ago , at the height of the cold war , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the “ deeply rooted and ancient opposition in this country to the extension of military control over civilians . ”
A great danger in treating operatives for Al Qaeda as combatants is precisely that its members are not easily distinguished from the population at large .
The government wields frightening power when it can designate who is , and who is not , subject to indefinite military detention .
The Marri case turned on this issue .
Mr. Marri is a legal resident of the United States and a citizen of Qatar ; the government contends that he is a sleeper agent of Al Qaeda .
For the last four years he has been held as an enemy combatant at the Navy brig in Charleston , S.C .

Larry J. Kolb learns why ' I do n't know ' is not only the best but the correct answer
I just finished his book " Overworld : The Life and Times of a Reluctant Spy . "
It 's staggeringly good , completely absorbing , and the best part is that it 's all true .
The even better part is that 99 % of the story did n't even make it into the book because it 's classified : can you imagine what 's in that material ?
Anyway , the following is from pages 404-405 of the book , in which Kolb 's crackerjack attorney , Frank Morris , prepares him for testimony in federal court in a case in which the government of India attempted to have him extradited to stand trial there for alleged misdeeds involving an election to determine the Prime Minister .
....................
" You 'll be sworn , " Frank went on , " and you 'll answer truthfully .
But by that I mean truthfully according to the standards of the law , which means pursuant to the rules of evidence . "
This was the point at which Frank started smiling reassuringly .
" In everyday life , " Frank said , " we accept things as true which are n't necessarily true , " and just then , Paul Morse , Jr. , Frank 's blond six - year - old nephew ... stuck his head against one of the panes of the closed glass door of the study Frank and I were in and made some faces at us .
Frank waved at Paul , I made some faces back at him , and Frank said , " If you were his father , and he asked you if he could eat a chocolate bar that was sitting here on the desk , and you said No , and then you left the room , and when you came back ten minutes later the chocolate wrapper was on the floor , and there was chocolate all over his lips and cheeks , you 'd spank his ass .
Even if he said he did n't eat the chocolate , you 'd spank him .
Because , by the standards of everyday life , you 'd know he did eat the chocolate .
But , according to the standard of the law , you 'd only suspect he ate the chocolate , and that is meaningless .
For all you 'd know , he could 've fallen and smashed his mouth on the chocolate bar , knocking the wrapper onto the floor .
You were n't a percipient witness to Paul eating the chocolate bar .
So , if you were asked in court if Paul ate the chocolate , the only truthful answer you could give would be I do n't know . "
Damn if Frank was n't right .
And that was a good thing , I was just beginning to realize .
I 'd testified a few times before under oath , in unrelated matters and under the advice and protection of expensive and what I thought was highly competent counsel .
But in light of the new standards of truth , knowledge , beauty , and human frailty Frank was imparting to me now , it was quickly coming clear to me that my previous counsel had let me ramble and speculate shamelessly about things I did n't actually know .
" For example , " Frank said to me now , " if you were asked , ' Why did Adnan Khashoggi ask you to help him with this matter ? ' , your answer would be ' I do n't know . '
Because you do n't know .
Most of us have enough trouble figuring out why we do things ourselves .
There 's no way we 're competent to know why anybody else does anything .
While testifying , do n't ever let yourself be tricked into speculating about someone else 's state of mind .
" If you happened to be asked , ' Why did Mr. Gandhi go to the restaurant ? ' , your answer could not be ' Because he was hungry ' or ' To eat . '
Your only truthful answer would be , ' I do n't know . '
Because , even if Rajiv told you he was hungry , that 's just hearsay , and you do n't know what went on in his mind that made him go into the restaurant .
But , if you were asked , ' Did Mr. Gandhi eat in the restaurant ? , ' ands you were in the restaurant when he was , and you saw him eat there , your answer would be ? "
Finally a part for me .
I said , " My answer would be ' Yes . ' "
" Correct , " said Frank .
" Your answer would be ' Yes ' and it would not be ' Yes , I saw him eating apple pie in the restaurant . '
Because they did n't ask that , and it's not up to you to volunteer anything . "
" So , do you understand ?
Do n't speculate about events to which you were not a percipient witness .
Do n't speculate about another person 's state of mind .
Do n't volunteer anything .
Do n't ramble .
Answer the questions , and only the questions , truthfully .
And the only truthful answer you can give to a lot more questions than it might first seem is ' I do n't know . ' "
....................
The above is as perfect a summary of how to conduct yourself in court as you will ever encounter .
I might note , however , that answering " I do n't know " over and over again results in all manner of head - shaking and doubtful expressions on the part of the examining attorney , so much so that you 're tempted to try to make yourself look better in her or his eyes by offering more than the above - styled truth .
Oftimes there will be derisory , sarcastic remarks such as " You do n't know much , do you ? "
Do n't take the bait .
Because those looks do n't translate to paper and those remarks make the questioning attorney look small when read in context .
Trust me — in the deposition transcript " I do n't know " makes perfect sense and is completely appropriate in the context of the ongoing questioning .
One last comment about " Overworld . "
The cast of characters is larger than life : Muhammad Ali , Adnan Khashoggi , Presidents Bush 41 and 43 , Ronald Reagan , Daniel Ortega , Dan Jenkins , Miles Copeland , William J. Casey , Jan Stephenson ( Kolb 's first wife ) , J. Edgar Hoover , Bill Talbert , King Fahd of Saudi Arabia , Ben Crenshaw , Rajiv Gandhi , Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos , Swamiji aka Chandraswami , V.P. Singh , boldface names on and on .
Eye - opening , jaw - droppingly amazing tales of life in a world you and I will most likely never visit .
Just as well — me , I 'm fine just reading about it .
I can't speak for you .

Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Larry J. Kolb learns why ' I do n't know ' is not only the best but the correct answer :
Comments
I never involve myself in these things , but after reading the above comments , I had to comment myself .
I 'm not defending Kolb : all his stories could be untrue .
But Richard Hirschfeld was a convicted felon , wanted for multiple crimes , indicted in 1996 for one of them , fled the U.S. , and finally killed himself in 2005 in prison while awaiting trial .
On a personal level , he 'd suffered falling outs with many people he 'd associated with , including Muhammad Ali .
Dr. Seriani , if that 's who you are , save your " delusional " yammering for someone who can't even read a newspaper .
Your writing reads like another one of these lunatics who thinks laws and responsibilities are for " other " people , who throws around the word " patriot " to disguise the misgivings and treachery of your own kind .
And if for no other reason , your own logic makes no sense , considering Hirschfeld himself was the megalomaniac , and a crook of the highest order .
Posted by : Elusive | Apr 12 , 2008 9:09:07 PM
Kolb is a wanna - be spy who never was .
A megalomaniac who exaggerates beyond the reader 's sensibilities .
If Kolb meets someone famous in passing , once -- he 's one of their best friends for decades ; if he gets to speak to someone famous , he 's part of their family forever .
He plants rumors that Elvis is alive and shows a photo of himself that somewhat resembles Elvis with Muhammad Ali ; then performs in Vegas with Elvis acts to make the press release :
He 's Larry Kolb , not Elvis Presley .
Kolb obviously knows some people who know some people who work for intelligence agencies , but he is not nor ever was an agent .
Nor is Muhammad Ali an agent as he suggests .
Kolb takes the liberty to besmirch people who likely were good patriots - who have a conscience for the greater good of democratic societies .
It is Kolb who is a selfish , money grubbing , star - struck rogue fighting the demons that haunt him from his suppressed childhood years by abusive alcoholic and , as Kolb describes , mostly dysfunctional parents .
Kolb who throughout his life says could never be as perfect or as successful or as pleasing to his parents as his preacher brother , the Reverent Jerry Kolb of Kansas City , Missouri .
Never in his life has Kolb held an actual job where you have job responsibilities , an employer or manager / boss holding you accountable , a consistent paycheck .
Kolb became a frustrated writer at age 55 .
He was a dreamer , a wanna - be jet - setter , who tried and did for a short time , live a life of lies , deception , and betrayal , so he says .
He admits he embarked on his James Bond adventure limited means , living way over his head , but finally got his cut of shady deals -- diamonds , jewels , arms and jet deals with a bogus swami and a host of known organized crime figures , including white collar money launderers like the Marcoses , Khashoggi , and Bin Laden 's money funders , and somehow visited " Danny " -- Sandanista rebel and enemy of the U.S. , ousted Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega .
It is indeed ironic .
Kolb claims Richard Hirschfeld and Robert Sensi , who he admits are a CIA Agent and CIA Officer ( Sensi recruited Hirschfeld ) and their close friends , General Wayne Jackson and Dr. Joe Seriani ( myself -- founder of LensExpress / 800CONTACT ) are tied to plots involving terroristic groups contributions .
He even falsely claims that I testified against Mr. Hirschfeld in federal court , and that Mr. Sensi posed as a priest to tamper with evidence and witnesses in a RICO action prosecuted against Engin Yesil and Yali Golan . )
Yet , Kolb claims to be part of the Adnan Khashoggi family , a personal and business confidant to Adnan .
No one in this century or the last has been tied to more shady conspiracies , allegations and indictments for fraud , racketeering , money laundering , including funds for terroristic organizations , Bin Laden and Al Quaeda , than Khashoggi himself whom Kolb calls his step - father - in - law .
A fairly superficial research into Kolb allegations and story - plot uncovers : 1 ) Hirschfeld and friends are the patriots , recognized and thanked by the U.S. Congressional Foreign Intelligence Committee for exposing the criminal plots to terrorize the Phillipines , steal , hide , and launder illicit money of Imelda and Ferdinan Marcos with their conspirator , Adnan Khashoggi .
2 ) Kolb is consistently prone to exaggeration or otherwise hallucination ; claims Muslim Turk , Engin Yesil , is a billionaire married to " the most beautiful woman on earth and an Indian princess , " and that Yesil is not the serious criminal and multiple felon , corrupt drug trafficker that Hirschfeld and friends claim that Yesil isin their suits against Yesil .
3 ) Kolb was never Muhammad Ali 's agent for anything .
However , for years , having met each other at John Wayne 's house , Richard Hirschfeld was Muhammad 's friend , confidant , and agent .
Kolb has been resentful , jealous , and injuriously slanderous of Hirschfeld et al. , ever since .
Kolb claims he's had to hide from Indian secret service agents for twelve years that he worked for a former President of India and was wrongly accused of treason and sabatage to the Government of India who has extradition warrants out for him .
So , for twelve years , he 's been locked up in a beach safe - house in South Florida .
Kolb is apparently ready to come out of hiding and latch on to Yesil in South Florida for a few bucks and bones as Yesil 's PR guy and trash Hirschfeld and Sensi , Kolb makes up one fictional scenario after another about Hirschfeld et al. to dismiss discredit them and their allegations about Yesil to the authorities and courts .
For example , Kolb claims Hirschfeld et al. , arranged for the Ayatollah to keep the 56 American hostages a little while longer so Carter would n't get re-elected .
This , of course , is delusional .
However , and I must admit the following deeds he attributes to us are true : crediting us for releasing several hostages throughout the years after that , as well as the capture of the Marcoses , and even the capture of Saddam Hussein through hundreds of millions swindled from us by Yesil at LensExpress , then from Yesil by us at Nterra Holdings .
Ho Hum .
If anyone there is serious about scripting a movie about these subject matters , I think I could convince Bob Sensi who does and always has worked for the United States Government , and General Wayne Jackson , a tremendous patriot , retired from many very important posts for the United States Government , and myself -- just a proud friend of Sensi and Jackson and former associate and friend of the now deceased Richard Hirschfeld --- would be happy to help you to get the facts straight , a very intriguing story indeed , but just keep Kolb at a distance from us otherwise we might be tempted to pull out one of our James Bond spy weapons and neutralize him on the set .

In 1969 Soviet dissident Andrei Amalrik smuggled to the West his prescient essay , " Will the Soviet Union Survive until 1984 ? "
Amalrik predicted that a collapse of the Soviet system would result from an explosion of suppressed national sentiment in the republics , a moribund economy , the incompetence of a self - selecting leadership , governance based on obedience and adherence to the Party line by loyal apparatchiks unable to cope with reality or to innovate , and an eventual Sino - Soviet war .
Of course , it turned out to be the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan , not a Sino - Soviet war , which served as the catalyst to overwhelm the Soviet economy and ultimately the Soviet Empire .
Amalrik was off in his prediction by seven years , but his overall analysis was uncannily accurate .
In 1976 Emmanuel Todd , a French historian , anthropologist , and demographer , scrutinized demographic data on the decline of birth rates in the Soviet Union , on a rise in infant mortality , and on a striking decline in life expectancy among Soviet males to write " The Final Fall : An Essay on the Decomposition of the Soviet Sphere " ( 1976 , Editions Robert Laffont ; 1979 , Kary Publishers ) .
When Gorbachev inherited power from the senile Old Guard ( the rigid and doddering Brezhnev , followed by the intelligent but doddering Andropov , followed in turn by the clueless and doddering Chernenko ) , he submitted to political pressure to feed what Khrushchev had called the Soviet Union 's " steel - eaters , " i.e. , the military - industrial complex , and to try to suppress the Afghan insurgency .
At the same time Gorbachev launched a moral crusade against alcoholism , curtailed the state monopoly 's production of vodka , limited vodka sales , greatly reduced liquor tax revenues , and increased the central budget deficit , thereby hastening financial and economic collapse .
( Oddly enough , during World War I the Tsarist government had done the same thing with vodka production and the national budget , and had suffered the same economic result : collapse . )
Toward the Soviet Empire 's end , whether in the outlying satellites and provinces or in the Russian heartland , even lifelong , loyal Communist Party members had stopped believing the lies , the deceptions , and the obvious delusions of their feckless , incompetent , self - serving , utterly corrupt , out - of - touch leadership .
The Old Guard 's clumsy anti-Gorbachev coup attempt in 1991 proved to be the blunder too far -- the mortal wound to the system .
Boris Yeltsin stood on a tank outside Parliament to rally Russian democrats to resist the coup , and Mstislav Rostropovich immediately flew to Moscow to camp out at Parliament and show his solidarity with Yeltsin .
The coup collapsed , but by then Gorbachev himself had become discredited and irrelevant , and the Soviet Union rapidly disintegrated into its constituent republics .
Todd later turned his gaze to the U.S. in " After the Empire : The Breakdown of the American Order " ( 2002 , Editions Gallimard ; 2003 Columbia University Press ) .
In this second book Todd 's demographic arguments are weak ( though recent surges in infant morality in the Deep South give Todd 's early demographic data retrospective weight ) , but his economic and historical analysis seems trenchant , and he predicts that in the relatively near term America 's financial indiscipline and runaway consumption habits will result in a crash leading to a necessary 15 to 20 percent reduction in American living standards .
Todd reasons that the U.S. , despite its military prowess , simply lacks the power to enforce its hegemony everywhere it wishes and that its increasingly fragile , debt - dependent economy cannot sustain for long such an overreaching imperial policy .
Todd describes the U.S. as a " superpower living hand to mouth , " led by a ruling class " even more rudderless and clueless than its European counterparts , " and incapable of achieving its global aims through repeated applications of " theatrical micromilitarism . "
Todd argues that the disintegration of American hegemony already is in full swing , and he predicts that the Bush American Administration and its neocon theorists " will go down in history as the gravediggers of the American empire . "
In " The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers : Economic Change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000 " ( 1987 , Random House ) , Yale historian Paul Kennedy presented a compelling argument that eerily paralleled Todd's .
Kennedy detected an oft - repeated standard formula for great power decline and collapse .
Great powers ( such as the Habsburg , French , Turkish , Dutch , Spanish , Russian , British , Japanese , Soviet , and eventually American Empires ) get in the habit of using military force to protect what they view as their broad economic interests , but in doing so , they divert investment from productive social and economic purposes into nonproductive military ends .
Inevitably , more dynamic , productive economies position themselves to replace the aging great power when its military overspending inexorably leads to its relative economic and social decline , whether gradual or sudden .
Apparently , American neocon ideologues at the turn of the twenty - first century , like Soviet ideologues in the 1980's , " do n't know much about his - to - ry . "
Or perhaps they merely misinterpreted Paul Kennedy and took his paradigm as a tragic Greek template that must be blindly followed .
The more the U.S. seeks to assert its will through diktat and unilateral military force , the more it ensures that the other major players will find it increasingly in their best interests to collaborate more closely with one another to deflect and frustrate the American imperium .
Note the increasing collaboration between rising Asian giants China and India as one canary in the mineshaft .
In the past week newly published data showed that China has replaced the U.S. as Japan 's major trading partner .
Note the deepening commercial relationships between China and Europe .
Note the rapidly increasing economic and political collaboration between China and Saudi Arabia .
Note the accelerating drift away from the U.S. dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
In the past week the dollar fell to historical lows against the euro .
Note the robust military collaboration between China and Russia .
Note the recent decision by China and Japan to establish a military " hot line . "
China will hold military exercises with several ASEAN states in the coming year .
Note the increasing disinclination of Europeans , notably the Germans , French , Spanish , and Italians , to support -- much less finance -- American imperial misadventures , such as the rapidly imploding debacle in Iraq .
Note the disinclination of the Europeans to continue to tolerate the tenure of American neocon ideologue Paul Wolfowitz at the World Bank .
Where and when will the reality - challenged Bush Administration commit its blunder too far ?
Perhaps that blunder will turn out to be the invasion and failed occupation of Iraq .
Or perhaps the ultimate catalytic blunder will occur in Iran , which remains on the neocon wish list as a target for destabilization , intervention , " liberation , " and regime change .
The collapse of the American Empire is not over the horizon -- an event lurking around a distant corner a few decades down the road .
We are already in the very midst of it .
It is like a staged train wreck unfolding frame - by - frame as we reflect in head - shaking disbelief on each day 's news and on each new blunder by the Bush Administration .
Can the U.S. navigate its way to become a post - imperial , normal country -- working responsibly as one great power among several rather than quixotically striving to be the sole global hegemon ?
Can it do so while avoiding further military disasters and a debilitating financial and economic collapse ?
Or will the decline be precipitous and disorderly , accelerated by corrupt , clueless , inept , and rigid leadership , as was the Soviet Empire 's collapse ?
WATER washes away many things , but could it be used to kill harmful viruses , fungi and bacteria in wounds ?
The developers of a form of “ super - oxidised ” water certainly think so – and they claim it may do so more effectively than bleach , without harming human tissue .
Information on the product , called Microcyn , was presented last week at Global Healthcare , a biomedical business conference in Monte Carlo , Monaco .
It revealed that wounds of patients with diabetes treated with the product and an antibiotic healed within 43 days on average , compared with 55 days for patients given the standard treatment of iodine plus …

An online game operator has demanded that banned players donate blood to be allowed back into the game .
Moliyo , which runs a 3D massively multiplayer online game in China , made the demand after banning 120,000 players who attempted to hack the game , according to gaming news website , 17173.com .
More than 100 players had already signed up to exchange half a litre ( 1 pint ) of blood for game accounts , 17173 reported ( in Chinese ) .
The company has also offered free accounts to ordinary players who give blood , the website claimed .
Texyt.com staff were unable to locate the announcement on Moliyo's website , although the company 's forum does include a copy ( in Chinese ) of 17173 's story .
According to the announcement , the players must attend a public blood donation drive in the city of Nanjing tomorrow afternoon .
Locked accounts will be reopened within 3 days .
Chinese hospitals have had increasing difficulty attracting blood donors in recent years after scandals in which tens of thousands of donors and blood recipients contracted HIV , the virus which causes AIDS .
Blood donors in China are usually paid about 12 dollars per donation .
Moliyo arranged the event in an attempt to “ create a civilized society , and enhance online gamers ' appreciation of social responsibility and public welfare , ” according to 17173.com .
The games company banned 120,000 players of the popular game Cabal earlier this month , because they used unauthorized software to artificially boost their standing in the game .
Moliyo operates several games in China , including Cabal , and Tales of Pirates .
images/news/microsoft.jpgNot only is Windows XP Service Pack 3 alive and kicking , but Microsoft also managed to leak details about what the refresh will contain .
The Redmond Company 's policy when it comes down to future releases of the Windows platform is to gag all details .
WindowsXP SP3 is old news for Microsoft .
And with the general availability of Windows Vista it was pushed to the background .
But in all fairness , Microsoft never confirmed the cancellation of the third service pack for Windows XP .
The company only scrapped it out of sight and under the rug with repeated delays .
Windows XP SP3 , despite its collection of delays , will make it to the market , and Microsoft plans in integrate changes to Internet Explorer and to Windows Media Player into the refresh .
" Microsoft has agreed to make changes to Windows XP , two Middleware Products , and Windows Live Messenger .
The Windows Live Messenger changes have been delivered in the Windows Live Messenger 8.5 beta and will be included in the public release .
Changes for Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player will be made available to users in August 2007 and Microsoft is discussing with the TC the delivery mechanism for those changes .
The Windows XP changes will be incorporated into Service Pack 3 for Windows XP , " revealed the U.S. Justice department in its filing .
The long - held notion that girls prefer pink while boys prefer blue may hold some truth , suggests a new study .
And moreover , there might be a biological basis for why women prefer pink – or at least more reddish colours than men , say researchers .
The authors of the new study say their findings support the theory that colour vision evolved in humans in part to help females spot ripe fruit such as red berries .
Both sexes find blues more appealing than other shades of the rainbow according to previous research , says Anya Hurlbert at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne , UK , who led the study .
However , scientists have lacked good evidence as to whether women and men really differ in terms of the shades they like best .
Hurlbert and her colleagues tested colour preferences in 171 British adults and 37 recent immigrants to the UK from mainland China , with almost equal numbers of men and women .
Advertisement
The idea of testing the two groups was to separate out whether culture or biology might influence gender preferences for colour .
Each participant viewed about 750 different pairs of colours spanning the entire rainbow , and in each case had to indicate which of the two shades they preferred .
Feminine preference
As expected from previous work , both sexes rated blues as best .
But analysis of all the colour comparisons revealed that the women had a significantly higher preference for blues with “ pinkish ” undertones – such as lilac – whereas men tend to lean towards purer blues .
Hurlbert thinks that women might prefer pinker shades because – in cultures where pink represents girlishness and femininity – they have learned to identify with it .
But she adds that the Chinese women in her study , who grew up without commercial toys such as Barbie that promote pink to girls , showed an even greater liking for pinkish hues than their British female counterparts .
So Hurlbert believes that women ’s attraction towards pinkish colours is innate .
She acknowledges , however , that there might be other cultural influences on colour preference beyond toys that explain why Chinese women prefer pinkish hues , too .
The study might provide insight into why humans evolved colour vision in the first place , say the researchers .
Although many mammals are thought to lack sophisticated colour perception , humans and several other primates , such as gorillas , possess advanced colour vision thanks to specialised receptors in the eye that can pick up on three different ranges of light waves .
Fruit gatherers
Some biologists have proposed that our primate ancestors developed this advanced form of colour vision because it made it easier to pick out reddish , ripe fruit against a background of green vegetation .
Hurlbert believes her finding that women show a greater liking for redder hues supports this theory because females are thought to have done most of the fruit gathering .
She admits , though , that just because women prefer pinkish colours does not mean they spot them faster than men do .
Hurlbert speculates there may also be evolutionary arguments for both sexes ’ preference for blue .
“ Going back to our ‘ savannah ’ days , we would have a natural preference for a clear blue sky , because it signalled good weather .
Clear blue also signals a good water source . ”

In this country , the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure is liposuction : doctors vacuum out something like two million pounds of fat from the thighs , bellies , buttocks , jowls and man-breasts of 325,000 people a year .
What happens to all that extracted adipose tissue ?
It ’s bagged and disposed of as medical waste ; or maybe , given the recent news about socially contagious fat , it ’s sent by FedEx to the patients ’ old college chums .
But one thing the fat surely is not , and that is given due thanks for serving as scapegoat , and for a job well done .
We are now in what feels like the 347th year of the fastidiously vilified “ obesity epidemic . ”
Health officials repeatedly warn that everywhere in the world people are gaining too much weight and putting themselves at risk of diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease and other obesity - linked illnesses , not to mention taking up more than their fair share of molded plastic subway seat .
It ’s easy to fear and despise our body fat and to see it as an unnatural , inert , pointless counterpoint to all things phat and fabulous .
Yet fat tissue is not the problem here , and to castigate fat for getting too big and to blame it for high blood pressure or a wheezing heart is like a heavy drinker blaming the liver for turning cirrhotic .
Just as the lush ’s liver was merely doing its hepatic best to detoxify the large quantities of liquor in which it was doused , and just as the alcoholic would have been far worse off had the liver not been playing Hepa - filter in the first place , so our fat tissue , by efficiently absorbing the excess packets of energy we put in our mouths , has our best interests at heart .
“ Obesity is not due to any defect in adipose tissue per se ; it ’s an issue of energy balance , ” said Bruce M. Spiegelman of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
If you are consuming too many calories relative to what you burn off , the body must cope with that energy surplus , he said , “ and adipose tissue is the proper place for it . ”
The Internet is a tightly controlled privilege in Cuba , reserved for the trusted elite .
Private citizens are prohibited from buying computers or accessing the Internet without special authorization .
Access in Cuba is limited to citizens who can prove they are engaged in research or connected to an accredited and approved institution .
And only about 2 % of Cubans even have telephones , so Internet access , even if they could acquire a computer , would be almost impossible for the average person in Cuba .
I guess they wo n't be visiting Carpe Diem , or any other blog or website , any time soon ( see the map above of visits to Carpe Diem ) !
Because his station was the most immediate , moment - to - moment source of information in the region , I asked Cohen how it had felt to be inside the hurricane .
“ Friday before the storm , we were feeling good , ” he said .
“ The National Hurricane Center said that this would really hit the Florida panhandle , not us .
We were barely in the ‘ cone of error ’ in New Orleans .
So I kicked off for the day on Friday at one o’clock and went to the gym .
But at around four my pager started going haywire .
Max Mayfield , the director of the National Hurricane Center , had changed his prediction .
There was a hundred - and - fifty - mile shift to the west . ”
It was going to be a problem to get people in the city to adjust .
“ In New Orleans , people go home at lunch on Fridays , ” Cohen said .
“ All year round .
And Friday night was a football night .
The Ravens were in town to play a preseason game against the Saints at the Superdome .
It was also a big high - school football night , the jamboree games , which kick off the season .
People were out drinking , having a good time .
They were consuming very little media .
But by Saturday morning we were told there was mandatory evacuation for Plaquemines Parish , to the southeast , and some coastal areas , though not yet New Orleans .
On Saturday , Ray Nagin was still saying that we have time to watch this .
A lot of people were clueless .
They had no idea there were evacuations .
“ We ’ve always talked about the worst - case scenarios in Louisiana , ” Cohen continued .
“ They talk about ‘ slosh models ’ — computer - generated models on what would happen .
The geography is obvious .
If you are walking along the riverfront in downtown New Orleans , you are looking up at the Mississippi River .
You look up at Lake Pontchartrain , up at the canals .
When the water flows in , you have a city that becomes a tidal lake , with sharks and manatees and all the rest .
“ By ten on Saturday night , Nagin was really concerned .
He got a call from Max Mayfield saying that he should evacuate the city .
And on Sunday morning Nagin issued a mandatory evacuation order .
Sunday night , there were gale - force winds .
We were told that if you were n’t out by now it was too late , that — and this was the quote — ‘ preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion . ’
We were broadcasting all of Sunday night .
The power went out in the city .
The eye of the storm was n’t even near us , but our windows in the downtown studio started cracking .
And on Monday morning , while Garland Robinette was on the air , the windows blew in .
“ Landfall was at 6 a.m. on the coast , ” he went on .
“ We feared that it would get to New Orleans at exactly 90 longitude , 30 latitude , and it got to 89.6 .
At 1 a.m. , it went due north , and it felt like Christmas had come early .
It was staying at 89.6 at 2 , 3 , 4 a.m. with one - hundred - and - fifty - mile - per - hour winds , but still it did not look like the worst - case scenario .
Roofs were flying off houses , cars moved around in the wind , there were rapids in the streets , but still . . .
On Monday night , there were reports that water was coming over the Seventeenth Street canal , which separates Orleans Parish and Jefferson Parish , to the west .
The water was coming over in the dark .
The levee itself is in Lakeview , an upscale lakefront neighborhood near where I - 10 and I - 610 split .
At six in the morning , we were told that the levee had been ripped apart and water was pouring in .
I went on the radio and said that eyewitnesses had said ‘ The bowl is filling . ’
So I said , ‘ Get out if you are to the east of the Seventeenth Street canal .
That ’s the whole city .
It ’s as bad as the Mississippi River breaking through .
Lake Pontchartrain is emptying into the city of New Orleans .
The water is rising and it ’s not going to stop .
Get out now . ’
“ We started getting amazing phone calls : a woman in her house with a two - year - old on one shoulder , a five - year - old at her side , no formula , no food , ‘ What do I do ? ’
And what can I tell her ?
I ’m just a guy on the radio ! ”
Like so many other news people in town , Dave Cohen had been preparing forty - years - later reports on Hurricane Betsy when Katrina hit .
Although L.B.J. and the local officials of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana responded to their crisis with far greater coördination and speed than their successors in 2005 , the memories of Betsy remain bitter , and not only because of the suffering and destruction it caused .
As Edward Haas has made clear , Betsy was followed within days by widespread rumors that Mayor Schiro had ordered floodwater pumped out of his own well - to - do subdivision , Lake Vista , and into the Ninth Ward .
At the time of the flood , Schiro was in a race for reëlection with another Democrat , the city council president , James E. Fitzmorris , Jr. There were also stories that he had ordered the levees breached .
Thomas E. Allen , of Hunt Foods & Industries , an ally of the Mayor ’s , wrote to him to say that two of his African - American servants “ brought this tale to my wife yesterday and said that all of the Negroes were talking about it and were angry with you about it . ”
Haas quotes Schiro ’s secretary , Marguerite Guette , who told the Mayor , “ An old 71 - years of age colored man by the name of Williams , who says you have helped him all of his life and who lives at 2630 Republic Street , called to say that he is very concerned about a rumor that is going around that may ruin you with colored voters .
The rumor is that you cut the Industrial Canal to drown the colored people so that they would not vote in the coming election . ”
An aide to the Mayor later reported that people claiming to be relief workers and Schiro supporters delivered bags of “ supplies ” to flood victims in the Ninth Ward .
People opened the bags only to find spoiled food and soiled , useless clothing .
Four years ago , a play staged in New Orleans called “ An Evening with Betsy ” explored the old conspiracy rumors .
And although among historians Schiro earns high marks for his handling of the flood ( if not for his obstinate views on race ) , the rumors persist .
“ That theory is why older people in the Ninth Ward still keep hatchets in their attics , ” Dave Cohen had told me .
“ They remember what it was like to be trapped , with the water rising and no way to get to the roof . ”
The pattern in Katrina ’s wake is similar .
Everywhere I went in Louisiana and Texas to talk to evacuees , many of the poorest among them were not only furious — furious at the President and local officials , furious at being ignored for days — but inclined to believe , as many did after Betsy , that the flooding of the city was , or could have been , a deliberate act .
In the town of New Iberia , south of Lafayette , a few hundred New Orleanians , nearly all of them African - American , were staying at a gym on the grounds of West End Park .
It was dusk when I arrived , and people were wandering around the athletic field , shooing away clouds of mosquitoes , drinking bottles of cold water provided by the Red Cross , and recounting for each other , yet again , their exodus stories .
“ Biblical proportions ” — everyone used that phrase , and why not ?
I went inside and noticed a couple of signs : “ This is Our Home .
Please Respect Us . ” “ Evacuees and Volunteers Only Beyond This Point : Curfew 730 , Lights Out 10 , TV off at 10:30 . ”
Two of the Red Cross volunteers who had organized the shelter and were keeping it running told me that they had been at Ground Zero in New York four years ago and that , in many ways , this was worse .
“ A whole city ruined , ” one said .
“ More than a million people leaving their homes . ”
“ Biblical proportions , ” the other said .
Astronomers using NASA ’s Swift and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellites have discovered a very bizarre object .
It only has about 7 times the mass of Jupiter , but instead of orbiting a star , it ’s orbiting a pulsar .
Oh , and it ’s not a planet .
It ’s all that ’s left from a star after the pulsar siphoned away most of its material .
The ghastly duo was discovered on June 7 when Swift picked up a burst of X - rays and gamma rays coming from the direction of the galactic centre .
Rossi turned to gaze at the source as well , and confirmed that it ’s pulsing out X - rays 182.07 times a second .
These are the classic characteristics of a pulsar – the rapidly spinning remains of a massive star .
Normally a pulsar like this is slowing down over time , releasing energy that decreases its rotational velocity .
However , in the case of SWIFT J1756.9-2508 , it ’s actually speeding up .
This means that some source is supplying the pulsar with additional material to increase its spin rate .
The researchers were able to detect that a low mass object is orbiting the pulsar , tugging it back and forth , towards and away from the Earth .
Astronomers were then able to calculate that this binary companion has somewhere between 7 and 30 times the mass of Jupiter .
The system probably formed billions of years ago as a very massive star and a smaller companion with 1 to 3 solar masses .
The massive star evolved quickly and then detonated as a supernova .
The smaller star eventually died as well , becoming a red giant , and encompassing the pulsar .
This slowed down their orbits enough to begin them spiraling inward .
Today they ’re so close that the pulsar produces a tidal bulge on the surface of the dead star , siphoning material away .
Sometimes there ’s so much mass accumulated that it piles up and explodes as the outburst that led astronomers to the discovery in the first place .
Do n’t think of the companion as a planet .
“ Despite its extremely low mass , the companion isnâ€™t considered a planet because of its formation , ” says researcher Christopher Deloye of Northwestern University .
“ Itâ€ ™s essentially a white dwarf that has been whittled down to a planetary mass . ”

Update 4 : Why you do n’t want to shard .
by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog .
Optimize everything else first , and then if performance still is n’t good enough , it ’s time to take a very bitter medicine .
Update 3 : Building Scalable Databases : Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes by Dare Obasanjo .
Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture , how to shard , and problems with sharding .
Update 2 : Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding by Alan Rimm - Kaufman of 37signals .
Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization .
With more memory , more CPU , and new tech like SSD , problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed .
Add features not infrastructure .
Jeremy Zawodny says he 's wrong wrong wrong .
we 're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds .
Moore wo n't save you .
Update : Dan Pritchett shares some excellent Sharding Lessons : Size Your Shards , Use Math on Shard Counts , Carefully Consider the Spread , Plan for Exceeding Your Shards
Once upon a time we scaled databases by buying ever bigger , faster , and more expensive machines .
While this arrangement is great for big iron profit margins , it does n't work so well for the bank accounts of our heroic system builders who need to scale well past what they can afford to spend on giant database servers .
In a extraordinary two article series , Dathan Pattishall , explains his motivation for a revolutionary new database architecture -- sharding -- that he began thinking about even before he worked at Friendster , and fully implemented at Flickr .
Flickr now handles more than 1 billion transactions per day , responding in less then a few seconds and can scale linearly at a low cost .
What is sharding and how has it come to be the answer to large website scaling problems ?
Information Sources
What is sharding ?
While working at Auction Watch , Dathan got the idea to solve their scaling problems by creating a database server for a group of users and running those servers on cheap Linux boxes .
In this scheme the data for User A is stored on one server and the data for User B is stored on another server .
It 's a federated model .
Groups of 500K users are stored together in what are called shards .
The advantages are :
High availability .
If one box goes down the others still operate .
Faster queries .
Smaller amounts of data in each user group mean faster querying .
More write bandwidth .
With no master database serializing writes you can write in parallel which increases your write throughput .
Writing is major bottleneck for many websites .
You can do more work .
A parallel backend means you can do more work simultaneously .
You can handle higher user loads , especially when writing data , because there are parallel paths through your system .
You can load balance web servers , which access shards over different network paths , which are processed by separate CPUs , which use separate caches of RAM and separate disk IO paths to process work .
Very few bottlenecks limit your work .
How is sharding different than traditional architectures ?
Sharding is different than traditional database architecture in several important ways :
Data are denormalized .
Traditionally we normalize data .
Data are splayed out into anomaly - less tables and then joined back together again when they need to be used .
In sharding the data are denormalized .
You store together data that are used together .
This does n't mean you do n't also segregate data by type .
You can keep a user 's profile data separate from their comments , blogs , email , media , etc , but the user profile data would be stored and retrieved as a whole .
This is a very fast approach .
You just get a blob and store a blob .
No joins are needed and it can be written with one disk write .
Data are parallelized across many physical instances .
Historically database servers are scaled up .
You buy bigger machines to get more power .
With sharding the data are parallelized and you scale by scaling out .
Using this approach you can get massively more work done because it can be done in parallel .
Data are kept small .
The larger a set of data a server handles the harder it is to cash intelligently because you have such a wide diversity of data being accessed .
You need huge gobs of RAM that may not even be enough to cache the data when you need it .
By isolating data into smaller shards the data you are accessing is more likely to stay in cache .
Smaller sets of data are also easier to backup , restore , and manage .
Data are more highly available .
Since the shards are independent a failure in one does n't cause a failure in another .
And if you make each shard operate at 50 % capacity it 's much easier to upgrade a shard in place .
Keeping multiple data copies within a shard also helps with redundancy and making the data more parallelized so more work can be done on the data .
You can also setup a shard to have a master - slave or dual master relationship within the shard to avoid a single point of failure within the shard .
If one server goes down the other can take over .
It does n't use replication .
Replicating data from a master server to slave servers is a traditional approach to scaling .
Data is written to a master server and then replicated to one or more slave servers .
At that point read operations can be handled by the slaves , but all writes happen on the master .
Obviously the master becomes the write bottleneck and a single point of failure .
And as load increases the cost of replication increases .
Replication costs in CPU , network bandwidth , and disk IO .
The slaves fall behind and have stale data .
The folks at YouTube had a big problem with replication overhead as they scaled .
Sharding cleanly and elegantly solves the problems with replication .
Some Problems With Sharding Sharding is n't perfect .
It does have a few problems .
Rebalancing data .
What happens when a shard outgrows your storage and needs to be split ?
Let 's say some user has a particularly large friends list that blows your storage capacity for the shard .
You need to move the user to a different shard .
On some platforms I 've worked on this is a killer problem .
You had to build out the data center correctly from the start because moving data from shard to shard required a lot of downtime .
Rebalancing has to be built in from the start .
Google 's shards automatically rebalance .
For this to work data references must go through some sort of naming service so they can be relocated .
This is what Flickr does .
And your references must be invalidateable so the underlying data can be moved while you are using it .
Joining data from multiple shards .
To create a complex friends page , or a user profile page , or a thread discussion page , you usually must pull together lots of different data from many different sources .
With sharding you can't just issue a query and get back all the data .
You have to make individual requests to your data sources , get all the responses , and the build the page .
Thankfully , because of caching and fast networks this process is usually fast enough that your page load times can be excellent .
How do you partition your data in shards ?
What data do you put in which shard ?
Where do comments go ?
Should all user data really go together , or just their profile data ?
Should a user 's media , IMs , friends lists , etc go somewhere else ?
Unfortunately there are no easy answer to these questions .
Less leverage .
People have experience with traditional RDBMS tools so there is a lot of help out there .
You have books , experts , tool chains , and discussion forums when something goes wrong or you are wondering how to implement a new feature .
Eclipse wo n't have a shard view and you wo n't find any automated backup and restore programs for your shard .
With sharding you are on your own .
Implementing shards is not well supported .
Sharding is currently mostly a roll your own approach .
LiveJournal makes their tool chain available .
Hibernate has a library under development .
MySQL has added support for partioning .
But in general it 's still something you must implement yourself .

I used to spend a lot of time in American embassies .
For much of its existence , Geekcorps was funded primarily by USAID , so meetings in nations where we worked or wanted to work were often in the embassy compound .
( In nations where USAID has a large presence , it often has its own offices – in ones where it ’s a smaller presence , the office is often within the embassy . )
I also got into the habit of meeting with the Commercial section of US embassies , always a good way to get a sense for the local business scene … or the US government perception of the local business scene … which inevitably involved embassy meetings .
It ’s not easy to get admitted to a US embassy , even if you ’re carrying a US passport .
( The situation is much worse for people attempting to get interviews to obtain US visas . )
Not only is there a security check involving x-rays of bags and a pass through a metal detector , followed by a patdown , but certain items ca n’t enter an embassy .
Anything that might be used as a bugging device – a mobile phone , a PDA , a laptop computer – must be checked at the gatehouse before you enter the main building .
Working with the US government , you get into the habit of working on paper – at the height of my work with Geekcorps , my calendar , phone book and other critical resources were all printed out in my Circa notebook , so I could have access to my digital data on paper during meetings …
( The security rules had some other odd implications .
You ca n’t bring any medicines or drugs into most US embassies , including aspirin .
As an insulin - dependent diabetic , this is a really unnerving situation , as you ’re leaving medicine which is hard to obtain in a country like Mongolia with the Wackenhut guards , praying you ’ll get it back .
One of the reasons I do n’t wear an insulin pump is that the notion of having to explain the pump to the guards or leave it with them … )
You can learn a lot about how the US government views a country by virtue of the location and the structure of the embassy .
In Ghana , the US embassy had two main locations – one was on the Ring Road , the main road of Accra , and another was in a residential neighborhood in Osu , an upscale part of town .
We shared a security wall with this second part of the embassy – the consular section – and they were excellent neighbors .
If you ignored the fact that the road was blocked in front of the consular section , you might have imagined that the compound was merely the location of a somewhat security - conscious Ghanaian business .
That style of embassy – an approachable , visible building integrated into the downtown of a city – is an old - school approach to embassy design .
According to Jane Loeffler , who literally wrote the book on US embassy design , the visibility and accessibility of these buildings was part of their mission : “ prominent , accessible public buildings to be visited and admired by American citizens and their foreign hosts . ”
The US built a lot of these embassies in the 1950s , but changed tactics in the 1960s , as US policy in Vietnam became less popular and attacks on embassy buildings became more common .
Attacks on the embassies in Khartoum , Athens , Kuala Lumpur and Beirut in the 1970s and 1980s changed the philosophy of embassy design for good .
In countries where the US government believes that the local population is unlikely to be opposed to US interests , embassies tend to be easily accessible , located downtown and protected by a modest amount of visible security ( usually substantially set back from the road , with a perimeter of concrete road obstacles ) .
In countries where the threat is considered more serious , US embassies are fortresses .
Specifically , they are “ Inman ” buildings , designed to meet a set of security standards proposed by retured Admiral Bobby Inman , a former head of the NSA – Inman proposed that buildings be remote , on large and fortified sites , and designed to withstand bomb blasts .
In 1998 , terrorist attacks on embassies in Tanzania and Kenya killed at least 220 people , primarily African employees of the US government .
The old Kenyan embassy had been near downtown Nairobi – the old one is far , far removed from the city center , a long taxi ride from downtown .
Non-official vehicles are n’t allowed into the compound , and you ’re not allowed to park your vehicle nearby – instead , you take a taxi to a drop - off point hundreds of meters from the main gate and walk to the gatehouse , then walk again to the main building .
The doors to the embassy are thick , bomb - proof vault doors , and when they close behind you , it ’s clear that you ’re far , far away from Nairobi .
Obviously it makes sense that the US government wants to protect diplomats and the people who work with them from attack – had the US embassy in Kenya not been in a crowded part of town , the collateral damage to citizens ( reports of up to 4,000 people wounded ) would have been much lower .
But this new style of embassy construction has practical and symbolic implications .
Loeffler wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post two weeks after the East Africa bombings titled “ Diplomacy Does n’t Belong In Bunkers “ , which argued in part , “ defensive building styles bring problems of their own , creating an atmosphere of suspicion and divorcing diplomats from the communities they need to know and understand . ”
Architecture sends messages .
Our embassies say that America fears Kenyans more than Ghanaians ( or did – see update at the end of this post ) , Chinese more than Mongolians .
And we fear no one more than the Iraqis .
Loeffler has an article in the upcoming issue of Foreign Policy that analyzes the US Embassy in Iraq in detail .
It ’s the largest embassy building in the world , covering 104 acres in the Green Zone .
That ’s six times larger than the UN complex on the banks of the East River in New York .
It incorporates 619 one - bedroom apartments , as well as all the facilities to support a small city – an electricity plant , water , sewage , a food court , movie theatre , market – all surrounded by nine - foot high walls .
What message does this send ?
Loeffler observes , “ … the United States has designed an embassy that conveys no confidence in Iraqis and little hope for their future .
Instead , the United States has build a fortress capable of sustaining a massive , long - term presence in the face of continued violence . ”
Another clear message is the fact that the US is never , ever planning on leaving Iraq – a perception many Iraqis will tell you they ’ve had since the opening days of the invasion .
The embassy may cost more than a billion dollars to build and a similar amount per year to operate – its architecture , cost , self - sufficiency and isolation make it very clear that the US is n’t going away any time soon , no matter what Congressional democrats – and most Americans – may hope .
Approachability is clearly not a priority for American diplomats in Iraq .
The New York Times reports that Iraqis who ’ve worked for the US government and contractors – who are therefore at great risk of death or kidnapping in Iraq – are n’t signing up for refugee status .
Why ?
Because they ca n’t do so in Iraq – they need to flee to Jordan or Syria , where they ’re likely to be turned away at the border .
I ca n’t think of a more shameful policy than forcing people who ’ve risked their lives to support our disastrous mission in Iraq to flee their country to seek refugee status in our country .
In the halcyon days of Mission Accomplished , IESC – the USAID contractor that took over operations of Geekcorps – started bidding for projects in Iraq .
They hoped that we could recruit computer geeks to come build internet centers in schools and libraries around Iraq .
I refused to work on the project , believing that there was no chance that volunteers would be able to have the cultural experiences we wanted to create with the Geekcorps program – the chance to work and live close to people in the country .
A few months later , I ’d left the company , and it seemed clear that it would be years before it might be possible for volunteers to walk the streets of Baghdad and interact with Iraqis without armed escort .
The structure of the US embassy in Iraq implies that the time when that sort of interaction might take place may be never .
I can understand the need to build a fortress in Baghdad .
But Loeffler warns that the design for the US embassy in Iraq is going to inform future embassy design around the world .
The cosy , approachable neighborhood embassy may well be a thing of the past , from Accra to Ulaanbaatar .
In the grand scope of all the terrible decisions made post - 9/11 , it may seem like a small thing , but I suspect it ’s a huge step backwards for US diplomacy for many years to come .
Architecture is a form of communication that lasts for decades or centuries .
I hope for a future where embassies that embody Fortress America seem like anachronisms , the memories of an unhappy , scared time that ’s now past .
Kwasi points out that I ’m already behind the times with this post – the US has upgraded its embassy in Ghana to a new structure that comes much closer to the fortress model than the humble old structures did .

Rubik 's cube has foxed people since the early 1980s
The research has proved that a Rubik 's cube can be returned to its original state in no more than 26 moves .
The supercomputer took 63 hours to crank out the proof which goes one better than the previous best solution .
The two computer scientists behind the research project believe that with more work they could push the move count even lower .
Cube crunching
It took some smart thinking by graduate student Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman from Northeastern University in Boston to come up with the proof because cranking through the 43 billion billion possible Rubik 's cube positions would take too long even for a supercomputer .
Instead , the scientists used a two - step technique in their calculations .
Initially , they programmed the supercomputer to arrive at one of 15,000 half - solved solutions .
They knew they could fully solve any of these 15,000 cubes with a few extra moves .
The results showed that any disordered cube could be fully solved in a maximum of 29 moves , but that most cubes took 26 moves or fewer .
The researchers then focused on the small number of " problem " configurations that required more than 26 moves .
Because there were so few " problem " configurations , the researchers could use the supercomputer to search for the best way to fully solve these cubes .
As it turned out the supercomputer was able to fully solve all of these special cases in fewer than 26 moves .
The study brings scientists one step closer to finding the so - called " God 's Number " which is the minimum number of moves needed to solve any disordered Rubik 's cube .
It is so named because God would only need the smallest number of moves to solve a cube .
Theoretical work suggests that God 's Number is in the " low 20s " .
Mr Dunkle and Mr Cooperman announced their findings at the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation in Waterloo , Ontario .
Finally , the British were never able to prevent a steady flow of arms , ammunition , instructors and fighters from entering the colonies from abroad .
Thus Washington , whose Continental Army was down to a few thousand fit soldiers , managed to survive the harsh winter of 1777 - 78 at Valley Forge and rebuild his military strength .
When the British switched their main effort to the Southern colonies , Nathanael Greene , probably the most successful insurgent leader in military history until Mao Zedong , was able to wear down Cornwallis ’s army in the Carolinas to a point where Washington , now reinforced by the French , was able to beat the British in a conventional battle at Yorktown .
It had truly been the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time .
So how did Britain recover ?
War is the parent of illusions , and the first step in ending a war must be to shatter those illusions .
It takes courage to accept defeat and vision to see that good can emerge from what appears to be disaster .
On hearing the news of the defeat at Yorktown , Lord North , the prime minister and architect of the war , is reported to have thrown his arms in the air exclaimed , “ Oh , God , it ’s all over . ”
In fact , for Britain it was just beginning .
The nation was on the threshold of the industrial revolution ; some rising politicians , like William Pitt ( the younger one ) , could see beyond the end of the war and plan for Britain ’s rapid political and economic recovery .
This was no easy task .
Britain was near bankruptcy when peace with America was officially signed .
Pitt , however , realized that because of industrialization his nation was about to experience unprecedented economic growth .
He rose to prime minister in 1783 and set about creating the necessary economic conditions for Britain to become the workshop of the world .
Pitt also passed the India Bill in 1784 — thus ensuring that the sort of poor administration that had soured relations with the American colonies would not be repeated in Britain ’s other territories .
( It also created the position of governor general in India , in which Cornwallis more than redeemed himself from his Yorktown disgrace . )
Most important , Pitt set about rebuilding the British Navy and Army , for he could see that war with France was looming once again .
He would often visit the yards to ensure that ships were being constructed on time .
Under the energetic direction of the Duke of York , the king ’s second son , the army was reorganized and retrained .
New commanders were appointed for both services — men like Nelson and Wellington — who were determined not to make the same mistakes as their predecessors .
It is hardly an overstatement to say that had Britain not ended the American War of Independence when it did , it could never have been in a position to defeat Napoleon .
Trusting in Exceptions To Do What They Do
Sunday , December 3 , 2006
Nobody likes to see exceptions when running an application ; it means something went wrong and you should have been on top of it .
But with that , often times I find people will write code to prevent exceptions rather than just allowing them to occur and then using it in their favor .
Take this bit of ruby code in a rails controller as an example :
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController def show @article = Article.find ( params [ : id ] ) end end
That 's pretty solid , but what happens if someone passes in an ID that does not exist ?
Well in rails ' production mode , it would return a 404 error .
Makes sense !
That article does n't exist , so it can't be found .
I have dabbled with a little SEO and usability and just a 404 is n't cutting it for me .
I think we can redirect our user back on a right track .
For one , we know the user is trying to read an article , so why not redirect the user to a list of all the articles and give them a little warning ?
Solution One
First check that the article exists , and if not , redirect the user to the index page .
def show if Article.exists ?( params [ : id ] ) @article = Article.find ( params [ : id ] ) else flash [ : error ] =
' That article does not exist ' redirect_to :action => ' index ' end end
While this works , this requires two queries to our database ; one to check it 's existence and one to load it .
I think there is a better way , and its secret is to go with the flow of the code .
Solution Two
One thing ActiveRecord : : Base # find does do is raise an exception when it cannot find anything , an ActiveRecord : : RecordNotFound exception .
We can use this bit of knowledge to re-write that method to something a little simpler by trusting it to throw an exception and then for us to rescue it .
def show @article = Article.find ( params [ :id ] ) rescue ActiveRecord :: RecordNotFound flash [ : error ] =
' That article does not exist ' redirect_to :action => ' index ' end
One call to the database and fewer lines of code ( not a lot , but still ) .
This time , that nasty little error has been used in our favor ; but one must n't get lazy when using rescue statements .
Do n't Get Lazy
Notice that I used the constant ActiveRecord : : RecordNotFound with the statement .
Sure , I could have just written rescue , but that hurts us in two ways .
First , it becomes less readable without it .
Having the RecordNotFound is pretty obvious as to the reason we are executing that statement .
Secondly , it can introduce unwanted side effects .
def show @article = Article.find ( params [ : id ] ) some_illegal_operation rescue flash [ : error ] =
' That article does not exist ' redirect_to :action => ' index ' end
Whenever that method is called , it will always redirect the user to the index page with that error message .
Because we 've rescued all errors , we 're not getting any notice about how our some_illegal_operation has caused us grief .
This makes debugging and management harder .
The lesson being , do n't be lazy in those rescues .
Try to avoid a blanket rescue statement if you can .
VMware , a young Silicon Valley company , is the early leader in a fast - growing market for what is called virtual - machine software .
And that puts it on a collision course with Microsoft , the industry ’s Goliath .
A virtual machine essentially mimics a computer so that several copies of an operating system — say , Windows or Linux or both — can run on one physical machine .
It allows computing chores to be done on fewer computers , using less electricity and taking up less space , promising a way to control costs at corporate data centers straining to keep up with the ever - increasing demands of the Internet age .
It is also a product that occupies strategic ground in computing , as a layer of code that resides between a computer ’s hardware and the operating system , usurping some tasks , and potentially undermining the importance of the operating system .
In a meeting with corporate customers in New York last month , Steven A. Ballmer , Microsoft ’s chief executive , said , “ Everybody in the operating system business wants to be the guy on the bottom , ” the software that controls the hardware .
And he vowed that Microsoft , whose Windows operating systems are the main source of its corporate wealth and market power , would “ compete very aggressively with VMware . ”
Most of us experience electromagnetic interference on a fairly regular basis .
For example :
If I put my cell phone down on my desk near the computer , I can hear loud static in my computer 's speakers every time the phone and the tower handshake .
In the same way , my car 's tape player produces loud static whenever I make a call on my cell phone .
When I dial a number on my home 's wireless phone , I can hear the number being dialed through the baby monitor
It is not uncommon for a truck to go by and have its CB radio overwhelm the FM station I am listening to .
Most of us have come across motors that cause radio or TV static .
None of these things , technically , should be happening .
For example , a truck 's CB radio is not transmitting on the FM radio bands , so my radio should never hear CB signals .
However , all transmitters have some tendency to transmit at lower power on harmonic side bands , and this is how the FM radio picks up the CB .
The same thing holds true for the wireless phone crossing over to the baby monitor .
In the case of the cell phone affecting the computer 's speakers , the wire to each speaker is acting like an antenna , and it picks up side bands in the audible range .

These are not dire problems -- they are just a nuisance .
But notice how common they are .
In an airplane , the same phenomena can cause big trouble .
­­An airplane contains a number of radios for a variety of tasks .
There is a radio that the pilots use to talk to ground control and air traffic control ( ATC ) .
There is another radio that the plane uses to disclose its position to ATC computers .
There are radar units used for guidance and weather detection , and so on .
All of these radios are transmitting and receiving information at specific frequencies .
If someone were to turn on a cell phone , the cell phone would transmit with a great deal of power ( up to 3 watts ) .
If it happens to create interference that overlaps with radio frequencies the plane is using , then messages between people or computers may be garbled .
If one of the wires in the plane has damaged shielding , there is some possibility of the wire picking up the phone 's signals just like my computer 's speakers do .
That could create faulty messages between pieces of equipment within the plane .
­Many hospitals have installed wireless networks for equipment networking .
For example , look at the picture of the heart monitor in How Emergency Rooms Work .
The black antenna sticking out of the top of the monitor connects it back to the nursing station via a wireless network .
If you use your cell phone and it creates interference , it can disrupt the transmissions between different pieces of equipment .
That is true even if you simply have the cell phone turned on -- the cell phone and tower handshake with each other every couple of minutes , and your phone sends a burst of data during each handshake .
The prohibition on laptops and CD players during takeoff and landing is addressing the same issue , but the concerns here might fall into the category of " better safe than sorry . "
A poorly shielded laptop could transmit a fair amount of radio energy at its operating frequency , and this could , theoretically , create a problem .

The most active members of LtU for the most part already have a solid foundation in logic .
For the rest of us interested in language design , but who are not already logicians here is a brief reading list on logic , focusing on natural deduction , the preferred method of expressing type systems .
More experienced members of LtU may perhaps consider contributing to the discussion with comments on the suggested reading or alternative suggestions .

And now for something completely different .
Read with tongue ever - so - slightly in cheek .
First Circle — The Virtuous Heathens :
Those who care strongly about liberty in one particular sphere ( e.g. freedom of speech , freedom of religious practice , the drug war , etc. ) but do n't care much about it other spheres .
These people are infuriating for their lack of general theory underlying their politics , but at least they 've sorta got the right idea and can make themselves somewhat useful .
This circle contains members of the NRA , ACLU & other such single - issue organizations , and is guarded by John Stuart Mill .
Second Circle — The Lustful :
Those who fall madly in love with a dim vision they have of a more egalitarian society and then hastily rush off to elope with it , without giving much thought about just how much promise there really is in the relationship .
These people 's hearts are often in the right place but they show a frightening lack of concern for whether or not the policies they endorse are actually likely to accomplish the goals they desire .
This circle is filled with innumerable bleeding - hearts and is guarded by Thomas Sowell .
Third Circle — The Gluttonous :
Those who support illiberal policies simply out of percieved self - interest , and like to paint themselves as victims despite living at a level of material comfort that most previous generations would consider luxurious .
Immigration & outsourcing restrictionists , farmers , labor unions , people who want to be insulated from the costs of their health care , etc .
This circle is guarded by Benjamin Franklin .
Fourth Circle — The Greedy : Lobbyists who think their peculiar obsession should be the government 's top priority .
Corporations pleading for protectionism , finger - wagging nannies on a crusade to enforce " public virtue " , and generally anyone who wants everyone else to suffer for their sense of ideological privilege .
This circle 's most recent acquisition was the execrable Jack Valenti , and is guarded by Milton Friedman .
Fifth Circle — The Wrathful : People who are socialistic primarily out of an ugly resentment of the wealthy or anyone else they percieve as enjoying benefits they privately wish they could enjoy .
Their instinct is not so much to see everyone doing well as to see those currently best - off doing much worse .
This circle is guarded by Ayn Rand , which I think is a suitable punishment for both parties .
Sixth Circle — The Heretics : People who do seem to generally care about liberty but have an anomalous and largely sentimental attachment to illiberal policies in at least one sphere .
They support freedom except the freedom to do drugs , or get an abortion , or freely migrate , or do anything they imagine undermines the war effort , etc .
This circle is guarded by Ron Paul .
Seventh Cirle — The Violent :
This circle is packed with tyrants large and small , politicians , bureaucrats and thugs — those who unquestionably do active violence to human freedom .
( I would also add overdominant parents to this list . )
They 're enabled by the members of other circles , but these are the ones who do the actual trigger - pulling .
This circle is guarded by Thomas Jefferson .
Eighth Circle — The Fraudulent : The Malebolge of public intellectuals — those who have a sphere of influence greater than most of us , and are negligent in their exercise of it by contributing to the darkness and confusion .
This sphere contains everyone from know - nothing idiots like Lou Dobbs of CNN and Bob Herbert of the NYT , to people who are really smart enough to know better yet resolutely avoid any systematic examination of their moral premises , like Matthew Yglesias and Reihan Salam .
This circle is guarded by , who else , Friedrich Hayek .
Ninth Circle — The Traitors :
Here lie lawyers & law professors , and also a significant number of economists , who have some degree of influence over actual legislation and policy .
Particularly the ones like Orin Kerr & Brad DeLong who are smart , reasonable , and may even have some pro-liberty sympathies , but when the rubber hits the road they do some showy handwringing before siding with illiberal policies .
This circle is guarded by David Friedman .
USA strækker sig fra Atlanterhavet i øst til Stillehavet i vest .
Landet grænser mod Canada i den nordlige del af landet og grænser mod Mexico på den sydlige del af landet .
Det imponerende store land er fyldt med forskellige kulturer , religioner og nationaliteter .
USA er delt op i 50 forskellige stater , der alle har særlige egenskaber .
Landet skal opleves i bil på ægte amerikansk manér .
Selvom det kan være en udfordring at nå at besøge alle staterne i USA , kan du stadig opleve en del ved at leje en bil og cruise rundt i landet .
Hvordan du lejer en bil i USA
Du vil hurtigt opdage , at der findes et væld af muligheder for leje af bil i USA .
Den der bedst tjent med det konkurrencedygtige marked er selvfølgelig dig som kunde .
Priserne tvinges ned og kvaliteten stiger , og du kan få rigtig meget for pengene , når du bestiller en udlejningsbil i USA .
Tilbuddene omfatter både forholdsvis lokale biludlejningsfirmaer samt de større firmaer som for eksempel Avis , Budget , Thrifty , Fox og National .
Hvis du foretrækker at hente din bil et bestemt sted og aflevere den et andet sted , kan det være en kæmpe fordel for dig , hvis du bestiller igennem et af de større udlejningsfirmaer .
Vær dog opmærksom på , at prisen ofte vil stige , hvis du vælger at aflevere bilen et andet sted end der , hvor du hentede den .
Hvis du bestiller din udlejningsbil i god tid , kan du få et rigtig godt tilbud .
Ting du skal vide om livet på landevejen
At køre bil i USA er for det meste rart og behageligt .
Som regel er vejene velholdte , og det vil du især opleve , når du kører på motorvejen og hovedvejene .
Det er forholdsvis nemt at følge vejskiltene både når man skal finde vej fra stat til stat , eller når man prøver at finde vej indenfor en stat .
Det kan alligevel være en god idé at købe et kort over landet , så du hele tiden har et godt overblik .
I nogle områder er den amerikanske kørekultur en smule anderledes end hvad du måske er vant til i Danmark .
For det første skal du vide , at trafikreglerne kan variere i forhold til , hvilken stat du befinder dig i .
Vi kan give dig et par generelle regler , der er værd at huske på .
Det er selvfølgelig forbudt at drikke alkohol , når man kører , men hvad der måske kan virke en smule mere overraskende er , at alkohol helst skal opbevares i bilens bagagerum .
Hvis du bliver stoppet af politiet med en åben flaske med alkohol i , kan du få en ordentlig bøde .
Det er som regel tilladt at dreje til højre ved vejkryds og reglen gælder , uanset om der så skulle være rødt lys .
Forudsætningen for dette er bare , at vejbanen skal være fri for trafik , og at der ikke står noget andet på vejskiltene .
Ellers har du højre vigepligt .
Hvis du er i tvivl om noget , skal du endelig spørge dit udlejningsfirma , når du henter din udlejningsbil .
De vil med glæde hjælpe dig med gode råd og tips til , hvordan man kører på de amerikanske veje .
Glem ikke den rigtige forsikring
Når man kører i en udlejningsbil i USA , er det yderst vigtigt , at man sørger for , at man har tilstrækkelig forsikring .
Udover den sædvanlige ansvarsforsikring , skal du også have en ” Additional Liability Insurance ” ( ALI ) , som svarer til en ” udvidet ansvarsforsikring ” .
Derudover kan det være en god idé at undersøge , om biludlejeren også tilbyder tyveriforsikring og ubegrænset kilometertal .
Rejsetips
Vores bedste råd til dig er , at du indsnævrer din ferie til et bestemt og begrænset område i USA .
På den måde får du mest muligt ud af de steder , du beslutter dig for at stoppe ved .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Democratic presidential front - runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she wo n't vote for any more money to support the four - year - old war in Iraq without a plan to start bringing U.S. troops home .
Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton greets people before speaking in Washington on September 17 .
" I 've reached the conclusion that the best way to support our troops is begin bringing them home , " the New York senator and former first lady told CNN's " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer . "
" I do n't believe we should continue to vote for funding that has an open - ended commitment , that has no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the tough political decisions they have to make , or which really gives any urgency to the Bush administration 's diplomatic efforts . "
Clinton 's declaration comes as the Senate debates the Defense Department 's 2008 spending authorization bill .
It follows her vote against a $ 120 billion war - spending bill in May , when Congress dropped a call for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 2008 after President Bush vetoed a bill containing that provision .
" The president has no intention of changing his policy in Iraq , " she said .
" He 's now talking about leaving it to his successor . "
Meanwhile , the Senate 's Republican minority routinely filibusters Democratic proposals to wind down the war , which is costing the Treasury about $ 10 billion a month and has claimed the lives of nearly 3,800 American troops .
May 's spending bill made continued U.S. support contingent on a set of benchmarks for Iraq 's government .
But the Iraqis met only 11 of the 18 benchmarks , according to the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress .
" Even those who are implementing this policy of the president 's cannot tell us it will make America more safe , nor that it will lead to the kind of political decision - making that we have to expect from the Iraqis themselves , " Clinton said .
Nearly two - thirds of the American public now opposes the war , according to a CNN - Opinion Research poll conducted in early September .
Clinton said , if elected president , she would end the conflict " as quickly and responsibly as I can , " but said some U.S. forces would likely remain as trainers , to protect Americans and to battle Islamic militants loyal to al Qaeda .
The two - term senator , who leads her Democratic presidential rivals by a double - digit margin in national polls , made the rounds of all five Washington talk shows Sunday .
Last week , Clinton supported two amendments that would have forced the Pentagon to begin a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq .
But she said Sunday that even if Democrats muster enough Republican support to break a filibuster -- something they have been unable to do -- Democrats would still be unlikely to get the two - thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto .
" The answer for this is , let 's elect more Democrats in 2008 , " she said .
" That will help solve the problem . "

All About George W. Bush • Hillary Clinton
In May 2000 , 13 year - old Nathaniel Brazill , an African - American boy from a low - income Florida family , shot and killed his middle school teacher , Barry Grunow , on the last day of school .
A few weeks earlier , also in Florida , 12 year - old Lionel Tate killed his 6 year - old playmate while practicing a wrestling move he saw on television .
Both these cases stirred controversy in Florida not because of the senselessness of the crimes , but because of the severity of the punishments : Brazill was convicted of second - degree murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison without the possibility of parole .
And Tate was convicted of first - degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole , making him the youngest person in modern US history to be sentenced to life in prison .
Both were tried as adults , and at the ages of 14 and 13 respectively , were locked away in adult prisons to serve their sentences .
At the time of their convictions , Florida led the nation in trying minors as adults , a trend that has skyrocketed across America in the past 15 years .
Currently , over 200,000 minors are charged in adult courts each year , and in 2005 nearly 7000 minors were being housed in adult jails .
More disturbing , a recent series by PBS Frontline , When Kids Get Life , reveals that the US is one of only a few countries in the world that sentences minors under the age of 18 to life in prison , and there are 2200 such convicts currently serving life sentences in the US .
( According to the advocacy organization Pendulum Foundation , there are only 12 in the rest of the world . )
Not until March 2005 did the US Supreme Court finally overturn a previous ruling and outlaw executing crimes committed by anyone under the age of 18 , acknowledging that giving teenagers the dealth penalty represents “ cruel and unusual punishment . ”
So if the Supreme Court has already ruled that when it comes to execution , minors ca n’t be held accountable to the same extent as adults , why has n’t the entire practice of trying minors as adults come to an end ?
Why , when minors are minors by definition , should they ever be tried as adults ?
The sharp increase in minors tried in adult courts is due to a wave of state legislation in the 1990s that gave judges and prosecutors the ability to determine who should be tried as an adult , along with new laws assigning mandatory minimum sentences for certain types of convictions including first - and second - degree murder .
In addition , many of the officials making these decisions hold elected positions , which compelled them ( and compels them still ) to take tough stances against young criminals following America ’s spike in violent street crime in the early nineties .
( This was the case with state attorney Barry Krischer of Florida ’s affluent Palm Beach County , where Nathaniel Brazill was prosecuted , who defends in this interview his famed zero - tolerance policy of trying minors as adults as often as possible . )
Proponents of trying minors as adults frequently cite weaknesses in the juvenile justice system , saying it is an insufficient deterrent for criminally - minded youths .
And how , they add , can you justify to a murder victim ’s family a light sentence just because the person who killed their love one was a kid ?
Fair enough , but can we really justify a justice system in which a person can go to prison for life for something they did when they were 12 years - old ?
Do we really want to encourage cycles of poverty , poor education , and violence by throwing juvenile delinquents into jail with hardened adult criminals for decades at a time ?
To be clear , I am not advocating leniency toward people who commit serious crimes .
If a violent crime is committed , justice needs to be served no matter who the criminal – but “ justice ” means a proportional and appropriate punishment .
In other areas of the law minors are viewed as mentally incompetent , a caveat our justice system takes seriously when deliberating the guilt or innocence of adult criminals .
Society ( rightly , in my opinion ) denies minors the right to vote , drink , independently sign legal contracts , run for office , adopt children , buy property , and so forth .
It recognizes that our grasp of right and wrong is not fully developed for most of our minority , and thus establishes 18 as the legal age at which we are fully responsible for our choices .
Trying minors as adults , therefore , represents a double standard in the legal system : a 15 year - old is too young and stupid to decide for himself whether cigarettes are something he should buy , but he is of sound adult mind when firing a gun in the midst of an argument .
Often in instances where minors are tried as adults , the crimes themselves are evidence of immaturity , not malice .
Prosecutors frequently call violent crimes committed by minors “ adult ” in nature , but this confuses the severity of the crime and the maturity of criminal : whether a 12 year - old steals a candy bar or kills a man over it , his maturity level and mental competence has n’t changed .
Rather the severity of the crime , and of the consequence , has changed .
( Indeed , the trivial motives of many violent crimes committed by minors demonstrate this – such as Lionel Tate ’s attempt to practice a WWF move on a 6 year - old . )
All of this was acknowledged a century ago when the juvenile justice system came into existence .
In 1899 , at the height of the Progressive Era , the first juvenile court opened in Chicago with the philosophy that rehabilitation , rather than punishment , should be the objective when dealing with juveniles .
Reformers acknowledged that minors and adults had different rehabilitative needs and that before a certain age offenders are sufficiently impressionable that they can be “ corrected ” and safely reinserted in society .
Juvenile detention centers were thus developed to place an emphasis on rewarding good behavior , instilling discipline , completing education , and reinsertion .
Place this in contrast to adult prisons , and the differences are astounding .
A recent report by the Center for Policy Alternatives reveals :
Youths held in adult jails are eight times more likely to commit suicide , five times more likely to be sexually assaulted , twice as likely to be beaten by staff , and 50 percent more likely to be assaulted with a weapon than youth in juvenile facilities .
Moreover , minors sent to adult prisons are significantly more likely to reoffend , and twice as likely to be arrested for a more serious crime , than minors in the juvenile justice system .
Extensive studies ( and common sense ) tell us that teenagers jailed alongside adult criminals become harder and more violent than those kept in juvenile detention .
They are subject to “ sentences ” far harsher than those rendered by judges and juries , in the form of rape , physical abuse , torture , and suicide .
Despite a Department of Justice report that nearly 40 % of juveniles in adult prisons were convicted of nonviolent offenses , there is abundant evidence that jailing minors alongside adult criminals makes them become more violent and less likely to be rehabilitated .
And unsurprisingly , nearly 77 % of minors in adult prisons represent a racial minority , primarily African American , while the vast majority hails from low - income families with poorly - educated parents .
Trying minors as adults represents a gross flaw in the current justice system .
It draws the newest and least privileged members of society into horrific cycles of violence and depression , allowing them little path to rehabilitation , forgiveness , and productive lives .
To address weaknesses in the juvenile justice system by simply bumping minors into adult courts and prisons disserves both minors and the adult prison system .
Moreover , how many of us would like to be held accountable , for the rest of our lives , for the decisions we made when we were 13 ?
And how many of us rely on our education , our wealth , and the support of our families to keep us from making grave choices , and to protect us from disproportional harm ?
Each year thousands of American teenagers face years of abuse in violent adult prisons for crimes they committed without these benefits .
Their crimes are horrific and punishable , but their punishments are not proportional .
The practice of sending minors to adult courts represents a terrible and embarrassing double standard in the American legal system , and should be written out of law nationwide .

Intensive driving courses , often referred to as a crash course or Fast Track Driving Lessons , are ideal for those people who wish to learn to drive quickly .
It may be because of new employment , attending university etc. or simply that having one or two driving lesson 's per week can take a long time to get to DSA driving test standard and become frustrating .
These intensive driving lessons are tailored to an individual pupils needs e.g. 2 hours per day , 4 hours per day , 6 hours per day etc . and can be spread over a few day's to a few weeks .
Crash courses are also generally very flexible .
If the intensive driving lesson's are for more than 2 hours at a time , comfort , tea , lunch breaks etc. will be built in .
It is of benefit if the practical driving test is taken at the end of the driving course or very shortly afterwards .
It is advisable therefore , to have already taken and passed the Driving Theory Test prior to booking a driving crash course .
As payment for intensive driving courses are required before commencement , good discounts can be obtained .
A driving instructor will always need up front payment given the large block of their diary taken up for the intensive course / fast track driving lessons and which would be very difficult to re-allocate at short notice .
At the Driving - Schools - directory , we have a substantial database of UK driving instructors who can provide crash courses driving for you at very keen prices .
Israelis and Palestinians protest against the evacuation of Kfar Shalem , 7 July 2007 .
( Oren Ziv/ActiveStills )
If we want to try comprehending the recent events in Kfar Shalem , we need to delve into the wounds of our past . [ 1 ]
Exploring these wounds can help us strengthen ourselves in the present , so we can plan for our future , and for our communities ’ healing .
Such healing might give us the stamina we will need to struggle together .
In 1882 , “ ’ E’eleh ba - Tamar ” [ the Hebrew phrase is borrowed from Song of Songs 7:9 ] , the first organized Yemenite labor migration wave , or “ ‘ aliya , ” the value - laden Hebrew term meaning “ ascendance , ” arrived in Palestine .
Considered “ natural laborers , ” they were expected to live frugally and thus lighten the burden of the Yiddish - speaking “ ideological laborers ” who were colonizing Palestine .
The Ashkenazim in the colonies ( moshavot ) refused to allow the “ natural laborers ” to dwell among them .
These workers were forced to live in the fields , the cowsheds or the stables .
When they rebelled , they were permitted to live in segregated ghettos in wooden huts and tin shacks .
I want to tell you about the dry twigs .
At the end of the workday , Yemeni women agricultural laborers used to gather dry twigs from the vineyards and orchards for cooking or heating water .
The colonies ’ farmers thought of these twigs as still their private property , but the Yemeni women laborers thought collecting this firewood was one of the very few benefits their agricultural labor entitled them to .
When farmers caught the women gathering branches , they punished them with fines taken from their paltry weekly pay .
One February dusk in 1913 , a plantation owner came to supervise his workers so that they would work until the very last minute of daylight , and noticed three women gathering twigs .
Not only did he beat them up — he also tried to tie them up .
The women resisted , ran away , and hid in the vineyard .
One of their coworkers , a Palestinian man , chased and caught them for the master .
The master ordered him to rope their wrists and ankles tightly together , tie the rope to the tail of his donkey , and lead them thusly into the Rehovot colony ( moshava ) center .
The master ordered the Palestinian laborer to walk behind the women so they would not pull back .
The women were unable to follow the donkey ’s fast pace , and so were dragged on the ground .
This incident led to the unionization of Yemeni laborers , yet no evidence can be found that women were members of the union .
The Yemeni union had to struggle for around a decade before it was recognized by Ashkenazi labor movement .
Nothing has changed much in the relationship between Mizrahim and the master , from that time to this .
True , we now have some poodles of our own : Mazuz , Itzik , Fuad , Mofaz — even Katsav , the poodle who overlooked the master ’s choke chain .
But as a community , we have remained dispossessed from economic stability or land ownership rights within the Hadera - Gedera confines — the two cities that chart the north and south margins of Israel ’s center .
We ’ve been the precarious tenants in Israel ’s gainful employment zone .
These days , as a community , we are the demographic majority of citizens , and on us rests Israel ’s regime .
But we do not get much in return .
Only scantily are we represented in the ruling elite : the courts , the universities , the specialty physicians and senior administrators .
Most of us still believe that if we work real hard , we , too , can make it and become part of the elite .
But aside from the handful of Mizrahim splendidly and repeatedly PRed by the public media , we are the majority in the long welfare lines , the long NGO food - for - the - hungry lines , and the long lines at the forced employment agencies .
Likewise , we are always the majority in the occasional marches , sit-ins and demonstrations of the homeless .
The struggle for Kfar Shalem is the struggle for us all .
A straight line stretches from the Kinneret colony ’s expulsion of Yemenis in 1930 to the demolition orders on Kfar Shalem ’s Mizrahi homes today .
From the “ ‘ E’eleh ba - Tamar ” migration wave even to this very hour , the master consistently subjects us to his policy of “ use ‘em up and throw ‘ em away . ”
No one has ever forced the kibbutzniks or the residents of the spiffy neighborhoods erected on the ruins of Palestine ’s Nakba villages to keep on living in the precarious indeterminacy typical of Kfar Shalem .
Mizrahim were forced to make Kfar Shalem their home from 1948 on , so that the Palestinians would have no place to return to , and for 60 years .
Now the Mizrahim too are forced to vacate this land , their homes , in favor of the Ashkenazi real estate barons .
Actually , it is the residents of the spiffy neighborhoods and the kibbutzniks themselves who have turned into the real estate barons profiteering from the land - plots of Palestine .
Nobody has ever denied the sons and daughters of these kibbutzim and Ashkenazi neighborhoods the right to proper education .
Nobody has ever denied them the right to gainful employment .
Nobody has ever dismantled their families , kidnapped their infants , or conducted radiation experiments on them under the guise of medical care .
No one has ever forced their kids into government boarding schools .
No one has ever demolished their homes .
There are around a million Israeli citizens these days , mostly Ashkenazim , who brandish an EU passport .
But we , Mizrahim , have nowhere to go .
We were brought here as their “ natural laborers , ” and from the early 1950s on , were stuffed by the master into the spacious Nakba villages , but in crowded conditions , to eliminate any possibility for the Palestinians to enact their right of return .
Today , these are our homes .
This is why we have to do our homework : delve into the history of our mothers ’ and fathers ’
Jewish homes : Yemeni homes .
Persian homes .
Iraqi homes .
Syrian homes .
Turkish homes .
In short , Mizrahi homes .
These are the homes that our master has forced us to unlearn and hate from 1882 on .
We must continue to struggle to heal ourselves from the wounds the master has inflicted upon us .
We need to heal not only through our day - to - day survival , but also with a long - term get - well plan — one with a future vision .
We must demand a true partnership and equality in one state for all of us , Mizrahim and Palestinian alike , a state that will be our permanent home .
Here and now , we must unite so that we are able to infuse with meaning , and to put into action , the very fact that it is we who are the demographic majority citizenry of the state of Israel .
As a majority , we should work together to generate an upheaval that will liberate the entire region from the real estate shenanigans inflicted upon us by the European real estate barons from 1882 until this very day .

The Prisoner 's Dilemma in Software Development
You , the developer , intend to exchange code for money with your client .
If you deliver something that does not work , and the client pays for it , you have received all the benefit of the transaction and the client has gotten the sucker 's payoff .
If you deliver functional software , and the client keeps it but fails to pay , the tables are turned and you have received the sucker 's payoff .
If you both perform cooperatively -- you deliver working software and the client pays -- you both benefit , but arguably less than if one of you had taken advantage of the other ( you have worked harder , presumably , than if you had delivered minimal , nonfunctional code , and the client is out the money it could have kept . )
If you both defect , you both lose out but at least the client has kept its money and you retained your code .
In a perfect world , the client would pay you the whole price at the outset of the software development project , and you would always deliver working code .
Since this is not a perfect world , the multi-phased software development contract has evolved , with payments made against successfully completed milestones .
This style of contract turns what might have been a one - turn game , with no shadow of the future , into a multi- round engagement ; each phase of the contract is in effect a separate round of the prisoner 's dilemma .
The classic software development contract , with its guarantee and its acceptance machinery , shifts the sequence of turns so that the client , on each round , may determine whether you have cooperated ( by examining your code to see if it meets the spec and is functional ) before determining its own move .
However , the contract , if well - drafted and fair , also protects you , the developer , by tightly defining the client 's expectations and by restricting the client 's ability to defect by withholding acceptance .
Without such an agreement ( which represents an advance compact by the parties to play the cooperation card on each round ) , it is all too common a spectacle to see a client withhold payment on the last round , to force the inclusion of additional requirements not previously thought of .
Even with a contract , this may happen ; since the iterated prisoner 's dilemma is for a known number of rounds , the client , not expecting to deal with you again , may defect on the last round , simply hoping to keep the balance of its money .
But a well - drafted contract will at least limit its ability to get away with such a defection .
By contrast , most defections by developers are the result of negligence , not malicious intent .
The shadow of the future lies more heavily on developers , who wish to remain in the business and obtain good recommendations from clients , while most clients are not themselves in the computer industry , do n't expect to need further services immediately and do not anticipate any problems finding software developers eager to serve them even if they have burned one or two .
Defection by the client may take other forms than the withholding of money .
It might involve a malicious interpretation of an ambiguous requirement , to include functionality that the developer cannot possibly deliver for the agreed price and still make a profit .
Or the client may blame you for its own shortcomings or inability to meet its commitments , making you the scapegoat for an internal political struggle .
Axelrod 's experiments determined that the most effective , yet simplest strategy in an iterated prisoner 's dilemma is " Tit for Tat " , in which you begin with cooperation on the first move but then echo whatever your partner did on the last move .
Effectively , what this means is that cooperation is always rewarded with cooperation , while defection is immediately punished with defection .
Surprisingly , most software developers are constitutionally unable to apply this strategy to their clients , for a variety of reasons .
Project managers may be overruled by salespeople or account managers , who think that being soft on the client is the best long term policy .
Sometimes a sense of guilt -- did you really do a good enough job on the first deliverable ?-- intervenes .
In any event , whenever I hear of a software development contract in which the developer has commenced Phase II even though Phase I has not been accepted and paid for , I know the developer is playing " All Cooperate " , a strategy which will certainly motivate the client to play " All Defect " , as it has nothing to lose .
And the developer will now receive the sucker 's payoff on every round .
The moral is that the developer , to protect itself in an unethical world , must be ready to stop performance on the round following a defection by the client .
Of course , before deciding to do so , the developer must conduct an objective review , preferably involving peers not involved in the project , to determine its own responsibility -- perhaps the client justifiably withheld acceptance because the developer defected on the last round , and does not know it !
But , assuming that you delivered working code and the client has failed to pay , going forward and hoping that all will come out right in the end is a sucker 's move .
Since a software development contract is almost always for a known number of phases ( and therefore the associated prisoner 's dilemma is for a known number of iterations ) preventing your client 's predictable defection on the last round is a knottier problem .
By now , the shadow of the future may be relatively slight ; the client has a satisfactory product , but can certainly spot some minor bugs , which , instead of submitting to maintenance , it can pleasantly rely on as an excuse to withhold the last payment .
The benefit of the acceptance payment retained in its pocket may seem far greater than the benefit of knowing you are happy and available to do business with it again .
Here are some strategies developers use to assure cooperation on the last round :
Daily Howler : Russert bungled Social Security , as he has done through the years
I T TAKES A VILLAGE BURGHER !
Russert bungled Social Security , as he has done through the years : // link // print // previous // next //
FRIDAY , SEPTEMBER 28 , 2007
DIGBYS LAMENT : We thought Digby was quite eloquent in cant run a middle - class democracy with a millionaire press corps .
Why have these hissy kabukis persisted ?
In part , because high - profile liberal pundits allow it .
They look away from this kind of kabuki — and theyve done so for many years now .
Their jobs are too good , too soft , too comfy , to jeopardize by tough , stinging comment .
The people cited by Digby can say what they please .
At the highest levels of our journalism , the villages liberals wont comment .
( Paul Krugman excepted , of course . )
We liberals have to teach ourselves how to see the way our mainstream spokesmen often refuse to fight .
Until we learn to see their compliance — until we describe their compliance , out loud — the bogus discussion that Digby laments will rule our discourse , our lives .
Final point :
We re reading a new book — you may have seen it reviewed — about the rise of kooky - conservative power .
We dont know when weve seen a book whose author seemed to work so hard to keep you from seeing the truth of his subject .
Many liberals will work quite hard to keep their place inside the village .
It s maddening when that kabuki persists — but some of our best friend permit it .
By the way , here are some definitions of burgher ,  courtesy of American Heritage : burgher :
1 ) A citizen of a town or borough .
2 ) A comfortable or complacent member of the middle class .
3 ) A member of the mercantile class of a medieval European city .
In what appears below , we think of that comfort and complacency .
And then , theres that love of the mercantile .
Special report : Russert happens !
PART 2 —IT TAKES A VILLAGE BURGHER : Tim Russert didnt ask about climate change at Wednesday nights Democratic debate .
We had no time for a topic like that .
But we did have time for these ruminations .
To Russert , these things really mattered :
1 ) Russert found time to ask John Edwards ( for the ten millionth time ) about his troubling haircuts .
2 ) He found time to present the latest 24 - style hypothetical — and to play gotcha with Hillary Clinton , employing an old Sean Hannity trick .
( You get your guest to disagree with a quote .
Then , you try to embarrass your guest when you reveal who said it ! )
3 ) He found time to bore the world with a question ( to Dennis Kucinich ) about a municipal problem in Cleveland — a problem which occurred in Cleveland in 1978 .
4 ) He found time to collect a Bible passage from each of the hopefuls — after leading with the latest RNC - scripted suggestion about the troubling lack of faith among these bad vile Democrats .
(  Before we go , theres been a lot of discussion about the Democrats and the issue of faith and values .
I want to ask you a simple question ...)
 There s been a lot of discussion about the Democrats and the issue of faith and values ! 
And yes , that s true , there has been such discussion — among the nations pseudo - conservative hacks .
But then , Russert has increasingly become a parody of a corporate - selected , multimillionaire mogul .
And this is before we consider the bungled discussion he led Wednesday night about Social Security , his favorite topic — the topic on which he has misled the public , and roiled our politics .
over the past many years .
How inept is our multimillionaire press corps ?
Let s start with Russerts introduction of this topic RUSSERT ( 9/26/07 ) : And were back at Dartmouth College talking to the Democrats .
I want to talk about Social Security and Medicare .
The chairman of the Federal Reserve , the head of the Government Accountability Office , have both said that the number of people in America on Social Security and Medicare is going to double in the next 20 years — there are now 40 million ; it s going to go to 80 million — and that if nothing is done , well have to cut benefits in half or double the taxes .
That is their testimony .
Senator Biden , in order to prevent that , would you be willing to consider certain steps ?
For example , back in 1983 , Ronald Reagan and Tip ONeill , Patrick Moynihan and Bob Dole got together and changed the retirement age .
It s going to be going up to 67 in a gradual increase .
Right now , you pay tax for Social Security on your first $ 97,500 worth of income .
Why not tax the entire income of every American ?
And if you do that , youll guarantee the solvency of Social Security farther than the eye can see .
 I want to talk about Social Security and Medicare ,  Russert said at the start of this segment .
And then , just like that , for whatever reason , he switched his field to a ( largely bungled ) discussion of Social Security only .
The absurdity of this approach should be obvious ; everyone agrees that the real problem with future entitlements concerns the costs of Medicare , not of Social Security .
Indeed , the former head of the federal reserve had said this to Russert just three days before the self - impressed burgher led Wednesday evenings debate .
On Sunday mornings Meet the Press , Alan Greenspan laid out the shape of the entitlement problem , as even the Greenspans now limn it : RUSSERT ( 9/23/07 ) :
Do you believe either political party has stepped up to the crisis we face with Social Security and Medicare in the coming years ?
GREENSPAN : I do not .
RUSSERT : How big a crisis will that be ?
GREENSPAN : Social Security is not a big crisis .
We are approximately 2 percent points of payroll short over the very long run .
It 's a significant closing of the gap , but it 's doable , and doable in any number of ways .
Medicare is a wholly different issue ...
We 're going to double the size of the retired population , and by all of the analysis I go through in the book , it 's very evident to me that we are not able to actually deliver on the Medicare we are promising ...
The problem lies with Medicare , Greenspan said , voicing an utterly standard analysis .
But for whatever reason , Russert quickly turned Wednesdays segment into a discussion of Social Security .
He blathered ahead with his typically useless data about the number of future recipients — and about the typical age of death back in the mid-1930s .
None of these facts are even slightly relevant to a real discussion of Social Security , as pundits have made clear many times , especially during 2005 , when Bushs privatization plan hit the deck .
( Duh .
These useless facts are already part of the future funding formulas ! )
But Russert rolled out his standard old cant — and drove the discussion away from Medicare , the actual source of future problems .
Why did he do this ?
We have no idea ; there seems to be no partisan reason .
But well offer a suggestion : Inevitably , this is the type of self - impressed , bungled work a middle - class democracy will get — if its lets its major news orgs be run by a mogul elite .
You might call this Nantucket - style journalism .
The deeply self - impressed Burgher Russert provides such work in spades .
Because yes , Russert has done this forever .
Back in January 2000 , he monopolized a Republican debate with his own set of facts about Social Security , blathering on until Alan Keyes heroically told him to shut his big yap .
( See
But Russert thoroughly bungled this discussion Wednesday night ; indeed , he had created a pointless discussion as soon as he turned a segment about  Social Security and Medicare into a discussion of Social Security alone .
Beyond that , a thoroughly jumbled discussion ensued — so jumbled that it was basically useless even as a debate about SS alone .
Basic question :
How many viewers knew what the candidates meant when they kept talking , without explanation , about raising the cap and lifting the ceiling ? 
Very , very few , we would guess .
And Russert made no attempt to clarify any of this as the long discussion unfolded .
He was too busy looking for ways to spring his gotchas ,  to recite his irrelevant data .
Honesty forces us to note that some of the candidates were quite hopeless too .
Most hopelessly , here is Obama , joining Russert in reciting a piece of pure RNC cant : OBAMA ( 9/23/07 ) :
My personal view is that lifting the cap is much preferable than the other options that are available .
But what s critical is to recognize that there is a potential problem .
As I travel around Iowa and New Hampshire I meet young people who dont think Social Security is going to be there for them .
They dont believe its going to be there for them .
And I think its important for us , in addition to getting our fiscal house in order , to acknowledge as Democrats that there may be a problem that weve got to take on .
There are no words for how awful that was .
For the most part , young people dont think Social Security is going to be there for them  because theyve been deceived , for year after year , by an army of pseudo - conservative dissemblers who are given free rein by our sad , hapless press corps .
But there was Obama reinforcing this framework — and Edwards quickly jumped in to support what Obama had said .
( Three cheers for Richardson , who noted the very conservative growth estimates which produce Social Security s small projected shortfalls . )
Greenspan explained it to Russert on Sunday .
Social Security is easy to solve ; Medicare is the real future problem .
But so what ?
Russert has become a pure buffoon in the years since he was air - lifted off to Nantucket .
He now presents the eternal image of the pompous , uninformed , self - righteous burgher .
He knows that Dems should be more godly .
And he knows what to pay for a haircut .
After the debate , another store - bought Nantucket denizen loudly asked college kids in his audience if they thought theyd ever get SS .
But then , Chris Matthews is a long - standing numbskull too — and he pummeled Clinton in his post - debate hour , as he has done to Major Dems ever since his patron , Jack Welch , allowed him to become a  Lost Boy of the Sconset . 
What does a middle - class democracy get when it hands control of its public discussion to a bunch of corporate - picked multimillionaires ?
Russerts performance was gruesome this Wednesday — and Matthews was there with Howard Fineman to fawn to this great island man .
WE DONT KNOW IF THIS IS ACCURATE :
For the record , we dont know who said this , or when : RUSSERT :
The chairman of the Federal Reserve , the head of the Government Accountability Office , have both said that the number of people in America on Social Security and Medicare is going to double in the next 20 years — there are now 40 million ; it s going to go to 80 million — and that if nothing is done , well have to cut benefits in half or double the taxes .
That is their testimony .
Does Russert refer to Bernanke and Walker ?
We cant find where they made the statements Russert gloomily paraphrases .
But surely , no one has said such a thing about the fate of SS alone .
Russert staged a hopeless discussion .
But how about an occasional cite when were offered such high - powered testimony ? 
We thought Digby was quite eloquent in this recent , maddening post .
We were struck by her frustration with the types of hissy kabuki which make up so much of our public discourse .
Our view :
This bad - faith discourse will prevail any time a middle - class democracy hands the reins of its public discourse to corporate - picked multimillionaires .
Simply put :
You simplyrun a middle - class democracy with a millionaire press corps .
Why have these hissy kabukis persisted ?
In part , because high - profile liberal pundits allow it .
They look away from this kind of kabuki — and theyve done so for many years now .
Their jobs are too good , too soft , too comfy , to jeopardize by tough , stinging comment .
The people cited by Digby can say what they please .
At the highest levels of our journalism , the villages liberals wont comment .
( Paul Krugman excepted , of course . )
We liberals have to teach ourselves how to see the way our mainstream spokesmen often refuse to fight .
Until we learn to see their compliance — until wetheir compliance , out loud — the bogus discussion that Digby laments will rule our discourse , our lives .
Final point :
We re reading a new book — you may have seen it reviewed — about the rise of kooky - conservative power .
We dont know when weve seen a book whose author seemed to work so hard toyou from seeing the truth of his subject .
Many liberals will work quite hard to keep their place inside the village .
It s maddening when that kabuki persists — but some of our best friend permit it .
By the way , here are some definitions of burgher ,  courtesy of American Heritage :
In what appears below , we think of that comfort and complacency .
And then , theres that love of the mercantile .
Tim Russert didnt ask about climate change at Wednesday nights Democratic debate .
We had no time for a topic like that .
But wehave time for these ruminations .
To Russert , these things really mattered : 1) Russert found time to ask John Edwards ( for the ten millionth time ) about his troubling haircuts .
2) He found time to present the latest - style hypothetical — and to play gotcha with Hillary Clinton , employing an old Sean Hannity trick .
( You get your guest to disagree with a quote .
Then , you try to embarrass your guest when you reveal who said it !
)3 )
He found time to bore the world with a question ( to Dennis Kucinich ) about a municipal problem in Cleveland — a problem which occurred in Cleveland in 1978.4 )
He found time to collect a Bible passage from each of the hopefuls — after leading with the latest RNC - scripted suggestion about the troubling lack of faith among these bad vile Democrats .
(  Before we go , theres been a lot of discussion about the Democrats and the issue of faith and values .
I want to ask you a simple question ...)
Theres been a lot of discussion about the Democrats and the issue of faith and values !
And yes , that s true , therebeen such discussion — among the nations pseudo - conservative hacks .
But then , Russert has increasingly become a parody of a corporate - selected , multimillionaire mogul .
And this iswe consider the bungled discussion he led Wednesday night about Social Security , his favorite topic — the topic on which he has misled the public , and roiled our politics .
over the past many years .
How inept is our multimillionaire press corps ?
Lets start with Russerts introduction of this topic at Wednesdays debate  I want to talk about Social Security and Medicare ,  Russert said at the start of this segment .
And then , just like that , for whatever reason , he switched his field to a ( largely bungled ) discussion of The absurdity of this approach should be obvious ; everyone agrees that the real problem with future entitlements concerns the costs of Medicareof Social Security .
Indeed , the former head of the federal reserve had said this to Russert just three days before the self - impressed burgher led Wednesday evenings debate .
On Sunday morning sAlan Greenspan laid out the shape of the entitlement problem , as even the Greenspans now limn it :
The problem lies with , Greenspan said , voicing an utterly standard analysis .
But for whatever reason , Russert quickly turned Wednesdays segment into a discussion of He blathered ahead with his typically useless data about the number of future recipients — and about the typical age of death back in the mid-1930s .
None of these facts are even slightly relevant to a real discussion of Social Security , as pundits have made clear many times , especially during 2005 , when Bushs privatization plan hit the deck .
( Duh .
These useless facts are already part of the future funding formulas ! )
But Russert rolled out his standard old cant — and drove the discussion away from Medicare , the actual source of future problems .
Why did he do this ?
We have no idea ; there seems to be no partisan reason .
But well offer a suggestion : Inevitably , this is the type of self - impressed , bungled work a middle - class democracy will get — if its lets its major news orgs be run by a mogul elite .
You might call this Nantucket - style journalism .
The deeply self - impressed Burgher Russert provides such work in spades .
Because yes , Russert has done this forever .
Back in January 2000 , he monopolized a Republican debate with his own set of facts about Social Security , blathering on until Alan Keyes heroically told him to shut his big yap .
( See THE DAILY HOWLER , 12/8/04 , with a link to real - time reporting . )
That summer , he and Joe Klein staged a savage and stupid discussion , trashing Candidate Gore in the strongest terms because he wouldnt go along with Bushs privatization ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 6/7/07 ) .
In such discussions down through the years , Russert has sometimes been overblown and inept ; often , he has been openly partisan .
Inevitably , he has adopted the positions favored by Republicans , and by upper - class journalistic elites .
( By general acknowledgment , wealthy media elites had come to favor privatization by the time of Campaign 2000 . )
But Russert thoroughly bungled this discussion Wednesday night ; indeed , he had created a pointless discussion as soon as he turned a segment about  Social Security and Medicare into a discussion of Social Security alone .
Beyond that , a thoroughly jumbled discussion ensued — so jumbled that it was basically useless even as a debate about SS alone .

My patient , a 37 - year - old homemaker , gazed at the man in the red plaid shirt as he sat on the couch in her living room .
“ Who are you ? ” she asked .
There was something familiar about him .
He wore her husband ’s boots , but the shirt made him look like a truck driver .
“ Yeah , and who are you ? ” the man replied with a laugh .
“ Come here and give me a kiss . ”
She gave the man a peck on the cheek , but she felt guilty , fearing that her husband would arrive at any moment and admonish her .
Not only did the man want a kiss — he also wanted sex !
Discouraging him , she sat down to talk .
The man spoke just like her husband and knew personal facts about her .
It occurred to her that her husband had been mysteriously replaced by this fellow .
How it happened she had no idea ; she knew only that it had .
I have endured a lot of smear and hatred since Casey was killed and especially since I became the so - called " Face " of the American anti-war movement .
Especially since I renounced any tie I have remaining with the Democratic Party , I have been further trashed on such " liberal blogs " as the Democratic Underground .
Being called an " attention whore " and being told " good riddance " are some of the more milder rebukes .
I have come to some heartbreaking conclusions this Memorial Day Morning .
These are not spur of the moment reflections , but things I have been meditating on for about a year now .
The conclusions that I have slowly and very reluctantly come to are very heartbreaking to me .
The first conclusion is that I was the darling of the so - called left as long as I limited my protests to George Bush and the Republican Party .
Of course , I was slandered and libeled by the right as a " tool " of the Democratic Party .
This label was to marginalize me and my message .
How could a woman have an original thought , or be working outside of our " two - party " system ?
However , when I started to hold the Democratic Party to the same standards that I held the Republican Party , support for my cause started to erode and the " left " started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used .
I guess no one paid attention to me when I said that the issue of peace and people dying for no reason is not a matter of " right or left " , but " right and wrong . "
I am deemed a radical because I believe that partisan politics should be left to the wayside when hundreds of thousands of people are dying for a war based on lies that is supported by Democrats and Republican alike .
It amazes me that people who are sharp on the issues and can zero in like a laser beam on lies , misrepresentations , and political expediency when it comes to one party refuse to recognize it in their own party .
Blind party loyalty is dangerous whatever side it occurs on .
People of the world look on us Americans as jokes because we allow our political leaders so much murderous latitude and if we do n't find alternatives to this corrupt " two " party system our Representative Republic will die and be replaced with what we are rapidly descending into with nary a check or balance : a fascist corporate wasteland .
I am demonized because I do n't see party affiliation or nationality when I look at a person , I see that person 's heart .
If someone looks , dresses , acts , talks and votes like a Republican , then why do they deserve support just because he / she calls him / herself a Democrat ?
I have also reached the conclusion that if I am doing what I am doing because I am an " attention whore " then I really need to be committed .
I have invested everything I have into trying to bring peace with justice to a country that wants neither .
If an individual wants both , then normally he / she is not willing to do more than walk in a protest march or sit behind his / her computer criticizing others .
I have spent every available cent I got from the money a " grateful " country gave me when they killed my son and every penny that I have received in speaking or book fees since then .
I have sacrificed a 29 year marriage and have traveled for extended periods of time away from Casey 's brother and sisters and my health has suffered and my hospital bills from last summer ( when I almost died ) are in collection because I have used all my energy trying to stop this country from slaughtering innocent human beings .
I have been called every despicable name that small minds can think of and have had my life threatened many times .
The most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning , however , was that Casey did indeed die for nothing .
His precious lifeblood drained out in a country far away from his family who loves him , killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think .
I have tried every since he died to make his sacrifice meaningful .
Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives .
It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance .
I failed my boy and that hurts the most .

I have also tried to work within a peace movement that often puts personal egos above peace and human life .
This group wo n't work with that group ; he wo n't attend an event if she is going to be there ; and why does Cindy Sheehan get all the attention anyway ?
It is hard to work for peace when the very movement that is named after it has so many divisions .
Our brave young men and women in Iraq have been abandoned there indefinitely by their cowardly leaders who move them around like pawns on a chessboard of destruction and the people of Iraq have been doomed to death and fates worse than death by people worried more about elections than people .
However , in five , ten , or fifteen years , our troops will come limping home in another abject defeat and ten or twenty years from then , our children 's children will be seeing their loved ones die for no reason , because their grandparents also bought into this corrupt system .
George Bush will never be impeached because if the Democrats dig too deeply , they may unearth a few skeletons in their own graves and the system will perpetuate itself in perpetuity .
I am going to take whatever I have left and go home .
I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost .
I will try to maintain and nurture some very positive relationships that I have found in the journey that I was forced into when Casey died and try to repair some of the ones that have fallen apart since I began this single - minded crusade to try and change a paradigm that is now , I am afraid , carved in immovable , unbendable and rigidly mendacious marble .
Camp Casey has served its purpose .
It 's for sale .
Anyone want to buy five beautiful acres in Crawford , Texas ?
I will consider any reasonable offer .
I hear George Bush will be moving out soon , tooÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ¦which makes the property even more valuable .
This is my resignation letter as the " face " of the American anti-war movement .
This is not my " Checkers " moment , because I will never give up trying to help people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the good old US of A , but I am finished working in , or outside of this system .
This system forcefully resists being helped and eats up the people who try to help it .
I am getting out before it totally consumes me or anymore people that I love and the rest of my resources .
Good - bye America -- you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice , I can't make you be that country unless you want it .
It 's up to you now .
Climate change is dramatically altering the growing patterns of mushrooms , toadstools and other fungi , new research has found .
There are around 18,000 different species of fungi in the UK -- three times as many as all plants put together .
They provide vital ecosystem services for the welfare of native trees and other plants , and are the natural recyclers of the planet , but until now their response to global climate change has not been examined .
A team from Cardiff University ’s School of Biosciences working on a project led by Royal Holloway , University of London and with the Natural Environment Research Council Centre for Ecology and Hydrology studied more than 52,000 fungal fruiting records from nearly 1,400 localities collected in southern England between 1950 - 2005 .
The study found that fungi are fruiting significantly earlier and for a longer period than ever before .
In the 1950s fungi fruited over a period of around 33 days but this has more than doubled to nearly 75 days in the current decade .
Professor Lynne Boddy , Cardiff School of Biosciences said : " The increase in the overall fruiting period is dramatic , and much higher than equivalent spring data reported for plants , insects or birds . "
The study found that the alteration in fungal fruiting mirrors changes in British temperatures that have occurred since 1975 .
The increase in late summer temperatures and autumnal rains has caused early season species to fruit earlier and late season species to continue to fruit later .
Furthermore , climate warming seems to have caused significant numbers of species to begin fruiting in spring as well as autumn , suggesting increases in decay rates in forests .
China ( TGW ) – China , which makes 70 % of the world ’s lightbulbs , has agreed to start promoting more energy inefficient lightbulbs .
The transition could be made in the next 10 years , said Monique Barbut , chief executive officer of the Global Environment Facility .
" We are starting a world campaign to ban all inefficient lightbulbs , " Barbut said at the Reuters Environmental Summit in Washington .
" And China has just agreed . "
Australia is one of a very small number of developed countries that has already agreed to phase out incandescent lightbulbs .
China ’s program will be formally announced in December .

replaced key functions ( i.e. ) with alternative versions .
The Supero programs are optimised by Supero , then fed back into GHC - GHC 's excellent native code generation is benefiting both programs .
All the results are compared to GHC 6.6.1 - O2 , which lacks SpecConstr , and is likely to give a benefit to the GHC benchmark .
The benchmarks were generally chosen because they did not read an input file , and did n't output too much - I wanted this to be a test of computation , not IO .
The benchmarks are just the ones I have tackled so far .
The results are not stable .
Yesterday two of the benchmarks showed substantially better results for Supero , and three did n't go through at all .
Things are changing fast - there is no guarantee that any final release of Supero will match these numbers .
* Warning : Benchmarks are hazardous to your health , always misleading and usually wrong .
I 've been working on optimising Haskell with the Supero project for a few months now .
I 've had some good success with small benchmarks , but scaling up to larger examples is always a challenge .
Even a small benchmark , such as those from the imaginary section of nobench , can pull in nearly 1 Mb of code from libraries .
Debugging through 100,000 lines of low - level transformed Haskell is not pleasant !
Anyway , I now have some results on some of the nobench programs , so I thought I 'd share them .
As with all benchmarks , there are a whole pile of disclaimers :
With those disclaimers out of the way , on to the graph :
All numbers are given relative to GHC taking 100 % , i.e. all the benchmarks are at least 10 % faster - and one is nearly three times faster .
It is actually quite an achievement to draw with GHC in these benchmarks .
GHC treats class dictionaries in a special manner ( I think ) , and optimises them out specially .
GHC also performs a reasonable amount of foldr / build fusion in several of the tests .
Since these transformations rely on names and special knowledge , when compiling Yhc generated Haskell they can no longer be applied - so Supero must perform all these tricks to draw with GHC .
I am sure there is further scope for improvement .
Supero is a moving target - yesterday the primes benchmark went 50 % faster , but now it is only 12 % faster .
Three days ago I rewrote the whole optimiser .
It will be a while before large scale Haskell programs can be optimised , but it is certainly the final goal .

Few phrases seem more quaintly outmoded these days than “ sound as a dollar . ”
Once the embodiment of American financial strength , the dollar has spent the past five years getting sand kicked in its face by the world ’s currencies , and in recent weeks , thanks to the Federal Reserve ’s surprisingly big interest - rate cut , its decline has accelerated .
A euro , which you could buy for eighty - six cents in January , 2002 , now costs $ 1.40 , and the Canadian loonie , once an easy object of derision , is as valuable as a dollar .
In 1922 , Ernest Hemingway wrote an article explaining how to live in Paris on a thousand dollars a year .
These days , an American in Paris is lucky to spend a thousand dollars a week .

Most Americans , of course , do n’t worry too much about the price of dinner at Taillevent .
But the dollar ’s latest drop , in the minds of many market observers , is bad news even for Americans who stay home .
We are , after all , hooked on imported goods — in 2006 , the U.S. paid $ 1.8 trillion for foreign imports — and a weaker dollar should , in theory , make them more expensive .
But , despite the daily headlines , there ’s little evidence that the situation has provoked anxiety .
Indeed , some in Congress are trying to pressure China to revalue its currency upward , which would make the dollar even weaker .
How can Americans , with their love for foreign goods , remain indifferent to the dollar ’s drop ?
Mainly because so far it has had surprisingly little impact on our standard of living .
Inflation , for instance , has remained solidly under control — the economy ’s core inflation rate was about two per cent over the past twelve months , and it has n’t been much higher than that in recent years .
Even more surprisingly , the prices of imported goods have gone up only slightly .
If you travel abroad , you feel like a pauper .
Yet if you stay at home you ’d be hard - pressed to notice any difference from a decade ago , with the notable exception of the price of oil .
In part , this is because exchange rates move far more quickly than real - world prices , which tend to be what economists call “ sticky . ”
It ’s a hassle to print new menus or product catalogues , or to go back and re-tag every item in the store , and it also confuses and alienates customers .
So companies tend not to change prices all that often .
They also use futures markets to hedge against currency risk , which reduces the need for price increases .
And China has played a huge role .
Although the dollar ’s value has plummeted against the euro , it has fallen much less against the Chinese yuan ; that ’s because the Chinese government continually buys dollars to prop up their value and insure that Americans can keep buying Chinese exports , which have been fundamental to China ’s economic boom .
But what ’s most interesting is that foreign companies have essentially chosen to protect U.S. consumers from the effects of the weak dollar .
They have resisted increasing prices here , accepting lower profit margins in order to maintain their market share .
The American market is too big and too important for them to run the risk of losing customers , and , because it ’s so competitive , they generally can’t raise prices without losing market share .
So high - end television sets , foreign beer , and luxury cars have all remained relatively affordable , even though the dollars we buy them with are worth much less than they were a few years ago .
This is not an entirely new phenomenon : a Federal Reserve study published after the dollar ’s crash in 1985 - 87 suggested that “ foreign competitors relinquished profits for market share ” by holding down price increases .
That tendency is even stronger these days : a recent Federal Reserve study found that changes in the value of the dollar today have half the impact on American prices that they did during the eighties .
It ’s hardly surprising , then , that over the past three years the prices of imported goods have risen just a little more than two per cent on average annually .
As a result of all this , American consumers are living in a kind of cocoon , where the rules that apply everywhere else seem not to matter .
This creates bizarre disjunctions ; for example , foreign - made luxury cars are often cheaper to buy in the U.S. than in their home countries .
Or consider Halo 3 , Microsoft ’s new Xbox 360 game .
If you buy Halo 3 from Amazon.com , you ’ll pay sixty bucks .
If you buy it from Amazon.de , in Germany , you ’ll pay ninety - three dollars .
Adjusted for taxes , this means that German consumers are paying twenty - six per cent more than Americans for the very same product .
The virtues of this peculiar arrangement are obvious : Americans are able to buy far more stuff with their flimsy currency than one would expect .
The vice , if there is one , may be that the relative painlessness of the dollar ’s decline has made it easier to ignore the reasons for it , like our colossal government debt and the trillions of dollars we ’re going to have to spend on Medicare and Social Security for retiring baby boomers .
We know that these things matter , but it ’s hard to get worried about them when foreign - made DVD players cost twenty - nine dollars .
The danger is that if no changes are made , and the dollar continues to fall , the safety net may at some point get yanked away , with China refusing to prop up the dollar anymore and foreign companies finally forced to raise prices .
As the chorus of voices lamenting the latest drop in the dollar suggest , it may well be time for Americans to emulate the ant .
The problem is that the rest of the world keeps making it too easy for us to be the grasshopper . ♦

DAMASCUS ( Reuters ) - Syria accused Israel of bombing its territory on Thursday and said it could respond to the Jewish state ’s “ aggression and treachery ” .
Israel declined to comment on the charge by Syria , which said no casualties or damage were caused .
The Syrian accusation was partly responsible for triggering a rise in world oil prices of more than $ 1.40 a barrel .
“ It appears that the Israeli planes were on a reconnaissance mission when they got caught by Syrian defenses and were forced to drop their bombs and extra fuel tanks , ” said a Western diplomat in Syria ’s capital Damascus .
He declined to be named .
After months in which talk of reviving long - stalled peace negotiations between neighboring Israel and Syria has been mixed with speculation on both sides that the other was preparing a surprise attack , Syrian officials hit out .
“ This shows that Israel cannot give up aggression and treachery , ” Syrian Information Minister Mohsen Bilal told Al Jazeera television .
Another Syrian official said : “ They dropped bombs on an empty area while our air defenses were firing heavily at them . ”
The official news agency SANA said Syria “ reserves the right to respond according to what it sees fit ” .
The Israeli military spokesman ’s office said in a statement : “ It is not our custom to respond to these kinds of reports . ”
The office has typically commented on such charges , but a security source said the government had imposed a news blackout on the issue .
A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said there would be no comment beyond the military statement .
In Washington , the White House declined to comment .
Russia urged Israel to respect international law .
“ The reports have caused extreme concern in Moscow , ” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement .
“ Particularly troubling is that this is the Middle East , a region already heavy with serious conflicts and tension . ”
Iran again criticized its foe Israel .
“ The aims of that ... provocative move by the Zionist regime was to shift its domestic crisis into areas other than Palestine , spreading insecurity in the region and covering up its failure in the 33 - day war against Lebanon , ” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini .

Iran ’s ambassador to Damascus had contacted Syrian security officials and said that “ Iran is ready to provide every kind of assistance to Syria , ” the official IRNA news agency reported .
RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS
It is more than a year since Syrian guns opened fire on Israeli aircraft and Israeli jets last struck in 2003 across a border that remains tense but largely quiet 34 years after the last war between the two neighbors ended in an edgy ceasefire .

Military analysts said Israel has conducted reconnaissance flights over Syria to probe its defenses .
Witnesses said several planes crossed deep into Syrian territory and flew over the oil centre of Deir al Zor on the Euphrates river .
Residents in the Tal al - Abiad area on Syria ’s border with Turkey said they spotted several fuel tanks .
Turkish and Israeli officials denied a report from an Israeli military source that the Israeli air force had trained in Turkey as recently as this week .
The last exercises concluded last month , officials in Ankara said .
Tensions between Israel and Syria have been high in the past few months .
Some Israeli intelligence officials have suggested Syrian President Bashar al - Assad ’s government might be ready to try to take by force parts of the Golan Heights , which Israel captured in the war of 1967 and held on to in fighting in 1973 .
Syrian officials have said Syria was seeking peaceful means to liberate the territory , although some have also suggested force remained an option if diplomacy failed .
Some Israeli military officials have expressed alarm at what they say are reinforcements of Syrian posts and arms purchases .
But Olmert , who launched his forces against Syrian - allied Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon a year ago , has been at pains to say he has no hostile intentions toward Damascus .
He has also said he would like to reopen peace negotiations that have been stalled for seven years .
Syrian officials too have said they would like peace .
But there has been little sign of any concrete steps towards rapprochement .

I ’m going to get off the subject of the Iraq War and back into my favorite subject which is campaign finance .
My short tenure as Chairman of the Liberal Party of America was an experience that enabled me to understand how politics works in this country .
This knowledge was the reason that we struck our tents as fast as we put them up .
It is unfortunate that we abandoned the LPA , but it was inevitable that we would have to , better sooner than later before too many people put their time and money into something that would never had succeeded at the time we embarked on that short journey .
In order to get a good understanding of a candidate , it really is n’t necessary to actually listen to their campaign speeches and to read their campaign literature .
The candidates when speaking on the trail will read one of a few speeches that they have given many times , it all depends on the group that they are speaking to .
When a candidate speaks to labor , they will read their labor speech .
If they are talking to a group of low - income , working class people , they will pull out their “ I ’m one of you ” speeches .
I ’m not going to belabor the point , I ’m sure that you understand .
No , the best way to understand a candidate is n’t to listen to them , the best way to truly understand where a candidate stands on issues is to look at who is putting up the money that funds their candidacy .
It ’s pure commonsense , no group or corporation is going to fund anyone unless it is in their best interests .
“ Many of the campaigns have played up the notion that most of their donors give small contributions .
What they have not emphasized is that , in raw dollar terms , the big donations are vastly more important to the campaigns ' bottom lines . ” ( www.opensecrets.org)
旧クラ スAなどの使われていない空間を回収して使えば枯渇しない、オークションなどの策を講じれば経済理論に照らして考えて枯渇はない？ 本当でしょうか？ 今回は池田先生の記事のトラックバックとして反論してみようと思います。
＃池田先生の記事からだいぶ時間が立ってしまっていますが。。。。
枯渇しない派には２つのポイントがあるようです
・ NAT があれば枯渇はな し
・アドレス空間の回収をすれべ枯渇はなし
前者は、現状の割当量の伸びはNATを前提としても進んでいるという現状を鑑みるに、ほとんど議論の余地はありません。NATは今まで十分に延命には貢献しましたが、これ以上差し込むところがない以上、貢献しえません。ここでは後者のアドレス空間の回収で枯渇が防げるか、ということに焦点をあててみましょう。
旧クラ スAなどの使われていない空間を回収して使えば枯渇しない、オークションなどの策を講じれば経済理論に照らして考えて枯渇はない、池田先生以外にもこういう論客は結構いらっしゃるようです。
理論的にはありうるかもしれませんね 。その理論が机上で成立するのかどうかについては議論する気はありません。
私のポイントは理論と実践は違うということです。例えば、クラスAの回収を行い、オークションをやるというような決定を誰がするのでしょうか？
この決定はいわゆるインターネットガバナンスと呼ばれる枠組みで行われています。私はアジア太平洋地域における会議の議長を、この仕組みができてから昨年まで６年間やってきました。この会議には誰でも参加ができますし、誰でも何でも意見を言えます。オープンな会議でいろんな人が自由な意見を交換し、ラフコンセンサスとして意思決定していきます。決して、権威あるところがトップダウンに決めているわけではありません。なるべく多くのステークホルダにとって幸せで、運用可能な方法をラフコンセンサスとして形成していきます。
もちろん今までもそういう議論の場で、 回収議論は何度も何度も行われてきています
。議論の合意事項としての施策により、
できるところから少しずつ回収は行っていますが、一方で運用コストを含めた回収の難しさは十分に認知されています 。現在、NATと同じようにすでにできることはやった上でも、現在割当量が増えてきて枯渇時期が近づいています。これ以上に完全な回収するにはJANOGのメーリングリストで某氏が主張していたように「IPアドレス税」的なものを導入するなど、ドラスティックな対策を立てる必要があります。
さて、アドレスをもっと強制的に回収してIPv4を延命させたい人はどうすればいいのでしょうか？
国など権威ある組織がインターネットをガバナンスしているのであれば、そういう組織に対し、マスコミなどで声をあげるだけでもよいかもしれません。そうではなく、インターネットのルールは
さまざまなステークホルダーの合意制なのだから、そういう意見とか意思があるのなら、しかるべき場に提案するなど、評論家ではなく、
一人称で具体的な提案をもって行動しないことにはインターネットガバナンスは動きませんし、枯渇も止まりません
。繰り返しになりますが、強制的回収が不可能だとは言っているのではなく、それを主張する人がルール作りのオープンな場に登場していないから、強制的回収は起こりえないと言っています。
最後に、 「枯渇するのか？」という表題にそくして回答するとすると、現在のコミュニティのラフコンセンサスとしては
・回収はできる範囲で努力することを前提に
・ IPv6への移行をきちんとす る
という流れになっています。これが現時点でのみんなの総意ということです。よっぽどIPv6が進展しないとかない限り、この流れが変わることなく、IPv4アドレスは枯渇するだろう。これが現在の状況です。

What Is the West ?
by Philippe Nemo
Duquesne University Press ,
155 pages , $ 18.95
Back in the late 1970s , Philippe Nemo was one of a group of young French philosophy graduates who turned against what was called the Generation of 1968 .
The intellectual culture of France was dominated in those days by a radical Marxist left that insisted liberal democracy was the fount of evil in the world - and universal revolution , spearheaded by intellectuals and students , was the only sure road to justice , peace , and an end to exploitation .
Nemo ’s group , which labeled itself “ the new philosophers , ” included such diverse figures as Bernard - Henry Lévy and André Glucksmann .
It is not unfair to say that however famous others in the group became , Nemo had the most important things to say .
The question Nemo poses in What Is the West ? is this :
By what series of historical encounters did Western civilization become the combination of “ the rule of law , democracy , intellectual liberties , critical rationality , science , and economic freedom founded on private property ? ”
The West evolved as a series of elements joined in a synthesis greater than its parts .
Christianity , Nemo asserts , entered not as a religion but as an “ ethical spirit within secular society . ”
The West was never coterminous with its faith .
Always the believers found themselves in a world they had partly made and partly inherited from the classical past .
Always they were challenged to adapt to what they believed to be the exigencies of a political and social world they respected too much to want to subordinate to a theocracy .
The story begins with the Greeks , who invented scientific speculation and the ideal of the city , in which “ individual lives are no longer submerged in a vast sea of humanity . . . .
Each person now has individuality and character . ”
To this - a point of capital importance - the Romans added their “ invention of private law , ” whereby they “ invented the individual human person . ”
The next stage , of course , is Christianity or , rather , the impact of biblical religion and spirituality on ancient culture , an impact that was crucial in transforming that culture into what we call medieval .
Biblical religion introduced an ethical and an eschatological revolution , “ cherishing the individual , morally responsible human being , by emphasizing human individuality as desired and created by God for all eternity . ”
But , Nemo adds , that ethical revolution “ might never have bestowed such theological significance on the individual person had these beliefs not taken root in a society that had already granted importance to the human ego . ”
Without Christianity , there is no civilization of human rights , but without the Greek city , Greek science , and Roman law , there is no Christendom .
Nemo here uncovers a fundamental logic of western civilization .
The West is a civilization of borrowings and mixtures , whose result , never fixed and never self - satisfied , is more than a mere function of those borrowings .
The West , in fact , as Nemo ’s colleague and friend Rmi Brague has written , is by definition a “ secondary ” culture , a culture of followers who know they are followers .
Neither Greek political philosophy nor Christianity were western inventions , yet their confluence created the West .
Nemo is too good a scholar to point to any one encounter as the decisive one ; all were necessary .
He does , however , make a justified and welcome case that the so - called Papal Revolution of the late eleventh to thirteenth centuries was a time of remarkable and unusual ferment , and one on which modern democracy , science , and hope for progress directly rest .
The Papal Revolution was , on the outside , the successful attempt to prevent temporal rulers from controlling church appointments and , as such , a struggle for libertas ecclesiae , the freedom of the Church .
As Nemo reminds us , on the outcome of that struggle rests the modern separation of church and state and hence , ultimately , democracy itself .
But even more important was the story of what the great thinkers , St. Anselm in particular , wrought .
This was to rehabilitate , legitimate , and encourage human action in the world , including political action .
By formulating the concepts of atonement and purgatory , Anselm made it possible , indeed necessary , to think that “ human action in the world makes sense again , since all works , although finite , make their way into the reckoning .
Even the most insignificant act can shift the balance from negative to positive .
This insight and change of outlook eliminate in one fell swoop the profound superstition of the Middle Ages . ”
As a result , men came to hope and believe in the “ process of developing every power and resource available to human nature and human reason in order to use them in the fulfillment of the ethical and eschatological ideals of the Bible . ”
In recounting the Papal Revolution and its theological corollaries , Nemo is making yet another important point about the frame of mind and the reasoning of those who brought about the changes .
Many fashionable thinkers are fond of saying that the medieval and modern
West got all its valuable intellectual resources from the Greeks via the Arabs , who , unlike the benighted Catholic Europeans , had the wit to preserve Greek philosophy and medicine .
Nemo does not deny that important wisdom came to Europe via the Arabs , but , as he says , that is “ less significant than the spirit that charged these texts with meaning , then renewed them , to the extent of overseeing a new beginning for science in the world . ”
The spirit in which that wisdom was sought and used is the point , and this spirit was western , not Arab or even Greek .
Christianity in its Anselmian form sanctified human action and human reason .
“ From this moment on , civilization becomes a synthesis of Athens , Rome , and Jerusalem . . . .
Faith expresses itself through the flowering of human nature , ” the insight immortalized by Dante in the greatest poem of the West , the Divine Comedy .
Without this medieval breakthrough , modern science , modern secular reason , and modern political democracy were unthinkable .
In Nemo ’s reading , the Protestant Reformation , whatever its political and economic repercussions , merely developed a logic and an understanding of human action and reason already launched by Anselm .
Protestants might object to getting such short shrift , and , indeed , if Nemo ’s essay has a weakness it is that he does not seem to know exactly what to make of the Reformers .
Instead , Nemo moves quickly to his fifth “ miracle , ” the liberal and democratic reforms of the Enlightenment , especially its American and British versions , which resulted in the modern western world and “ extended . . . the aim of the Papal Revolution , namely the improvement of the world through the application of science and law . ”
Linking modern democracy so strongly to political and theological developments of the twelfth century is perhaps Nemo ’s most daring argument .
He disagrees not only with the secularists but also with most Christian and liberal progressives in tracing the most characteristically modern western manifestations to these medieval changes rather than to the usual sources given , the Renaissance or the radical Enlightenment .
Modern democracy began to take root when “ social elites realized that a pluralist order in the realm of the constitution , as well as in intellectual and scientific pursuits , was useful . ”
Thus it is also not true , as many economic historians insist , that first came capitalism , then democracy .
As another contemporary French scholar , Jean Baechler , has consistently asserted , freedom came first , then economic development , and Nemo shows why .
For Baechler , the freedom was primarily political and consisted in the niches of liberty permitted by the competition of political forces in geopolitically fragmented Europe .
Nemo shows that more important than these political niches was the intellectual breakthrough of the Papal Revolution , which approved the use of reason or , more precisely , distinguished the proper use of man ’s God - given reason from the false .
Holding democracy to be a result of how Christianity evolved in the West , Nemo is equally firm in holding that modern totalitarianism was not the evil essence of the West .
The West , in this semi-Marxist view , is characterized by power and exploitation , democracy being merely a sham .
Totalitarianism was simply the West without the mask .
Any decent political philosophy that rejects totalitarianism must , in this widespread interpretation , also reject much of the West .
In both elite ideology and much popular common wisdom , modern totalitarianism and Christianity are lumped together as bad , authoritarian , inhuman ideologies of unnatural constraint that must be rejected , and , since they were western , the rejection takes the form of multiculturalism and liberal guilt .
The final stage of Nemo ’s historical analysis is to ask whether western culture is universal now and , if so , what that means .
“ Does modernization require westernization ? ” asks the Indian - born economist Deepak Lal .
Nemo remains agnostic but suggests that we need not wait for the final answer , if any , to the question of what the West is today and what it should do to survive .
He proposes , therefore , a “ western union ” of the United States and such other states as can bring themselves to recognize a western identity consisting of the elements Nemo has described .
Unfortunately , such a western union , which Nemo conceives of as more a moral and intellectual force than a political alliance , has few chances as long as Europe is run by people who think Catholics are dangerous in power and as long as the United States still suffers under an elite that , even when it acknowledges religion , continues to follow a multiculturalist creed in which the only good values are universal ones and in which the ultimate sin is to think the West really has anything to offer .
A western union of a different sort may , however , be possible : a union of citizens who can see the justice and truth of Nemo ’s account and who understand the West as he sketches it , not as the result of expropriations and imperialism , of barbarity and exploitation , but as the result of an evolving spirit characterized , in its productive and creative phases , by openness resting on a strong intrinsic faith .
Had the West not first been Christian , it could never have become the modern dynamic West .
Christianity , its formative element , needed the Anselmian revolution to become the kind of society - shaping religion needed for the borrowings to be attractive and for the borrowers to be able to use them and build on them .
Among Nemo ’s many virtues is that he writes clearly and vividly .
This is not a virtue of many of his compatriots but French philosophers and historians used to have a great tradition of forceful , clear writing , and Nemo is of that tradition .
Another great value of his exposition is that he understands how the logic of human liberty is not just spiritual or just political but is spiritual , political , and economic at the same time .
Nemo belongs to the deeper tradition that understands human action as a whole .

A Swedish woman has been banned from smoking in her own back garden because her neighbour is allergic to cigarette smoke .
The cigarette row has rocked the city of Akarpin in southern Sweden , where the Environment Court banned Ingela Olofsson from smoking in her yard after hearing that her neighbour - Michael Berggren , a lawyer - has to wear an oxygen mask when walking from the house to the car .
" This is insane , " Olofsson said .
The row started when the lawyer bought the house next to Olofsson three years ago .
Berggren says that he initially asked her to smoke somewhere else than next to his garden .
But the woman did not stop smoking , and the bemused city has watched as the friendly neighbourhood atmosphere degenerated into a catfight .
The neighbours stopped talking to each other and recently all the communication between them has occurred via their legal representatives - and the media .
" We have no other choice to enter or exit our house but passing the garden path that faces your house and we can therefore no longer accept that you poison our lives with your disgusting and unhealthy tobacco smoke , " the lawyer wrote in an angry letter to Olofsson .
" The best thing is for you to quit , " he added .
Olofsson also received a letter from Berggren 's legal representative who informed her that the lawyer " had not been able to open the windows in two years due to the awful smell coming from the neighbour 's yard produced by the tobacco smoke " .
Berggren even claimed that he was forced to wear an oxygen mask when walking from the house to his car in the mornings and the evenings .
He said that without the mask it took only seconds for the effects of the smoke to take hold , leaving him struggling for breath .
Surprised neighbours and friends have spotted Berggren walking with the oxygen mask in his own garden several times a day .
" He is walking with the mask regardless if I smoke or not , " Olofsson said .
" I was provoked by his actions , but now I do not care anymore . "
The smoker was reported to the authorities and last week representatives from the Environment Court of south Sweden arrived in order to inspect the situation .
But Olofsson refused to participate .
" I did not believe it made any sense at all .
What were they supposed to do here ?
This is so ridiculous , " she said .
The court representatives inspected Berggren 's yard and established that it was fully possible to see Olofsson 's yard when standing there .
So the action - which Olofsson had believed was just a bad joke - turned serious , with the Environment Court ruling she could not smoke in major parts of her yard .
" This is making me furious , " she complained .
Since Norway banned smoking in all public facilities in June 2004 , Sweden and Denmark have followed with similar bans .
In the aftermath of the first explosion , the air over Lower Manhattan transformed instantly .
“ The sky was glittering with glass , ” says Nina L. , a Tribeca resident who asked not to be further identified .
She ran to her window and saw a shower of flaming jet fuel cascading from one of the towers .
“ This ca n’t be a good thing to have my windows open , ” she immediately thought to herself .
Nina closed her windows and shut her air conditioner flues .
As a former jeweler , she ’d worked around dangerous chemicals before and understood the hazards of toxic fumes .
From her apartment seven blocks north of the World Trade Center , she sat transfixed until a second explosion jolted her into action .
Nina tore up an old pillowcase , fashioned a makeshift bandanna over her face , packed her cats into cages , and trekked northward .
“ The whole neighborhood was blanketed in a gray snow , ” she recalls .
“ Some people were walking by in moon suits . ”
Although Nina could not have known it at the time , she had just entered one of the most dangerous atmospheric conditions ever to occur on American soil , and she suffers the consequences .
She had chronic bronchitis until 2003 and still has esophagitis and sinusitis .
Many health professionals believe others like her wo n’t experience the harsher , suffocating symptoms for several more years .
Up to 70 percent of first responders are ill as a result of 9/11 contamination .
If a similar rate of illness holds true for those who lived and worked near the Twin Towers , the number of seriously ill New Yorkers could climb to 300,000 in the near future .
About 70,000 New Yorkers so far have listed themselves with the World Trade Center Health Registry , a database that tracks the health impact of the 9/11 attacks .
The registry has been criticized for excluding large numbers of those potentially sickened outside a designated one - square - mile area .
Despite the insistent denials of city and federal officials , tens of thousands of New Yorkers were unnecessarily exposed to a chemical brew without even the most rudimentary precautions .
Today New York City is still mired in a fog of cover - upsand half - truths regarding its environmental welfare .
Civil rights attorney Felicia Dunn Jones , who worked a block from the towers , was caught in the initial deluge of dust when the towers fell .
Although her family rejoiced upon her return home , Dunn Jones developed a serious cough the following January .
She died barely five weeks later of sarcoidosis , an immune disorder caused by toxic exposure .
Dunn Jones ’s name will be added to the list of victims when the memorial is completed in 2009 , and the honor is n’t just a token gesture .
The addition of her name is a hard - won acknowledgment that exposure to 9/11 contaminants can lead to death .
David Worby , a personal injury lawyer , is representing more than 10,000 individuals who claim they ’ve suffered serious illness as a result of 9/11 .
Already , 130 of them have died of causes similar to Dunn Jones ’s , though Dunn Jones was not a client of Worby ’s .
Worby is critical of government officials for their overly sanguine assurances about the safety of the air and is especially critical of the city ’s lax enforcement of federal requirements that respirators be worn at contaminated sites .
“ They are getting sick because of people like Christie Todd Whitman and Rudy Giuliani , ” Worby says .
Whitman was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , and Giuliani was the mayor at the time the towers fell .
“ My people do n’t want their names to be on the wall , because they are not victims of terrorists — they ’re victims of bad government .
Giuliani should be banned from public office for what he did . ”
New York City , the Port Authority , and the contractors who were responsible for the cleanup ( Bovis and Turner Construction ) are all defendants in the Worby lawsuit .
“ I started this suit on behalf of one cop that got sick , ” Worby says of his class - action lawsuit filed in 2004 .
“ Nobody would touch the case with a 10 - foot pole because it was considered unpatriotic to say anything against the cleanup or the EPA .
We have come a long way .
They once called the 9/11 cough a badge of honor .
Now they know that the whole thing is a catastrophic government disaster . ”
Since the attacks , various scientific studies have demonstrated that New Yorkers are engulfed in billows of illness and disease related to 9/11 .
First the 9/11 cough and mental health problems caught the attention of local doctors .
Then chronic respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions began to surface .
Recently a program at Mount Sinai noted the emergence of rare blood cancers among 9/11 first responders .
Experts predict that more problems will surface in the next few decades .
While the progression of diseases continues to unnerve New York residents , more people are asking why basic health and safety standards were ignored and violated in the wake of the attacks .
One nonprofit organization , the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health ( NYCOSH ) , keeps a diligent watch on 9/11 - related issues .

The trustbuster in the Browser War
Unfortunately , right now , there is not much of a browser war anymore .
In 1996 , when I was working for a dinky start - up ISP in Portland , Oregon , all I ever heard of was tales of the war between Microsoft and Netscape .
With my blisteringly fast 100 Mhz computer , I was always running the newest beta of Netscape 2.0 , and was one of the ones that won a tee - shirt at the Internet Exporer 4.0 “ midnight madness ” download party when IE 4.0 was released .
New features were being added all the time that fundamentally changed the way that we made websites — silly things like when IE finally allowed you to make tables have a background image , or when broad JavaScript support finally existed .
Just Netscape 1.2 ’s support for tables at all rocked my world back in ’ 95 .
As an example , when the Scientology and Dianetics websites first came out in 1995 / 96 , they were done entirely without tables as not everyone could view this .
But what about now ?
What was the last significant advance in web browser software ?
I ’d have to say it ’s tabbed browsing , but that came out 3 years ago .
I ’d have to venture that pretty much ever since Netscape went under and basically lost the browser war to Microsoft , there ’s been an utter stagnation in the feature set of the browser – with the main improvements being things like security and cosmetics .
Honestly , what does IE7 bring to the table in terms of a fundamental feature set ?
I ’d have to say that it ’s about time for someone to once again extend the feature set of the browser , and start taking in some new territory — and once again start providing something new to majorly change and extend the way we use the Internet .
The guys over at Flock , which I have to commend , are doing something quite interesting with this in that they are building Web 2.0 right into the browser , and are tying in some of the most popular social networking and interactive services right into the UI of the browswer window .
Even cooler is that it works on Linux .
Like a charm .
Like in 30 seconds it was downloaded and installed and running on my Fedora 7 box .
Some simple examples of what this changes : first , I have all of my blogs and social networking services represented right in the browser .
I just browse along and when I see something nifty to blog I just press a hotkey and start typing and press publish .
Blam .
Like a surfing comment about the Scientology Basics on my FastPageMode blog ( and BTW – the new Scientology basic books are incredible ) , or like this post you ’re reading now .
I can with a click dig into my Flickr photos , or rapidly add RSS feeds to a sidebar so I can keep track of my news .
Nifty items I find like the Dianetics Course I ’m on now , can just be saved to a web clipboard , so that I can paste in and use the items later in blogs .
I ’m only touching on like a tenth of the features , but I think the point is that a gigantic amount of the development work in web applications nowadays is not going into desktop apps , but into on - line apps like YouTube and Facebook , as well as privatized versions of such like the Way to Happiness site which implements similar video sharing features .
The browswer now is just turning into a fast app which can take advantage of all this , and tie all of these disparate apps into an Internet experience which is faster and more ‘ jacked - in ’ .
I have no idea how Flock intends to fund themselves , but the idea is nonetheless exciting — that someone would finally go to start extending the browsing experience once again and start moving into some new ground .

" War is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the military . "
Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee , at a hearing on the Pentagon 's proposed $ 623.1 billion budget for fiscal 2008 , asked Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England and Adm.
Edmund Giambastiani , the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , why the emergency spending bill for Iraq included money for new F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter jets and C - 130 cargo planes .
The answer from England was that the Iraq conflict was lasting longer than expected and the weapons and equipment were wearing out at a faster rate than they had planned for .
England , who first served in the Bush administration as Secretary of the Navy , was a General Dynamics contractor and a former president of Lockheed .
England knew well that his former employer , Air Force Secretary and former Northrup president James G. Roche , had awarded the JSF contract to Lockheed - Martin and Northrop - Grumman .
The only other competitor was Boeing .
The order which stretches over 40 years , called for the development and manufacturing of 3000 fighters to be used by the Air Force , Navy and Marines .
Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England just happened to have served as president of Lockheed 's Fort Worth division , which will build the fighter jets .
The defense contract was the largest in U.S. military history ; a potential $ 250 billion deal .
Business is booming for defense contractors like Lockheed .
This week , it was reported that the aerospace corporation 's current president took home a $ 24 million bonus .
What England did not explain to the budget committee - behind all of the president 's insistence that Congress immediately fund his escalation of his occupation - was why these weapon systems needed to be included at all in the emergency request since most of them , like the F - 35 fighter jets , would n't be operational until at least 2010 .
Certainly , the Pentagon should know enough after four years in Iraq to plan for these appropriations in the regular budget , but have insisted on including these items in the ' emergency ' budget request which Bush has described as " funding our war fighters . "
The two future weapons systems were n't the only expenditures in Bush 's budget which had nothing to do with any ' emergency ' in Iraq .
It was revealed last month that Bush 's proposed war budget includes many other high - cost weapons that wo n't reach any battlefield for years .
There 's a request for a dozen F / A - 18 fighter jets ; seven new V - 22 Osprey transport aircraft ; six copies of a new plane called the Growler ; and $ 74 million for " design , development , integration , and testing " of an unmanned spy plane .
All of these extraneous expenditures included in the Iraq ' emergency ' supplemental by Bush 's Pentagon make a lie out of the scolding Bush gave Congress this weekend in his radio address :
The first line is made false by his own inflated budget request , and by his continued insistence that his ' war on terror ' is being fought against " enemies " in Iraq .
As his National Intelligence Estimate concluded last year , Bush 's occupation is actually fueling the violent resistance to the Iraq government he installed with our military , and , in fact , is creating even more individuals who are wiling to attack the U.S. , our interests , and allies in the region .
Even if we accepted that Bush had once cared at all about " funding our war fighters , " that vow was laid bare this month when the shortcomings and neglect of the medical care for the soldiers and veterans who served as the point of Bush 's ideological invasion and occupation of Iraq , and whatever other militarism he 's committed them to , was revealed in reports from the largest , most prominent military health care facility at Walter Reed .
Indeed , the Pentagon , themselves , released a report which claimed that rising health care costs were threatening their ' readiness ' for combat operations and their ability to wage war .
The Boston Globe reported earlier this month that , the Navy and Air Force plan to cut 15,000 jobs to try and save their health care system $ 138 million per year .
" Without relief , spending for healthcare will . . . divert critical funds needed for war fighters , their readiness , and for critical equipment , " Dr. William Winkenwerder , assistant defense secretary for health affairs , reportedly told Congress .
Despite the fact that Bush 's ' emergency ' request was $ 93.4 billion , Democrats are insisting on adding an additional $ 2.5 billion for training and readiness for forces deployed outside of the war zones and another $ 1.4 billion to cover housing allowance shortfalls .
Also included in the Democrat 's funding plan - which calls for troops to leave Iraq by the fall of 2008 , or earlier - is $ 900 million for soldiers with brain injuries and post - traumatic stress .
In response to Rep. John Murtha , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense , Gen. Peter Pace made the amazing argument that , if the military was forced by Democrats in Congress to live up to their own established standards for readiness it would actually ' erode ' their fighting ability .
Yet , in a report by Pace in February , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the dual occupations in Afghanistan and Iraq were , themselves , straining military readiness to the point where , it " may take several years to reduce risk to acceptable levels . "
That assessment has done little , if anything , to deter the Pentagon and Bush from proceeding with their escalation of the occupation , and the increased deployment of combat troops to Iraq without any change in the meager preparation time provided for the soldiers so far , or an addition of resources to cover the equipment shortages which already plague the existing forces .
With little regard - if any - for the over 3200 U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq at the rate of 1 - 3 dead every day , Bush and the Pentagon are wedging them in - between the warring factions ; ordering them into cramped , vulnerable , sandbagged huts as quickly as they can ship more troops over .
All of the talk of " success " in suppressing the Sunnis and others who are engaged in armed resistance against the Shiite - dominated regime masks the reality of our nation 's defenders hunkered - down doing the policing that Iraqis should rightly be doing for themselves .
All of Bush 's talk of the consequences of bringing our soldiers home before " Iraq is more secure " is a curious and revealing caution which he ignores in his zeal to press forward .
It 's apparent to everyone , except to Bush and his generals , that guaranteeing the security of Iraq 's new regime is an open - ended , dubious commitment which relies on continuing the occupation indefinitely to maintain the current buffer against insurgent violence .
Everywhere else in Iraq that our forces have not massed and embedded has become host to whatever mischief , unrest , and violence the Baghdad gauntlet cannot contain .

Maggots of the common bluebottle can fight off the superbug MRSA , researchers from Manchester University announced today .
They discovered that when free - range larvae from the insect were applied to the MRSA - infected foot ulcers of 13 diabetic patients , they cleared up the infection in all but one case .
Head of the research team Professor Andrew Bolton said he was confident that the treatment could be just as successful in MRSA infections in other parts of the body .
He said : " Maggots are the world 's smallest surgeons .
In fact they are better than surgeons - they are much cheaper and work 24 hours a day .
" They have been used since the Napoleonic wars and in the American civil war they found that those who survived were the ones with maggots in their wounds : they kept them clean .
They remove dead tissue and bacteria , leaving the healthy tissue to heal . "
Prof Bolton and his team have been using maggots for the last 10 years to treat foot ulcers developed by patients at the Manchester Diabetes Centre and foot clinics , as well as in - patients at Manchester Royal Infirmary .
But they decided to see whether maggots had any effect on beating MRSA after they noticed that the number of patients with ulcers infected by the superbug had doubled in last three years .
Prof Bolton admitted that the results were a surprise but " very exciting . "
He said : " We have demonstrated for the first time the potential of larval therapy to eliminate MRSA infection of diabetic foot ulcers .
" If confirmed in a randomised controlled trial , larval treatment would offer the first non-invasive and risk - free treatment of this increasing problem and a safe and cost - effective treatment , in contrast to the expensive and potentially toxic antibiotic remedies . "
Prof Bolton has now been awarded a grant of £ 98,000 from the charity Diabetes UK to carry out a randomised controlled trial to find out how successful maggots are in the treatment of MRSA - infected foot ulcers of patients with diabetes compared to two other more traditional treatments .
Agckphbft .
I did n’t expect so many of you to order the DVD of the movie we made here , Aardvark ’d : 12 Weeks with Geeks .
I thought we ’d get about 1000 orders .
So far , we ’ve received about 2600 orders , which went to 55 different countries , including Kazakhstan .
We even sent a copy to someone in New Orleans .
Now , anyone in their right mind would have found a fulfillment house to actually package and ship these damn things , but here at Fog Creek we seem to have developed a do - it - yourself kind of culture .
That led to a three day packing and shipping ordeal to get the first batch out the door , which is finally over .
The way I justify this silly exercise in hard labor is that I can write it off as a learning experience !
Here ’s what I learned :
Barcodes are the greatest thing since sliced bread .
I did n’t think we ’d need a barcode because all we had to type was an eight digit order ID .
Lo and behold , typing an eight digit order ID three thousand times adds up .
The three day ordeal would have been a two day ordeal if we had thought to put barcodes on the packing slip and had a scanner to read it .
It is amazing how much easier our life would have been if we had found a way to get the packing slip and the shipping label onto the same physical piece of paper .
Otherwise you need to spend a remarkable amount of effort trying to keep your packing slips in the same sequence as your shipping labels .
If they can both be printed on the same sheet somehow , the sequence stops mattering and everything you do is just that much easier .
You can throw things on piles as you assemble the packages instead of carefully keeping things in sequence .
You ’ll notice that a lot of shippers use special paper that is half peel - off - label , half plain paper for this exact reason .
The difference between desk / table height ( intended for working sitting down ) and counter height ( intended for working standing up ) makes a huge difference ergonomically .
Three days of working with things at various heights while standing up taught me that lesson in a visceral way .
Luckily our new office expansion was not completely set in stone so we were able to alter the design of the new mailroom shipping station to use counters instead of desks .
You ca n’t send Global Priority Mail to Italy .
Who knew ?
So far we ’ve shipped to just about everyone who ordered , except for the last 100 people who ordered the NTSC edition , because we flat ran out .
More NTSC DVDs will arrive on December 14th and will go out quickly .
We still have some PAL in stock , so those are now going out the same day .
In case you ’re wondering how much it really costs to produce a movie like this , here ’s the approximate breakdown .
Incremental Expenses ( per unit )
$ 2.00 – DVD production and delivery
$ 5.00 – Royalty to filmmaker
$ 0.30 – Envelope for shipping
$ 2.52 – Postage ( weighted average )
$ 0.20 – Other supplies for shipping ( labels , paper for packing slips , toner , boxes , etc )
$ 1.00 – Shipping labor ( estimate , since most labor came from Fog Creek employees on the payroll anyway ) .
Total per unit : $ 11.02 .
Since we ’re selling at $ 19.95 that ’s $ 8.93 gross profit .
Fixed Expenses :
$ 5,000 – Stipend paid to Boondoggle Films
$ 5,000 – expense reimbursement to Boondoggle Films
$ 925 – English - language subtitles
$ 3000 – Terabyte storage server used to hold footage while editing
$ 1000 – Graphic design of DVD cover and silkscreen
$ 200 – Damaged goods , accidental double shipments ( due to lack of bar codes ! ) , spoiled postage , etc .
Total : $ 15125 .
So we need to sell 1694 copies to break even .
As of today , we ’ve sold 2595 , so we made a profit on the movie of about $ 8048 .
There ’s one thing this does n’t account for : since we buy the DVDs in lots of 1000 , at some point in the future we ’re going to have a bunch of DVDs that we just ca n’t sell and we ’ll have to write those off .
With 2 SKUs and batches of 1000 we ’ll waste an expected 500 units per SKU which is $ 2000 , so deduct $ 2000 from the profit giving you a final figure of $ 6048 .
Not bad !
I was hoping to break even on the movie , and make a “ profit ” through more applications to our summer internship program from people who saw the movie and were inspired to work for Fog Creek .
There are several reasons I loved working on the Saints and Sinners Issue .
It 's the only magazine I 've ever seen with Madonna and Gandhi elbowing for cover space , it 's the first issue we ever got the fantastic authors John Green and Michael Stusser to write for , and it had this piece by Chris Smith .
It 's just 23 quick notes on 23 important album covers , but it 's one of my favorites .
Enjoy !
wearing their art on_their sleeves :
23 album covers that changed everything by Chris Smith
Long before MTV , performers expressed the visual dimension of their art through their album covers .
Every music fan has his / her favorites , but several covers stand out for their brilliance , their impact and their ability to make as much of a statement as the music they represent .
Every art form has its giants , and album cover art is no exception .
The work of the designers featured here spans over 40 years of music .
THE SIXTIES : Before the 1960s , most albums featured portraits of musicians , instruments or musicians playing instruments .
But the 1960 's spirit of exploration and experimentation found its way into music and , consequently , onto album covers .
1967 The Beatles , Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band
The Beatles ' album covers act as a kind of scrapbook for their mythmaking career : a serious With the Beatles , a hippie - esque Rubber Soul , a stripped down The White Album , and a funeral procession on Abbey Road .
Each is a testament to the band 's creativity and insight into their culture .
Yet no single album cover defines its era and its artists more than 1967's Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
As with any good cult artifact , stories built around the album : Was Paul McCartney dead ?
( No . )
Are the figures cardboard cutouts ?
( Yes . )
Are those pot plants ?
( No . )
The album was also legendarily difficult to execute — securing the faces of the band 's heroes and influences , from Alistair Crowley to guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi — was a logistical nightmare .
Finding photographs of everyone , blowing them up to specifications and tinting them with color all turned out to be well worth the effort , however .
The album became the single most recognizable ( and , according to many , the greatest ) album cover of all time .
1965 Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass , Whipped Cream & Other Delights
This concept album pushed the 1960s envelope all the way to the fridge .
Every song on the album is named for some kind of food , something the cover model seems to be enjoying in a more than metaphorical way .
This was Herb Albert 's most successful album , but whether the songs or cover sold the album has yet to be determined .
1969 Grateful Dead , Aoxomoxoa
It 's an iconic example of psychedelic art by one of the giants of the genre , graphic artist and California surfer , Rick Griffin .
The band met Griffin backstage after a concert and fell in love with his style .
In fact , they were so sure of his talent that they gave him total artistic freedom for the cover .
Griffin also designed the first masthead for Rolling Stone .
1967 The Doors , Strange Days
With this album , The Doors touched on the decade 's surrealism with a Fellini - esque circus , but still escaped the psychedelia that typified its generation .
The cover 's zoo of characters were a mix of professionals , amateurs and friends .
The juggler is the photographer 's assistant .
The trumpet player in the background was a cab driver who agreed to pose for $ 5 right before the image was shot .
1969 Blind Faith , Blind Faith
By the end of the decade , idealism had given way to cynicism , yet this album offered a strange vision of hope .
A maiden in the nude , holding a silver spaceship matted onto a pastoral setting , forms a metaphorical union of innocence and achievement , life and knowledge , uncharacteristic of the decade that spawned it .
THE SEVENTIES : The stylistic fragmentation of the 1960s continued in the 1970s .
Bands like Pink Floyd , Yes and Led Zeppelin claimed music — and their respective album covers — were definitely a trip .
>> Lots more after the jump !
1971 The Rolling Stones , Sticky Fingers
Rock n' roll is sometimes used as a euphemism for sex , so it 's no wonder that the crotch has been the centerpiece of countless album covers .
Yet , The Rolling Stones ' Sticky Fingers is the most famous and innovative example .
Sticky Fingers stands out as the best album cover of the decade .
The cover features an Andy Warhol photograph of a well - endowed young man ( contrary to legend , it was not Mick Jagger ) .
A working zipper on the man 's pants could be opened to reveal another shot of the model , this time in his skivvies .
The zipper left its mark on the album cover genre .
Unfortunately , it also left its mark on the record itself ( right in the middle of " Sister Morphine "  ) .
1973 Pink Floyd , Dark Side of the Moon
The classic simplicity of the prism on Dark Side is partly derived from a textbook illustration designed to show how light passes through a prism to form a spectrum .
In a science book , however , a prism spectrum has seven colors .
The album cover only has six ; they got rid of indigo simply because it looked too much like purple .
1977 Sex Pistols , Never Mind the Bollocks Here 's the Sex Pistols
Nothing sums up the punk ethos better than this album .
Like the record itself , the cover resembles a ransom note ( actually designed with cut - up newspaper bits ) , boldly proclaiming the Pistols had stolen the music industry 's thunder ... and did n't plan on giving it back .
The album was first refused in record shops because of the word " bollocks , "  and the issue was later taken up in court .
1979 Supertramp , Breakfast in America
This album reflects the English band 's move to the United States and the cynicism that went along with it .
A view of the Manhattan skyline , uncannily recreated with salt shakers , creamers , coffee mugs , egg cartons , napkin dispensers and silverware , stands behind a friendly waitress named Libby who offers you a tall glass of OJ — all through your airplane window .
Good morning , indeed .
1979 The Clash , London Calling
Punk thrust a rusted safety pin into the nostril of the bloated music industry with this one .
London Calling juxtaposed the concept of a 1956 Elvis album with a blurry image of Paul Simonon smashing his bass .
Incidentally , during the shoot , he smashed his watch in the process .
That 's the price you pay for ripping on Elvis .
THE EIGHTIES : The 1980s offered an interesting contrast : Musically , the decade was both an extension of the excesses of the 1970s and a reaction to it .
So what was the product of this conflict ?
The ability to stir up some controversy .
1988 Jane 's Addiction , Nothing 's Shocking
This album was shocking in every way .
A pair of Siamese twins joined at the hip and shoulder ( actually plaster sculptures built by lead singer Perry Ferrell himself ) sit naked on a love seat , their heads on fire .
According to Ferrell , it 's harder to get big flames burning on plaster twins than one might think .
Nine national record chains refused to stock the album .
1980 Gamma , Gamma 2
This cover perfectly illustrates the fear that 1980 's punk rock brought into the otherwise serene suburbs of America .
Originally , the pair of feet in the bottom right corner of the cover were only those of a woman , but Electra Records felt the image might seem inflammatory to certain female customers .
At the last minute , a pair of male feet were added to the cover .
1988 Prince , Lovesexy
While heavy metal and punk were making waves in music during the 1980s , Prince pushed the envelope in a different direction .
Celebrating both sexual freedom and ambiguity , Prince combined a feminine pose with overt phallic imagery .
Believe it or not , the shot was spontaneous : the photographer Jean - Baptiste Mondino suggested Prince go nude just before the session .
1983 Def Leppard , Pyromania
This album made Tipper Gore 's " filthy fifteen "  list when she crusaded against " porn - rock "  in the mid-1980s .
By organizing the Parents ' Music Resource Center , she encouraged the Recording Industry Association of America to adopt an explicit content labeling policy to protect minors .
THE NINETIES AND BEYOND :
By the 1990s the CD had replaced the old vinyls of yesterday .
While the classic square shape was back , the smaller size meant designers did n't have as much space with which to work .
Time will tell what images from the 1990s will stake their claim as classics .
Some are immediate standouts .
1991 Metallica , Metallica
The rock band reflects their stripped - down sound with this none - more - black cover , known to fans simply as " the black album . " 
The album marked the band 's transition from heavy metal to mainstream .
1990 Pixies , Bossanova
The Pixies took their listeners to another world with Bossanova , mixing the old with the new and the new with the kitsch and retro .
Pixies ' vocalist Frank Black claims he saw a UFO as a child and was always infatuated with outer space .
In fact , the band 's founding members decided to form the band while on a trip to New Zealand to see Halley 's Comet .
1996 Beck , Odelay
One of the decade 's strangest covers comes , fittingly , from one of its strangest artists .
Beck 's album shows a Komondor , ( a Hungarian sheepdog with a dreadlock - like coat ) , leaping over a hurdle .
It 's almost impossible to tell it 's a dog , but it 's even harder to forget .
1997 Prodigy , Fat of the Land
The rise of electronica brought acts like Prodigy to the fore , which featured a crab with brandished claws , symbolic of their aggressive beats and attitudes .
The image was chosen at the last minute as an illustration of the album title : a crab coming out of the sea to enjoy the bounty of the land .
AND SOME COVER ARTISTS YOU SHOULD MEET :
Andy Warhol : 1967 The Velvet Underground , The Velvet Underground and Nico
Despite what it insinuates on the cover , the album 's title is not Andy Warhol .
Rather , the then - unknown
The Velvet Underground used their well - known album artist 'of Warhol 's name created a persistent myth about The Velvets .
Everybody thought Andy Warhol was the lead guitarist . " 
Reid Miles : 1962 Freddie Hubbard , Hub - Tones
Reid Miles produced almost 500 graphically striking covers for Blue Note Records jazz acts like Freddie Hubbard .
Apparently , Blue Note often did n't have the budget to print full - color album covers , so Miles was confined to using two colors .
With his creativity and resourcefulness though , you 'd never know .
Neon Park XIII : 1970 The Mothers of Invention , Weasels Ripped My Flesh
A painter , whose name is as colorful as his work , Park produced quirky paintings for Little Feat and the Beach Boys , and the infamous Weasels Ripped My Flesh for Frank Zappa 's band , The Mothers of Invention .
This one was based on an ad for an electric shaver from a 1950s Life magazine .
Roger Dean : 1973 Yes , Tales From Topographic Oceans
Influenced by John Michell 's The View Over Atlantis — which argues the entire earth is connected via a single prehistoric ancient culture — and by P. Yogananda 's Autobiography of a Yogi , Dean imagined otherworldly dreamscapes for prog-rock groups like Yes and Asia .
In 1970 , Dean also designed the first logo for a new record label , Virgin .
Hipgnosis ( A British design pair led by Storm Thorgerson ) : 1975 Pink Floyd , Wish You Were Here
Hipgnosis produced widespread cover art , including Led Zepellin's Houses of the Holy and over 20 Pink Floyd covers .
In Wish You Were Here , the burning man shaking hands actually is on fire .
At the photo shoot , the stunt man wore an asbestos suit and a wig , then doused himself with gasoline and lit a match .

From " Nevemind " to " Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots " to " On the Corner " , we definitely left a lot off the list .
Be sure to tell us which ones we should have included in the comments below .
Parked Domains Will Make Google Irrelevant
Today , I had a neat idea .
I wanted to see if there was a such thing a type of dresser that is made up of modular , stackable sections .
The dresser has a top , a bottom and one or more frames in between .
Each section holds a one , two or three drawers .
It ’s a novel concept , but I never seen anything like that .
So , I searched Google for modular dresser drawers .
The top result was exactly what I was looking for .
Google seemed to have captured a very relevant result :
However , when I clicked the link , I was severely disappointed .
The top two results were parked domains , full of advertisements .
Even their Sponsored Links are not very relevant either .
It would be nice if Google was able to detect these leeches accurately .
However , Google will probably do nothing about it .
They even cater to these keepers of misinformation by offering Google AdSense for [ Parked ] Domains :
AdSense® for domains allows domain name registrars and large domain name holders to unlock the value in their parked page inventory .
AdSense for domains delivers targeted , conceptually related advertisements to parked domain pages by using Google ’s semantic technology to analyze and understand the meaning of the domain names .
Our program uses ads from the Google AdWords ™ network , which is comprised of thousands of advertisers worldwide and is growing larger everyday .
Google AdSense for domains targets web sites in over 25 languages , and has fully localized segmentation technology in over 10 languages .
It not like the Google needs another way to acquire more money .
However , this type of practice is going to have consequences .
If I keep getting parked domains as top relevant results , I certainly have no use for Google .
So , start looking at some other search engines , I first start with AltaVista .
Before I started using Google exclusively , I used AltaVista .
I was surprised that they still existed in some form .
The results of the same query to AltaVista yielded something interesting :
After taking a close look , I realized that even though the first few results are Sponsored Links , it turns out that they were the more relevant than Google ’s result .
The second ( and most importantly to me ) is that I did not find any parked domains on the first page of the results .
I was very impressed .
So , how did others search engines do in my very unscientific test ?
The results on Ask.com seem to have some relevence , but some of the results on the bottom of the first page point to dead links .
Not a good thing , in my opinion , because that tells me that Ask does not check back often to see if the result is still relevant .
Ask.com also has Sponsored Links on the top and the bottom , with some sponsored links repeated .
Very annoying , indeed !
On top of that , it was hard to tell the difference between a Sponsored Link from a standard result because the Sponsored Links only had a single text element telling me that it was a Sponsored Link .
There was no background contrast , no boundaries , and no distinguishing text colors .
The most positive thing about the results from Ask.com , there were no parked domains in the results .
On Microsoft Live , the results were about the same as Ask.com , but it was even harder to tell between a Sponsored Link and a standard result in the main content area .
I had to look very hard .
The first Sponsored Link in the right sidebar seemed to point to another search site .
A little weird , but I can work with that .
Again , to my surprise , there were no parked domains on the first page of the results .
On Yahoo , the results very familiar , almost like Google .
The standard results are numbered , while Sponsored Links are bulleted .
As with the others , the results are mostly relevant .
But again , there are no parked domains on Yahoo ’s first page of my results .
Of the major search providers , why does Google allow these shenanigans ?
Are they trying to be different , or are they seriously behind in this area ?
From my perspective , they are seriously annoying me as one of their customers .
I have been using Google since it was located at google .
stanford.edu , and I had been quite satisfied .
However , they are slowly getting on my bad side .
So , listen up Google , before you become irrelevant yourselves .
Last November , the American people voted for change .
We were fed up .
So we sent more Democrats to Washington with the expectation that we would finally see some positive change , some real efforts to reverse the direction in which this country has been led ( and misled ) over the past six years .
No such luck .
And now they 've outdone themselves .
All along , Congress has been rubberstamping Bush 's misguided Iraq war policy .
They fear that if they do n't , they 'll be accused of not supporting our troops .
So now what do they do ?
They block legislation that would support our troops .
Stranger than fiction .
Last week , the Senate rejected a bipartisan proposal to give our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan more leave time .
The proposal had been introduced by Senator Jim Webb , who happens to be a Viet Nam veteran .
How many of the senators who voted against it have any idea of what it 's like to serve in military combat ?
Not many , I suspect .
Our troops are overstretched .
They 're tired .
They 're stressed to the max .
And they have to endure the most horrific conditions imaginable for months and months on end .
They deserve a generous amount of time off .
Besides , it 's no secret that long , endless work shifts under stressful conditions will reduce one 's performance and present safety issues .
We 've got laws regulating how long a trucker can drive at a single stretch , and how many hours per week a medical resident can work .
And , as stressful as their jobs can be , truck drivers and doctors are not typically in danger of being shot at 24 hours a day .
Do n't our troops deserve better ?
How would these senators feel if they were deprived of R and R ?
Maybe we should see .
Since these senators feel that time off is n't so necessary , maybe they should forego their own vacations .
And maybe they should live like the troops for a while , as a show of support and solidarity , and to see for themselves what it 's like .
Make them work 24/7 under the most stressful conditions , with someone barking orders at them constantly .
Make them sleep and shower in group facilities and eat only military chow and MREs .
Make them walk the streets each day in a high - crime section of D.C. to see what it 's like to have bullets flying by their heads .
Make them live like this for six months , and do n't give them a single day off .
No break .
And they 're not allowed to complain .
Make them live like this for six months , and then see if they still feel that the troops have it just fine .

BBC News Online business editor in Davos
Spammers - senders of bulk e-mail that mostly offers dubious products or pornography - were innovative , he said .
However , a three - pronged strategy would soon stamp out the problem , he said in remarks at the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) in Davos .
He hailed search technology firm Google as a " great company " ; its approach reminded him of Microsoft 20 years ago .
Microsoft 's chief , estimated worth $ 46bn , is the US ' richest man
But he also predicted that Microsoft search technology would soon outpace that of its rival .
Mr Gates , by now a fixture at the annual WEF 's meeting of business leaders and top politicians , said a lot of progress had been made during the past year to stop spam e-mail .
" Lots of mail you get is from people on your contact list .
So what 's the problem ?
Strangers ! "
Filters could do a lot to sort spam from real mail , Mr Gates said : " Does the e-mail say it 's about ' enlargement ' - that might be spam . "
But by adding random words in subject lines and replacing text with pictures , spammers were trickier to catch and in the long run filters would " not be the magic solution " .
Spam will soon be a thing of the past
Bill Gates
How Microsoft aims to make spammers pay
More promising were " human challenges " - forcing the sender to solve a puzzle , or the computer sending the e-mail to do a simple computation .
" That 's easy for a machine sending a few e-mails , but gets very difficult and expensive for a computer sending lots of spam , " Mr Gates said .
But ultimately , Mr Gates predicted , spam would be killed through the electronic equivalent of a stamp , also known as " payment at risk " .
This would force the sender of an e-mail to pay up when an e-mail was rejected as spam , but would not deter senders of real e-mail because they could be confident that their mail would be accepted .
" Microsoft is pursuing all three approaches , and spam will soon be a thing of the past , " Mr Gates asserted .
Google vs Microsoft
Asked whether Microsoft missed the boat in the field of search technology , Mr Gates admitted that he had to take the blame for losing out to Google .
" We took an approach that I now realise was wrong , " he said .
" Our strategy was to do a good job on the 80 % of common queries and ignore the other stuff . "
Mr Gates claimed that Microsoft was better on the 80 % of common queries , although Google was " pretty good " as well .
We have gained good credibility ... and shown that we are hardcore about this business [ Xbox video games ] . "
Bill Gates
" But that 's not what counts .
It 's the remaining 20 % that counts ... because that 's where the quality perception is . "
Google was " way better " , he said , for people investigating a rare disease , exploring a hobby , or searching for a specific restaurant .
He praised the " high level of IQ " at Google 's research team , but said " we will catch them " .
X marks the box
In his wide - ranging remarks , Mr Gates described the first generation of his company 's Xbox video games console as a " pretty good first shot " , that would allow it " to play again " .
Gates and his wife have set up a charitable foundation
" We are a fairly strong number 2 to number 3 , and a weak number 2 to number 1 .
But we have gained good credibility ... and shown that we are hardcore about this business . "
Game software makers were now taking Microsoft seriously , and the next Xbox generation in two or three years ' time would be " mind - blowing " .
The future of computing
And anyway , in a decade from now , " we will laugh at personal computing as we know it " .
In a world of " seamless computing " everything would be digital , flexible and personalised , and driven by software not hardware .
" What is holding things back right now is software , " Mr Gates said , before adding with a smile : " At least I hope so , otherwise we are overspending to the tune of billions . "

All right , you know about the Government 's latest move to outlaw beggars ?
Do you really think it 's really about beggars ?
It is n't .
It 's about immigrant - beggars , who now throng our streets .
We could , of course , deal with the substantive matter , that of immigration itself , but instead we prefer to deal with its symptoms -- and in the usual cowardly way in which we address anything which is a little difficult or embarrassing .
Now look : I 'm not a complete fool .
People do n't turn columnists to read the same stuff , day after day after day .
Yet that 's what I 've been doing , endlessly writing on this same subject .
No doubt by this time , the one reader left is some old wino sitting in a doorway in his own personal pool of warmth , scanning these few column inches in the belief that these are the greyhound results .
No matter .
Here I go again .
Immigration is now not merely the dominant feature of Irish life , it is the greatest threat to the existence of the Irish nation as a coherent , and cohesive whole .
No country has ever accepted , never mind assimilated , the volumes of foreigners now present in this state .
We have some 400,000 legal immigrants ; but everyone knows that the army of illegals , especially Africans and Chinese , is vast , and probably tops 200,000 .
In all , Ireland has received at least 600,000 immigrants , most of them within the past five years .
It could be many more .
No one has the least idea .
In the US , such immigration would translate into an inward population movement of 45 million .
In the UK , the figure would be nine million .
Needless to say , neither state would be so idiotic or feckless as allow such vast numbers to enter .
Only Ireland would be so idiotic and so morally lethargic as to allow such massive inward population movements .
And of course , we have n't got the resources to cope with the consequences of such an influx .
But worse than our lack of resources , is our lack of courage in confronting the issue .
We do not have policies , but inept evasiveness : and perhaps worst of all , we have a posturing gallery of home - grown jackanapes ready to shriek " racism " wherever and whenever they see that things are not going quite the way that immigrants want .
Thus , on any discussion on RTE , especially from its newsroom , immigrants are never held responsible for choosing to come here .
Instead , we hear endless complaints that Irish institutions had not prepared themselves properly for their arrival .
On the News at One on Monday , African after African in Balbriggan complained there were no places for their children in the existing local schools .
Not once was the question posed : what was the real reason for the Africans not having places in schools ?
Answer : they 'd only just come here .
Instead , Africans who were just off the boat were allowed to accuse us of racism for not having school places awaiting their children .
There 's also the Paddy - factor in all this .
It 's impossible for any outsider to understand that this state is almost pathologically incapable of planning anything .
This is the land of the Red Cow Roundabout and motorways without service stations , rest - stops or toilets .
So how could we be expected seven years ago to have planned school - building projects in north county Dublin for Africans as yet unborn ?
If blaming ourselves for our failure to plan for Africa 's educational needs were not fatuous enough , some poor spokeswoman from the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin had to defend the Catholic Church against an RTE journalist 's accusations of bigotry .
Naturally , in this unprincipled liberal Ireland , for the Catholic Church to insist that Catholic schools have a primary duty to educate Catholics is nowadays both racist and sectarian .
But of course , no one on RTE would ever dream of proposing that Islamic madrasahs should take in Jewish , Catholic or Hindu pupils : in the new Ireland , the only people who are expected to bend their own rules are the Irish Catholic majority .
Accompanying this presumption is the pious and all - prevalent dogma that immigrants will on arrival abandon ancient loyalties , and will promptly don a Hibernian mantle : hence the brainless cliche , wittered endlessly by journalists and politicians alike , " the New Irish " .
Sorry .
This is conceited gibberish .
Why would a Pole surrender something which the Polish people have fought for a thousand years to retain ?
Why the presumption that an Asian Muslim who lives in Ireland is in any way Irish ?
My mother lived most of her life in England , but never for a second thought of herself as English .
The media should be asking the big question , ' Why are we still admitting hundreds of thousands of immigrants ? '
Instead , we are obsessing with the relatively trivial question of :
Are the Irish people , who after all have admitted vast armies of strangers to their national home , racist ?
This is self - hatred at its most pathetic , and its most self - defeating .
Whether Irish people are " racist " is irrelevant .
We have created a society whose apparent cohesiveness is totally dependent on immigration - fuelled economic growth .
That growth must one day come to an end .
Then what , in Darndale , Coolock , or even Balbriggan ?
In light of President Bush 's disgraceful presser today , Keith Olbermann decided to make a Special Comment on tonight 's Countdown and wow , did he make the most of it .
Olbermann blasts the president for his cowardly and un-American behavior of pimping General Petraeus as a political hack and hiding behind him to deflect criticism .
To say that Keith took the president to the woodshed would be an understatement .

Transcripts below the fold
So the President , behaving a little bit more than usual , like we'd all interrupted him while he was watching his favorite cartoons on the DVR , stepped before the press conference microphone and after side - stepping most of the substantive issues like the Israeli raid on Syria in condescending and infuriating fashion , produced a big - wow political finish that indicates , certainly , that if it was n't already -- the annual Republican witch - hunting season is underway .
" I thought the ad was disgusting .
I felt like the ad was an attack not only on General Petraeus , but on the U.S. Military .
" And I was disappointed that not more leaders in the Democrat party spoke out strongly against that kind of ad . " And that leads me to come to this conclusion : that most Democrats are afraid of irritating a left - wing group like Move - On - Dot - Org -- or ** more ** afraid of irritating them , than they are of irritating the United States military . " "
That was a sorry deal . "
First off , it 's " Democrat - ic " party , sir .
You keep pretending you 're not a politician , so stop using words your party made up .
Show a little respect .
Secondly , you could say this seriously after the advertising / mugging of Senator Max Cleland ?
After the swift - boating of John Kerry ?
But most importantly ... making that the last question ?
So that there was no chance at a follow - up ?
So nobody could point out -- as Chris Matthews so incisively did , a week ago tonight -- that you were the one who inappropriately interjected General Petraeus into the political dialogue of this nation in the first place !
Deliberately , premeditatedly , and virtually without precedent , you shanghaied a military man as your personal spokesman -- and now you 're complaining about the outcome , and then running away from the microphone ?
Eleven months ago the President 's own party -- the Republican National Committee -- introduced this very different kind of advertisement , just nineteen days before the mid-term elections .
Bin Laden .
And Zawahiri 's rumored quote of six years ago about having bought " suitcase bombs . "
All set against a ticking clock , and finally a blinding explosion ... and the dire announcement :
" These are the stakes - vote , November 7th . "
That one was ok , Mr. Bush ?
Terrorizing your own people in hopes of getting them to vote for your own party has never brought as much as a public comment from you ?
The Republican Hamstringing of Captain Max Cleeland and lying about Lieutenant John Kerry met with your approval ?
But a shot at General Petraeus -- about whom you conveniently ignore it is you who reduced him from four - star hero to a political hack -- that merits this pissy juvenile blast at the Democrats on national television ?
Your hypocrisy is so vast , sir , that if we could somehow use it to fill the ranks in Iraq you could realize your dream -- and keep us fighting there until the year 3000 .
The line between the military and the civilian government is not to be crossed .
When Douglas MacArthur attempted to make policy for the United States in Korea half a century ago , President Truman moved quickly to fire him , even though Truman knew it meant his own political suicide , and the deification of a General who history suggests had begun to lose his mind .
When George McClellan tried to make policy for the Union in the Civil War , President Lincoln finally fired his chief General , even though he knew McClellan could galvanize political opposition - as he did ... when McClellan ran as Lincoln 's presidential opponent in 1864 and nearly defeated our greatest president .
Even when the conduit flowed the other way and Senator Joseph McCarthy tried to smear the Army because it would n't defer the service of one of McCarthy 's staff aides , the entire civilian and Defense Department structures -- after four years of fearful servitude -- rose up against McCarthy and said " enough " and buried him .
The list is not endless -- but it is instructive .
Air Force General LeMay -- who broke with Kennedy over the Cuban Missile Crisis -- and was retired .
Army General Edwin Anderson Walker -- who started passing out John Birch Society leaflets to his soldiers .
Marine General Smedley Butler -- who revealed to Congress the makings of a plot to remove FDR as President -- and for merely being approached by the plotters , was phased out of the military hierarchy .
These careers were ended because the line between the military and the civilian is ... not ... to ... be ... crossed !
Mr. Bush , you had no right to order General Petraeus to become your front man .
And he obviously should have refused that order and resigned rather than ruin his military career .
The upshot is -- and contrary it is , to the MoveOn advertisement -- he betrayed himself more than he did us .
But there has been in his actions a sort of reflexive courage , some twisted vision of duty at a time of crisis .
That the man does n't understand that serving officers cannot double as serving political ops , is not so much his fault as it is your good , exploitable , fortune .
But Mr. Bush , you have hidden behind the General 's skirts , and today you have hidden behind the skirts of ' the planted last question ' at a news conference , to indicate once again that your presidency has been about the tilted playing field , about no rules for your party in terms of character assassination and changing the fabric of our nation , and no right for your opponents or critics to as much as respond .
That , sir , is not only un-American -- it is dictatorial .
And in pimping General David Petraeus , sir , in violation of everything this country has been assiduously and vigilantly against for 220 years , you have tried to blur the gleaming radioactive demarcation between the military and the political , and to portray your party as the one associated with the military , and your opponents as the ones somehow antithetical to it .
You did it again today , sir , and you need to know how history will judge the line you just crossed .
It is a line -- thankfully only the first of a series -- that makes the military political , and the political , military .
It is a line which history shows is always the first one crossed when a democratic government in some other country has started down the long , slippery , suicidal slope towards a military junta .
Get back behind that line , Mr. Bush , before some of your supporters mistake your dangerous transgression , for a call to further politicize our military .

Good night , and good luck .

In the late 1960s , provocative Provo Party of Amsterdam started a movement to provide bicycles for anyone 's use around the town .
The action was led by Luud Schimmelpennink , who was elected to the seat of city council as the sole representative of Provo .
He pushed forward the idea in the council , but in vein .
Provo did some experiments of its own .
This effort known as witfiets ( white bike in Dutch ) soon failed because of thefts and vandalism .
After witfiets , Schimmelpennink started a new system called witkar ( white car in Dutch ) in 1974 .
This was a quite sophisticated electoronic car sharing system , which sustained for several years until the program disbanded because of the lack of funds in 1980 .
These stories tells us how Luud Schimmelpennink was innovative in the field of urban transportation .
In 1999 , he started a new witfiets program equipped with computer - operated locking / charging system , in collaboration with GBV , the city 's transportation authority .
Under this system , users purchase a chip card and pay a few Guilders for each use .
At the time of lease , users register their destination so that the rack at the destination will have a open rack .
Unfortunately , this project got suspended in 2001 ( may not be correct ; need to check ) when GBV withdrew from the venture .
The major problem was again the thefts .
Locks on the rack broke when a few persons pulled the bike very hard .
Currently , the system is not working , and bicycle racks have been removed ( you can find the information poles still standing around Amsterdam ) .
Luud Schimmelpennink is now developing a totally new system in collaboration with a Dutch lock manufacturer : Axa .
The new system will integrate the card - operated key lock on the bicycles .
He plans to test this new system from February 2004 at a rental location next to city hall at Waterlooplein .
If you have a chance to visit Amsterdam , watch out for it !
Also , the bicycle will be the ones used in Germany 's call a bike program for the convenience of users .

The world is very different now than it was before the industrial revolution , which began about 1800 when fossil fuels were first used extensively .
It seems to me that there is a significant chance that over the long term there will be just as big a change as we leave the age of fossil fuels .
To start the discussion , let 's start with where we are , and then take a look back .
Many people when analyzing the world oil situation focus on the relatively small drop in overall world supply in the first few years .
From this , they conclude that peak oil will primarily raise the price of oil and some related goods , but not have a huge effect otherwise .
If the decrease in oil products is severe , some rationing may be required .
I think this analysis misses the big part of the problem – the impact of peak oil on the overall economic system , particularly in the United States .
What happens when peak oil collides with our economic system ?
It seems to me that there is a high probability of a major discontinuity of some type .
What exactly happens after the discontinuity is likely to vary from country to country .
It seems to me that the United States is especially vulnerable to a drastic drop in the amount of oil available for import because of the large amount of oil we import and the relatively small amount of goods we export .
This is the first part of a three - part series providing my ideas on the economic impact of peak oil .
We all recognize our current economic system .
Goods are made in factories around the world .
Food is grown on large farms , then processed and packaged before we buy it in grocery stores or restaurants .
There is a huge amount of international and local trade that brings all of our goods and services to us .
Most of us have jobs and work for money to purchase the things we need or want .
We expect to buy various types of insurance , such as life insurance , auto insurance , and long term care insurance .
After we have worked for a number of years , we expect to retire and collect funds from various sources - social security , a pension , or perhaps a 401 ( k ) .
To finance all of this , there is a huge financial industry .
This industry includes many players :
• Banks and savings and loans
• Insurance companies
• Hedge funds
• Markets that sell stocks , bonds , and a wide variety of derivatives and repackaged debt
• Large numbers of accountants , actuaries , economists , financial advisors , financial planners , quantitative analysts , and others associated with the financial services industry .
We know that this system includes a very large amount of debt .
Almost any new factory is “ financed ” .
Businesses use debt to buy other business .
Individuals use debt to finance college educations and to purchase homes or cars .
In recent years it has become fashionable to refinance home loans as soon as some equity has built up , and use the funds withdrawn to pay down credit card debt .
Governments use debt to just as great an extent as individuals .
State and local governments issue bonds to finance a wide range of projects .
The federal government has both the debt that it reports , and unfunded programs such as Social Security and Medicare .
USA
Today reports that when corporate style accounting is used , federal liabilities amount to $ 59.1 trillion , or $ 516,348 for each US household .
This compares to an average of $ 112,043 per household in personal debt such as mortgage loans , auto loans , and credit cards .
2 . Have economies always been similar to ours today ?
We all know that the answer is “ No ” .
Prior to the industrial revolution , most people were farmers , and businesses tended to be quite small .
Governments funded big undertakings like roads or water systems ( or pyramids ) .
Farmers grew or made most of what they needed .
What was left over was sold and traded for other goods .
Cities tended to be quite small , because the amount farmers produced over and above what they needed for themselves was not sufficient to support very many additional people .
While there was international trade , the volume was much smaller than today .
In businesses and governments , debt seems to have played a lesser role than today .
When Lloyd ’s of London was formed in 1688 to pool insurance risk , it was formed by a group of wealthy individuals , each pledging a share of their personal wealth as backing for the venture .
Thus , the emphasis was on assets rather than debt .
The US government did not have significant debt until the Civil War .
Its next increase in debt came with World War I .
The use of debt , particularly by individuals , seems to have been viewed quite negatively .
The Catholic Church forbad debt until 1822 , and Islam to this day forbids paying interest on debt .
The Jewish Torah says debts should be erased every seven years and every 50 years .
Those who could not repay loans were sometimes sent to debtors ’ prisons or became indentured servants or slaves .
Homes and barns were quite simple , and were often built with the help of friends or neighbors , so little debt was needed .
Farms and other property tended to stay in families , and were transferred through inheritance .
Many of the skills needed to run a farm or small business were learned through apprenticeship , often with the boy ’s own father .
Retirement was unknown .
People would work as long as their heath permitted , and lived with their children when they got older .
Since retirement was unknown , when people saved for the future , it was primarily savings for a “ rainy day ” - –crop failure or ill health or burial .
The stock market and even banks were viewed as risky .
Panics , crashes and bubbles happened frequently , making it difficult to predict how markets would behave in the future .
3 . How did this huge change in the economic system take place ?
One of the big factors in the change was the greater use of fossil fuels , starting about 1800 , when coal began to be used to power factories and the steam engine .
This allowed for the production of many more goods , and resulted in greatly expanded trade .
Petroleum came into widespread use in the late 19th and early 20th century .
Farmers were able to farm larger tracts of land with the use of tractors and other equipment .
The green revolution between 1940 and 1960 further increased farm productivity through the greater use of fertilizers ( natural gas ) , pesticides ( oil ) , and pumped irrigation ( oil ) .
4 . Was n't technology important in the change in the economy ?
Energy and technology go hand - in - hand .
Without energy , it is hard to have much technology improvement .
Energy also goes hand in hand with productivity growth , since energy is what permits a machine to do the work a person previously would have done .
5 . Have economists studied the relationship between energy and economic growth ?
The standard model by which economists explain growth is the Solow - Swan neoclassical growth model , which is described in Robert Solow 's 1956 paper A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth .
This paper looks at the contribution of labor and capital to the growth of the US economy , using a model that assumes that the contributions of labor and capital are proportional to their respective costs .
The paper finds that labor and capital in fact explain less than 25 % of the actual growth of the US economy .
The assumption is then made that " technology " must explain the huge residual .
With a model that explains so little ( less than 25 % of actual growth ) , it is not clear that the model is very helpful .
The residual comprising over 75 % of growth could just as well be energy as technology .
One economic growth model that explains growth quite well is Accounting for Growth , the Role of Physical Work by Robert U. Ayres and Benjamin Warr , Structural Change and Economic Dynamics , February , 2004 ) .
This model looks at the amount of work ( in a physics sense ) that is done by energy .
Thus , it considers both the amount of energy used and how productive that energy is .
For example , power stations in 1900 converted only 4 % of the potential energy in coal to electricity , but by 2000 , the conversion efficiency was raised to 35 % .
This model explains the vast majority of US real economic growth between 1900 and 2000 , except for a residual of about 12 % after 1975 .
Figure 1 : Results of model by Ayres and Warr .
The selected model is the dotted red line , which includes biomass and animal labor , as well as other types of fuels ( fossil and nuclear ) .
A closely related result from the Ayres and Warr paper is that declining real cost of energy , particularly electricity , and the rising use of the much cheaper electricity , fed economic growth in the 1900 to 1998 period .
Figure 2 : Electricity prices and electrical demand , USA 1900 - 1998
6 . Has the real price of electricity and other energy products continued to drop in recent years ?
Any of us , looking at our electric bills , our natural gas bills , and the cost of fuel for our cars know the answer to this one .
Rather than talking about peak oil , perhaps we should be talking about passing the " trough in energy prices " .
The Department of Labor shows this graph of changes in the Consumer Price Index for Energy .
Figure 3 : Changes in Consumer Price Index for Energy , from the US Department of Labor
The cost of electricity has also been rising since 1999 .
Productivity is growing , but not nearly as rapidly as energy costs .
The International Energy Association says that energy efficiency is growing at less than 1 % per year in its 26 member countries .
The US Energy Information Administration forecasts energy efficiency gains ranging from 2.2 % to 2.4 % per year between 2004 and 2030 in its various forecast scenarios .
One way of confirming the higher real cost of energy is to look at the trend in energy costs as a percentage of GDP .
According to the U. S. Energy Information Agency , energy costs rose from 6.0 % to 7.4 % of US GDP between 1999 and 2004 .
We all know that since 2004 , energy costs have likely risen further .
7 . Were there any other factors besides the increased use of fossil fuels that caused a change in the economic system between early days and now ?
Yes , there certainly have been many .
One that is important for our analysis is the fact that there was a real change in the way the markets and financing were viewed .
Debt was viewed more positively .
The stock market came to be viewed as a safe investment .
The whole system came to be viewed as sufficiently stable that quantitative analysts could develop sophisticated models of the system and use these to price financial products .
We will look at how this change came about in Part 2 .
In Part 2 , we will also look a little more at where the economy is now .

It looks like a samurai sword , and it 's almost as long as he is tall .
His hands are on the hilt .
He raises and steadies the blade .
Two apprentices help to guide it .
Twelve years ago , when it was new , this knife was much longer , but the apprentices ' daily hours of tending to it , of sharpening and polishing it , have reduced it greatly .
It was made by the house of Masahisa , sword - makers for centuries to the samurai of the Minamoto , the founders of the first shogunate .
In the 1870s , when the power of the shoguns was broken and the swords of the samurai were outlawed , Masahisa began making these things , longer and more deadly than the samurai swords of old .
The little guy with the big knife is Tsunenori Iida .
He speaks not as an individual but as an emanation , the present voice , of the generations whose blood flows in him and who held the long knife in lifetimes before him , just as he speaks of Masahisa as if he were the same Masahisa who wrought the first samurai sword , in the days of dark mist .
Thus it is that he tells me he 's been here since 1861 , during the Tokugawa shogunate , when this city , Tokyo , was still called Edo .
Iida - san is the master of the house of Hicho , one of the oldest and most venerable of the nakaoroshi gyosha , intermediate wholesalers of tuna , or tuna middlemen , if you will .
The tuna that lies before Iida - san on its belly was swimming fast and heavy after mackerel a few days ago under cold North Atlantic waves .
In an hour or so , its flesh will be dispatched in parcels to the various sushi chefs who have chosen to buy it .
Iida - san is about to make the first of the expert cuts that will quarter the 300 - pound tuna lengthwise .
His long knife , with the mark of the maker Masahisa engraved in the shank of the blade , connects not only the past to the present but also the deep blue sea to the sushi counter .
Everything around him seems to turn still for a breath as he draws the blade toward him and lays open the tuna with surgical precision .
And everything around him is a lot , for we are in the frantic heart of a madness unto itself : the wild , engulfing , blood - drenched madness of Tsukiji .
Until the summer of 1972 , bluefin tuna was basically worthless to American fishermen .
Nobody ever ate it , and its sole commercial use was as an ingredient in canned cat food .
The only tuna that people ate , the white stuff , also in cans , was processed from smaller , albacore tuna , and even that probably would not have gotten into the American diet if a California cannery had n't run out of sardines and begun selling it in 1903 .
Theodore C. Bestor is the author of Tsukiji : The Fish Market at the Center of the World , the standard work on the subject .
He , the chair of the Anthropology Department of Harvard , and I , the chair of nothing , spent some time together in Tokyo .
It was Ted who taught me how to correctly pronounce the name of this place : " tskee - gee . "
( In her new book , The Sushi Economy , Sasha Issenberg says it 's " pronounced roughly like ' squeegee , ' " but it 's not .
Her book , however , is an engaging one . )
" I grew up in central Illinois , " Ted told me , " and as a kid I do n't remember ever eating fresh fish .
I 'm not sure I ever even saw one .
As far as I knew , fish came frozen , already breaded and cut into oblongs for frying .
And tuna , of course , was something that appeared only in cans like hockey pucks and ended up in sandwiches .
I had absolutely no idea of what a tuna looked like , its size or anything else . "
Watch Prices Go Up : Interesting Facts About Inflation
“ Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten dollar haircut you used to get for five dollars when you had hair . ” — Sam Ewing
I still remember the “ good old days ” when gas cost $ 1.50 a gallon .
Heck , if you went further back and looked at how much things cost in 1964 when many of us were n’t born yet , you ’d probably think how nice and cheap prices were back then .
But at that time , you ’d be lucky to make $ 10,000 a year and more likely to make half of that amount .
In general though , inflation is something we accept grudgingly as part of our daily life .
Though price increases can be wrongly attributed to greedy capitalists and businesses , for the most part , price hikes happen because of less self - serving reasons .
Here are some of the most common reasons for higher prices :
Why Do We Get Price Hikes ?
# 1 Increase in money supply
One of the most common reasons for prices increases is that the government raises our money supply or releases more currency in circulation , which then cause businesses to increase prices to maintain the same value for their products .
# 2 Scarcity of products
High demand chasing low supply ( or scarcity ) can also cause price increases : when food items such as oranges or grapes are negatively affected by weather , then we see the consequences in our grocery stores .
# 3 Interest rates
Higher interest rates can cause borrowing and the cost of doing business to become more expensive — we may see that cost passed on to general products and services .
To be specific , a higher interest rate environment may be inflationary in the short term , but in the long term , rates are raised to counter inflation .
Lower interest rates can spur growth and potentially inflation as well .
How Much Did Things Cost in 1964 ?
Some examples of items in 1964 from the American Heritage Magazine “ The Cost of Living ” article :
Item Price Four - bedroom , two - bath house in South Bend , Indiana $ 16,000 “ Penthouse view ” in doorman building on East 69th Street , Manhattan $ 245 per month Hershey chocolate bar $ 0.05 Steak dinner at the Palm in Manhattan $ 8 Fruit of the Loom boxer shorts $ 0.69 Ford Mustang , starting price $ 2,358 Rental car , Ford Falcon $ 5 per day DeBeers one carat diamond $ 500 to $ 1,800
One year ’s tuition at Harvard $ 2,400
One year ’s tuition at Syracuse University $ 750 Ticket to “ Goldfinger ” with Sean Connery $ 1
Fast forward to today …
Today , with $ 9 or $ 10 for a movie ticket , property values in South Bend , Indiana at $ 126,000 , Manhattan rents at $ 4,000 a month and Harvard tuition at over $ 31,000 a year , we have come to accept these price increases as part of everyday living , since after all , our median $ 53,350 a year salary is going to cover our expenses accordingly .
In fact , we should n’t really complain too much with our inflation rates holding low for so long .
Graphic Displays of Inflation
So far , inflation has been tame in the United States , and we can thank the Federal Reserve hawks Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan for this .
In fact , some mild inflation is actually considered a benefit by some economists and business people who believe it “ greases the wheels of commerce ” .
The important thing is that it remains in check .
If you check out this U.S. historical inflation chart , we ’ve never had more stable prices than we do today .
Let ’s just be thankful we do n’t have to face runaway inflation ( hyperinflation ) as the Zimbabweans are doing at this point in time , where they are dealing with prices , incomes and money supplies that are out of control .
Nor do we have to worry about deflation , which is the sustained fall in prices , typically triggered by a decrease in demand .
That ’s something the Fed keeps an eye on as well .
In general though , by looking at this world inflation chart , it looks like we ’re relatively in good shape .
Now there are some “ chicken littles ” out there who thrive on gloomy predictions about our future economic situation , who present arguments that show the huge slide of the dollar ’s purchasing power , while hyping up the ultimate safe haven that is gold and precious metals .
All I can say to that is , do n’t get too carried away — see all sides of the story behind rising prices .

Playing With Prices : Use These Interactive Resources
If you ’re ever in the mood to delve into the historical movement of money and prices , then here are some things I found around the internet that pertain to this topic :
Cool Inflation Calculators
I discovered these cool calculators that shows us how our dollars have kept up with time : how does a certain dollar amount change from one year to another based on inflationary effects ?
You ’ll find it with this tool .
Consumer Price Index Surveys
If you ’re curious to see what the history of price is for a particular item from 1978 through today , here ’s something you can review .
I ’m just surprised that bananas have n’t really changed in price much for the last 10 years , whereas other goods like eggs and milk have !
More price index information here .
Percentage Increase in Prices of Ordinary Goods
Following is another illustration that shows you the percentage increase in prices for some common items we buy .
In the span of a mere couple of decades , we see percentage rate increases from 55 % for milk to 170 % for your average house .
What a difference 20 years makes !
Though prices go up , we may not notice the increase when we get raises , relatively fatter salaries , and appreciated assets .
When we see how everything else goes up , including our income , it is n’t as bad as it appears .

It contains a vast collection of money and currency data .
In general , low inflation through the years is something we barely care about on a daily basis .
Many of us get raises that keep up with the cost of living .
But in the long term , these cost of living changes WILL matter .
And it ’s especially harder for people on fixed income .
The good news , though , is that there are ways to combat the gradual degradation of your money ’s value , but you ’ll need to stay tuned for another post to continue this discussion .

So , you just executed a complex , wonderful emacs command using the minibuffer and you ’re so excited that need to immediately write it down , lest you forget .
As you may already know , you do n’t need pen and paper for that .
Emacs will do it for you : just press C-x ESC ESC ( that is , repeat - complex - command ) and you ’ll see an Elisp form in your minibuffer that reproduces your last command ( C- h w C-x ESC ESC for more details ) .
Now C-a C-k and you got it in the kill - ring , ready to be yanked in one of your configuration files .
I do n’t use this trick that much because over the years more and more emacs automatisms are recorded either in my nervous system or my config files .
Except for one thing : defining keybindings .
There ’re a bunch of ways to define a keybinding in emacs , and i’m never sure what ’s the right one when there ’re special keys involved .
The solution is to define the key interactively with M-x global - set - key .
Once i’m done , i play C-x ESC ESC and presto : an elisp snippet to yank in my .emacs appears in the minibuffer .
Happy binding !

In an unusual expression of frustration , the judge who sentenced former White House aide I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby to 30 months in jail , only to see the sentence commuted by President Bush , said he was “ perplexed ” by the act of clemency .
In his first public comments on the matter , U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton took issue with Bush ’s statement that the prison sentence ordered for Libby last month was “ excessive . ”
Walton defended the sentence , saying that he followed established legal precedents as well as a strict interpretation of federal sentencing guidelines that has been supported by Bush ’s own administration .
“ In light of these considerations … it is fair to say that the court is somewhat perplexed as to how its sentence could accurately be characterized as ‘ excessive , ’ ” Walton wrote .
“ Although it is certainly the president ’s prerogative to justify the exercise of his constitutional commutation power in whatever manner he chooses , the court notes that the term of incarceration imposed in this case was determined after a careful consideration of each of the requisite statutory factors . ”
( Original Article ) Â
The saga of the sagging dollar continues .
All year , the dollar has drooped compared with other major currencies .
Last week , after the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates , it fell even further – now at a level not seen since 1997 .
The Canadian loonie is even stronger – on par with the greenback for the first time in 30 years .
But does a less prestigious portrait of George Washington ( on the dollar bill ) have any meaning for most Americans ?
Economists say the falling dollar has pluses and minuses for the economy .
For consumers who like to buy European automobiles or French cheeses , it means their standard of living will go down as they pay more money for these goods .
But for American workers on the assembly lines at places such as Boeing or Caterpillar , it means their employers ' products will be more in demand .
" After the pluses and minuses are all netted out , I think the lower - valued dollar is good for the economy , " says Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody's Economy.com .
" The growth we 're getting from trade is helping to cushion the blow to the economy from housing . "
The last time that the buying power of the US dollar was this low was about a decade ago , according to Federal Reserve Board statistics .
But the major difference was that the dollar was rebounding from its low point in the mid-1980s when the major industrial nations decided it was overvalued .
It was also easier to make changes in the trade numbers because the price of oil ranged from $ 22 a barrel ( in 2006 dollars ) to $ 26 a barrel , and China 's exports were tiny .
The US trade deficit was about $ 230 billion .
This time , the dollar has been on the skids for the past five years .
The price of oil is about $ 80 a barrel .
The Census bureau reports the trade imbalance with China alone is $ 141 billion through July .
So far this year , the greenback is down 7.6 percent , including another 2 percent last week after the Fed reduced interest rates by half of a percentage point .
One of the greatest concerns is that a lower - valued dollar will add to the inflation rate , since imports could become more expensive .
So far that has n't shown up in the inflation numbers .
" It will take awhile to build into the system , " says Bill Witherell , chief global economist at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland , N.J. " Right now , it 's [ inflation from imports ] within the bounds which permitted the Fed to move . "
However , some other economists are n't sure a falling dollar will help improve the trade deficit .
They argue that the two major components of the trade deficit – oil and imports from China – are not really affected by the dollar gyrations .
In July , the two areas represented 80 percent of America 's trade imbalance .
" If you can't adjust imports of oil , and most are priced in dollars , and you can't adjust currencies against Chinese yuan , which is pegged to the dollar , depreciating the dollar does not get you where you want to go , " says Peter Morici , an economics professor at the University of Maryland 's business school .
Mr. Zandi , however , counters that the rising price of oil will eventually mean that Americans get serious about alternatives or cutting down on consumption .
" It 's having an impact , but it 's just not as noticeable yet , " he says .
He believes China 's slow appreciation of its currency – about 10 percent in the past two years – will ultimately result in fewer Chinese exports .
" It will have a big impact two to four years down the road , " he predicts .
Some Federal Reserve watchers are not surprised that chairman Ben Bernanke opted to lower interest rates .
Mr. Bernanke is a keen observer of the Great Depression in the 1930s .
" In his studies of the Depression , one of his main criticisms is that the US was on the gold standard and did not get off of it , " says Axel Merk , president of Merk Hard Currency Fund in Palo Alto , Calif .
" Had they been able to lower the value of the dollar , Bernanke argues , " the officials could have reduced the hardship . "
Some investors , including Mr. Merk , are skeptical that sacrificing the dollar is beneficial to an individual 's pocketbook .
Globally , that skepticism has seeped over into the gold market and is one reason the price of gold is now above $ 732 a troy ounce , a 27 - year high .
So far this year , gold is up about 15 percent .
" Gold appreciates as the dollar declines , " says Merk .
So far the weak dollar has not kept investors from buying stocks , bonds , and real estate .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 10.5 percent year - to - date and the Standard & Poor 's 500 index is up 7.1 percent year - to - date .
" You could argue it 's a problem if there is a rout of the dollar and it affects stock prices , " says Zandi .
" But we are not there yet , and as long as the decline is orderly , it is one of the key conduits which helps ease the problem . "

Back in January 2005 , I announced on the O’Reilly blog that I was going to completely scrap over 100,000 lines of messy PHP code in my existing CD Baby ( cdbaby.com ) website , and rewrite the entire thing in Rails , from scratch .
I hired one of the best Rails programmers in the world ( Jeremy Kemper aka bitsweat ) , and we set off on this huge task with intensity …
Two years (! ) later , after various setbacks , we were less than halfway done …
I said fuckit , and we abandoned the Rails rewrite …
Then in a mere TWO MONTHS , by myself , not even telling anyone I was doing this , using nothing but vi , and no frameworks , I rewrote CD Baby from scratch in PHP .
Done !
Launched !
And it works amazingly well .
Expecting a plug for a book about the latest miracle cure for project failure blues ?
Nope , sometimes the technical whizzies blind us to basic , fundamental wisdom that is as true today as it was twenty or even forty years ago .
Do n’t believe the hype .
For a solid grounding on how to successfully develop software , start with The Mythical Man-Month : Essays on Software Engineering .
It is one of the most important books ever written about developing software , from the small to the large .
Read the book that spawned the expression , “ There is no silver bullet . ”
If there is one lesson to draw here it is that “ There is always more than one way to look at any issue . ”
Oh dear , the latest nine days wonder seems shocking on the face of it .
To quote the protagonist in the tale : There has been a running flamestorm over this , mostly centered on whether Rails is or is n’t the perfect framework for web applications .
In other words , there is a prevailing sentiment that this rewrite failed for technical reasons .
I have my own experience with project failure , and I can’t blame any of it for technical problems .
This is because , in my experience , the technical problems in projects are not root causes , they are symptoms of people and management problems .
Amazingly , Chad Fowler identified six reasons that big rewrites of production systems fail .
Given that opinions are like noses ( everybody has one ) , what ’s so amazing about Chad ’s list ?
What ’s amazing is that Chad wrote his list a year ago , and yet he thoroughly nailed Derek ’s experience .
I ’ll bring up his first reason , Software as Spec .
Re-read the condensed story above .
Note , with horror , that a Rails expert took two years to fail what Derek accomplished in just two months .
Well , if Jeremy could n’t do it , obviously Rails is seriously broken , a complete toy .
But this is like a sleight - of - hand trick .
The paragraphs tell two stories , and we are so focused on one , “ Two years for Rails , two months for PHP , ” that we ignore the prestidigitator ’s other story : Two years for Jeremy , two months for Derek .
This is a complex , production system .
When writing any complex , production system , what is the number one biggest risk ?
No , not technical risk .
Requirements risk .
Jeremy tried to create a copy of an existing , messy production system .
Sure , he had Derek pulling the strings and calling the shots .
But this is no guarantee of success , especially in an environment with heavy integration with other messy , chaotic systems .
Communicating requirements is hard enough in a green field situation .
It ’s nearly impossible when dealing with a real , production piece of code .
Jeremy had almost no chance if his goal was to duplicate the original system ’s functionality based on Derek ’s direction and even assistance .
Derek , on the other hand , wrote the original system .
He knows it intimately .
If there is some weird , bogus code in one corner , Derek remembers why it ’s there , what obscure bug it fixes , or perhaps what bug in some other piece of software ’s code it mediates .
If something does n’t need to be there any more , Derek knows it can be dropped and he knows why it ought to go .
Of course Derek succeeded where Jeremy failed .
Having Jeremy performing the rewrite with Derek ’s assistance created an insurmountable barrier for understanding .
Even with Derek trying to assist , the very fact that they were rewriting in Rails created a double whammy :
Derek knew the system but had to try to explain its subtleties to Jeremy .
Jeremy knew Rails but had to try to explain its subtleties to Derek .
Derek ’s two - month rewrite with the hindsight of implementing the system in the first place and then living through the first rewrite failure is easy to understand : one person knew both the system and the implementation technology intimately .
No communication barrier .
No requirements risk .
So , was the problem choosing Rails ?
Or choosing to bring in an outsider to implement a technology the insider did n’t know intimately ?
This is a false dichotomy , of course .
Failed projects may have many problems .
But when trying to simplify the situation and derive useful conclusions , my heuristic is to look for the simplest explanation , the one with the fewest moving parts .
The technology explanation is very specific and with many dangling caveats .
It only applies to projects involving rewrites from PHP to Rails , and even then only those projects that are messy and have legacy data models that are n’t particularly CRUD - dy .
The people explanation is much simpler .
It explains what we observed here as well as what we observed in many other projects , and it does so with very few caveats and conditions .
My personal heuristic is to go with the simpler explanation that applies to the widest possible set of observations in the wild .
As several people have pointed out here and elsewhere , we are working with anecdotal evidence .
And the plural of anecdote is not data .
But we must soldier on in our industry .
If we waited until we could rigorously “ prove ” anything about software development before forming conclusions , we would n’t have budged from toggling switches on front panels .
The Kyoto Protocol and the European Union ’s cap and trade program set emissions targets for countries or large companies .
Those that exceed their allowances by emitting too much carbon need to purchase carbon credits from countries or companies that do not need their allotment , or from companies like Klimafa that create credits through green projects like planting trees .
On the European Union market , carbon credits are trading at about $ 28 , with one credit countering one ton of emitted carbon dioxide .
Klimafa says its donation to the Vatican is worth about $ 130,000 .
The European Union program allows for a much - needed transfer of money from the more developed countries of Western Europe to the new economies of the East .

Countries and companies in the West tend to exceed their allowances , whereas Eastern countries tend to have excess credits to sell because so many polluting Communist - era factories have been shut .
Also , many of the former Eastern bloc countries had to decommission farmland to join the European Union in accordance with its agricultural policy .
In Hungary , as in other new member states , huge tracts of marginal fields have been bought by the government from farmers and are available for reforesting .
The land that will hold Klimafa ’s first eco-restoration project , originally called Forest Island , was cleared in the Middle Ages , though it is on a flood plain and has always been risky to farm .
The area is a mix of weeds , wetlands , a lake and a few fields of corn that farmers are planting illegally even though they no longer own the land .
Much of the land is a jumble of goldenrod and amorpha fruticosa , a weed that grows like wildfire .
Gergely Torda , a plant biologist from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences who is consulting on the project , scans the land as a blank canvas , describing plans for what will be planted where .
Later this year , Klimafa will begin clearing the weeds , using local labor , and then start environmentally sensitive planting of native saplings like willows , beeches , ash , certain poplars and oaks .
The growing forest will absorb 10 times the carbon that the land currently absorbs , and will be self - sustaining , Mr. Torda said .
Math can be terrifying for many people .
This list will hopefully improve your general knowledge of mathematical tricks and your speed when you need to do math in your head .
1. The 11 Times Trick
We all know the trick when multiplying by ten – add 0 to the end of the number , but did you know there is an equally easy trick for multiplying a two digit number by 11 ?
This is it :
Take the original number and imagine a space between the two digits ( in this example we will use 52 :
5_2
Now add the two numbers together and put them in the middle :
5 _( 5+2) _2
That is it – you have the answer : 572 .
If the numbers in the middle add up to a 2 digit number , just insert the second number and add 1 to the first :
9 _(9+9) _9
( 9+1 ) _8_9
10_8_9
1089 – It works every time .

2. Quick Square
If you need to square a 2 digit number ending in 5 , you can do so very easily with this trick .
Mulitply the first digit by itself + 1 , and put 25 on the end .
That is all !
252 = ( 2 x ( 2+1 ) ) & 25
2 x 3 = 6
625
3. Multiply by 5
Most people memorize the 5 times tables very easily , but when you get in to larger numbers it gets more complex – or does it ?
This trick is super easy .
Take any number , then divide it by 2 ( in other words , halve the number ) .
If the result is whole , add a 0 at the end .
If it is not , ignore the remainder and add a 5 at the end .
It works everytime :
2682 x 5 = ( 2682 / 2 ) & 5 or 0
2682 / 2 = 1341 ( whole number so add 0 )
13410
Let ’s try another :
5887 x 5
2943.5 ( fractional number ( ignore remainder , add 5 )
29435
4. Multiply by 9
This one is simple – to multiple any number between 1 and 9 by 9 hold both hands in front of your face – drop the finger that corresponds to the number you are multiplying ( for example 9×3 – drop your third finger ) – count the fingers before the dropped finger ( in the case of 9×3 it is 2 ) then count the numbers after ( in this case 7 ) – the answer is 27 .
5. Multiply by 4
This is a very simple trick which may appear obvious to some , but to others it is not .
The trick is to simply multiply by two , then multiply by two again :
58 x 4 = ( 58 x 2 ) + ( 58 x 2 ) = ( 116 ) + ( 116 ) = 232

6. Calculate a Tip
If you need to leave a 15 % tip , here is the easy way to do it .
Work out 10 % ( divide the number by 10 ) – then add that number to half its value and you have your answer :
15 % of $ 25 = ( 10 % of 25 ) + ( ( 10 % of 25 ) / 2 )
$ 2.50 + $ 1.25 = $ 3.75
7. Tough Multiplication
If you have a large number to multiply and one of the numbers is even , you can easily subdivide to get to the answer :
32 x 125 , is the same as :
16 x 250 is the same as :
8 x 500 is the same as :
4 x 1000 = 4,000
8. Dividing by 5
Dividing a large number by five is actually very simple .
All you do is multiply by 2 and move the decimal point :
195 / 5
Step1 : 195 * 2 = 390
Step2 : Move the decimal : 39.0 or just 39
2978 / 5
step 1 : 2978 * 2 = 5956
Step2 : 595.6
9. Subtracting from 1,000
To subtract a large number from 1,000 you can use this basic rule : subtract all but the last number from 9 , then subtract the last number from 10 :
1000
- 648
step1 : subtract 6 from 9 = 3
step2 : subtract 4 from 9 = 5
step3 : subtract 8 from 10 = 2
answer : 352
10 . Assorted Multiplication Rules
Multiply by 5 : Multiply by 10 and divide by 2 .
Multiply by 6 : Sometimes multiplying by 3 and then 2 is easy .
Multiply by 9 : Multiply by 10 and subtract the original number .
Multiply by 12 : Multiply by 10 and add twice the original number .
Multiply by 13 : Multiply by 3 and add 10 times original number .
Multiply by 14 : Multiply by 7 and then multiply by 2
Multiply by 15 : Multiply by 10 and add 5 times the original number , as above .
Multiply by 16 : You can double four times , if you want to .
Or you can multiply by 8 and then by 2 .
Multiply by 17 : Multiply by 7 and add 10 times original number .
Multiply by 18 : Multiply by 20 and subtract twice the original number ( which is obvious from the first step ) .
Multiply by 19 : Multiply by 20 and subtract the original number .
Multiply by 24 : Multiply by 8 and then multiply by 3 .
Multiply by 27 : Multiply by 30 and subtract 3 times the original number ( which is obvious from the first step ) .
Multiply by 45 : Multiply by 50 and subtract 5 times the original number ( which is obvious from the first step ) .
Multiply by 90 : Multiply by 9 ( as above ) and put a zero on the right .
Multiply by 98 : Multiply by 100 and subtract twice the original number .
Multiply by 99 : Multiply by 100 and subtract the original number .
Bonus : Percentages
Yanni in comment 23 gave an excellent tip for working out percentages , so I have taken the liberty of duplicating it here :
Find 7 % of 300 .
Sound Difficult ?
Percents :
First of all you need to understand the word “ Percent . ”
The first part is PER , as in 10 tricks per listverse page .
PER = FOR EACH .
The second part of the word is CENT , as in 100 .
Like Century = 100 years .
100 CENTS in 1 dollar … etc. Ok… so PERCENT = For Each 100 .
So , it follows that 7 PERCENT of 100 , is 7 .
( 7 for each hundred , of only 1 hundred ) .
8 % of 100 = 8 . 35.73 % of 100 = 35.73
But how is that useful ??
Back to the 7 % of 300 question .
7 % of the first hundred is 7 .
7 % of 2nd hundred is also 7 , and yep , 7 % of the 3rd hundred is also 7 .
So 7+7+7 = 21 .
If 8 % of 100 is 8 , it follows that 8 % of 50 is half of 8 , or 4 .
Break down every number that ’s asked into questions of 100 , if the number is less then 100 , then move the decimal point accordingly .
EXAMPLES :
8%200 = ? 8 + 8 = 16 .
8%250 = ? 8 + 8 + 4 = 20 .
8%25 = 2.0 ( Moving the decimal back ) .
15%300 = 15+15+15 =45 .
15%350 = 15+15+15+7.5 = 52.5
Also it ’s usefull to know that you can always flip percents , like 3 % of 100 is the same as 100 % of 3 .
35 % of 8 is the same as 8 % of 35 .

“ I was born in 1953 .
Like the rest of my generation , I took the America I grew up in for granted – in fact , like many in my generation I railed against the very real injustices of our society , marched against the bombing of Cambodia , went door to door for liberal candidates .
It ’s only in retrospect that the political and economic environment of my youth stands revealed as a paradise lost , an exceptional episode in our nation ’s history . ”
That ’s the opening paragraph of my new book , The Conscience of a Liberal .
It ’s a book about what has happened to the America I grew up in and why , a story that I argue revolves around the politics and economics of inequality .
I ’ve given this New York Times blog the same name , because the politics and economics of inequality will , I expect , be central to many of the blog posts – although I also expect to be posting on a lot of other issues , from health care to high - speed Internet access , from productivity to poll analysis .
Many of the posts will be supplements to my regular columns ; I ’ll be using this space to present the kind of information I can’t provide on the printed page – especially charts and tables , which are crucial to the way I think about most of the issues I write about .
In fact , let me start this blog off with a chart that ’s central to how I think about the big picture , the underlying story of what ’s really going on in this country .
The chart shows the share of the richest 10 percent of the American population in total income – an indicator that closely tracks many other measures of economic inequality – over the past 90 years , as estimated by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez .
I ’ve added labels indicating four key periods .
These are :
The Long Gilded Age : Historians generally say that the Gilded Age gave way to the Progressive Era around 1900 .
In many important ways , though , the Gilded Age continued right through to the New Deal .
As far as we can tell , income remained about as unequally distributed as it had been the late 19th century – or as it is today .
Public policy did little to limit extremes of wealth and poverty , mainly because the political dominance of the elite remained intact ; the politics of the era , in which working Americans were divided by racial , religious , and cultural issues , have recognizable parallels with modern politics .
The Great Compression :
The middle - class society I grew up in did n’t evolve gradually or automatically .
It was created , in a remarkably short period of time , by FDR and the New Deal .
As the chart shows , income inequality declined drastically from the late 1930s to the mid 1940s , with the rich losing ground while working Americans saw unprecedented gains .
Economic historians call what happened the Great Compression , and it ’s a seminal episode in American history .
Middle class America :
That ’s the country I grew up in .
It was a society without extremes of wealth or poverty , a society of broadly shared prosperity , partly because strong unions , a high minimum wage , and a progressive tax system helped limit inequality .
It was also a society in which political bipartisanship meant something : in spite of all the turmoil of Vietnam and the civil rights movement , in spite of the sinister machinations of Nixon and his henchmen , it was an era in which Democrats and Republicans agreed on basic values and could cooperate across party lines .
The great divergence : Since the late 1970s the America I knew has unraveled .
We ’re no longer a middle - class society , in which the benefits of economic growth are widely shared : between 1979 and 2005 the real income of the median household rose only 13 percent , but the income of the richest 0.1 % of Americans rose 296 percent .
Most people assume that this rise in inequality was the result of impersonal forces , like technological change and globalization .
But the great reduction of inequality that created middle - class America between 1935 and 1945 was driven by political change ; I believe that politics has also played an important role in rising inequality since the 1970s .
It ’s important to know that no other advanced economy has seen a comparable surge in inequality – even the rising inequality of Thatcherite Britain was a faint echo of trends here .
On the political side , you might have expected rising inequality to produce a populist backlash .
Instead , however , the era of rising inequality has also been the era of “ movement conservatism , ” the term both supporters and opponents use for the highly cohesive set of interlocking institutions that brought Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich to power , and reached its culmination , taking control of all three branches of the federal government , under George W. Bush .
( Yes , Virginia , there is a vast right - wing conspiracy . )
Because of movement conservative political dominance , taxes on the rich have fallen , and the holes in the safety net have gotten bigger , even as inequality has soared .
And the rise of movement conservatism is also at the heart of the bitter partisanship that characterizes politics today .
Why did this happen ?
Well , that ’s a long story – in fact , I ’ve written a whole book about it , and also about why I believe America is ready for a big change in direction .
For now , though , the important thing is to realize that the story of modern America is , in large part , the story of the fall and rise of inequality .
There is obviously no way to know what home prices will do in the next few years .
But there are two big reasons to doubt the real estate boosters who insist that it ’s once again a great time to buy .
The first is history .
After the last big run-up in house prices , in the 1980s , a long slump followed .
In the New York area , prices peaked in early 1989 and then fell 9 percent over the next three years , according to government data .
( Adjusted for inflation , the drop was much bigger . )
Not until 1998 did prices pass their earlier peak .
Keep in mind that the 2000 - 5 boom was even bigger than the ’ 80s boom and that house prices on the coasts , according to the official numbers at least , have fallen only slightly so far .
So it is hard to imagine that prices will rise 5 percent a year , or another 28 percent in all , over the next five years .
The second reason for skepticism is that buying has never been quite as beneficial as Realtors — and mortgage brokers , home builders and everybody else who makes money off home purchases — have made it out to be .
Buyers have to pay property taxes on top of their mortgage , while renters have the taxes included in their monthly rent bill .
Buyers also face thousands of dollars in closing costs ( and , in Manhattan , co-op charges ) .
Renters , meanwhile , can invest what they would have spent on closing costs and a down payment in the stock market , which has n’t exactly delivered a bad return over the last 20 years .
And that famous mortgage - interest tax deduction ?
Yes , it reduces the borrowing costs that come with a mortgage , but it does n’t eliminate them .
Renters do n’t face any such borrowing costs .
Almost two years ago , I interviewed a thoughtful 37 - year - old man named Tchaka Owen , who happens to be a real estate agent .
( Whatever the sins of the Realtors ’ association , there are a lot of smart , helpful agents out there .
Just remember that they have a financial interest in getting you to buy a house . )
Mr. Owen and his girlfriend , Polly Thompson , had recently moved from the Washington suburbs to the Miami area and decided to rent a two - bedroom apartment with spectacular bay views .
“ You can get so much more for your money , renting instead of buying , ” he said at the time .

Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) asked Army Lt. Gen. David H .
Petraeus during his confirmation hearing yesterday if Senate resolutions condemning White House Iraq policy " would give the enemy some comfort . "
Petraeus agreed they would , saying , " That 's correct , sir . "

I hope that this colloquy has not entrapped you into some responses that you might later regret .
I wonder if you would just give me the assurance that you 'll go back and examine the transcript as to what you replied with respect to certain of these questions and review it , because we want you to succeed .
propriety
There 's really nothing that 's occurred since the invasion and occupation that was not predictable and in fact , most of it was predicted .
It was predicted in many cases by people with long backgrounds in national security ... and in many cases there were people who saw their military careers destroyed and who were personally demeaned by people who opposed them on the issues , including members of this administration .
And they are people in my judgment , who will be remembered in history as having had a moral conscience .

debate
Joe Lieberman has probably become the single most poisonous Beltway voice when it comes to the war in Iraq .
The Bush administration 's principal rhetorical tactic for the last five years , of course , has been to equate opposition to its policies and criticism of the Leader with love of the Terrorists .
But when it comes to the debate over Iraq , Lieberman -- time and again -- has managed to descend even further into the rhetorical sewer than the administration itself .
Lieberman , of course , spent several years warning Americans not to criticize their Leader with regard to the War .
Just two weeks ago , Lieberman went onand prompted an angry outburst from Chuck Hagel after Lieberman sat there smugly accusing Hagel and anyone else who opposes the Glorious Surge of wanting the U.S. to lose in Iraq .
In the same appearance , Lieberman also looked straight into the camera and said that the U.S. was " attacked on 9/11 by the same enemy that we ’re fighting in Iraq today " -- a claim so transparently false that even the President long ago abandoned it But yesterday , Lieberman reached what might be a new low .
During the confirmation hearings of Gen. David Petraeus , Lieberman provoked this truly reprehensible exchange with Gen. Petraeus , as summarized by 's Thomas Ricks : Using the terms to " give comfort " and the " enemy " in the same phrase has no conceivable objective other than to invoke accusations of treason .
The Constitution 's definition of " treason " is exactly that -- giving " Aid and Comfort " to the enemy .
For Lieberman to purposely track the Constitution 's treason language when describing opponents of the " surge " plan -- and to invite the new Iraq War Commander to agree with his accusation -- reveals so inescapably what Lieberman is .
That 's just the basest and most despicable smear one can imagine .
also re-prints the response to this exchange from Sen.
John Warner -- who , as a newly announced surge opponent and co-sponsor of one of the enemy - comforting resolutions in question , is now one of the many whom Lieberman is accusing of being " some " type of a traitor .
Warner warned Petraeus of how ill - advised it is for Petraeus to associate himself with the toxic sentiments of Joe Lieberman : Warner 's response illustrates an interesting point .
War opponents have been the target of smears of this type for years , beginning in 2002 when the country became intoxicated with Iraq war fever and every war opponent had their character attacked and motives called into question .
Nobody seemed to mind too much back then .
But now the Washington Establishment has arrogated unto itself the right to oppose the war and criticize the President .
As a result , many of the same groups and even same individuals who spent the last three years accusing war opponents of " undermining the Commander - in - Chief in a time of war " and thereby weakening America have themselves become vocal war opponents as the war lay in ruins ( though it should be noted , from what I can tell , that Sen .
Warner himself never engaged in that sort of smearing rhetoric and even expressly opposed it , one of the very few in his Party who did ) .
What was subversive and unserious in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 has now become perfectly acceptable , even noble , among the elite political and journalist classes .
The Washington Establishment has not only changed its view on the war , but has also -- not coincidentally -- dramatically changed its view on theof opposing the President and his war , i.e. whether it 's now allowed to do so .
As the superb Jim Webb recently told Robert Gates at a recent Senate hearing : To Joe Lieberman , anyone who opposes whatever Iraq plan he happens to be currently favoring is a frivolous , defeat - hungry traitor -- giving " some comfort " to the " enemy . "
He 's really the Senate 's modern - day Joe McCarthy , smearing everyone 's character and impugning everyone 's motives who does n't march faithfully along behind the President .
What makes it all the more deceitful is that he never ceases to piously masquerade around as the Beacon of Civility and Honor , a disguise long propped up by an adoring Beltway media .
But now , Lieberman 's behavior has become so toxic and ignoble that even decorous , restrained Senate Republicans -- no strangers to the art of the political smear -- have begun condemning him in unusually strong terms .
What is more pernicious than for a politician , in a Senate hearing with the country 's new top General in Iraq , to expressly equate disagreement with their war views with treason ?
Not much . :
Relating to the last point about the shift in the rules imposed by the Washington Establishment , 's Glenn Kessler this morning identifies numerous inconsistencies and incoherent claims in the President 's speech last night .
In particular , Kessler documents that " President Bush presented an arguably misleading and often flawed description of ' the enemy ' that the United States faces overseas , lumping together disparate groups with opposing ideologies to suggest that they have a single - minded focus in attacking the United States .
" Kessler 's points are all correct and well - stated , but the article nonetheless provokes mixed feelings .
None of the manipulative falsehoods which Kessler criticizes are new .
These are the same tactics the administration has been using continuously for the last six years to bludgeon all of its opponents and to render all opposition subversive and pro-terrorist .
And while it is encouraging , I guess , that the media is beginning to point out these fundamental flaws more expressly , it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that this scrutiny is due more to the President 's pervasive unpopularity than it is to any re-awakening by national journalists with regard to their responsibilities .
Kicking a President with Nixon - level approval ratings is easy .
Americans have already figured out that the President is a fraud .
The real need for this scrutiny was back when 70 % of Americans cheered on the invasion -- and the subsequent occupation -- because they had been led to believe that it was Saddam who helped fly those planes into the buildings along with his good friend , Osama bin Laden .
Several people in comments have noted that other media outlets have quoted Lieberman 's question to Petraeus differently than it was quoted by Thomas Ricks in -- specifically , some media outlets quote Lieberman as asking whether the resolutions would " give the enemy some " ( and not , as Ricks had it , " comfort " to the enemy ) .
But Sarah Wheaton , on herblog The Caucus , also quotes Lieberman 's question as asking whether the resolutions “ would give the enemy some comfort ” ( though it 's possible she was using Ricks ' article as her source for that ) .
I have n't found anything definitive yet , but I did receive an e-mail from a very reliable source from a well - known political / media group ( whom I 'll identify once I get permission ) , and he advises me that he obtained and listened to the video of the hearings and Lieberman used the word " encouragement " and Ricks therefore misquoted Lieberman .
If that is so , then Lieberman 's smear here is just the standard , garden - variety one used by war advocates to equate war opposition with helping The Terrorists , and not the more extraordinary version that purposely tracks the treason language from the Constitution .
Once I have something more definitive one way or the other , I will post it . : Whether Lieberman accused " surge " opponents of giving " comfort " to the enemy or merely " encouraging " them ( and it looks increasingly like it was " encouragmenet , " though still nothing truly definitive ) , Chuck Hagel 's impassioned response applies just as potently -- not only to Lieberman , but to all of those war supporters who think that what is one of our country 's greatest strengths -- the fact that weimportant issues , rather than meekly submit to the Leader 's will -- is something we should suppress because the Terrorists are emboldened by our disagreements .
The oldest age at death for humans has been rising for more than a century and shows no signs of leveling off , according to a demographer at the University of California , Berkeley .
This new finding , based on Swedish national death records for each year since 1861 , calls into question the belief by many scientists that the human life span has a set end - point of 120 years .
In research published today in Science , the nation 's premier science journal , UC Berkeley associate professor of demography John Wilmoth and his colleagues in Sweden and the United States show that , in the1860s in Sweden , the oldest ages at death for men and women centered around 101 .
That average maximum age moved up slowly throughout the century to about 105 in the 1960s and then accelerated to 108 in the 1990s .
" We have shown that the maximum life span is changing .
It is not a biological constant .
Whether or not this can go on indefinitely is difficult to say .
There is no hint yet that the upward trend is slowing down , " said Wilmoth .
Wilmoth said that Swedish demographic statistics - considered the world 's best records on birth and death - are a good indication of patterns in other industrialized nations , where it has become commonplace to survive to a very old age .
But until now , there has been no evidence that the maximum age at death was being pushed back , leading to a lengthening of the human life span , said Wilmoth .
" Human progress is real , somehow , " he said .
" We are changing the limits of the human life span over time . "
advertisement
For individuals alive now , the current life span makes it rare to live past 110 years , said Wilmoth .
" But future generations could have a higher range . "
Such statements run counter to recent predictions by other experts in the field who theorize that the human life span is biologically limited to 115 or 120 years .
" Those numbers are out of thin air , " said Wilmoth .
" There is no scientific basis on which to estimate a fixed upper limit .
Whether 115 or 120 years , it is a legend created by scientists who are quoting each other . "
Historical records , on the other hand , show that the entire configuration of ages at death in Sweden has been shifting upward for 138 years , he said .
The upward trend accelerated suddenly around 1970 , more than doubling the rate at which the life span was growing , from less than one year of age for every two decades to more than one year per decade .
This has happened because of medical and public health advances throughout the century , said Wilmoth , whose analysis ruled out simple population growth as a factor .
Some scientists had thought that the increased number of very old people could be due to a larger population base , but Wilmoth 's data show that the main cause is increased survival after age 70 .
Earlier in the century , the lengthened life span was probably due to public health measures such as better sanitation , a safer water supply and control of infectious diseases .
advertisement
While it is well known that these measures increased life expectancy - the average age at death - especially by lowering child mortality , Wilmoth believes that better public health also increased the maximum age at death by creating a healthier population in old age .
" The elderly today are benefiting from the fact they were not as sick when they were children as in past generations , and these changes took place 80 to 100 years ago , " he said .
As for the spurt upward in 1970 , Wilmoth 's data shows that survival after 70 was due overwhelmingly to improved medical practice concerning heart disease , stroke , smoking cessation , and the development of new drugs .
" After 1970 , the trend began to slope upward rapidly , " said Wilmoth .
" That corresponds closely with breakthroughs in certain medical practices such as understanding and treating heart disease and stroke . "
Wilmoth also analyzed the age at death for the individual who lived the longest from each yearly birth cohort between 1756 and 1884 and found a similar upward trend in the life span .
The longest - lived person born in 1756 , for instance died in 1857 at the age of 101 , while the longest - lived person born in 1884 died in 1993 at the age of 109 .
As in most other demographic data , men had a slightly lower maximum life span than did women , but the gender difference was much smaller than with life expectancy .
Life expectancy is the average age to which people are expected to live when they are born .
Men in the United States can expect to live , on average , to age 72 while women live to 79 , a difference of about seven years .
But in great old age , the gender difference shrank to less than two years in Sweden 's records on maximum age .
In the world today , said Wilmoth , " there are currently about two dozen documented cases of people over 110 years of age - a handful of men and a few handfuls of women . "
The upper limbs are relatively primitive
In the journal Nature , the researchers outline details of the partial skeletons uncovered in a Medieval town .
The bones reveal a mixture of primitive and advanced features , team leader David Lordkipanidze explained .
These early hominids may have been among the first to leave Africa to colonise the rest of the world .
" They are the earliest , undisputable hominids outside of Africa , " Dr Lordkipanidze said .
" We are dating them between 1.7 and 1.8 million years old .
They are the most complete collection of a Homo [ species ] from any site older than 300,000 years old , " he told the BBC's Science In Action programme .
Ancient pioneers
Discovered in the early 1990s , the Dmanisi site has proved a rich source of remains and artefacts from the dawn of the Pleistocene Epoch .
Studying the various skulls and jaws has given scientists important information about the early species that lived here .
But , until now , they had little information about the rest of the skeleton .
The remains uncovered at the town of Dmanisi consist of the partial skeleton of an adolescent individual associated with a skull , and the " post - cranial " remains of three adults .
In many respects , the well - preserved fossils resemble Homo erectus , a species from the genus Homo that first appeared in Africa some two million years ago and quickly spread throughout Europe and much of Asia .
They have remarkably human - like spines and lower limbs that would have been well suited for long distance travel .
Their feet had well - developed arches .
An apparently small difference in the size of males and females also puts them in the same company as Homo erectus and Homo sapiens .
Feature mix
However , they also have relatively small brains and primitive upper limbs , traits which they share with the earlier Homo habilis , and even with the more primitive Australopithecus , which first appeared in Africa some four million years ago .
" They are smaller than what we thought Homo erectus could be , " David Lordkipanidze explained .
" They have smaller brains ; and also their body proportions , they are not completely human - like .
" In the [ Nature report ] , we showed that their legs were very human but their hands were still ape - like .
So , I would say these are quite mosaic features ; this does not fit precisely the definition of Homo erectus before the Dmanisi finds .
Maybe we are adding something new to the Homo erectus definition . "
The most famous example of Australopithecus is the so called " Lucy " specimen found in north - eastern Ethiopia in 1974 which led scientists to rethink existing theories about early human evolution .
MADISON , Wis. —
The city 's pooper scooper law applies to everyone , even police officers on mounted patrol and K - 9 unit duty — but a new statute may allow them to start leaving the evidence behind .
An ordinance amendment to be taken up Tuesday is aimed at making it easier for the city to increase its use of mounted police patrols .
Alderwomen Judy Compton and Lauren Cnare , co-sponsors of the amendment , said the change is meant to allow officers in the saddle or partnered with canines to patrol events such as University of Wisconsin football games without having to stop to pick up droppings like civilian pet owners .
Lt. Victor Wohl , who oversees the police department 's five - dog canine unit , was n't aware of the proposed change , but he said it is n't likely to affect his officers ' work .
" The K - 9 handlers are in most instances going to pick up after their dogs , " he said .
The medal in question is a Bronze Star with Valor Device , the fourth - highest award we have for combat valor .
That " Valor Device " specifies combat valor and makes it an entirely different medal from the Bronze Star for Meritorious Conduct .
With the 101st Airborne , Petraeus received it as a Major General , in 2003 - 2004 .
It was his first combat ever .
That same year , Jeannie Hancock and her four children would receive a telephone call from General Petraeus and his condolences that she would be getting the same medal from the Army , but not the husband who had earned it posthumously - Sgt. Michael Hancock , also of the 101st .
" a kind of moral plagiarism - - a theft of other men's honor , and therefore a debasing of the coin rewarding their courage " - Lance Morrow describing the improper wearing of a Valor Device and the suicide of Admiral Jeremy Boorda .
Let me break this down for you :
To get the valor medal , General Petraeus had to be under enemy fire .
He is described to have been under enemy fire in the battle for Najaf .
The only incident of enemy fire reported near General Petraeus was on March 30th .
The descriptions of that event by the two separate journalists match perfectly - one mortar round hit between 40 and 50 meters away from Generals Petraeus and Wallace as they read a map on the hood of a Humvee .
They acted nonchalant .
The event is described in this article penned by Gregg Zoroya and Steve Komarow .
It describes one mortar round hitting at the above distance .
Komarow was embedded with V Corps , General Wallace 's command .
Pulitzer - prize - winning journalist Rick Atkinson was so close he dove between two trucks when the round hit .
He stood up quickly and got back to reporting .
We must all now depend on Atkinson to stick by his reporting as the Swiftboat is thrown into hard reverse .
Embedded with the 101st Airborne " at the elbow " of General Petraeus - a person he knew well - Atkinson describes the event in his book In The Company Of Soldiers .
He was Petraeus 's constant companion during this time .
If there was another event in Najaf , Atkinson would have described it .
And we have no reason to disbelieve his account of events of March 30 .
Then there is the Army story .
It was apparently passed around to troops to demonstrate the esprit de corps and fighting spirit of the general officers .
It is so bad , so irreconcilable with Atkinson 's detailed description of events , that when I read it I thought I was hallucinating .
So , I asked a friendly librarian to read the two descriptions and compare them .
Librarians are dignified people , but as she read , her jaw literally dropped .
When she was finished she almost started crying .
For the Army story to be true , Rick Atkinson , Pulitzer - Prize newsman , would have to have failed to notice
Bullets flying past him .
Generals , on whom he was reporting , running " towards the fight " with MPs sprinting after them .
Atkinson describes no MPs at the scene at all .
MPs fairly shoving Generals into armored vehicles to save them from their manly instincts to fight .
Atkinson would also have failed to interview Petraeus about the shoving .
Indeed , Atkinson thinks so little of the event , he does not interview Petraeus about it at all .
He would somehow have to have miscounted the number of Generals .
Get this - Atkinson would somehow have to have miscounted the number of mortar shells landing just yards away from himself .
He dove for cover when the first one hit .
But the Army suggests he somehow failed to notice a second mortar round hitting some moments later - ten meters closer .
Ridiculous .
And the Army story is gleefully described for its moral - building properties .
It is the silliest type of propaganda .
So we have two interpretations of the facts as reported .
1. Propaganda Is True
I will not recount the Army story here , but rest assured that even if the entire story were true , it would fail to rise to the level of valor under fire .
Generals running to look at things while surrounded by security is hardly combat heroism .
The military has itself shared on its websites dozens - perhaps hundreds - of the stories of people who truly deserve that medal - and rightly so .
2. Propaganda Is NOT True
And as I have diaried before , if the journalistic version is true , then it's one mortal round , 40 meters away and a claim of valor under fire is too ridiculous to stomach .
Other soldiers walk through that before breakfast .
And we have one single conclusion :
Resolved : General Petraeus is a Phony and a Propagandist
If the Army put out a phony story to make David Petraeus look like a combat hero , then he knew about it or he damn well had the responsibility to know .
For a General to allow a sham story of combat valor about himself to be circulated is to counterfeit his own honor - and debase the coin of courage .
Without honor , he is not a soldier but a fraud , a scandal , a dishonest civil servant with a gun .
His medals are lies - particularly and especially any medal for " valor " .
I do n't know General Petraeus .
I have no malice against him .
I wish he was just a soldier .
I could thank him for his service and respect him .
But I cannot help but conclude that David Petraeus has sold that service cheap - for ambition and Bush .

The reviews have been coming in for a week now , and they have been phenomenal .
Consider that according to GameRankings.com , BioShock is the 4th best game of all time .
On Metacritic , BioShock has received more perfect 100 scores than even The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time , usually the game cited as the best of all time .
Clearly , 2 K ‘s Mature - rated , failed utopia FPS is a critical smash hit .
Perhaps then there is little need for another glowing review of the game .
Except this is not a glowing review in the strictest sense , because BioShock is not exactly the masterpiece of perfection indicated by these scores .
Instead , BioShock is a wonderful game that happens to draw to light the inadequacies of the way games are typically reviewed and the inherent inconsistencies of how games are judged .
The core of the matter is that , as a pure game experience , BioShock stands tall among the best the hobby has to offer :
It is superb in its presentation from the stellar graphics to the pitch - perfect sound design including a remarkable score and some wonderful licensed music .
The excellence continues all the way to the coherent art design that makes spectacular use of art deco to evoke a mood and time .
Even minor presentation elements like the menu systems and on - screen displays are well crafted .
But beyond that BioShock contains a full and gripping plot .
In the game ’s typically thoughtful manner it is revealed in bits and pieces over time , adding an element that is essentially optional but highly rewarding .
Woven into this story is a level of complexity , a true emotional sensibility that touches that most jaded of creature , the hardcore gamer .
BioShock features engaging combat , sure , but it has considerations that go beyond the raw mechanics of the game and manage to touch the player directly and cause them to ask some real and wonderfully uncomfortable questions of themselves .
Underneath what would ordinarily be a merely competent shooter lies a less tangible but far more evocative completeness in the game design that uses the nature of player interaction to tell a story in a way that could not have been managed by other media .
This is , essentially , a shining example of what games can be .
That being said , it sounds like there is little reason to withhold a perfect score or highest possible recommendation .
And yet , there is something that nags because BioShock , for all its triumphs , is not perfect .
Technically , BioShock is well crafted but it does have some problems .
The frame rate stalls out occasionally , sometimes in predictable locations or when certain events occur .
It ’s not a slowdown issue , the game appears to lock entirely for several seconds .
There is also an infrequent but noticeable texture pop-in issue , not to mention a number of bugs that have been reported including one encountered during the playtest for this review in which a camera , used in the game to photograph foes for research points that add bonuses to combat , glitched out and covered the still - moving screen with it ’s sepia - toned filter and angled photo - frame .
There have also been reports of AI glitches with the game ’s signature foes , the Big Daddies .
All of which could be partially overlooked under the general strength of the game .
Except that it does n’t end there .
The real problem with BioShock is n’t so much a problem with 2 K ’s game itself but in what it represents as a game that is being hailed as worthy of perfect review scores .
Consider for a moment the combat and the way death is handled .
Combat in BioShock is a wonderfully rich experience that provides players with a lot of freedom to experiment , to solve problems in their own ways using the game ’s genetic powers like telekinesis , lightning bolts or mind controls .
Combined with the impressive number of available weapons and some clever environmental variables , combat can be an exciting and extremely varied undertaking .
On the other hand , combat can also be drab and repetitive because the game treats death as a minor setback rather than a serious failure .
The game is littered with Vita - Chambers that act as checkpoints liberally distributed around the game ’s undersea city setting , Rapture .
Each time you lose all your health you are sent back to the nearest activated Vita - Chamber ( they activate automatically as you pass them ) but , and this is the key , the world around you does not change .
Any damage you have dealt to foes who may have killed you remains and you suffer no penalty from loss of items , power - ups or resources .
Given enough patience , you could theoretically complete the game using only the first weapon you find , a lowly wrench used as a melee combat device .
By itself this is perhaps not a huge concern except that it does remove some of the challenge of the game .
One might argue it removes all the challenge from the game since even the toughest of battles ( excepting the final boss fight ) can be reduced to dull attrition .
Compare this with a game like Prey , whose Spirit World mechanic for handling player death worked in a similar way :
Players were whisked into a brief 30 - second mini - game before being dropped back right where they left off .
Many reviewers blasted this aspect of the game as removing all the challenge from it and rightly so .
It ’s difficult to understand then how BioShock escapes this fate or even this criticism .
But perhaps the biggest discrepancy between BioShock ’s phenomenal reviews scores and the considerable catalog of previous reviews is the omission of multiplayer .
Consider the recent FPS title Shadowrun as an example .
Shadowrun is a multiplayer - only game sharing spiritual ties with popular PC mods like Counter - Strike .
Shadowrun was almost universally panned for shipping without even a cursory campaign mode .
Note that does not mean Shadowrun cannot be played single - player , as it can but the experience is simply the multiplayer game with human opponents substituted for bots .
This is not to defend Shadowrun per se but is instead a question .
How can a FPS be clearly docked points from the final review scores for not including both a campaign and multiplayer while another FPS can carry the exact same limitation and yet be considered perfect or as near to as we bother to distinguish ?
Is it that we value single - player campaigns more highly than multiplayer experiences ?
Does it have something to do with the other limiting factors to online games like broadband internet access ?
Or maybe the only real deciding factor in a game ’s review score is the ephemeral experience it provides and everything else is just a nitpick ?
It is possible that Shadowrun and Prey are simply not as good as BioShock and therefore deserve to be valued as lesser quantities .
That being the case it would then be necessary to justify this ranking and so reviewers go in search of details they can gripe about to give weight to their scores .
But this very practice introduces the kinds of double standards cited above .
What then is the point of a review ?
Can a game paradoxically be flawed yet receive a perfect score ?
Can we ever be sure what standards are being used to rate a game ?
What feels disturbing is that for the most part it would hardly matter : Scores are arbitrary numbers , everyone knows this .
Or do they ?
Recent Gamasutra article about public relations in the game industry and interviews with irate game producers over low scores can showcase that these numbers mean something to some people .
But questions ought to be raised about what we value in a game , how we describe that value accurately and what it ought to translate to for any given gamer .
In BioShock ’s case the bottom line is this :
It is a phenomenal work of game design .
It unequivocally ought to be experienced at least once by every gamer .
That said , it is n’t without its faults and of particular concern is the overall value of the game as a purchase :
At $ 60 the game offers what is admittedly an exceptional 20 hours of entertainment for a single play through .
It may not be worth the full retail price , but one way or the other it begs to be played .
Ignore the scores if you can ; BioShock is n’t flawless but fortunately it does n’t need to be .
The value for this game lies not in the price of admission or the seamless technical experience or even the endless challenge it poses .
The value — the joy — of this game is living , for a time , within the leaky walls of Rapture .
Microsoft still is n't commenting on when a beta of Service Pack 1 for Vista will be officially released ( our money is on November ) , but the company has posted two updates that are expected to be part of that final package : the " performance and reliability " update and the " compatibility and reliability " update .
These are official releases .
The " standalone updates " have been posted to Microsoft 's support site , and users will need to validate their Vista installs via WGA to download them .
A Microsoft spokesperson would not indicate when the patches would find their way to Windows Update , but the company confirms that these are not beta releases .
We suspect that they will roll out automagically on the next Patch Tuesday , August 14 .
The quick and dirty : Explorer file transfer ( copy / move ) slowness looks to have been fixed ( finally ) , hibernate and sleep now actually work as advertised ( at least on my Toshiba R400 ) , and a load of video card support issues have been rolled up .
For those of you keeping track , the MD5 hashes on these updates match those that were leaked last week .
KB 938979 , aka the " performance and reliability " update , addresses " poor memory management performance , " as well as a handful of specific issues , including a nasty problem installing printers when User Account Control is disabled .
Also gone is the ever - so - annoying networking flaw that would strike TCP / IP dead after a computer wakes from hibernation , and offline file synchronization is reportedly fixed , according to the release notes .
The big kicker , however , is the " file transfer " problem , which Microsoft describes as follows :
When you copy or move a large file , the " estimated time remaining " takes a long time to be calculated and displayed .
Those of you who have run into this problem know it by its true description : " takes forever just to copy a few hundred megabytes of data ! "
With the patch installed , file copying is certainly faster in my testing but still does n't feel as fast as it should be .
Nevertheless , it is a major improvement in my opinion .
KB 938194 , also known as the " compatibility and reliability " update , should probably be called the " now you can play games with your computer " update .
It purports to address a handful of gaming - related problems , including compatibility issues with NVIDIA 's G80 series of cards .
The lame printer spooling bug that was afflicting many of you has also been addressed .
Look before you leap
While this is n't beta software , I 'd recommend reading both KB entries and hitting the discussion thread before installing the updates just to see what to expect and what your fellow Vista users are experiencing .
I 've had both updates running on two computers all afternoon without incident , but I will note that the compatibility update did stop my laptop from shutting down after the first install , but not after subsequent reboots .
Started with AT&T SIM inserted Inserted T - Mobile SIM , showed that it produces invalid SIM error ( expected behavior for a locked iPhone )
Connected to iPhone over SSH Transferred iPhoneSIM free unlock app over SCP Restarted SpringBoard ( iPhone default application launcher ) Ran iPhoneSIMfree app
When complete , iPhone shows that T - Mobile SIM no longer produces invalid SIM error , instead asks for activation ( expected behavior for an iPhone that has a valid SIM , but is not yet activated )

Ok , here it is , the first time on camera you 've seen a real iPhone software SIM unlocked from start to finish ( and not done with the demo app iPhoneSIM free sent out last week ) .
The last iPhoneSIM free unlock video we had only showed of the end result of a successful iPhone unlock , which took place off - camera .
This time we 're doing the entire process , which we confirmed earlier this morning , on video .
For quick reference , here are the steps we took on camera : Back on camera : activate iPhone with T - Mobile SIM using iAsign
Make test call to another phone Activate iPhone once more with AT&T SIM using iAsign Granted , we do n't expect end - users to take all these steps when unlocking their iPhone -- we just went a little overboard here so everyone can see the release software is functional , and unlocks iPhones as advertised .

AMONG European reactionaries , on left and right , it is a cherished tenet that globalisation is the enemy of decent cheese .
Not for nothing was the slogan “ McDonald 's out , let 's keep the Roquefort ” chanted when José Bové , a media - savvy French farmer , achieved worldwide fame for “ dismantling ” a half - built branch of the hamburger chain in 1999 .
Local traditions , small - scale production by hand , the use of tasty raw milk : all these good things are said to be at threat from the homogenising , cost - cutting impulses of global capitalism .
So it is striking to discover that Switzerland , home not just of serious cheese , but also of one of the world 's most protected farm sectors ( worse even than the European Union ) is taking a big bet that the future of Gruyère and Emmental is best secured by embracing international competition .
Unnoticed by the wider world , this summer saw the near - total liberalisation of Swiss - EU cheese trade .
This ended years of import barriers that doubled the cost of some EU cheese on Swiss shelves , as well as export subsidies that dumped half - priced Emmental in places like Italy ( thus , in a final lunacy , luring thrifty Swiss housewives to cross the border to buy their cheese ) .
Reduced to its essence , the Swiss bet is this : if your country is a ( very ) expensive place to make cheese , it is better to head upmarket and seek out new , rich customers than to deploy subsidies and tariffs to compete artificially on price .
What this amounts to is a hope that a focus on choosy foreign buyers may turn out to be the best way to safeguard traditional producers .
This Swiss experiment matters to the rest of Europe .
For it foreshadows , in microcosm , a bigger bet on globalisation that reformers would like to make for most European agriculture .
Swiss officials say it took ten years to swing their cheese industry behind the idea of open borders .
Mariann Fischer
Boel , the agriculture commissioner , does not have that long : in the next few months a new battle will start over reform of the much - improved , but still disgracefully lavish , common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , which accounts for almost half of the EU budget .
In recent speeches , Mrs Fischer Boel has urged food producers to focus on quality , heritage and new markets .
This summer , she told exporters that import tariffs will move in only one direction in the coming years : “ downwards ” .
Anton Brügger , a second - generation Gruyère - maker from the Sense valley , near Bern , has not forgotten a visit to Australia , when he saw hunks of Swiss Gruyère on sale for four times the price he gets from his producers ' association .
This example of globalisation did not anger him .
Instead he bought some to taste ( it was pretty good ) , and rejoiced at the power of Swiss exports .
China is a new opportunity , he thinks .
“ The Chinese will start eating cheese , that 's for sure . ”
At that point , naturally , China will start making lots of cheap cheese : it already has a growing dairy industry , making pots of money from yoghurt .
Mr Brügger 's home village of Wiler vor Holz is not a cheap place to farm .
Its dark wooden houses and barns , balconies brightened by masses of geraniums , would not shame a ski resort .
The cows wandering past his dairy , bells tonkling prettily , are fed on the purest grass and hay ( cows whose milk is destined for Gruyère or other protected Swiss cheese may not eat silage or cattle feed ) .
As a result , even the permanent whiff of cow dung that hangs in the air has an oddly pleasant , yeasty scent .
This is also the smell of Swiss taxpayers ' money at work .
State aid for maintaining the ( lovely ) landscape is everywhere .
There are subsidies for feeding cows only grass and hay , and subsidies for letting them graze outdoors in the summer ( Swiss voters are big on animal welfare , and tourists like animals ) .
Wildflower meadows , wooded riverbanks and steep fields all attract cash .
Officials insist these are payments for public goods that do not distort the market .
Their views are nowadays echoed in the EU , where cash is shifting from subsidising production to direct payments for looking after the countryside .
The whiff of free competition
The Swiss bet on globalisation does not affect trade with the EU alone .
Switzerland still slaps big tariffs on New Zealand dairy products .
But more competition will stir things up .
Aberrations like Swiss mozzarella or brie may struggle against the real thing from Italy and France .
Authenticity will come to matter more .
For years , Swiss dairymen had little incentive to improve their Appenzell or Tête de Moine , as all cheese for export was bought for a fixed price by a state - run monopoly .
It was a “ very comfortable ” life for those who were not “ champion cheesemakers ” , says one official , delicately .
More go - ahead types seethed with frustration .
The industry 's self - regulation continues for the biggest cheese varieties .
Producers ' associations , such as the one that buys Gruyère from Mr Brügger , still set production quotas for each cheesemaker .
At a regional fair , Charlemagne met an authentic free - market hero , Walter Zaugg , who escaped the “ very regulated ” Emmental market five years ago by inventing his own cheese , Flösserkäse , or “ rafter 's cheese ” .
He gave the cheese a fictitious history ( his marketing talks vaguely of cheese hidden in barrels and smuggled to market on log rafts centuries ago ) .
Inventing your own cheese is “ hard work ” , says Mr Zaugg , “ but it means freedom . ”
He now makes 200 tonnes a year , much of it exported to Germany .
Mrs Fischer
Boel likes to point out to EU farmers that the Indian middle class is growing by 35 m people , “ the population of a medium - sized European country ” , every year .
The new rich in India are hungry for exotic forms of European food and drink , she says .
India 's middle classes have already embraced McDonald's .
Will some now take to authentic Roquefort and Gruyère as well ?
If Europeans take care to export only decent , well - crafted cheese , it seems a fair bet .
German officials said they were relying largely on American and Pakistani intelligence to identify men who traveled to Waziristan , and while they declined to specify the nature of that intelligence , they said it was strong .
The amount of training under way in the tribal areas of Pakistan is difficult , if not impossible , to estimate , but intelligence officials are concerned about what they see as a trend toward terrorist groups recruiting Westerners .
In a speech in New York on Friday , the C.I.A. director , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , said , “ We do see them working to train people whom you and I would n’t raise an eyebrow about if they were getting off the plane with us at Kennedy , people whose identity makes it easier — whose persona makes it easier for them to come into America and to blend into American society . ”
The Pakistani government has recently acknowledged that Al Qaeda and other militants are operating in the tribal - controlled areas on its border with Afghanistan .
Pakistan had struck an agreement with leaders in the South Waziristan tribal area , giving groups there amnesty as long as they refrained from attacking government installations and vehicles .
But it broke down last month when the military began a new operation against the militants , which led to the capture of close to 300 Pakistani troops by the militants .
Even as Western governments and Pakistan try to crack down on terrorist training , their efforts are clashing with human rights groups in Pakistan that are pressing for the release of terrorism suspects who have been detained without being charged .
Pakistani courts recently released two Germans , who officials say they believe received explosives training in Waziristan , including a 45 - year - old gem dealer who was designated a “ potentially dangerous person ” by the German police for threatening statements he made three days after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
He is back home in Germany , where officials say he has contacts with violent Islamic cells and has made several trips to the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
He was arrested on June 18 by the Pakistani military intelligence agency , Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , as he was boarding a plane in Lahore to fly back to Germany , and remained in detention for two months until the Supreme Court ruled there was insufficient evidence to continue holding him .

There is a term for this : no -brainer !
WASHINGTON  Al Qaeda 's Internet communications system has suddenly gone dark to American intelligence after the leak of Osama bin Laden 's September 11 speech inadvertently disclosed the fact that we had penetrated the enemy 's system .
The intelligence blunder started with what appeared at the time as an American intelligence victory , namely that the federal government had intercepted , a full four days before it was to be aired , a video of Osama bin Laden 's first appearance in three years in a video address marking the sixth anniversary of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
On the morning of September 7 , the Web site of ABC News posted excerpts from the speech .
But the disclosure from ABC and later other news organizations tipped off Qaeda 's internal security division that the organization 's Internet communications system , known among American intelligence analysts as Obelisk , was compromised .
This network of Web sites serves not only as the distribution system for the videos produced by Al Qaeda 's production company , As - Sahab , but also as the equivalent of a corporate intranet , dealing with such mundane matters as expense reporting and clerical memos to mid- and lower - level Qaeda operatives throughout the world .
While intranets are usually based on servers in a discrete physical location , Obelisk is a series of sites all over the Web , often with fake names , in some cases sites that are not even known by their proprietors to have been hacked by Al Qaeda .
One intelligence officer who requested anonymity said in an interview last week that the intelligence community watched in real time the shutdown of the Obelisk system .
America 's Obelisk watchers even saw the order to shut down the system delivered from Qaeda 's internal security to a team of technical workers in Malaysia .
That was the last internal message America 's intelligence community saw .
" We saw the whole thing shut down because of this leak , " the official said .
" We lost an important keyhole into the enemy . "
By Friday evening , one of the key sets of sites in the Obelisk network , the Ekhlaas forum , was back on line .
The Ekhlaas forum is a password - protected message board used by Qaeda for recruitment , propaganda dissemination , and as one of the entrance ways into Obelisk for those operatives whose user names are granted permission .
Many of the other Obelisk sites are now offline and presumably moved to new secret locations on the World Wide Web .
The founder of a Web site known as clandestineradio.com , Nick Grace , tracked the shutdown of Qaeda 's Obelisk system in real time .
" It was both unprecedented and chilling from the perspective of a Web techie .
The discipline and coordination to take the entire system down involving multiple Web servers , hundreds of user names and passwords , is an astounding feat , especially that it was done within minutes , " Mr. Grace said yesterday .
The head of the SITE Intelligence Group , an organization that monitors Jihadi Web sites and provides information to subscribers , Rita Katz , said she personally provided the video on September 7 to the deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center , Michael Leiter .
Ms. Katz yesterday said , " We shared a copy of the transcript and the video with the U.S. government , to Michael Leiter , with the request specifically that it was important to keep the subject secret .
Then the video was leaked out .
An investigation into who downloaded the video from our server indicated that several computers with IP addresses were registered to government agencies . "
Yesterday a spokesman for the National Counterterrorism Center , Carl Kropf , denied the accusation that it was responsible for the leak .
" That 's just absolutely wrong .
The allegation and the accusation that we did that is unfounded , " he said .
The spokesman for the director of national intelligence , Ross Feinstein , yesterday also denied the leak allegation .
" The intelligence community and the ODNI senior leadership did not leak this video to the media , " he said .
Ms. Katz said , " The government leak damaged our investigation into Al Qaeda 's network .
Techniques and sources that took years to develop became ineffective .
As a result of the leak Al Qaeda changed their methods . "
Ms. Katz said she also lost potential revenue .
A former counterterrorism official , Roger Cressey , said , " If any of this was leaked for any reasons , especially political , that is just unconscionable . "
Mr. Cressey added that the work that was lost by burrowing into Qaeda 's Internet system was far more valuable than any benefit that was gained by short - circuiting Osama bin Laden 's video to the public .
While Al Qaeda still uses human couriers to move its most important messages between senior leaders and what is known as a Hawala network of lenders throughout the world to move interest - free money , more and more of the organization 's communication happens in cyber space .
" While the traditional courier based networks can offer security and anonymity , the same can be had on the Internet .
It is clear in recent years if you look at their information operations and explosion of Al Qaeda related Web sites and Web activities , the Internet has taken a primary role in their communications both externally and internally , " Mr. Grace said .

6 What Programmers Can Do
After the descriptions in the previous sections it is clear that there are many , many opportunities for programmers to influence a program 's performance , positively or negatively .
And this is for memory - related operations only .
We will proceed in covering the opportunities from the ground up , starting with the lowest levels of physical RAM access and L1 caches , up to and including OS functionality which influences memory handling .
6.1 Bypassing the Cache
When data is produced and not ( immediately ) consumed again , the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance .
This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon .
This is especially true for large data structures , like matrices , which are filled and then used later .
Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements , making caching of the writes ineffective .
For this and similar situations , processors provide support for non-temporal write operations .
Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon , so there is no reason to cache it .
These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it ; instead , the new content is directly written to memory .
This might sound expensive but it does not have to be .
The processor will try to use write - combining ( see Section 3.3.3 ) to fill entire cache lines .
If this succeeds no memory read operation is needed at all .
For the x86 and x86 - 64 architectures a number of intrinsics are provided by gcc :
#include < emmintrin.h > void _mm_stream_si32 ( int * p , int a ) ; void _mm_stream_si128 ( int * p , __m128i a ) ; void _mm_stream_pd ( double * p , __m128d a ) ; #include < xmmintrin.h > void _mm_stream_pi(__m64 * p , __m64 a ) ; void _mm_stream_ps ( float * p , __m128 a ) ; # include < ammintrin.h > void _mm_stream_sd ( double * p , __m128d a ) ; void _mm_stream_ss ( float * p , __m128 a ) ;
These instructions are used most efficiently if they process large amounts of data in one go .
Data is loaded from memory , processed in one or more steps , and then written back to memory .
The data streams  through the processor , hence the names of the intrinsics .
The memory address must be aligned to 8 or 16 bytes respectively .
In code using the multimedia extensions it is possible to replace the normal _mm_store_ * intrinsics with these non-temporal versions .
In the matrix multiplication code in Section 9.1 we do not do this since the written values are reused in a short order of time .
This is an example where using the stream instructions is not useful .
More on this code in Section 6.2.1 .
The processor 's write - combining buffer can hold requests for partial writing to a cache line for only so long .
It is generally necessary to issue all the instructions which modify a single cache line one after another so that the write - combining can actually take place .
An example for how to do this is as follows :
#include < emmintrin.h > void setbytes ( char * p , int c ) { __m128 i i = _mm_set_epi8 ( c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c , c ) ; _mm_stream_si128(( __m128i *) &p[ 0 ] , i ) ; _mm_stream_si128(( __m128i *) &p [ 16 ] , i ) ; _mm_stream_si128(( __m128i *) &p [ 32 ] , i ) ; _mm_stream_si128(( __m128i *) &p [ 48 ] , i ) ; }
Assuming the pointer p is appropriately aligned , a call to this function will set all bytes of the addressed cache line to c .
The write - combining logic will see the four generated movntdq instructions and only issue the write command for the memory once the last instruction has been executed .
To summarize , this code sequence not only avoids reading the cache line before it is written , it also avoids polluting the cache with data which might not be needed soon .
This can have huge benefits in certain situations .
An example of everyday code using this technique is the memset function in the C runtime , which should use a code sequence like the above for large blocks .
Some architectures provide specialized solutions .
The PowerPC architecture defines the dcbz instruction which can be used to clear an entire cache line .
The instruction does not really bypass the cache since a cache line is allocated for the result , but no data is read from memory .
It is more limited than the non-temporal store instructions since a cache line can only be set to all - zeros and it pollutes the cache ( in case the data is non-temporal ) , but no write - combining logic is needed to achieve the results .
To see the non-temporal instructions in action we will look at a new test which is used to measure writing to a matrix , organized as a two - dimensional array .
The compiler lays out the matrix in memory so that the leftmost ( first ) index addresses the row which has all elements laid out sequentially in memory .
The right ( second ) index addresses the elements in a row .
The test program iterates over the matrix in two ways : first by increasing the column number in the inner loop and then by increasing the row index in the inner loop .
This means we get the behavior shown in Figure 6.1 .
Figure 6.1 : Matrix Access Pattern
We measure the time it takes to initialize a 3000×3000 matrix .
To see how memory behaves , we use store instructions which do not use the cache .
On IA - 32 processors the non - temporal hint is used for this .
For comparison we also measure ordinary store operations .
The results can be seen in Table 6.1 .
Inner Loop Increment Row Column Normal 0.048s 0.127s Non-Temporal 0.048s 0.160s Table 6.1 : Timing Matrix Initialization
For the normal writes which do use the cache we see the expected result : if memory is used sequentially we get a much better result , 0.048s for the whole operation translating to about 750 MB /s , compared to the more - or - less random access which takes 0.127s ( about 280MB /s ) .
The matrix is large enough that the caches are essentially ineffective .
The part we are mainly interested in here are the writes bypassing the cache .
It might be surprising that the sequential access is just as fast here as in the case where the cache is used .
The reason for this behavior is that the processor is performing write - combining as explained above .
Additionally , the memory ordering rules for non-temporal writes are relaxed : the program needs to explicitly insert memory barriers ( sfence instructions for the x86 and x86 - 64 processors ) .
This means the processor has more freedom to write back the data and thereby using the available bandwidth as well as possible .
In the case of column - wise access in the inner loop the situation is different .
The results are significantly slower than in the case of cached accesses ( 0.16s , about 225 MB /s ) .
Here we can see that no write combining is possible and each memory cell must be addressed individually .
This requires constantly selecting new rows in the RAM chips with all the associated delays .
The result is a 25 % worse result than the cached run .
On the read side , processors , until recently , lacked support aside from weak hints using non-temporal access ( NTA ) prefetch instructions .
There is no equivalent to write - combining for reads , which is especially bad for uncacheable memory such as memory - mapped I/O. Intel , with the SSE4.1 extensions , introduced NTA loads .
They are implemented using a small number of streaming load buffers ; each buffer contains a cache line .
The first movntdqa instruction for a given cache line will load a cache line into a buffer , possibly replacing another cache line .
Subsequent 16 - byte aligned accesses to the same cache line will be serviced from the load buffer at little cost .
Unless there are other reasons to do so , the cache line will not be loaded into a cache , thus enabling the loading of large amounts of memory without polluting the caches .
The compiler provides an intrinsic for this instruction :
#include < smmintrin.h > __m128i _mm_stream_load_si128 ( __m128i * p ) ;
This intrinsic should be used multiple times , with addresses of 16 - byte blocks passed as the parameter , until each cache line is read .
Only then should the next cache line be started .
Since there are a few streaming read buffers it might be possible to read from two memory locations at once .
What we should take away from this experiment is that modern CPUs very nicely optimize uncached write and ( more recently ) read accesses as long as they are sequential .
This knowledge can come in very handy when handling large data structures which are used only once .
Second , caches can help to cover up some — but not all — of the costs of random memory access .
Random access in this example is 70 % slower due to the implementation of RAM access .
Until the implementation changes , random accesses should be avoided whenever possible .
In the section about prefetching we will again take a look at the non-temporal flag .
6.2 Cache Access
The most important improvements a programmer can make with respect to caches are those which affect the level 1 cache .
We will discuss it first before including the other levels .
Obviously , all the optimizations for the level 1 cache also affect the other caches .
The theme for all memory access is the same : improve locality ( spatial and temporal ) and align the code and data .
6.2.1 Optimizing Level 1 Data Cache Access
In section Section 3.3 we have already seen how much the effective use of the L1d cache can improve performance .
In this section we will show what kinds of code changes can help to improve that performance .
Continuing from the previous section , we first concentrate on optimizations to access memory sequentially .
As seen in the numbers of Section 3.3 , the processor automatically prefetches data when memory is accessed sequentially .
The example code used is a matrix multiplication .
We use two square matrices of 1000 ×1000 double elements .
For those who have forgotten the math , given two matrices A and B with elements a ij and b ij with 0 ≤ i , j < N the product is
A straight - forward C implementation of this can look like this :
for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; ++j ) for ( k = 0 ; k < N ; ++k ) res [ i ] [ j ] += mul1 [ i ] [ k ] * mul2 [ k ] [j ] ;
The two input matrices are mul1 and mul2 .
The result matrix res is assumed to be initialized to all zeroes .
It is a nice and simple implementation .
But it should be obvious that we have exactly the problem explained in Figure 6.1 .
While mul1 is accessed sequentially , the inner loop advances the row number of mul2 .
That means that mul1 is handled like the left matrix in Figure 6.1 while mul2 is handled like the right matrix .
This can not be good .
There is one possible remedy one can easily try .
Since each element in the matrices is accessed multiple times it might be worthwhile to rearrange ( transpose ,  in mathematical terms ) the second matrix mul2 before using it .
After the transposition ( traditionally indicated by a superscript ‘ T ’ ) we now iterate over both matrices sequentially .
As far as the C code is concerned , it now looks like this :
double tmp [ N ] [ N ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; ++j ) tmp [ i ] [ j ] = mul2 [ j ] [ i ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i ) for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; ++j ) for ( k = 0 ; k < N ; ++k ) res [ i ] [ j ] += mul1 [ i ] [ k ] * tmp[j ] [ k ] ;
We create a temporary variable to contain the transposed matrix .
This requires touching more memory , but this cost is , hopefully , recovered since the 1000 non-sequential accesses per column are more expensive ( at least on modern hardware ) .
Time for some performance tests .
The results on a Intel Core 2 with 2666MHz clock speed are ( in clock cycles ) :
Original Transposed Cycles 16,765,297,870 3,922,373,010 Relative 100 % 23.4 %
Through the simple transformation of the matrix we can achieve a 76.6 % speed - up !
The copy operation is more than made up .
The 1000 non-sequential accesses really hurt .
The next question is whether this is the best we can do .
We certainly need an alternative method anyway which does not require the additional copy .
We will not always have the luxury to be able to perform the copy : the matrix can be too large or the available memory too small .
The search for an alternative implementation should start with a close examination of the math involved and the operations performed by the original implementation .
Trivial math knowledge allows us to see that the order in which the additions for each element of the result matrix are performed is irrelevant as long as each addend appears exactly once .
{ We ignore arithmetic effects here which might change the occurrence of overflows , underflows , or rounding .}
This understanding allows us to look for solutions which reorder the additions performed in the inner loop of the original code .
Now let us examine the actual problem in the execution of the original code .
The order in which the elements of mul2 are accessed is : ( 0,0 ) , ( 1,0 ) , … , ( N - 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , ( 1,1 ) , ….
The elements ( 0,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) are in the same cache line but , by the time the inner loop completes one round , this cache line has long been evicted .
For this example , each round of the inner loop requires , for each of the three matrices , 1000 cache lines ( with 64 bytes for the Core 2 processor ) .
This adds up to much more than the 32 k of L1d available .
But what if we handle two iterations of the middle loop together while executing the inner loop ?
In this case we use two double values from the cache line which is guaranteed to be in L1d .
We cut the L1d miss rate in half .
That is certainly an improvement , but , depending on the cache line size , it still might not be as good as we can get it .
The Core 2 processor has a L1d cache line size of 64 bytes .
The actual value can be queried using
sysconf ( _SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE )
at runtime or using the getconf utility from the command line so that the program can be compiled for a specific cache line size .
With sizeof ( double ) being 8 this means that , to fully utilize the cache line , we should unroll the middle loop 8 times .
Continuing this thought , to effectively use the res matrix as well , i.e. , to write 8 results at the same time , we should unroll the outer loop 8 times as well .
We assume here cache lines of size 64 but the code works also well on systems with 32 - byte cache lines since both cache lines are also 100 % utilized .
In general it is best to hardcode cache line sizes at compile time by using the getconf utility as in :
gcc - DCLS=$( getconf LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE ) ...
If the binaries are supposed to be generic , the largest cache line size should be used .
With very small L1ds this might mean that not all the data fits into the cache but such processors are not suitable for high - performance programs anyway .
The code we arrive at looks something like this :
# define SM ( CLS / sizeof ( double ) ) for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i += SM ) for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; j += SM ) for ( k = 0 ; k < N ; k += SM ) for ( i2 = 0 , rres = &res [ i ] [ j ] , rmul1 = & mul1 [ i ] [k ] ; i2 < SM ; ++i2 , rres += N , rmul1 += N ) for ( k2 = 0 , rmul2 = & mul2 [ k ] [j ] ; k2 < SM ; ++k2 , rmul2 += N ) for ( j2 = 0 ; j2 < SM ; ++ j2 ) rres [ j2 ] += rmul1 [ k2 ] * rmul2 [ j2 ] ;
This looks quite scary .
To some extent it is but only because it incorporates some tricks .
The most visible change is that we now have six nested loops .
The outer loops iterate with intervals of SM ( the cache line size divided by sizeof ( double ) ) .
This divides the multiplication in several smaller problems which can be handled with more cache locality .
The inner loops iterate over the missing indexes of the outer loops .
There are , once again , three loops .
The only tricky part here is that the k2 and j2 loops are in a different order .
This is done since , in the actual computation , only one expression depends on k2 but two depend on j2 .
The rest of the complication here results from the fact that gcc is not very smart when it comes to optimizing array indexing .
The introduction of the additional variables rres , rmul1 , and rmul2 optimizes the code by pulling common expressions out of the inner loops , as far down as possible .
The default aliasing rules of the C and C++ languages do not help the compiler making these decisions ( unless restrict is used , all pointer accesses are potential sources of aliasing ) .
This is why Fortran is still a preferred language for numeric programming : it makes writing fast code easier .
{ In theory the restrict keyword introduced into the C language in the 1999 revision should solve the problem .
Compilers have not caught up yet , though .
The reason is mainly that too much incorrect code exists which would mislead the compiler and cause it to generate incorrect object code.}
How all this work pays off can be seen in Table 6.2 .
Original Transposed Sub-Matrix Vectorized Cycles 16,765,297,870 3,922,373,010 2,895,041,480 1,588,711,750 Relative 100 % 23.4 % 17.3 % 9.47 % Table 6.2 : Matrix Multiplication Timing
By avoiding the copying we gain another 6.1 % of performance .
Plus , we do not need any additional memory .
The input matrices can be arbitrarily large as long as the result matrix fits into memory as well .
This is a requirement for a general solution which we have now achieved .
There is one more column in Table 6.2 which has not been explained .
Most modern processors nowadays include special support for vectorization .
Often branded as multi-media extensions , these special instructions allow processing of 2 , 4 , 8 , or more values at the same time .
These are often SIMD ( Single Instruction , Multiple Data ) operations , augmented by others to get the data in the right form .
The SSE2 instructions provided by Intel processors can handle two double values in one operation .
The instruction reference manual lists the intrinsic functions which provide access to these SSE2 instructions .
If these intrinsics are used the program runs another 7.3 % ( relative to the original ) faster .
The result is a program which runs in 10 % of the time of the original code .
Translated into numbers which people recognize , we went from 318 MFLOPS to 3.35 GFLOPS .
Since we are here only interested in memory effects here , the program code is pushed out into Section 9.1 .
It should be noted that , in the last version of the code , we still have some cache problems with mul2 ; prefetching still will not work .
But this cannot be solved without transposing the matrix .
Maybe the cache prefetching units will get smarter to recognize the patterns , then no additional change would be needed .
3.19 GFLOPS on a 2.66 GHz processor with single - threaded code is not bad , though .
What we optimized in the example of the matrix multiplication is the use of the loaded cache lines .
All bytes of a cache line are always used .
We just made sure they are used before the cache line is evacuated .
This is certainly a special case .
It is much more common to have data structures which fill one or more cache lines where the program uses only a few members at any one time .
In Figure 3.11 we have already seen the effects of large structure sizes if only few members are used .
Figure 6.2 : Spreading Over Multiple Cache Lines
Figure 6.2 shows the results of yet another set of benchmarks performed using the by now well - known program .
This time two values of the same list element are added .
In one case , both elements are in the same cache line ; in the other case , one element is in the first cache line of the list element and the second is in the last cache line .
The graph shows the slowdown we are experiencing .
Unsurprisingly , in all cases there are no negative effects if the working set fits into L1d .
Once L1d is no longer sufficient , penalties are paid by using two cache lines in the process instead of one .
The red line shows the data when the list is laid out sequentially in memory .
We see the usual two step patterns : about 17 % penalty when the L2 cache is sufficient and about 27 % penalty when the main memory has to be used .
In the case of random memory accesses the relative data looks a bit different .
The slowdown for working sets which fit into L2 is between 25 % and 35 % .
Beyond that it goes down to about 10 % .
This is not because the penalties get smaller but , instead , because the actual memory accesses get disproportionally more costly .
The data also shows that , in some cases , the distance between the elements does matter .
The Random 4 CLs curve shows higher penalties because the first and fourth cache lines are used .
An easy way to see the layout of a data structure compared to cache lines is to use the pahole program ( see [ dwarves ] ) .
This program examines the data structures defined in a binary .
Take a program containing this definition :
struct foo { int a ; long fill [ 7 ] ; int b ; } ;
Compiled on a 64 - bit machine , the output of pahole contains ( among other things ) the information shown in Figure 6.3 .
struct foo { int a ; /* 0 4 */ /* XXX 4 bytes hole , try to pack */ long int fill [ 7 ] ; /* 8 56 */ /* --- cacheline 1 boundary ( 64 bytes ) --- */ int b ; /* 64 4 */ } ; /* size : 72 , cachelines : 2 */ /* sum members : 64 , holes : 1 , sum holes : 4 */ /* padding : 4 */ /* last cacheline : 8 bytes */ Figure 6.3 : Output of pahole Run
This output tells us a lot .
First , it shows that the data structure uses up more than one cache line .
The tool assumes the currently - used processor 's cache line size , but this value can be overridden using a command line parameter .
Especially in cases where the size of the structure is barely over the limit of a cache line , and many objects of this type are allocated , it makes sense to seek a way to compress that structure .
Maybe a few elements can have a smaller type , or maybe some fields are actually flags which can be represented using individual bits .
In the case of the example the compression is easy and it is hinted at by the program .
The output shows that there is a hole of four bytes after the first element .
This hole is caused by the alignment requirement of the structure and the fill element .
It is easy to see that the element b , which has a size of four bytes ( indicated by the 4 at the end of the line ) , fits perfectly into the gap .
The result in this case is that the gap no longer exists and that the data structure fits onto one cache line .
The pahole tool can perform this optimization itself .
If the — reorganize parameter is used and the structure name is added at the end of the command line the output of the tool is the optimized structure and the cache line use .
Besides moving elements to fill gaps , the tool can also optimize bit fields and combine padding and holes .
For more details see [ dwarves ] .
Having a hole which is just large enough for the trailing element is , of course , the ideal situation .
For this optimization to be useful it is required that the object itself is aligned to a cache line .
We get to that in a bit .
The pahole output also makes it easier to determine whether elements have to be reordered so that those elements which are used together are also stored together .
Using the pahole tool , it is easily possible to determine which elements are in the same cache line and when , instead , the elements have to be reshuffled to achieve that .
This is not an automatic process but the tool can help quite a bit .
The position of the individual structure elements and the way they are used is important , too .
As we have seen in Section 3.5.2 the performance of code with the critical word late in the cache line is worse .
This means a programmer should always follow the following two rules :
Always move the structure element which is most likely to be the critical word to the beginning of the structure .
When accessing the data structures , and the order of access is not dictated by the situation , access the elements in the order in which they are defined in the structure .
For small structures , this means that the programmer should arrange the elements in the order in which they are likely accessed .
This must be handled in a flexible way to allow the other optimizations , such as filling holes , to be applied as well .
For bigger data structures each cache line - sized block should be arranged to follow the rules .
Reordering elements is not worth the time it takes , though , if the object itself is not aligned .
The alignment of an object is determined by the alignment requirement of the data type .
Each fundamental type has its own alignment requirement .
For structured types the largest alignment requirement of any of its elements determines the alignment of the structure .
This is almost always smaller than the cache line size .
This means even if the members of a structure are lined up to fit into the same cache line an allocated object might not have an alignment matching the cache line size .
There are two ways to ensure that the object has the alignment which was used when designing the layout of the structure :
the object can be allocated with an explicit alignment requirement .
For dynamic allocation a call to malloc would only allocate the object with an alignment matching that of the most demanding standard type ( usually long double ) .
It is possible to use posix_memalign , though , to request higher alignments .
# include < stdlib.h > int posix_memalign ( void ** memptr , size_t align , size_t size ) ;
The function stores the pointer to the newly - allocated memory in the pointer variable pointed to by memptr .
The memory block is size bytes in size and is aligned on a align - byte boundary .
For objects allocated by the compiler ( in .data , .bss , etc , and on the stack ) a variable attribute can be used : struct strtype variable __attribute ( ( aligned ( 64 ) ) ) ;
In this case the variable is aligned at a 64 byte boundary regardless of the alignment requirement of the strtype structure .
This works for global variables as well as automatic variables .
This method does not work for arrays , though .
Only the first element of the array would be aligned unless the size of each array element is a multiple of the alignment value .
It also means that every single variable must be annotated appropriately .
The use of posix_memalign is also not entirely free since the alignment requirements usually lead to fragmentation and / or higher memory consumption .
would only allocate the object with an alignment matching that of the most demanding standard type ( usually ) .
It is possible to use , though , to request higher alignments .
the alignment requirement of a type can be changed using a type attribute : struct strtype { ... members ... } __attribute ( ( aligned ( 64 ) ) ) ;
This will cause the compiler to allocate all objects with the appropriate alignment , including arrays .
The programmer has to take care of requesting the appropriate alignment for dynamically allocated objects , though .
Here once again posix_memalign must be used .
It is easy enough to use the alignof operator gcc provides and pass the value as the second parameter to posix_memalign .
The multimedia extensions previously mentioned in this section almost always require that the memory accesses are aligned .
I.e. , for 16 byte memory accesses the address is supposed to be 16 byte aligned .
The x86 and x86 - 64 processors have special variants of the memory operations which can handle unaligned accesses but these are slower .
This hard alignment requirement is nothing new for most RISC architectures which require full alignment for all memory accesses .
Even if an architecture supports unaligned accesses this is sometimes slower than using appropriate alignment , especially if the misalignment causes a load or store to use two cache lines instead of one .
Figure 6.4 : Overhead of Unaligned Accesses
Figure 6.4 shows the effects of unaligned memory accesses .
The now well - known tests which increment a data element while visiting memory ( sequentially or randomly ) are measured , once with aligned list elements and once with deliberately misaligned elements .
The graph shows the slowdown the program incurs because of the unaligned accesses .
The effects are more dramatic for the sequential access case than for the random case because , in the latter case , the costs of unaligned accesses are partially hidden by the generally higher costs of the memory access .
In the sequential case , for working set sizes which do fit into the L2 cache , the slowdown is about 300 % .
This can be explained by the reduced effectiveness of the L1 cache .
Some increment operations now touch two cache lines , and beginning work on a list element now often requires reading of two cache lines .
The connection between L1 and L2 is simply too congested .
For very large working set sizes , the effects of the unaligned access are still 20 % to 30 % — which is a lot given that the aligned access time for those sizes is long .
This graph should show that alignment must be taken seriously .
Even if the architecture supports unaligned accesses , this must not be taken as they are as good as aligned accesses .
There is some fallout from these alignment requirements , though .
If an automatic variable has an alignment requirement , the compiler has to ensure that it is met in all situations .
This is not trivial since the compiler has no control over the call sites and the way they handle the stack .
This problem can be handled in two ways :
The generated code actively aligns the stack , inserting gaps if necessary .
This requires code to check for alignment , create alignment , and later undo the alignment .
Require that all callers have the stack aligned .
All of the commonly used application binary interfaces ( ABIs ) follow the second route .
Programs will likely fail if a caller violates the rule and alignment is needed in the callee .
Keeping alignment intact does not come for free , though .
The size of a stack frame used in a function is not necessarily a multiple of the alignment .
This means padding is needed if other functions are called from this stack frame .
The big difference is that the stack frame size is , in most cases , known to the compiler and , therefore , it knows how to adjust the stack pointer to ensure alignment for any function which is called from that stack frame .
In fact , most compilers will simply round the stack frame size up and be done with it .
This simple way to handle alignment is not possible if variable length arrays ( VLAs ) or alloca are used .
In that case , the total size of the stack frame is only known at runtime .
Active alignment control might be needed in this case , making the generated code ( slightly ) slower .
On some architectures , only the multimedia extensions require strict alignment ; stacks on those architectures are always minimally aligned for the normal data types , usually 4 or 8 byte alignment for 32 - and 64 - bit architectures respectively .
On these systems , enforcing the alignment incurs unnecessary costs .
That means that , in this case , we might want to get rid of the strict alignment requirement if we know that it is never depended upon .
Tail functions ( those which call no other functions ) which do no multimedia operations do not need alignment .
Neither do functions which only call functions which need no alignment .
If a large enough set of functions can be identified , a program might want to relax the alignment requirement .
For x86 binaries gcc has support for relaxed stack alignment requirements :
- mpreferred - stack-boundary=2
If this option is given a value of N , the stack alignment requirement will be set to 2N bytes .
So , if a value of 2 is used , the stack alignment requirement is reduced from the default ( which is 16 bytes ) to just 4 bytes .
In most cases this means no additional alignment operation is needed since normal stack push and pop operations work on four - byte boundaries anyway .
This machine - specific option can help to reduce code size and also improve execution speed .
But it can not be applied for many other architectures .
Even for x86 - 64 it is generally not applicable since the x86 - 64 ABI requires that floating - point parameters are passed in an SSE register and the SSE instructions require full 16 byte alignment .
Nevertheless , whenever the option is usable it can make a noticeable difference .
Efficient placement of structure elements and alignment are not the only aspects of data structures which influence cache efficiency .
If an array of structures is used , the entire structure definition affects performance .
Remember the results in Figure 3.11 : in this case we had increasing amounts of unused data in the elements of the array .
The result was that prefetching was increasingly less effective and the program , for large data sets , became less efficient .
For large working sets it is important to use the available cache as well as possible .
To achieve this , it might be necessary to rearrange data structures .
While it is easier for the programmer to put all the data which conceptually belongs together in the same data structure , this might not be the best approach for maximum performance .
Assume we have a data structure as follows :
struct order { double price ; bool paid ; const char * buyer [ 5 ] ; long buyer_id ; } ;
Further assume that these records are stored in a big array and that a frequently - run job adds up the expected payments of all the outstanding bills .
In this scenario , the memory used for the buyer and buyer_id fields is unnecessarily loaded into the caches .
Judging from the data in Figure 3.11 the program will perform up to 5 times worse than it could .
It is much better to split the order data structure in two , storing the first two fields in one structure and the other fields elsewhere .
This change certainly increases the complexity of the program , but the performance gains might justify this cost .
Finally , let 's consider another cache use optimization which , while also applying to the other caches , is primarily felt in the L1d access .
As seen in Figure 3.8 an increased associativity of the cache benefits normal operation .
The larger the cache , the higher the associativity usually is .
The L1d cache is too large to be fully associative but not large enough to have the same associativity as L2 caches .
This can be a problem if many of the objects in the working set fall into the same cache set .
If this leads to evictions due to overuse of a set , the program can experience delays even though much of the cache is unused .
These cache misses are sometimes called conflict misses .
Since the L1d addressing uses virtual addresses , this is actually something the programmer can have control over .
If variables which are used together are also stored together the likelihood of them falling into the same set is minimized .
Figure 6.5 shows how quickly the problem can hit .
Figure 6.5 : Cache Associativity Effects
In the figure , the now familiar Follow { The test was performed on a 32 - bit machine , hence NPAD =15 means one 64 - byte cache line per list element .} with NPAD =15 test is measured with a special setup .
The X–axis is the distance between two list elements , measured in empty list elements .
In other words , a distance of 2 means that the next element 's address is 128 bytes after the previous one .
All elements are laid out in the virtual address space with the same distance .
The Y–axis shows the total length of the list .
Only one to 16 elements are used , meaning that the total working set size is 64 to 1024 bytes .
The z–axis shows the average number of cycles needed to traverse each list element .
The result shown in the figure should not be surprising .
If few elements are used , all the data fits into L1d and the access time is only 3 cycles per list element .
The same is true for almost all arrangements of the list elements : the virtual addresses are nicely mapped to L1d slots with almost no conflicts .
There are two ( in this graph ) special distance values for which the situation is different .
If the distance is a multiple of 4096 bytes ( i.e. , distance of 64 elements ) and the length of the list is greater than eight , the average number of cycles per list element increases dramatically .
In these situations all entries are in the same set and , once the list length is greater than the associativity , entries are flushed from L1d and have to be re-read from L2 the next round .
This results in the cost of about 10 cycles per list element .
With this graph we can determine that the processor used has an L1d cache with associativity 8 and a total size of 32kB .
That means that the test could , if necessary , be used to determine these values .
The same effects can be measured for the L2 cache but , here , it is more complex since the L2 cache is indexed using physical addresses and it is much larger .
For programmers this means that associativity is something worth paying attention to .
Laying out data at boundaries that are powers of two happens often enough in the real world , but this is exactly the situation which can easily lead to the above effects and degraded performance .
Unaligned accesses can increase the probability of conflict misses since each access might require an additional cache line .
Figure 6.6 : Bank Address of L1d on AMD
If this optimization is performed , another related optimization is possible , too .
AMD 's processors , at least , implement the L1d as several individual banks .
The L1d can receive two data words per cycle but only if both words are stored in different banks or in a bank with the same index .
The bank address is encoded in the low bits of the virtual address as shown in Figure 6.6 .
If variables which are used together are also stored together the likelihood that they are in different banks or the same bank with the same index is high .
6.2.2 Optimizing Level 1 Instruction Cache Access
Preparing code for good L1i use needs similar techniques as good L1d use .
The problem is , though , that the programmer usually does not directly influence the way L1i is used unless s/he writes code in assembler .
If compilers are used , programmers can indirectly determine the L1i use by guiding the compiler to create a better code layout .
Code has the advantage that it is linear between jumps .
In these periods the processor can prefetch memory efficiently .
Jumps disturb this nice picture because
the jump target might not be statically determined ;
and even if it is static the memory fetch might take a long time if it misses all caches .
These problems create stalls in execution with a possibly severe impact on performance .
This is why today 's processors invest heavily in branch prediction ( BP ) .
Highly specialized BP units try to determine the target of a jump as far ahead of the jump as possible so that the processor can initiate loading the instructions at the new location into the cache .
They use static and dynamic rules and are increasingly good at determining patterns in execution .
Getting data into the cache as soon as possible is even more important for the instruction cache .
As mentioned in Section 3.1 , instructions have to be decoded before they can be executed and , to speed this up ( important on x86 and x86 - 64 ) , instructions are actually cached in the decoded form , not in the byte / word form read from memory .
To achieve the best L1i use programmers should look out for at least the following aspects of code generation :
reduce the code footprint as much as possible .
This has to be balanced with optimizations like loop unrolling and inlining .
code execution should be linear without bubbles .
{ Bubbles describe graphically the holes in the execution in the pipeline of a processor which appear when the execution has to wait for resources .
For more details the reader is referred to literature on processor design .} aligning code when it makes sense .
We will now look at some compiler techniques available to help with optimizing programs according to these aspects .
Compilers have options to enable levels of optimization ; specific optimizations can also be individually enabled .
Many of the optimizations enabled at high optimization levels ( - O2 and - O3 for gcc ) deal with loop optimizations and function inlining .
In general , these are good optimizations .
If the code which is optimized in these ways accounts for a significant part of the total execution time of the program , overall performance can be improved .
Inlining of functions , in particular , allows the compiler to optimize larger chunks of code at a time which , in turn , enables the generation of machine code which better exploits the processor 's pipeline architecture .
The handling of both code and data ( through dead code elimination or value range propagation , and others ) works better when larger parts of the program can be considered as a single unit .
A larger code size means higher pressure on the L1i ( and also L2 and higher level ) caches .
This can lead to less performance .
Smaller code can be faster .
Fortunately gcc has an optimization option to specify this .
If - Os is used the compiler will optimize for code size .
Optimizations which are known to increase the code size are disabled .
Using this option often produces surprising results .
Especially if the compiler cannot really take advantage of loop unrolling and inlining , this option is a big win .
Inlining can be controlled individually as well .
The compiler has heuristics and limits which guide inlining ; these limits can be controlled by the programmer .
The - finline - limit option specifies how large a function must be to be considered too large for inlining .
If a function is called in multiple places , inlining it in all of them would cause an explosion in the code size .
But there is more .
Assume a function inlcand is called in two functions f1 and f2 .
The functions f1 and f2 are themselves called in sequence .
With inlining Without inlining start f1 code f1 inlined inlcand more code f1 end f1 start f2 code f2 inlined inlcand more code f2 end f2 start inlcand code inlcand end inlcand start f1 code f1 end f1 start f2 code f2 end f2 Table 6.3 : Inlining Vs Not
Table 6.3 shows how the generated code could look like in the cases of no inline and inlining in both functions .
If the function inlcand is inlined in both f1 and f2 the total size of the generated code is :
size f1 + size f2 + 2 × size inlcand
If no inlining happens , the total size is smaller by size inlcand .
This is how much more L1i and L2 cache is needed if f1 and f2 are called shortly after one another .
Plus : if inlcand is not inlined , the code might still be in L1i and it will not have to be decoded again .
Plus : the branch prediction unit might do a better job of predicting jumps since it has already seen the code .
If the compiler default for the upper limit on the size of inlined functions is not the best for the program , it should be lowered .
There are cases , though , when inlining always makes sense .
If a function is only called once it might as well be inlined .
This gives the compiler the opportunity to perform more optimizations ( like value range propagation , which might significantly improve the code ) .
That inlining might be thwarted by the selection limits .
gcc has , for cases like this , an option to specify that a function is always inlined .
Adding the always_inline function attribute instructs the compiler to do exactly what the name suggests .
In the same context , if a function should never be inlined despite being small enough , the noinline function attribute can be used .
Using this attribute makes sense even for small functions if they are called often from different places .
If the L1i content can be reused and the overall footprint is reduced this often makes up for the additional cost of the extra function call .
Branch prediction units are pretty good these days .
If inlining can lead to more aggressive optimizations things look different .
This is something which must be decided on a case - by - case basis .
The always_inline attribute works well if the inline code is always used .
But what if this is not the case ?
What if the inlined function is called only occasionally :
void fct ( void ) { ... code block A ... if ( condition ) inlfct ( ) ... code block C ... }
The code generated for such a code sequence in general matches the structure of the sources .
That means first comes the code block A , then a conditional jump which , if the condition evaluates to false , jumps forward .
The code generated for the inlined inlfct comes next , and finally the code block C .
This looks all reasonable but it has a problem .
If the condition is frequently false , the execution is not linear .
There is a big chunk of unused code in the middle which not only pollutes the L1i due to prefetching , it also can cause problems with branch prediction .
If the branch prediction is wrong the conditional expression can be very inefficient .
This is a general problem and not specific to inlining functions .
Whenever conditional execution is used and it is lopsided ( i.e. , the expression far more often leads to one result than the other ) there is the potential for false static branch prediction and thus bubbles in the pipeline .
This can be prevented by telling the compiler to move the less often executed code out of the main code path .
In that case the conditional branch generated for an if statement would jump to a place out of the order as can be seen in the following figure .
The upper parts represents the simple code layout .
If the area B , e.g. generated from the inlined function inlfct above , is often not executed because the conditional I jumps over it , the prefetching of the processor will pull in cache lines containing block B which are rarely used .
Using block reordering this can be changed , with a result that can be seen in the lower part of the figure .
The often - executed code is linear in memory while the rarely - executed code is moved somewhere where it does not hurt prefetching and L1i efficiency .
gcc provides two methods to achieve this .
First , the compiler can take profiling output into account while recompiling code and lay out the code blocks according to the profile .
We will see how this works in Section 7 .
The second method is through explicit branch prediction .
gcc recognizes __builtin_expect :
long __builtin_expect( long EXP , long C ) ;
This construct tells the compiler that the expression EXP most likely will have the value C .
The return value is EXP .
__builtin_expect is meant to be used in an conditional expression .
In almost all cases will it be used in the context of boolean expressions in which case it is much more convenient to define two helper macros :
# define unlikely ( expr ) __builtin_expect (!!( expr ) , 0 ) # define likely ( expr ) __builtin_expect ( !!( expr ) , 1 )
These macros can then be used as in
if ( likely ( a > 1 ) )
If the programmer makes use of these macros and then uses the - freorder - blocks optimization option gcc will reorder blocks as in the figure above .
This option is enabled with - O2 but disabled for - Os .
There is another option to reorder block ( - freorder - blocks - and - partition ) but it has limited usefulness because it does not work with exception handling .
There is another big advantage of small loops , at least on certain processors .
The Intel Core 2 front end has a special feature called Loop Stream Detector ( LSD ) .
If a loop has no more than 18 instructions ( none of which is a call to a subroutine ) , requires only up to 4 decoder fetches of 16 bytes , has at most 4 branch instructions , and is executed more than 64 times , than the loop is sometimes locked in the instruction queue and therefore more quickly available when the loop is used again .
This applies , for instance , to small inner loops which are entered many times through an outer loop .
Even without such specialized hardware compact loops have advantages .
Inlining is not the only aspect of optimization with respect to L1i .
Another aspect is alignment , just as for data .
There are obvious differences : code is a mostly linear blob which cannot be placed arbitrarily in the address space and it cannot be influenced directly by the programmer as the compiler generates the code .
There are some aspects which the programmer can control , though .
Aligning each single instruction does not make any sense .
The goal is to have the instruction stream be sequential .
So alignment only makes sense in strategic places .
To decide where to add alignments it is necessary to understand what the advantages can be .
Having an instruction at the beginning of a cache line { For some processors cache lines are not the atomic blocks for instructions .
The Intel Core 2 front end issues 16 byte blocks to the decoder .
They are appropriately aligned and so no issued block can span a cache line boundary .
Aligning at the beginning of a cache line still has advantages since it optimizes the positive effects of prefetching .} means that the prefetch of the cache line is maximized .
For instructions this also means the decoder is more effective .
It is easy to see that , if an instruction at the end of a cache line is executed , the processor has to get ready to read a new cache line and decode the instructions .
There are things which can go wrong ( such as cache line misses ) , meaning that an instruction at the end of the cache line is , on average , not as effectively executed as one at the beginning .
Combine this with the follow - up deduction that the problem is most severe if control was just transferred to the instruction in question ( and hence prefetching is not effective ) and we arrive at our final conclusion where alignment of code is most useful :
at the beginning of functions ;
at the beginning of basic blocks which are reached only through jumps ;
to some extent , at the beginning of loops .
In the first two cases the alignment comes at little cost .
Execution proceeds at a new location and , if we choose it to be at the beginning of a cache line , we optimize prefetching and decoding .
{ For instruction decoding processors often use a smaller unit than cache lines , 16 bytes in case of x86 and x86-64.}
The compiler accomplishes this alignment through the insertion of a series of no - op instructions to fill the gap created by aligning the code .
This dead code takes a little space but does not normally hurt performance .
The third case is slightly different : aligning beginning of each loop might create performance problems .
The problem is that beginning of a loop often follows other code sequentially .
If the circumstances are not very lucky there will be a gap between the previous instruction and the aligned beginning of the loop .
Unlike in the previous two cases , this gap cannot be completely dead .
After execution of the previous instruction the first instruction in the loop must be executed .
This means that , following the previous instruction , there either must be a number of no - op instructions to fill the gap or there must be an unconditional jump to the beginning of the loop .
Neither possibility is free .
Especially if the loop itself is not executed often , the no-ops or the jump might cost more than one saves by aligning the loop .
There are three ways the programmer can influence the alignment of code .
Obviously , if the code is written in assembler the function and all instructions in it can be explicitly aligned .
The assembler provides for all architectures the .align pseudo - op to do that .
For high - level languages the compiler must be told about alignment requirements .
Unlike for data types and variables this is not possible in the source code .
Instead a compiler option is used :
-falign- functions=N
This option instructs the compiler to align all functions to the next power - of - two boundary greater than N .
That means a gap of up to N bytes is created .
For small functions using a large value for N is a waste .
Equally for code which is executed only rarely .
The latter can happen a lot in libraries which can contain both popular and not - so - popular interfaces .
A wise choice of the option value can speed things up or save memory by avoiding alignment .
All alignment is turned off by using one as the value of N or by using the - fno - align - functions option .
The alignment for the second case above — beginning of basic blocks which are not reached sequentially — can be controlled with a different option :
- falign - jumps=N
All the other details are equivalent , the same warning about waste of memory applies .
The third case also has its own option :
-falign-loops=N
Yet again , the same details and warnings apply .
Except that here , as explained before , alignment comes at a runtime cost since either no -ops or a jump instruction has to be executed if the aligned address is reached sequentially .
gcc knows about one more option for controlling alignment which is mentioned here only for completeness .
- falign - labels aligns every single label in the code ( basically the beginning of each basic block ) .
This , in all but a few exceptional cases , slows down the code and therefore should not be used .
6.2.3 Optimizing Level 2 and Higher Cache Access
Everything said about optimizations for using level 1 cache also applies to level 2 and higher cache accesses .
There are two additional aspects of last level caches :
cache misses are always very expensive .
While L1 misses ( hopefully ) frequently hit L2 and higher cache , thus limiting the penalties , there is obviously no fallback for the last level cache .
L2 caches and higher are often shared by multiple cores and / or hyper - threads .
The effective cache size available to each execution unit is therefore usually less than the total cache size .
To avoid the high costs of cache misses , the working set size should be matched to the cache size .
If data is only needed once this obviously is not necessary since the cache would be ineffective anyway .
We are talking about workloads where the data set is needed more than once .
In such a case the use of a working set which is too large to fit into the cache will create large amounts of cache misses which , even with prefetching being performed successfully , will slow down the program .
A program has to perform its job even if the data set is too large .
It is the programmer 's job to do the work in a way which minimizes cache misses .
For last - level caches this is possible — just as for L1 caches — by working on the job in smaller pieces .
This is very similar to the optimized matrix multiplication on Table 6.2 .
One difference , though , is that , for last level caches , the data blocks which are be worked on can be bigger .
The code becomes yet more complicated if L1 optimizations are needed , too .
Imagine a matrix multiplication where the data sets — the two input matrices and the output matrix — do not fit into the last level cache together .
In this case it might be appropriate to optimize the L1 and last level cache accesses at the same time .
The L1 cache line size is usually constant over many processor generations ; even if it is not , the differences will be small .
It is no big problem to just assume the larger size .
On processors with smaller cache sizes two or more cache lines will then be used instead of one .
In any case , it is reasonable to hardcode the cache line size and optimize the code for it .
For higher level caches this is not the case if the program is supposed to be generic .
The sizes of those caches can vary widely .
Factors of eight or more are not uncommon .
It is not possible to assume the larger cache size as a default since this would mean the code performs poorly on all machines except those with the biggest cache .
The opposite choice is bad too : assuming the smallest cache means throwing away 87 % of the cache or more .
This is bad ; as we can see from Figure 3.14 using large caches can have a huge impact on the program 's speed .
What this means is that the code must dynamically adjust itself to the cache line size .
This is an optimization specific to the program .
All we can say here is that the programmer should compute the program 's requirements correctly .
Not only are the data sets themselves needed , the higher level caches are also used for other purposes ; for example , all the executed instructions are loaded from cache .
If library functions are used this cache usage might add up to a significant amount .
Those library functions might also need data of their own which further reduces the available memory .
Once we have a formula for the memory requirement we can compare it with the cache size .
As mentioned before , the cache might be shared with multiple other cores .
Currently { There definitely will sometime soon be a better way !} the only way to get correct information without hardcoding knowledge is through the /sys filesystem .
In Table 5.2 we have seen the what the kernel publishes about the hardware .
A program has to find the directory :
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache
for the last level cache .
This can be recognized by the highest numeric value in the level file in that directory .
When the directory is identified the program should read the content of the size file in that directory and divide the numeric value by the number of bits set in the bitmask in the file shared_cpu_map .
The value which is computed this way is a safe lower limit .
Sometimes a program knows a bit more about the behavior of other threads or processes .
If those threads are scheduled on a core or hyper - thread sharing the cache , and the cache usage is known to not exhaust its fraction of the total cache size , then the computed limit might be too low to be optimal .
Whether more than the fair share should be used really depends on the situation .
The programmer has to make a choice or has to allow the user to make a decision .
6.2.4 Optimizing TLB Usage
There are two kinds of optimization of TLB usage .
The first optimization is to reduce the number of pages a program has to use .
This automatically results in fewer TLB misses .
The second optimization is to make the TLB lookup cheaper by reducing the number higher level directory tables which must be allocated .
Fewer tables means less memory usage which can result is higher cache hit rates for the directory lookup .
The first optimization is closely related to the minimization of page faults .
We will cover that topic in detail in Section 7.5 .
While page faults usually are a one - time cost , TLB misses are a perpetual penalty given that the TLB cache is usually small and it is flushed frequently .
Page faults are orders of magnitude more expensive than TLB misses but , if a program is running long enough and certain parts of the program are executed frequently enough , TLB misses can outweigh even page fault costs .
It is therefore important to regard page optimization not only from the perspective of page faults but also from the TLB miss perspective .
The difference is that , while page fault optimizations only require page - wide grouping of the code and data , TLB optimization requires that , at any point in time , as few TLB entries are in use as possible .
The second TLB optimization is even harder to control .
The number of page directories which have to be used depends on the distribution of the address ranges used in the virtual address space of the process .
Widely varying locations in the address space mean more directories .
A complication is that Address Space Layout Randomization ( ASLR ) leads to exactly these situations .
The load addresses of stack , DSOs , heap , and possibly executable are randomized at runtime to prevent attackers of the machine from guessing the addresses of functions or variables .
For maximum performance ASLR certainly should be turned off .
The costs of the extra directories is low enough , though , to make this step unnecessary in all but a few extreme cases .
One possible optimization the kernel could at any time perform is to ensure that a single mapping does not cross the address space boundary between two directories .
This would limit ASLR in a minimal fashion but not enough to substantially weaken it .
The only way a programmer is directly affected by this is when an address space region is explicitly requested .
This happens when using mmap with MAP_FIXED .
Allocating new a address space region this way is very dangerous and hardly ever done .
It is possible , though , and , if it is used , the programmer should know about the boundaries of the last level page directory and select the requested address appropriately .
6.3 Prefetching
The purpose of prefetching is to hide the latency of a memory access .
The command pipeline and out - of - order ( OOO ) execution capabilities of today 's processors can hide some latency but , at best , only for accesses which hit the caches .
To cover the latency of main memory accesses , the command queue would have to be incredibly long .
Some processors without OOO try to compensate by increasing the number of cores , but this is a bad trade unless all the code in use is parallelized .
Prefetching can further help to hide latency .
The processor performs prefetching on its own , triggered by certain events ( hardware prefetching ) or explicitly requested by the program ( software prefetching ) .
6.3.1 Hardware Prefetching
The trigger for hardware prefetching is usually a sequence of two or more cache misses in a certain pattern .
These cache misses can be to succeeding or preceding cache lines .
In old implementations only cache misses to adjacent cache lines are recognized .
With contemporary hardware , strides are recognized as well , meaning that skipping a fixed number of cache lines is recognized as a pattern and handled appropriately .
It would be bad for performance if every single cache miss triggered a hardware prefetch .
Random memory accesses , for instance to global variables , are quite common and the resulting prefetches would mostly waste FSB bandwidth .
This is why , to kickstart prefetching , at least two cache misses are needed .
Processors today all expect there to be more than one stream of memory accesses .
The processor tries to automatically assign each cache miss to such a stream and , if the threshold is reached , start hardware prefetching .
CPUs today can keep track of eight to sixteen separate streams for the higher level caches .
The units responsible for the pattern recognition are associated with the respective cache .
There can be a prefetch unit for the L1d and L1i caches .
There is most probably a prefetch unit for the L2 cache and higher .
The L2 and higher prefetch unit is shared with all the other cores and hyper - threads using the same cache .
The number of eight to sixteen separate streams therefore is quickly reduced .
Prefetching has one big weakness : it can not cross page boundaries .
The reason should be obvious when one realizes that the CPUs support demand paging .
If the prefetcher were allowed to cross page boundaries , the access might trigger an OS event to make the page available .
This by itself can be bad , especially for performance .
What is worse is that the prefetcher does not know about the semantics of the program or the OS itself .
It might therefore prefetch pages which , in real life , never would be requested .
That means the prefetcher would run past the end of the memory region the processor accessed in a recognizable pattern before .
This is not only possible , it is very likely .
If the processor , as a side effect of a prefetch , triggered a request for such a page the OS might even be completely thrown off its tracks if such a request could never otherwise happen .
It is therefore important to realize that , regardless of how good the prefetcher is at predicting the pattern , the program will experience cache misses at page boundaries unless it explicitly prefetches or reads from the new page .
This is another reason to optimize the layout of data as described in Section 6.2 to minimize cache pollution by keeping unrelated data out .
Because of this page limitation the processors do not have terribly sophisticated logic to recognize prefetch patterns .
With the still predominant 4 k page size there is only so much which makes sense .
The address range in which strides are recognized has been increased over the years , but it probably does not make much sense to go beyond the 512 byte window which is often used today .
Currently prefetch units do not recognize non-linear access patterns .
It is more likely than not that such patterns are truly random or , at least , sufficiently non-repeating that it makes no sense to try recognizing them .
If hardware prefetching is accidentally triggered there is only so much one can do .
One possibility is to try to detect this problem and change the data and / or code layout a bit .
This is likely to prove hard .
There might be special localized solutions like using the ud2 instruction { Or non-instruction .
It is the recommended undefined opcode.} on x86 and x86 - 64 processors .
This instruction , which cannot be executed itself , is used after an indirect jump instruction ; it is used as a signal to the instruction fetcher that the processor should not waste efforts decoding the following memory since the execution will continue at a different location .
This is a very special situation , though .
In most cases one has to live with this problem .
It is possible to completely or partially disable hardware prefetching for the entire processor .
On Intel processors an Model Specific Register ( MSR ) is used for this ( IA32_MISC_ENABLE , bit 9 on many processors ; bit 19 disables only the adjacent cache line prefetch ) .
This , in most cases , has to happen in the kernel since it is a privileged operation .
If profiling shows that an important application running on a system suffers from bandwidth exhaustion and premature cache evictions due to hardware prefetches , using this MSR is a possibility .
6.3.2 Software Prefetching
The advantage of hardware prefetching is that programs do not have to be adjusted .
The drawbacks , as just described , are that the access patterns must be trivial and that prefetching cannot happen across page boundaries .
For these reasons we now have more possibilities , software prefetching the most important of them .
Software prefetching does require modification of the source code by inserting special instructions .
Some compilers support pragmas to more or less automatically insert prefetch instructions .
On x86 and x86-64 Intel 's convention for compiler intrinsics to insert these special instructions is generally used :
#include < xmmintrin.h > enum _mm_hint { _MM_HINT_T0 = 3 , _MM_HINT_T1 = 2 , _MM_HINT_T2 = 1 , _MM_HINT_NTA = 0 } ; void _mm_prefetch ( void * p , enum _mm_hint h ) ;
Programs can use the _mm_prefetch intrinsic on any pointer in the program .
Most processors ( certainly all x86 and x86 - 64 processors ) ignore errors resulting from invalid pointers which make the life of the programmer significantly easier .
If the passed pointer references valid memory , though , the prefetch unit will be instructed to load the data into cache and , if necessary , evict other data .
Unnecessary prefetches should definitely be avoided since this might reduce the effectiveness of the caches and it consumes memory bandwidth ( possibly for two cache lines in case the evicted cache line is dirty ) .
The different hints to be used with the _mm_prefetch intrinsic are implementation defined .
That means each processor version can implement them ( slightly ) differently .
What can generally be said is that _MM_HINT_T0 fetches data to all levels of the cache for inclusive caches and to the lowest level cache for exclusive caches .
If the data item is in a higher level cache it is loaded into L1d .
The _MM_HINT_T1 hint pulls the data into L2 and not into L1d .
If there is an L3 cache the _MM_HINT_T2 hints can do something similar for it .
These are details , though , which are weakly specified and need to be verified for the actual processor in use .
In general , if the data is to be used right away using _MM_HINT_T0 is the right thing to do .
Of course this requires that the L1d cache size is large enough to hold all the prefetched data .
If the size of the immediately used working set is too large , prefetching everything into L1d is a bad idea and the other two hints should be used .
The fourth hint , _MM_HINT_NTA , is special in that it allows telling the processor to treat the prefetched cache line specially .
NTA stands for non-temporal aligned which we already explained in Section 6.1 .
The program tells the processor that polluting caches with this data should be avoided as much as possible since the data is only used for a short time .
The processor can therefore , upon loading , avoid reading the data into the lower level caches for inclusive cache implementations .
When the data is evicted from L1d the data need not be pushed into L2 or higher but , instead , can be written directly to memory .
There might be other tricks the processor designers can deploy if this hint is given .
The programmer must be careful using this hint : if the immediate working set size is too large and forces eviction of a cache line loaded with the NTA hint , reloading from memory will occur .
Figure 6.7 : Average with Prefetch , NPAD=31
Figure 6.7 shows the results of a test using the now familiar pointer chasing framework .
The list is randomized .
The difference to previous test is that the program actually spends some time at each list node ( about 160 cycles ) .
As we learned from the data in Figure 3.15 , the program 's performance suffers badly as soon as the working set size is larger than the last - level cache .
We can now try to improve the situation by issuing prefetch requests ahead of the computation .
I.e. , in each round of the loop we prefetch a new element .
The distance between the prefetched node in the list and the node which is currently worked on must be carefully chosen .
Given that each node is processed in 160 cycles and that we have to prefetch two cache lines ( NPAD =31 ) , a distance of five list elements is enough .
The results in Figure 6.7 show that the prefetch does indeed help .
As long as the working set size does not exceed the size of the last level cache ( the machine has 512 kB = 219B of L2 ) the numbers are identical .
The prefetch instructions do not add a measurable extra burden .
As soon as the L2 size is exceeded the prefetching saves between 50 to 60 cycles , up to 8 % .
The use of prefetch cannot hide all the penalties but it does help a bit .
AMD implements , in their family 10h of the Opteron line , another instruction : prefetchw .
This instruction has so far no equivalent on the Intel side and is not available through intrinsics .
The prefetchw instruction prefetches the cache line into L1 just like the other prefetch instructions .
The difference is that the cache line is immediately put into ' M ' state .
This will be a disadvantage if no write to the cache line follows later .
If there are one or more writes , they will be accelerated since the writes do not have to change the cache state — that already happened when the cache line was prefetched .
Prefetching can have bigger advantages than the meager 8 % we achieved here .
But it is notoriously hard to do right , especially if the same binary is supposed to perform well on a variety of machines .
The performance counters provided by the CPU can help the programmer analyze prefetches .
Events which can be counted and sampled include hardware prefetches , software prefetches , useful software prefetches , cache misses at the various levels , and more .
In Section 7.1 we will introduce a number of these events .
All these counters are machine specific .
When analyzing programs one should first look at the cache misses .
When a large source of cache misses is located one should try to add a prefetch instruction for the problematic memory accesses .
This should be done in one place at a time .
The result of each modification should be checked by observing the performance counters measuring useful prefetch instructions .
If those counters do not increase the prefetch might be wrong , it is not given enough time to load from memory , or the prefetch evicts memory from the cache which is still needed .
gcc today is able to emit prefetch instructions automatically in one situation .
If a loop is iterating over an array the following option can be used :
- fprefetch - loop - arrays
The compiler will figure out whether prefetching makes sense and , if so , how far ahead it should look .
For small arrays this can be a disadvantage and , if the size of the array is not known at compile time , the results might be worse .
The gcc manual warns that the benefits highly depend on the form of the code and that in some situation the code might actually run slower .
Programmers have to use this option carefully .
6.3.3 Special Kind of Prefetch : Speculation
The OOO execution capability of a processor allows moving instructions around if they do not conflict with each other .
For instance ( using this time IA - 64 for the example ) :
st8 [ r4 ] = 12 add r5 = r6 , r7 ; ; st8 [ r 18 ] = r5
This code sequence stores 12 at the address specified by register r4 , adds the content of registers r6 and r7 and stores it in register r5 .
Finally it stores the sum at the address specified by register r18 .
The point here is that the add instruction can be executed before — or at the same time as — the first st8 instruction since there is no data dependency .
But what happens if one of the addends has to be loaded ?
st8 [ r4 ] = 12 ld8 r6 = [ r8 ] ; ; add r5 = r6 , r7 ; ; st8 [ r 18 ] = r5
The extra ld8 instruction loads the value from the address specified by the register r8 .
There is an obvious data dependency between this load instruction and the following add instruction ( this is the reason for the ; ; after the instruction , thanks for asking ) .
What is critical here is that the new ld8 instruction — unlike the add instruction — cannot be moved in front of the first st8 .
The processor cannot determine quickly enough during the instruction decoding whether the store and load conflict , i.e. , whether r4 and r8 might have same value .
If they do have the same value , the st8 instruction would determine the value loaded into r6 .
What is worse , the ld8 might also bring with it a large latency in case the load misses the caches .
The IA - 64 architecture supports speculative loads for this case :
ld8.a r6 = [ r8 ] ; ; [... other instructions ...] st8 [ r4 ] = 12 ld8.c.clr r6 = [ r8 ] ; ; add r5 = r6 , r7 ; ; st8 [ r 18 ] = r5
The new ld8.a and ld8.c.clr instructions belong together and replace the ld8 instruction in the previous code sequence .
The ld8.a instruction is the speculative load .
The value cannot be used directly but the processor can start the work .
At the time when the ld8.c.clr instruction is reached the content might have been loaded already ( given there is a sufficient number of instructions in the gap ) .
The arguments for this instruction must match that for the ld8.a instruction .
If the preceding st8 instruction does not overwrite the value ( i.e. , r4 and r8 are the same ) , nothing has to be done .
The speculative load does its job and the latency of the load is hidden .
If the store and load do conflict the ld8.c.clr reloads the value from memory and we end up with the semantics of a normal ld8 instruction .
Speculative loads are not ( yet ? ) widely used .
But as the example shows it is a very simple yet effective way to hide latencies .
Prefetching is basically equivalent and , for processors with fewer registers , speculative loads probably do not make much sense .
Speculative loads have the ( sometimes big ) advantage of loading the value directly into the register and not into the cache line where it might be evicted again ( for instance , when the thread is descheduled ) .
If speculation is available it should be used .
6.3.4 Helper Threads
When one tries to use software prefetching one often runs into problems with the complexity of the code .
If the code has to iterate over a data structure ( a list in our case ) one has to implement two independent iterations in the same loop : the normal iteration doing the work and the second iteration , which looks ahead , to use prefetching .
This easily gets complex enough that mistakes are likely .
Furthermore , it is necessary to determine how far to look ahead .
Too little and the memory will not be loaded in time .
Too far and the just loaded data might have been evicted again .
Another problem is that prefetch instructions , although they do not block and wait for the memory to be loaded , take time .
The instruction has to be decoded , which might be noticeable if the decoder is too busy , for instance , due to well written / generated code .
Finally , the code size of the loop is increased .
This decreases the L1i efficiency .
If one tries to avoid parts of this cost by issuing multiple prefetch requests in a row ( in case the second load does not depend on the result of the first ) one runs into problems with the number of outstanding prefetch requests .
An alternative approach is to perform the normal operation and the prefetch completely separately .
This can happen using two normal threads .
The threads must obviously be scheduled so that the prefetch thread is populating a cache accessed by both threads .
There are two special solutions worth mentioning :
Use hyper - threads ( see Figure 3.22 ) on the same core .
In this case the prefetch can go into L2 ( or even L1d ) .
Use dumber threads than SMT threads which can do nothing but prefetch and other simple operations .
This is an option processor manufacturers might explore .
The use of hyper - threads is particularly intriguing .
As we have seen on Figure 3.22 , the sharing of caches is a problem if the hyper - threads execute independent code .
If , instead , one thread is used as a prefetch helper thread this is not a problem .
To the contrary , it is the desired effect since the lowest level cache is preloaded .
Furthermore , since the prefetch thread is mostly idle or waiting for memory , the normal operation of the other hyper - thread is not disturbed much if it does not have to access main memory itself .
The latter is exactly what the prefetch helper thread prevents .
The only tricky part is to ensure that the helper thread is not running too far ahead .
It must not completely pollute the cache so that the oldest prefetched values are evicted again .
On Linux , synchronization is easily done using the futex system call [ futexes ] or , at a little bit higher cost , using the POSIX thread synchronization primitives .
Figure 6.8 : Average with Helper Thread , NPAD=31
The benefits of the approach can be seen in Figure 6.8 .
This is the same test as in Figure 6.7 only with the additional result added .
The new test creates an additional helper thread which runs about 100 list entries ahead and reads ( not only prefetches ) all the cache lines of each list element .
In this case we have two cache lines per list element ( NPAD =31 on a 32 - bit machine with 64 byte cache line size ) .
The two threads are scheduled on two hyper - threads of the same core .
The test machine has only one core but the results should be about the same if there is more than one core .
The affinity functions , which we will introduce in Section 6.4.3 , are used to tie the threads down to the appropriate hyper - thread .
To determine which two ( or more ) processors the OS knows are hyper - threads , the NUMA_cpu_level_mask interface from libNUMA can be used ( see Section 12 ) .
#include < libNUMA.h > ssize_t NUMA_cpu_level_mask ( size_t destsize , cpu_set_t * dest , size_t srcsize , const cpu_set_t*src , unsigned int level ) ;
This interface can be used to determine the hierarchy of CPUs as they are connected through caches and memory .
Of interest here is level 1 which corresponds to hyper - threads .
To schedule two threads on two hyper - threads the libNUMA functions can be used ( error handling dropped for brevity ) :
cpu_set_t self ; NUMA_cpu_self_current_mask(sizeof( self ) , &self ) ; cpu_set_t hts ; NUMA_cpu_level_mask( sizeof ( hts ) , &hts , sizeof ( self ) , &self , 1 ) ; CPU_XOR ( &hts , &hts , &self ) ;
After this code is executed we have two CPU bit sets .
self can be used to set the affinity of the current thread and the mask in hts can be used to set the affinity of the helper thread .
This should ideally happen before the thread is created .
In Section 6.4.3 we will introduce the interface to set the affinity .
If there is no hyper - thread available the NUMA_cpu_level_mask function will return 1 .
This can be used as a sign to avoid this optimization .
The result of this benchmark might be surprising ( or maybe not ) .
If the working set fits into L2 , the overhead of the helper thread reduces the performance by between 10 % and 60 % ( ignore the smallest working set sizes again , the noise is too high ) .
This should be expected since , if all the data is already in the L2 cache , the prefetch helper thread only uses system resources without contributing to the execution .
Once the L2 size is exhausted the picture changes , though .
The prefetch helper thread helps to reduce the runtime by about 25 % .
We still see a rising curve simply because the prefetches cannot be processed fast enough .
The arithmetic operations performed by the main thread and the memory load operations of the helper thread do complement each other , though .
The resource collisions are minimal which causes this synergistic effect .
The results of this test should be transferable to many other situations .
Hyper - threads , often not useful due to cache pollution , shine in these situations and should be taken advantage of .
The sys file system allows a program to find the thread siblings ( see the thread_siblings column in Table 5.3 ) .
Once this information is available the program just has to define the affinity of the threads and then run the loop in two modes : normal operation and prefetching .
The amount of memory prefetched should depend on the size of the shared cache .
In this example the L2 size is relevant and the program can query the size using
sysconf( _SC_LEVEL2_CACHE_SIZE )
Whether or not the progress of the helper thread must be restricted depends on the program .
In general it is best to make sure there is some synchronization since scheduling details could otherwise cause significant performance degradations .
6.3.5 Direct Cache Access
One sources of cache misses in a modern OS is the handling of incoming data traffic .
Modern hardware , like Network Interface Cards ( NICs ) and disk controllers , has the ability to write the received or read data directly into memory without involving the CPU .
This is crucial for the performance of the devices we have today , but it also causes problems .
Assume an incoming packet from a network : the OS has to decide how to handle it by looking at the header of the packet .
The NIC places the packet into memory and then notifies the processor about the arrival .
The processor has no chance to prefetch the data since it does not know when the data will arrive , and maybe not even where exactly it will be stored .
The result is a cache miss when reading the header .
Intel has added technology in their chipsets and CPUs to alleviate this problem [ directcacheaccess ] .
The idea is to populate the cache of the CPU which will be notified about the incoming packet with the packet 's data .
The payload of the packet is not critical here , this data will , in general , be handled by higher - level functions , either in the kernel or at user level .
The packet header is used to make decisions about the way the packet has to be handled and so this data is needed immediately .
The network I/O hardware already has DMA to write the packet .
That means it communicates directly with the memory controller which potentially is integrated in the Northbridge .
Another side of the memory controller is the interface to the processors through the FSB ( assuming the memory controller is not integrated into the CPU itself ) .
The idea behind Direct Cache Access ( DCA ) is to extend the protocol between the NIC and the memory controller .
In Figure 6.9 the first figure shows the beginning of the DMA transfer in a regular machine with North - and Southbridge .
DMA Initiated DMA and DCA Executed Figure 6.9 : Direct Cache Access
The NIC is connected to ( or is part of ) the Southbridge .
It initiates the DMA access but provides the new information about the packet header which should be pushed into the processor 's cache .
The traditional behavior would be , in step two , to simply complete the DMA transfer with the connection to the memory .
For the DMA transfers with the DCA flag set the Northbridge additionally sends the data on the FSB with a special , new DCA flag .
The processor always snoops the FSB and , if it recognizes the DCA flag , it tries to load the data directed to the processor into the lowest cache .
The DCA flag is , in fact , a hint ; the processor can freely ignore it .
After the DMA transfer is finished the processor is signaled .
The OS , when processing the packet , first has to determine what kind of packet it is .
If the DCA hint is not ignored , the loads the OS has to perform to identify the packet most likely hit the cache .
Multiply this saving of hundreds of cycles per packet with tens of thousands of packets which can be processed per second , and the savings add up to very significant numbers , especially when it comes to latency .
Without the integration of I/O hardware ( NIC in this case ) , chipset , and CPUs such an optimization is not possible .
It is therefore necessary to make sure to select the platform wisely if this technology is needed .
