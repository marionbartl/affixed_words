You may ( or may not ) have seen these before – I thought they ’re interesting enough to share with you all .
Maybe you ’ll spot one or two you knew about , and maybe a few more you did n’t 🙂
VOMERONASAL ORGAN ( VNO ) , or Jacobson ’s organ : a tiny hole on each side of the nasal bridge that is considered to be connected to nonfunctional chemical receptors .
Could be all that is left from our once great ability to detect pheromones .
EXTRINSIC EAR MUSCLES :
These three muscles most likely made it possible for our ancestors to move their ears independently of their heads , as rabbits and dogs do .
We still have them , which is why most people can learn to wiggle their ears .
WISDOM TEETH : Early humans had to chew a lot of plants to get enough calories to survive , making another row of molars helpful , but unless you chew a lot of branches , these will eventually come out in a painful procedure .
Only about 5 percent of the population has a healthy set of these third molars .
NECK RIB : A set of cervical ribs — possibly leftovers from the age of reptiles , still appear in less than 1 percent of the population .
They often cause nerve and artery problems .
THIRD EYELID : A common ancestor of birds and mammals may have had a membrane for protecting the eye and sweeping out debris .
Humans retain only a tiny fold in the inner corner of the eye , exactly there where you always catch a spec of dust or debris .
DARWIN ’S POINT : A small folded point of skin toward the top of each ear is occasionally found in modern humans .
It may be a remnant of a larger shape that helped focus distant sounds .
SUBCLAVIUS MUSCLE :
This small muscle stretching under the shoulder from the first rib to the collarbone would be useful if humans still walked on all fours .
Some people have one , some have none , and a few have two .
PALMARIS MUSCLE :
This long , narrow muscle runs from the elbow to the wrist and is missing in 11 percent of modern humans .
It may once have been important for hanging and climbing .
Surgeons harvest it for reconstructive surgery .
MALE NIPPLES : Lactiferous ducts form well before testosterone causes sex differentiation in a fetus .
Men have mammary tissue that can be stimulated to produce milk .
This just makes me angry ; I ’ve been spending a fortune on milk all these years !
I ’ll have to test this tomorrow with my Special K .
ERECTOR PILI : Bundles of smooth muscle fibers allow animals to puff up their fur for insulation or to intimidate others .
Humans retain this ability ( goose bumps are the indicator ) but have obviously lost most of the fur .
APPENDIX : This narrow , muscular tube attached to the large intestine served as a special area to digest cellulose when the human diet consisted more of plant matter than animal protein .
It also produces some white blood cells .
Annually , more than 300,000 Americans have an appendectomy .
BODY HAIR : Brows help keep sweat from the eyes , and male facial hair may play a role in sexual selection , but apparently most of the hair left on the human body serves no function .
THIRTEENTH RIB :
Our closest cousins , chimpanzees and gorillas , have an extra set of ribs .
Most of us have 12 , but 8 percent of adults have the extras .
PLANTARIS MUSCLE : Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students , the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet .
It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population .
MALE UTERUS : A remnant of an undeveloped female reproductive organ hangs off the male prostate gland .
FIFTH TOE : Lesser apes use all their toes for grasping or clinging to branches .
Humans need mainly the big toe for balance while walking upright , the other four are for holding when you slam them on a coffee table at night !
FEMALE VAS DEFERENS :
What might become sperm ducts in males become the epoophoron in females , a cluster of useless dead - end tubules near the ovaries .
PYRAMIDALIS MUSCLE : More than 20 percent of us lack this tiny , triangular pouch - like muscle that attaches to the pubic bone .
It may be a relic from pouched marsupials .
COCCYX : These fused vertebrae are all that ’s left of the tail that most mammals still use for balance and communication .
Our hominid ancestors lost the need for a tail before they began walking upright .
All they ’re good for now is give us painful falls on the butt .
PARANASAL SINUSES :
The nasal sinuses of our early ancestors may have been lined with odor receptors that gave a heightened sense of smell , which aided survival .
No one knows why we retain these perhaps troublesome mucus - lined cavities , except to make the head lighter and to warm and moisten the air we breathe .
A snorkeller is believed to have been snatched by a shark as he swam last weekend with his son at a beach south of Perth .
Witnesses reported seeing a dorsal fin and thrashing in the water before the sea turned red and the man vanished at the scene on Australia 's west coast .
Father - of three Brian Guest , 51 , who had campaigned for many years for the protection of sharks , had been looking for crabs on yesterday morning with his 24 - year - old son when he was attacked about 30 metres from the shore .
Luke Tubbs told how a witness ran to his house in shock and screaming for help : " He just saw a big splash and then the shark roll over in the water with the guy and then [ he saw ] no body or anything . "
Daniel Guest , who was swimming six metres away at the Port Kennedy beach , heard his father 's screams but did not see the attack .
He raced to shore when he saw blood in the water .
His father 's shredded wetsuit was found later , and aerial searches spotted a five - metre great white shark swimming in the area .
In Sydney , some hours later , a kayaker survived a terrifying ordeal after being knocked from his craft by a great white shark .
That encounter , endured by 29 - year - old Steve Kulcsar , occurred less than a mile off Australia 's east coast , at Long Reef , and was filmed by a fisherman in a small boat nearby .
The video footage apparently showed the shark circling Kulcsar after bumping him off his kayak .
Kulcsar said : " I knew it was there , but my first thought was to just get back in the kayak as quick as possible . "
For 10 minutes , the shark is seen lurking around him and two other kayakers before losing interest and swimming away .
The two great white encounters sparked panic and closed a number of beaches across Australia .
Yesterday Bondi beach was closed yesterday after a shark was spotted close to shore .
Swimmers were also evacuated from a Queensland holiday island after sharks were spotted in waist - deep water .
During an aerial search on the West ­Australian coastline for Guest 's body , sharks were spotted , forcing the closure of two beaches .
The attack on Guest was the second by sharks in Australia this year .
A 16 - year - old surfer , Peter Edmonds , died after being attacked by a shark near Byron bay , on the New South Wales coast , in April .
On average there are 15 shark attacks a year in Australia , with about one death each year .
Swimmers are more likely to die of a lightning strike than be taken by a great white shark .
Yesterday Daniel
Guest recalled how his father had spoken of the risks of sharks and how he had " loved and respected the ocean environment " .
Brian Guest wrote on the Western Angler website forum in 2004 : " I have always had an understanding with my wife that if a shark or ocean accident caused my death then so be it , at least it was doing what I wanted .
Every surfer , fisherman and diver has far more chance of being killed by bees , drunk drivers , teenage car thieves and lightning .
Every death is a tragedy – regardless of the cause – but we have no greater claim to use of this earth than any of the other creatures [ we ] share it with . "
His son said he viewed his father 's death as a random event that should not make people fear the water , and said he would eventually go back into the sea .
" When I 'm ready … I 'll do that . "

Belgian police arrested a 31 - year - old mother , who was accused of treating her newborns in a debasing way and with fraud after a Dutch couple informed authorities that she had conned them .
According to the police , Sonia Ringoir , sold her newborn twins for GBP9,000 ( $ 13,500 ) so she could have a liposuction operation .
To sell her babies , the woman engaged in an online rent - a - womb trade , where different women , who desperately wanted children , offered their price .
According to Tamara and Gideon Stegeman , the couple who wanted to buy the twins , the woman had run so - called " sperm parties " in her big family house located in Lovendegem , a small village near Ghent .
Mrs Stegeman said that Ringoir charged GBP300 a time in order to be inseminated with her husband 's sperm .
She added that the event looked like a coffee party where people drank a cup of coffee and then went into a room with a syringe .
The Dutch couple confessed that they attended three " sperm parties " and spent GBP900 , hoping that the woman would bear them a child .
Both Tamara and Gideon were unaware that Ringoir made the same promise to another couple over the Internet and charged GBP1,800 for 5 impregnation trips .
It was reported that the woman has operated as Sary Levy .
However , her real identity was revealed by a Dutch TV program .
The Network 's reporters followed Ringoir to her home .
The operation was part of an investigation into an online surrogate baby fraud between Belgium and the Netherlands .
The arrested woman is the mother of five other offsprings aged between 3 and 13 .
She decided to give her twins to a friend and the Stegemans were left with nothing .
Ringoir said that she did not ask money from her friend .
However , her 48 - year - old husband Marc Poppe , told an undercover reporter from Holland that the woman charged money in order to pay for a liposuction operation .
After breaking up with her husband , Ringoir found herself a new boyfriend who gave an interview to a Belgian newspaper , saying that it was her former husband who pushed Sonia Ringoir to " have her body rebuilt " .
The woman cannot be charged with trading her children due to the fact that according to the Belgian law this is not considered crime .
Ringoir may face 1 to 5 months in jail if found guilty .
This case raised serious concerns in Belgium and politicians have already started thinking about changing the law , reports Daily Mail .
Imeem for Android is a music application from Imeem.com available for free at the Android Market .
This application caught my eye as one of the early front - runners in popularity at the Android Market .
I ’ve been using it for about a month , and I listen just about daily .
As a music app , it ’s faster and easier to use than the music player that ’s built into the G1 handset .
If you ’re more in the mood for a genre than for a specific song or artist , it ’s a better choice .
One of the application ’s strengths is its buffering capabilities .
You wo n’t get any hiccups or skips in songs — even in an elevator .
I ’ve had songs restart on me once or twice after a few seconds of playing , but Imeem definitely got streaming right with this application .
Local Favorites
One of the fun features is a station that plays the songs that are currently hot in your area .
One recent visit to the “ Los Angeles ” channel served up some fresh new Britney Spears , Kanye West and even Paris Hilton ; it definitely did n’t offer any music I ’d actually want to listen to .
Imeem claims to customize its music feed based on your preferences .
The interface on the G1 does include a “ heart ” button that allows you to tell it that you like the song you ’re hearing .
But what does pushing that button do ?
Imeem lacks a clear indication of how the user ’s input influences the music selection going forward .
If I push the “ heart ” button , does that mean the system is learning my preferences and using that to create a better mix of music for me ?
I ’d like to think so , but I still end up hearing roughly the same mix of music on each of the stations I listen to .
Perhaps the input is being used in a more macro fashion , such as to link bands and music styles to each other , but I want a little more .
Where ’s My Station ?
The Imeem Android app offers the option to create a separate station based on my favorite artists , but when I go to that station , nothing plays .
This kind of feature seems to exist on the Web version of Imeem , but it has n’t translated effectively to the Android client just yet .
One other thing I ’ve noticed is that artists I set as favorites on my phone do n’t necessarily show up as such on the Web site .
So , while Imeem says its Android app “ seamlessly integrates with features on imeem.com , ” I would say the seams are showing .
Still , for the way I use it — as Web radio on the go — Imeem is a worthwhile application that mixes in some new bands and additional familiar music along with the music it already knows you like .

Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters ( SGRs ) are strange and relatively rare objects , with only five known to exist ( four in the Milky Way and one in the Large Magellanic Cloud . )
Each is between 10 and 30 km across , yet contains about twice the mass of the Sun .
SGRs are collapsed cores of large stars that have exploded , called neutron stars , and seemingly , they refuse to die : they will repeatedly flare up after remaining quiet for long periods .
Now , ESA ’s XMM - Newton spacecraft zeroed in on one of these stellar zombies , SGR 1627 - 41 revealing it to be extremely unique and unusual .
What sets SGRs apart from other neutron stars is that they possess magnetic fields that are up to 1000 times stronger .
This has led astronomers to call them magnetars .
SGR 1627 - 41 was discovered in 1998 by NASA ’s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory when it burst into life emitting around a hundred short flares during a six - week period .
It then faded before X - ray telescopes could measure its rotation rate .
Thus , SGR 1627 - 41 was the only magnetar with an unknown period .
But now , XMM Newton was able to determine the rotation rate for the first time : it rotates once every 2.6 seconds .
“ This makes it the second fastest rotating magnetar known , ” says Sandro Mereghetti , INAF / Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica , Milan , one of the team .
Theorists are still puzzling over how these objects can have such strong magnetic fields .
One idea is that they are born spinning very quickly , at 2 - 3 milliseconds .
Ordinary neutron stars are born spinning at least ten times more slowly .
The rapid rotation of a new - born magnetar , combined with convection patterns in its interior , gives it a highly efficient dynamo , which builds up such an enormous field .
With a rotation rate of 2.6 seconds , this magnetar must be old enough to have slowed down .
Another clue to the magnetar ’s age is that it is still surrounded by a supernova remnant .
During the measurement of its rotation rate , XMM - Newton also detected X - rays coming from the debris of an exploded star , possibly the same one that created the magnetar .
“ These usually fade to invisibility after a few tens of thousand years .
The fact that we still see this one means it is probably only a few thousand years old ” , says Mereghetti .
If it flares again , the team plan to re-measure its rotation rate .
Any difference will tell them how quickly the object is decelerating .
There is also the chance that SGR 1627 - 41 will release a giant flare .
Only three such events have been seen in the last 30 years , each from a different SGR , but not from SGR 1627 - 41 .
These superflares can supply as much energy to Earth as solar flares , even though they are halfway across the Galaxy , whereas the Sun is at our celestial doorstep .
“ These are intriguing objects ; we have much still to learn about them , ” says Mereghetti .

Ford Motor Co. reported a $ 5.9 billion quarterly loss that was twice what many expected and said it would draw down its last credit lines sooner than anticipated , raising fresh questions about how long it can survive without a government bailout .
Ford burned through more than $ 5.5 billion in cash in the fourth quarter .
While that was down from the $ 7.7 billion it ran through in the third quarter it left the company with just $ 13.4 billion at year end , an amount it could use up in a few quarters if conditions remain dire .

K. Kouneva , a militant syndicalist of the cleaner 's union in Athens was attacked with sulphuric acid and is in intensive care .
The attack has led to the occupation of the Electric Railway HQs in Athens and a protest march to the hospital where she lies in coma .
On Monday protesters clashed with and routed riot police guarding the company 's offices in Piraeus .
On Monday 22 of December Konstantina Kouneva , militant syndicalist , general secretary of the cleaner ’s union of Athens ( Panattic Union of Cleaners and Domestic Personnel ) and active feminist was attacked with vitriolic acid by what she and her comrades claim to be agents of her bosses .
Konstantina , who comes from Bulgaria , has been actively campaigning for workers rights in one of the darkest sectors of the greek economy : companies that subhire female and predominantly immigrant , often sans - papiers , cleaners to state and private companies , as permited under a PaSoK ( Socialist Party ) law of 2001 .
Konstantina ’s bosses at OIKOMET , the company that provides cleaners to major banks and state magnates like the metro system and the national electricity company , have been known to have direct and close links to the political nepotistic establishment of the country .
The company ’s owner , Oikonomakis , has been a long term Socialist cadre in Pireaus .
According to the Union , Konstantina had been recently receiving a series of threat calls by company thugs in relation to her demand that the Christmas bonus is fully paid to its workers , who had been forced to sign a receipt of payment receiving only half their salary earlier this month .
Such threats apparently thickened after she started attending the Assembly of the Occupied General Worker ’s Union during the days of the December Uprising .
The attack that took place outside her flat in the traditional proletarian neighbourhood of Petralona and sent the syndicalist in coma , has already cost Konstantina one of her eyes , while doctors are struggling to save the other one and her phonetic chords .
In response to the bosses ’ attack and the general apathy of the media which have imposed a virtual blackout on the subject , a solidarity demo took place on the 26 of December outside Evangelismos hospital where she is been held in intensive care .
During the demo a police car that tried to cross nearby was attacked with rocks by the protesters .
Trying to organise more consistent and long - term counterinformation and solidarity action to the syndicalist , an Assembly for Solidarity to K. Kouneva has been formed late this week .
On Saturday 27 , the Assembly occupied the Headquarters of ISAP , the state - owned Athens - Piraeus Electric Railway Company , which has been hiring Konstantina along with hundreds of other cleaners by OIKOMET .
The Assembly hang banners condemning corporate violence and decided to hold a protest march in the centre of Athens on Sunday afternoon .
Despite the short - notice and the seasonal holiday , the march was attended by more than 500 people who marched to Evangelismos hospital chanting slogans like “ ISAP and the bosses throw vitriolic acid , we shall burn the city down ” , “ Class hatred , kick and punch the bosses ” and “ Konstantina you are not alone , bosses pigs murderers ” .
On Monday morning ( 29/12 ) , the Feminist Center of Athens held a demo outside the hospital , while cleaners blockaded the entrance of the OIKOMET offices forcing them to shut down .
In the same evening cleaners and solidarity protesters took to the streets of Piraeus , home of the OIKOMET premises .
When the protest march reached the offices , the protesters encountered riot policemen guarding the building .
In the clash that ensued the riot police forces were routed and were forced to run leaving shields , helmets and even shoes behind .
The text that follows is the pamphlet of the occupied ISAP HQs .
WHEN THEY MESS WITH ONE OF US
THEY MESS WITH ALL OF US
On the 27th of December we occupied the headquarters of ISAP ( Athens Piraeus Electric Railway ) as a first response to the murderous attack against Konstantina Kuneva on the 23-12-2008 .
Sulphuric acid was thrown at her face as she was returning home from work .
Konstantina is in the intensive care ward of Evangelismos hospital suffering serious sight and respiratory system problems .
Who was Konstantina ?
Why was she attacked ?
Konstantina is one among the hundreds of female immigrant workers who have been working for years as cleaners .
She is general secretary of the Panattic Union of Cleaners and Domestic Personnel .
She is a militant union organizer , well known for her stance against various bosses .
Just last week she had a clash with the employer company “ OIKOMET ” when she demanded for herself and the rest of her colleagues to get paid the whole amount of money of her Christmas bonus .
She also denounced illegal procedures in payments .
Just a short while ago the same company fired her mother in an act of revenge against her and she got herself an unfavourable transfer to Marousi station .
There is also a case of a three - part meeting in the Labour Inspection Office still pending on the 5 - 1- 2009 concerning a denouncement of hers .
Situations like these are not at all rare in the field of cleaning and employee lending companies .
It ’s exactly the opposite .
This is the rule when it comes to cleaning company contractors : delayed contracts , stolen wages , stolen overtime payments , differences between contract assets and what the employee actually gets paid , selection of almost exclusively immigrant male and female workers with green card status ( legal residency in Greece ranging from 1 to 5 years – in most cases only 1 year ) so they can be held in a state of hostageship , social security benefits that are never attributed .
All these under the support of the public sector and enterprises which are aware , incite and support working conditions reminiscent of the middle ages .
OIKOMET in particular , a cleaning company with enterprises all over Greece and owned by Nikitas Oikonomakis who is a member of PASOK ( Greek Socialist Party ) , “ officially ” employs 800 workers – on the other hand , workers say that their number is at least twice as much and during the last 3 years the turnover amounts to 3000 ) .
Illegal procedures on the part of the employer company are on the everyday list .
To be more specific , employees sign “ blank page contracts ” and they are never given a copy of them .
They work 6 hours a day but get paid for 4,5 ( including stamp ) because in this way they appear to be working less than 30 hours per week on paper and the boss is not forced to include them in the “ higher stamp category ” .
Employees get terrorized , they get unfavourable transfers , they get fired and blackmailed into resigning voluntarily ( a female employee was threatened by her employer into signing her resignation after being held for 4 hours in a space owned by the company ) .
The boss organised a “ yellow ” ( company ) union in order to manipulate employees while he fires and hires people as he wishes , ruling out any prospect of communication inside the workplace or collective action .
What is the connection between OIKOMET and ISAP ?
OIKOMET has been assigned as a contractor the cleaning of ISAP ( as well as the cleaning of other public sector and corporations ) because it can “ provide ” the cheapest deal that includes the highest level of exploitation and devaluation of work .
This “ regime ” of “ offer and demand ” is based on public sector organisations such as ISAP .
ISAP is an accomplice in maintaining this regime of crude exploitation despite repeated denouncements by the union .
The murderous attack against our colleague was an act of revenge and had the intent to serve as an example .
The target was not coincidental .
Female , immigrant , militant union organizer , mother of an underage child , she was the most vulnerable for the bosses .
The method was not coincidental .
It resembles “ dark ” ages and aims to “ brand ” , to serve as an example and terrorize us .
The time chosen was not coincidental .
The media , the political parties , the Church , businessmen and union bosses have been trying to ridicule the social movement that has taken the form of an explosion and talk about the cold - blooded murder of 15 - year - old Alexandros as the result of a bullet getting redirected .
In this pretext , the attack on Konstantina is lost in the everyday news .
This murderous attack on the part of the employers was well - planned .
Konstantina is one of us .
Her struggle for DIGNITY and SOLIDARITY is also our struggle .
The attack on Konstantina has left a mark in all our hearts .
It has left a mark in our memory as have done the racist pogroms , the concentration camps for immigrants , the attacks by thugs working for the state , the workplace accidents , the people murdered by the state , the working conditions that resemble galleys , the purges , the lay - offs and the terror .
All these show the long way ahead for the social and class struggle .
Our hearts are filled with sorrow and rage and one sentence comes to our lips :
MURDERERS , YOUR TIME WILL COME
THE EMPLOYERS TERROR SHALL NOT PASS
SOLIDARITY ASSEMBLY
FOR KONSTANTINA KUNEVA
This was dumb .
I underestimated my employer 's IT security personnel .
I theorized they were as slipshod an operation as most other departments I encountered .
Well , while investigating suspected unauthorized access to my company - provided laptop , I allowed them to get an image of the hard drive .
Although my attempts to conceal my personal use of said laptop ( I told myself it would be too much bother to back - up and restore later ) , they found it and stuff I forgot I even had .
After reporting the other employee had not done anything improper on my computer , I was immediately discharged for misuse of a company PC because they found ( what they considered ) a file that would enable me to pirate software , software capable of circumventing network security ( tunnelling software that I used from home ) , personal business use of the computer ( a Website I backed up for a non-profit organization but forgot to delete ) , porn ( vacation pics and possibly video ) and inappropriate language in chat logs .
Getting caught red - handed was n't so bad ... you live and learn .
Hey I would have fired me .
I later realized that some of the stuff I forgot about was more than likely backed up to a server I used as a sandbox .
It was a salvaged PC tagged for disposal when I pulled it from the heap .
Not knowing what was on that PC and how or if it was disposed of has caused me many restless nights .
The moral of this story ?
Never be tempted to use company - issued equipment for personal use .
And never underestimate the expertise of those hired to police ... no matter how high up the food chain you are .
Edward Graziano Solicits Hit Man to Kill Wife
This story did n't go at all the way we expected .
Although the family has not been in the news recently , was caught hiring a hit man .
Ed is the father ofwho was left in a vegetative state after being involved in a car crash with , who served 188 days in the county jail .
Our first instinct was that he would opt to off the Hulk himself or Nick after what happened to his son but we were wrong .
Graziano wanted his estranged wife permanently taken out .
How ?
In a car crash .
Creepy right ?
How does one go about this .... you might ask .
If you are Ed , you contact an undercover cop and offer him $ 1,100 in cash , write him a $ 1,000 personal check and do n't forget the $ 13.06 gift card to Westshore Pizza .
We do n't make this stuff up folks !
Graziano's arrest came after a two month long investigation .
As for his wife Debra - her lawyer says that she can't believe how much tragedy can happen to one family and that her priority will continue to be her son John .

Iran 's nuke program not weapons - capable , UN official says : report Jeremy Gantz
Published : Saturday February 21 , 2009

As experts argue Iran 's nuclear status , ' change ' may come in the country 's presidential election Can Iran build a nuclear bomb ?
The new answer to that long - debated question is " yes , " if you ask the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) .
The non-partisan think - tank , which focuses on stopping nuclear proliferation , released a report Thursday citing a brand - new report from the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog that declared Iran had reached " nuclear weapons breakout capability . "
Not so fast , says an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency , which released its report Thursday , according to IAEA 's website .
The report can be found here , at ISIS 's website .
" We think they 're not there yet , " the UN nuclear official told Press TV , speaking on condition of anonymity .
( Press TV is " the first Iranian international news network , " according to its website . )
The anonymous official said the Iranian enrichment program is " under surveillance at all times " and that there is no evidence Iran is building a secret facility to produce the enriched uranium required for nuclear bomb fuel .
The IAEA report says that Iran has produced a total of 1,010 kilograms of low enriched uranium hexafluoride as of January 31 , 2009 .
The ISIS report , which can be found here , calls that amount " sufficient for a nuclear weapons breakout capability . "
Yet , the IAEA report says that as of February 19th , results of environmental samples taken at fuel enrichment plants indicated that the plants " have been operating as declared [ by Iran ] ( i.e. less than 5.0 % U - 235 enrichment ) .
Since March 2007 , 21 unannounced inspections have been conducted at FEP . "
But despite the low - key tone of the U.N. 's new five - page report , Israel 's ambassador to the U.S. seized on its findings , calling Friday for " immediate and serious action . "
" It 's an extremely worrisome report ...
It emphasizes that with every day passing , Iran is getting closer to a nuclear military capacity , " Sallai Meridor told FOXNews.com .
" The world must take immediate and serious action in order to prevent this nightmare from happening . "
Meridor said sanctions against Iran should be increased , and that if Iran were to achieve nuclear capability , a " nuclear genie " would be released that would " endanger every society in the world . "
Obama administration officials have called Iran 's uranium enrichment activities an " urgent problem , " differing little from former president George W. Bush 's administration on the issue , although Obama has said he 's willing to negotiate with Iran .
Iran denies trying to build a nuclear bomb .
" Iran has observed international regulations and depriving Iran of nuclear technology is impossible , " Ali Larijani , the country 's parliament speaker , said Saturday while visiting former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder during a meeting in Tehran .
Meanwhile in Iran Saturday , Iranian authorities blocked two websites promoting the presidential bid of Mohammed Khatami , according to reformists supporting the former president , the Associated Press reported .
The blockages  Yaarinews.com and Yaari.ir could not be accessed from within Iran , but were viewable outside of the country  signals that hard - liners supporting current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may seek to stop Khatami from winning the June 12th election .
Khatami , who declared on Feb. 8th he was running for president again , made dialogue with the West a major part of his eight years as president , which ran from 1997 to 2005 .
" Reformist opponents assume they can block the path of people 's understanding but people are wise enough to judge these actions , " prominent Khatami ally Majid Ansari said , referring to the website blockages .
If the moderate Khatami were to win June 's election , it might in some ways mirror Obama 's victory .
Obama has signaled a willingness to dialogue with Iran  a clear break from Bush , who famously labeled Iran part of the " Axis of Evil "  particularly over the Islamic Republic 's controversial nuclear program .
" On Nov. 4 , 2008 , change came to America .
On June 12 , 2009 , hopefully change will come to Iran , " Morgan Negrin wrote Friday in Pipe Dream , Binghamton University 's student newspaper .
But it is unclear how the outcome of June 's election will alter what is  or is not , depending on who 's speaking  happening in Iran 's nuclear power program .

Slugs and snails are annoying pests , more so as they are “ invisible ” .
They are rarely seen at work because they come out at night and hide in dark and moist places , mostly underground .
I accidentally discovered this very easy and organic way of reducing and eventually eliminating slugs from the garden .
Initially , I had a problem with a cat from the neighborhood .
Mostly in spring when our small city patch is bare and being prepared for new seedlings , the cat would be inspired to dig in and do her business there .
I tried several tactics and one was to scatter squeezed out orange halves around the garden .
I read somewhere it deters the cats .
Eventually , the cat stopped coming due to oranges , new seedlings planted , or other tricks .
But what I discovered when I went to the garden after dark was dozens of snails in each orange half !
It took only minute to collect the orange halves with all the snails in them , probably close to hundred .
Now , whenever I make freshly squeezed orange juice , I scatter the halves around the garden edges and pick them later , usually few hours after dark .
I just make sure one edge is close to the ground so the slugs have an easy access .
Grapefruit halves work as well .
What to do with all the slugs ?
Up till now , I usually put them all in a plastic bag and threw them in the rubbish bin .
Now that our three chickens are bigger , I ’ll try offering the slugs to them .
Apparently , some chickens love the snails and the other not - it ’s all matter of taste .
Alternatively , they can be kept in a container and offered to the birds , drowned in soapy water or squashed ( I could n’t do this somehow ) .
There are other natural and organic methods of slug and snail control available , especially if your garden is n’t close to where you live .
Wandering with a torch in a community garden at night for example would n’t be the wisest slug control option !
Instead you might try this :
Beer trap : mix a little flour with a stale beer and fill a shallow container with the rim 1 or 2 cm above the ground so that slugs and snails can climb .
Substitute beer for wine , sugar water or water mixed with yeas .
Coffee spray : make a weak coffee brew with ground coffee and water .
Spray the plants .
Pot trap : place a plant pot upside down in a shaded area of the garden away from seedlings and check regularly
Physical barriers : scatter crushed egg shells , sawdust or wood shavings around plants at risk .
Would you like to share your tips on natural control of slugs and snails in the garden ?

There are two theories about Google Apps ( Spreadsheet , Word- processor , GMail , etc. ) :
Google Apps will rapidly become a multi-billion dollar business that will diversify Google 's dependence on search
Google Apps will kill Microsoft
The first of these theories , a source outside Google familiar with Apps tells us , is laughable .
Two years after launching Apps , the source says , Google 's Enterprise division is targeting revenue of $ 10 million in 2009 ( 200,000 paid subscribers at $ 50 a pop ) .
The same source says that , privately , some Google executives hope the company might hit $ 40 million of revenue in 2009 ( 800,000 subs at $ 50 a pop ) .
Both of these numbers are a joke .
Why so little revenue ?
The source says Google is having a devil of a time persuading free Google Apps users to sign up for the paid version .
That said , the fact that Google is apparently having trouble building Apps into a real business does NOT mean that Apps is n't a big threat to Microsoft .
Google Apps are a classic disruptive technology .
They meet the needs of casual users ( whereas Microsoft Office is vastly over - featured ) .
They are simple and convenient ( we use them almost exclusively ) .
Their price , free , ca n't be beat .
Google Apps could end up being a lousy , puny business for Google and still steal a huge chunk of revenue and profit from Redmond .
So do n't give up on that second theory .

Often , a developer 's goal is to create software that runs on many different operating systems , while giving users the same experience no matter which operating system they happen to be using .
Virtual machine technology lets developers run multiple operating systems each installed in a VM , which should save them time and money -- if the VM performance does n't suffer .
To determine whether it 's viable to run a VM as a testing / developing environment for software development , I ran a battery of performance tests , all using Java running on various configurations of Ubuntu Linux and Windows .
This allowed comparisons between the host control PCs and the virtual setups .
I created tests to compare three factors : processing speed , speed of the network interface cards , and input / output speeds of hard drives , all comparing performance on the various configurations .
The source for all of the test programs is available for download here .
The processor speeds and RAM allotments of the host PC and the guest PC were :
The host PC sees a 1.73 - GHz processor and 2.00 GB of RAM .
The guest PC sees a 1.73 GHZ processor and 512 MB of RAM .
The difference in the RAM is because the guest gets allocated 512 MB ( or as specified ) of the 2.00 GB of the host .
There were six total configurations on which I conducted tests .
I ran two controls using only the host :
One test on Ubuntu Linux .
One test on Microsoft 's Windows XP .
The other tests were run on combinations of hosts and guests :
Ubuntu Linux ( guest ) on Ubuntu Linux .
Windows ( guest ) on Ubuntu Linux .
Windows ( guest ) on Windows
Ubuntu Linux ( guest ) on Windows .
Each test was run 100 times and the results were averaged to get more accurate measurements .
All of the tests were run on clean installs of the operating systems with only the default settings to get the most unaffected and comparable results .
The first test was to determine the comparative processing speed of the configurations .
To test the processing speed , I wrote a test program that tabulates the time it takes to create 500,000 Java objects ( Figure 1 ) .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The results show a minor decrease in performance compared to the controls when the host operating system is the same as the guest operating system .
The most surprising result is the difference between running Ubuntu - on - Windows and running Windows - on - Ubuntu .
Windows - on - Ubuntu took more than twice the time in creating the objects compared to the control , while Ubuntu - on - Windows was actually faster than Windows - on - Windows .
Overall , the results show that there are no major differences between the guest and the host , Windows - on - Ubuntu notwithstanding .
I suspect that the large differences here are a result of the way the abstraction layer executes the Windows code when Ubuntu is the host .
The next test was to determine the comparative speed of the NICs on the various configurations .
To do this , I wrote a second test program that executes a SQL query through the Java Database Connectivity ( JDBC ) API ( Figure 2 ) .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The SQL query result set included 99,900 rows .
The results here show a distinct speed difference when using Ubuntu as the host system , compared to Windows as the host .
I suspect that the reason is that drivers for devices such as NICs are specifically written by manufacturers for Windows , while drivers in Linux distributions ( such as Ubuntu ) are written by the open - source community , which may lead to slight differences in implementations .
There is almost no speed difference between the Windows control and the guests on Windows .
On the Ubuntu side , there is a little more variation , with the surprise that Ubuntu on Ubuntu is the slowest ( although not exceedingly far behind the control ) .
Again , I attribute this to the drivers for Ubuntu being written by the open - source community instead of NIC manufacturer .
The third test program I wrote determines the comparative input / output speeds of hard drives on the various configurations .
To do this , the program outputs a large text file , which the program reads back in .
The speeds of each operation are then calculated ( Figure 3 ) .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The key thing to remember is that the VM 's so - called " hard drive " is actually just a file on the host 's hard drive .
These results show little variation when Windows is the host , but much more variation when Ubuntu is the host .
With Windows and Ubuntu as the controls , their results are similar , as are the two guest configurations on Windows .
The main surprise in this test is that Windows - on - Ubuntu was almost twice as slow on both the input and the output side of things .
A final test program took in all of the previous tests for an overall perspective on performance , using a program that queries a SQL database and outputs the result set to a file .
It then reads the file back in and creates objects populated with what 's in the file ( Figure 4 ) .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The tests show similar results across the board , with the exception of Windows - on - Ubuntu , which underperformed the others consistently .
The tests show fairly conclusively that , except for the Windows - on - Ubuntu case , a VM is just as usable as a physical PC for software development .
While there 's a slight degradation in performance in many cases , the decrease is minor overall and likely worth the efficiency gains from having any operating system readily available .

Proposals by UK Culture Secretary , Andy Burnham , to introduce cinema - style ratings for websites across the globe might benefit from a little more fact - finding and a little less rhetoric .
On the other hand , the danger of open - minded research , is that it might just expose New Labour waffle to the harsh realities of how things actually work .
Over in Australia , government plans to filter the entire internet are in total disarray , as a pilot exercise planned to be " all over by Christmas " has now been put back to January .
Or maybe even February .
At the same time , the cack - handed approach by the Australian government on this issue – most notably by Mr Burn ’em ’s opposite number , Stephen Conroy - appears to have had the embarrassing effect of creating mass opposition to government proposals , by politicians , ISPs and the general public , as well as kicking off a public debate on the whole question of what the government should be censoring .
A bad year for Stephen Conroy ended in final humiliation , as it emerged last week that he appears to have been sitting on a report , handed to him in February 2008 , which explained that the concept of internet filtering was " fundamentally flawed " .
Meanwhile , back in Europe , the Romanian Authority for Communication ( ANC ) has been asking ISPs to block access to 40 websites hosted in Romania , on the grounds that they do not meet the criteria imposed by article 7 of Law no .196/2003 on preventing and fighting pornography .
The Romanian government huffed and puffed about the dangerous content of such sites , whilst ANC President Liviu Nistoran declared that the list of blocked sites would not be made public , " to avoid encouraging their accessing in the following period " .
Unfortunately , for Romania ’s guardians of public morality , a scanned version of this list leaked online in early December and appeared to contain a well - known user - generated video - sharing website ( 220.ro ) , a redirect to a .com website and a number of websites hosted on some free hosting accounts based in Romania .
Still , this is the sort of shady censorship one would expect from a country such as Romania : in the UK , we do things very differently and the list of sites blocked by our own Internet Watch Foundation is , er , a secret .
Whilst it is quite possible that some cunning pervs might make use of a banned list to go shopping on their own account , a more plausible reason for this secrecy might be found nearer to home , in Denmark .
They , too , maintain a secret list of internet sites , banned mostly at the request of the Danish police and the Danish " Save the Children " group .
Unfortunately for the Danish authorities , when this list was published on Wiki - leaks last week , it was found to contain a number of US - based sites with a prominently displayed USC 2257 notice .
And a Dutch transport company ( caution : according to Danish authorities , clicking this site means you could be a paedophile ! ) .
For those unfamiliar with the intricacies of US porn publishing , the USC 2257 requirement sets a very tough standard for anyone wishing to publish pornography , including requirements to keep records of age of models , consent forms – and a contact address .
Interestingly , neither the Romanian nor Danish authorities had any complaints about sites being wrongly included on their list – until the lists were so irresponsibly published .
This again is quite unlike the UK , where the IWF have never had anyone complain about being included on their unpublished list .
Until a couple of weeks ago , when it became public knowledge that amongst the sites blocked was a page – including perfectly legal written content – from Wikipedia .
Despite an apparent ignorance of many of the issues involved – Mr Burn ’em famously seemed to believe that YouTube and MySpace were very similar propositions – it is about time such a debate was started .
Governments have been encouraging censorship for years , and these cases provide just a flavour of what is already happening worldwide : secret listings ; blocks that cannot be appealed ; and judgments made by police and unelected authorities with no recourse to any court of law .
For a more detailed overview , El Reg readers might like to pick up a copy of Access Denied , published in December 2008 by MIT Press and the Open Net Initiative .
This provides a country by country overview of what is happening now and the issues associated with filtering .
A major problem for any form of global ratings system is that countries cannot even agree a common age of consent , with sexual intercourse variously legal for ages ranging from 13 to 21 depending on the country you happen to reside in .
Anyone who thinks otherwise might wish to take a look at the following YouTube clip by that icon of French culture , Serge Gainsbourg .
It is called " Lemon Incest " and features father and daughter in a mainstream video that would quite possibly fail the test of decency in the UK .
( Perhaps the IWF should take a look ? )
If two countries with so much in common cannot agree on an issue of this sort , what hope can there possibly be for a global standard on " decency " ?
Coulter advocates punching protesters on live TV John Byrne
Published : Thursday January 8 , 2009
Print This Email This Outspoken conservative author Ann Coulter said Republicans should have " punched " two protesters who interrupted Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's speech to the Republican National Convention last September on Tuesday 's " Lou Dobbs Tonight . " '
Coulter , known for her over - the - top attacks on Democrats , bemoaned the liberal protesters and the muted response of " strong Republican men " on the convention floor .
" How about a punch in the yap to these screaming banshees ? " she asked .
She also tried to tie the two women to Obama , saying they were " Obama bundlers . "
A video of her comments appears below .
Coulter also praised NBC's Matt Lauer , who recently interviewed her on The Today Show after sharp criticism from liberal bloggers .
" Oh , it was fabulous , " Coulter said of her interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's The Today Show .
Dobbs praised the conservative icon , saying she had the " sharpest tongue " and calling her the sharpest wit out there . "
He added that he " admire [ d ] the energy you bring to your cause . "
One of the protesters is pictured above right as law enforcement offers placed a hand over her mouth .
In a September 2008 press release , they said they " adjusted their clothes to reveal pink slips that read ' Palin is not a woman 's choice , '... [ and ] yelled " Women say no to war ! " and " Women need a vice - president for peace ! ' "
Code Pink , a anti-war group , is known for their aggressive tactics .
They also interrupted a speech by Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) on global warming in 2007 .
Fox News morning host Brian Kilmead said that the Clinton protester should have been tased .
" They should Tase this guy , " Kilmead said .
" At one point with security so high and tensions on edge , do n't you think they 're going to get at the very least Tased or beaten to a pulp by somebody ?
These people look threatening . "
" I would be for Tasing anyone in Code Pink , " he added .
" I'm pro-Pink Tasing . "
Hackety.org - How Are Those Guys Datamoshing ?
Datamoshing とは，部分的に破壊された圧縮映像を再生する際に現れる「映像の乱れ」をエフェクトとして活用する技法のこと。
2000 年代後半になって登場した比較的新しい技法であり，これを意識的に使用したのは
David OReilly や Takeshi Murata などのアーティストが最初であるとされている。
Datamoshing の原理と制作手順については Rosa Menkman による記事によくまとめられている。基本的には，特定のコーデックによって圧縮された映像を，特定の（解析しやすい）コンテナに格納し，その中からキーフレーム ( I - Frame ) を探し出して，バイナリエディタを使って破壊するだけ。こうして改変された映像データを特定のプレイヤーで再生すると，動き補償の基準となるフレームを失ったまま動き補償を行うことになり（それをやってくれないプレイヤーもあるため，プレイヤーは選ばなくてはならない），元映像の動きの情報によって画像が掻き混ぜられるという，非常に複雑で奇妙な効果が生まれる。
Datamoshing の技法の面白いところは，ひとつに，「技術 」 が「質感」に変わる瞬間を見ているという点にあると思う。以前，「JPEG
圧縮によるモスキートノイズが『味』として解釈されるようになる日がいつか来る」というようなことを言っていた絵描きさんがいたのだけれど，なかなかそういった感情を持つ機会は，これまでに現れなかった。また，「MP3 のエンコーダーによる音質の劣化の違いが『個性』として解釈されるようになる日が来るかもしれない」というようなことを言っていたミュージシャンもいたのだけれど，これもやはり，そのような心境になる機会はこれまでになかった。
Datamoshing の登場は，このような 「『技術』が『質感』になる日」がとうとう来るのだということを予感させる出来事だと思う。
もうひとつの面白い点は，この技法は非常に情報量の多い映像効果であるということ。例えば，何か他のまっとうな映像エフェクトを使うときに，どの程度の情報をそこに与えているかを考えてみて欲しい。せいぜい十数個のスライダーをいじって設定を行うものじゃないだろうか。それがこの datamoshing では，元の映像に含まれる動きの情報すべてが，画像を変化させていく要素となって与えられる。それは十数個のスライダーをチクチクと調整していくよりも，劇的に複雑な効果を簡単に生み出すことができるという可能性を秘めていると思う。
MS causes damage to nerve cells Stem - cell transplants may control and even reverse multiple sclerosis symptoms if done early enough , a small study has suggested .
Not one of 21 adults with relapsing - remitting MS who had stem cells transplanted from their own bone marrow deteriorated over three years .
And 81 % improved by at least one point on a scale of neurological disability , The Lancet Neurology reported .
Further tests are now planned , and a UK expert called the work " encouraging " .
MS is an autoimmune disease which affects about 85,000 people in the UK .
It is caused by a defect in the body 's immune system , which turns in on itself , causing damage to the nerves which can lead to symptoms including blurred vision , loss of balance and paralysis .
Stem cells are showing more and more potential in the treatment of MS and the challenge we now face is proving their effectiveness in trials involving large numbers of people
Dr Doug Brown , MS Society
At first , the condition mostly causes intermittent symptoms that are partly reversible .
Over a 10 - 15 year period after onset , most patients develop secondary - progressive MS , with gradual but irreversible neurological impairment .
It is not the first time this treatment - known as autologous non-myeloablative haemopoietic stem - cell transplantation - has been tried in people with MS , but there has not been a great deal of success .
The researchers at Northwestern University School of Medicine in Chicago said most other studies had tried the transplants in people with secondary - progressive MS where the damage had already been done .
In the latest trial patients with earlier stage disease who , despite treatment had had two relapses in the past year , were offered the transplant .
Immune system
Stem cells were harvested from the patients and frozen while drugs were given to remove the immune cells or lymphocytes causing the damage .
The stem cells were then transplanted back to replenish the immune system - effectively resetting it .
Five patients in the study relapsed , but went into remission after receiving other therapy .
The researchers are now doing a randomised controlled trial in a larger number of patients to compare the treatment with standard therapy .
Study leader Professor Richard Burt said this was the first MS study of any treatment to show reversal of damage .
" You do n't want to wait until the horse has left the barn before you close the barn door - you want to treat early .
" I think the reversal is the brain repairing itself .
" Once you 're at the progressive stage you have exceeded the ability of the brain to repair itself , " he said .
However , he cautioned that it was important to wait for the results of the larger trial .
And that he would not call it a cure but " changing the natural history of the disease " .
Dr Doug Brown , research manager at the MS Society , said the results were very encouraging .
" It 's exciting to see that in this trial not only is progression of disability halted , but damage appears to be reversed .
" Stem cells are showing more and more potential in the treatment of MS and the challenge we now face is proving their effectiveness in trials involving large numbers of people . "

Remember the Interior Department ’s sex , drugs , and oil scandal ?
After investigating , the Interior Department released a September 2008 report that concluded Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) employees “ frequently consumed alcohol at industry functions , had used cocaine and marijuana , and had sexual relationships with oil and gas company representatives . ”
Several employees were terminated , but only there were only two subsequent convictions .
( Read more about MMS corruption here and here . )
Well , the new Interior Secretary Ken Salazar plans to reopen the MMS investigations .
From the Denver Post :
U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Thursday that he has ordered a re-examination of the scandalized Interior Department division based in Lakewood , including why the U.S. Justice Department did not pursue more criminal prosecutions ….
Salazar stressed that he wants to examine why Bush administration prosecutors in the public - integrity unit did n’t pursue criminal cases against others .
“ There ’s a new sheriff in town , ” Salazar said during a news conference at the MMS complex .
“ We will be visiting with the new U.S. attorney general and take a new look at it . ”
As TPMMuckraker notes , Salazar also mentioned re-opening investigations into the Steven Griles affair , in which the Interior Department ’s No. 2 was convicted in connection to the Jack Abramoff scandal .
Salazar ’s Wild West bluster , complete with bolo tie and cowboy hat , is certainly a welcome change to the industry sweetheart deals of the Bush years .
But let ’s be honest : the Interior Department is a bureaucratic beast and old habits die hard , especially with the Bushies digging in .

Jenny McCarthy Fears For Son's Life
Actresswas hit hard by the details ofand 's recent tragedy .
passed away after having a seizure on January 2nd and for McCarthy that reality could have been hers as well .
A few years back Jenny 's son Evan also suffered a seizure and went into cardiac arrest .
The young child was said to be " clinically dead " for a few minutes but was brought back to life by paramedics .
" I too watched the paramedics do CPR on Evan , and I did n't know if he was going to come back .
We did get him back and then he suffered another seizure last year , when we had to put Evan in a coma for four days , so he would n't go into cardiac arrest .
So I live on that edge that they ( Travolta and Preston ) have lived with Jett for all those years . "
Jenny is very vocal in her fight to raise awareness for autism as well as her fight against childhood vaccinations .
She and her boyfriendhave used their celebrity status to bring these issues to the forefront .

Google has released an alpha of Chrome 2.0 , even though work on version 1.0 of the browser remains incomplete .
The unpolished Chrome 2.0 rocked up in the early hours of today and comes loaded with the latest WebKit release that adds support for various CSS functions and speed improvements .
Spell checking can now be enabled or disabled in a text field with a simple click of the mouse .
More language support has been added for the function too .
The browser also comes with the form autocomplete feature which remains missing in action in Chrome 1.0 .
It landed in September last year and had the beta tag removed in uncharacteristically speedy fashion by Google last month .
That ’s despite the fact that the Mac and Linux versions of the open source browser remain notably absent .
Google ’s release notes for the Chrome 2.0 pre-beta offer some hints about when those versions might arrive , however .
Chrome 2.0 uses a new network code that might mean fanboys and gals will finally get their mitts on the Firefox , Safari and Internet Explorer rival .
It now has its own implementation of the HTTP network protocol , said Google .
The internet giant was previously using the WinHTTP library on Windows , thereby inadvertently shunning Mac and Linux because of the lack of common code .
“ We fixed a few bugs in HTTP authentication and made Google Chrome more compatible with servers that reply with invalid HTTP responses , ” said the company .
“ We need feedback on anything that 's currently broken , particularly with proxy servers , secure ( https ) sites , and sites that require log in . ”
So there you have it , perhaps the wait is nearly over for Mactards and Linux lovers keen to Google the web via Google ’s browser . ®

Fellow media haters , we do n’t ask for much , but could ya click on the Digg icon for this one so we can get it passed around the net ?
It ’s just too funny to let others miss !
I love my job .
I live my job .
For every project I do , I try to make it look special .
I ’ll be honest : I have a fetish for comments like “ I never saw anything like that ! ” or , “ I wish I thought of that ! ” .
I know , I have an ego - problem .
( Eleven I ’s already )
But sometimes , you run out of inspiration .
Happens to everybody , and everybody hates it .
“ I ’m the worst designer in the world . ”
“ Everything I designed before this was just pure luck ! ”
No it was n’t .
Countless articles about finding inspiration have already been written .
Great , but they ’re not the magic potion you ’d expect them to be when you need it .
Here ’s a list of small tips that can have immediate effect when applying them / using them .
Main theme : Liberate yourself from the designers ’ block by restricting yourself .
Do’s
Grids
If you are n’t already using grids , you ’re doing something wrong .
Not only are they a great help for aligning your design , they also restrict you to certain widths and heights .
( For more information about grids , I suggest you read Mark Boulton ’s series on designing grid systems .
Oh , he ’s also publishing a book I think . )
So what ’s the link between grids and restrictions ?
Instead of having the option to style a piece of layout with a width of 1 to 960 pixels , you have to choose from values like 60 pixels , 140 , 220 , 300 , …
Start small
Having a hard time finding a style for the layout , why do n’t you start with one small object ?
No , not that small object , I meant a piece of a form , or a link , or try styling your headers ( h1 – h6 ) .
Let ’s take a submit button of a form : it ’s small , but needs much attention .
People will click it .
People will hover it .
Maybe sometimes it ’s disabled ?
Also : a button needs to look like a button , so typically it requires more styling then a regular link .
Once you ’ve got the button , move on , following the button ’s style .
Color palettes
There are lots of resources on the web for finding inspiration for color palettes .
Some of the most famous are COLOURlovers , wear palettes and Adobe ’s Kuler .
Browse through them ( or create your own from a picture ) , pick a color palette you like and which works with the subject you ’re handling , and stick with it .
4 - 5 colors , maybe with some tonal variations , but that ’s it .
Fonts
There are n’t many fonts available for the web ( Richard Rutter has a great article on this subject ) , but you ’d be surprised how long they go .
A simple text - transform : uppercase ; or font - style : italic ; can change a dull looking font into something entirely fresh .
Play around with the fonts you want to use and the variations you ’ll be using , and make a list .
Pick five combinations of fonts and their variations , and stick with them throughout the layout .
Single - task
Most of us use multiple monitors .
They ’re great to increase productivity , but make it harder to focus on a single task .
Here ’s what you do : try using only your smallest monitor .
Maybe it ’s the one from your laptop , maybe it ’s an old 1024 × 768 you found in the attic .
Having Photoshop ( or Fireworks or … ) taking over your entire workspace blocks out all the other distractions on your screen , and works quite liberating .
Mute everything …
… but not entirely .
I noticed I was way more focused when I set NetNewsWire to refresh it ’s feeds only once every two hours .
After two hours , I need a break anyway .
Turning off Twitterrific was a mistake , as it ’s my window to the world , and it ’s the place where the people I like to call colleagues live .
You ca n’t exactly ask them to bring you a cup of coffee when they go to the vending machine , but they do keep you fresh , and it stops you from going human - shy .
Instead I changed the settings to not play a notification sound when new Tweets arrive so it does n’t disturb me when I ’m zoning .
Don’ts
CSS galleries
Do n’t start browsing all kinds of CSS galleries .
Either you ’ll feel bad , or you just start using elements in a way you ca n’t call “ inspired ” anymore .
Instead gather your own collection of inspiration .
Example : I use LittleSnapper in which I dump everything I find inspiring .
This goes from a smart layout idea , to a failed picture someone posted on Flickr .
Everything is inspiring .
Panicking
Do n’t panic .
It ’s the worst thing you could do .
Instead , get away from the computer , and go to bed early .
A good night of sleep combined with a hot / cold shower can give you a totally new perspective on a design .
Got a deadline by tomorrow ?
Well , you should ’ve started earlier .
Got a good excuse to start on this design this late ?
Tell your client it was either that or a bad design .
120 - hour work - week
Do n’t work all day long , including evenings and early mornings .
Write off that first hour , you do n’t really think you ’ll get anything productive done before 9AM ?!
I do n’t even think you should work on one and the same design all day long .
If you ’re stuck , try working in blocks of 1 or 2 hours on a certain design .
Mixing projects is n’t for everyone , but it might just do the trick for you .

When it comes to understanding the options available to a central bank for managing an economy where interest rates are very low , U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote the book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ well , a presentation paper actually , and , technically , he co-authored it , but no matter .
In 2004 , Bernanke Ã¢â‚¬â€ œtogether with Vincent R. Reinhart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ delivered a paper titled Conducting Monetary Policy at Very Low Short - Term Interest Rates before the Monetary and Banking Studies Lecture in Geneva .
Given recent events Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s wave of interest rate cuts that rolled across the European continent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a look at this document is most timely and could provide insight into additional actions central banks may take to deal with the global crisis .
The situation now facing the Group of Seven countries and indeed all of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s major economies , is that as central banks close in on a zero or near - zero interest rate policy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also known as a zero - bound policy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ further interest rate cuts become impossible .
Despite this constraint limiting options available to central banks , Bernanke and Reinhart discuss three other monetary tools that can be implemented even in a zero - bound economy :
1. Shaping Interest Rate Expectations
2. Altering the Composition of the Central BankÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Balance Sheet
3. Expanding the Size of the Central BankÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Balance Sheet
Shaping Interest Rate Expectations
The most commonly - used monetary tool used by central banks is the setting of short - term interest rates .
This is because these rates impact the cost borne by commercial banks to acquire funds and this directly influences commercial rates that companies and individual consumers must pay to borrow money .
Short - term interest rates also influence the valuation of longer - term assets such as equities and fixed - income bonds so in addition to directly impacting the money supply by adjusting short - term lending rates , a central bank can also influence the value of longer - term securities .
It is because of this relationship between short and longer - term interest rates , that central banks use the setting of rates as a primary monetary tool .
In times of inflation , central banks can tighten monetary policy by increasing the cost of borrowing to discourage spending in a bid to ease inflating prices .
When deflation is the problem and the economy needs a stimulus , central banks will pursue a policy to expand the economy by reducing interest rates to promote borrowing and , ultimately , more spending .
The current situation however , defies this conventional approach to managing the economy .
Productivity is on the decline in many countries and despite deep interest rate cuts imposed by these jurisdictions which have lowered interest rates to near zero , growth is still falling .
The problem now facing the central banks is obvious Ã¢â‚¬â€œ having already hit the interest rate floor , further cuts are now Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ or soon will be Ã¢â‚¬â€œ impossible .
Despite this fact , the authors point out that central banks can still use interest rates as a stimulus for the economy by offering a firm commitment to maintaining low interest rates for a longer period of time than may be otherwise expected .
Such a pledge may provide the impetus needed to prompt companies and consumers to borrow and spend money now , safe in the knowledge that they will have access to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ cheapÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â credit for the stated period of time .
Bernanke and Reinhart refer to this as an unconditional interest rate commitment .
By way of contrast , the authors refer to a conditional interest rate commitment as a pledge to keep interest rates at a specific level until some form of condition is met .
For instance , the central bank could commit to keeping interest rates at 0.25 percent until growth reaches at least 1.5 percent or until some other economic indicator suggests that the economy is gaining ground .
Altering the Composition of the Central BankÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Balance Sheet
Central banks tend to hold many types of assets on their balance sheets and the make up of these assets can be used as another form of monetary tool .
To illustrate how this can work , Bernanke notes that in 2004 when this article was written at least , the Federal Reserve held roughly $ 670 billion worth of Treasury securities with maturities from a few weeks up to thirty years , but the average maturity was in the one to four year range .
Because the Federal Reserve is a dominant force in the Treasury market , it can use its incredible buying power to influence term premiums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and ultimately overall yields Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by buying securities of a certain maturity range .
For example , a shift from shorter to longer - term securities could cause the value of shorter - term securities to appreciate having much the same effect as increasing short - term interest rates .
Influencing the economy in this manner , is referred to as quantitative easing and is based on the premise that a central bank Ã¢â‚¬â€œ through various actions in the open market Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can influence prices and security valuations .
Expanding the Size of the Central BankÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Balance Sheet
In a similar vein , central banks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in addition to changing the composition of their balance sheet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can also alter the size or value of the balance sheet .
This is also a form of quantitative easing and can be used by a central bank to directly affect the level of reserves held by the commercial banks and the overall supply of money within the economy .
This means that even if short - term interest rates are zero effectively making it free for banks to borrow money in the overnight market , impacting the availability of money can still directly affect spending levels .
Thus , if the central bank were to sell securities or lower the reserve requirements commercial banks must hold on deposit , the result would be more money available for lending which is the same result a central bank desires when lowering interest rates .
New Rochelle , NY , January 29 , 2009 -- Two common strains of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , commonly known as MRSA , were virtually eradicated in the laboratory by exposing them to a wavelength of blue light , in a process called photo - irradiation that is described in a paper published online ahead of print in Photomedicine and Laser Surgery .
The article will appear in the April 2009 issue ( Volume 27 , Number 2 ) of the peer - reviewed journal published by Mary Ann Liebert , Inc .
The paper is available free online at www.liebertpub.com/pho
Antibiotic - resistant bacterial infections represent an important and increasing public health threat .
At present , fewer than 5 % of staphylococcal strains are susceptible to penicillin , while approximately 40 % - 50 % of Staph aureus isolated have developed resistance to newer semisynthetic antibiotics such as methicillin as well .
Chukuka S. Enwemeka , Deborah Williams , Sombiri K. Enwemeka , Steve Hollosi , and David Yens from the New York Institute of Technology ( Old Westbury , NY ) had previously demonstrated that photo - irradiation using 405 - nm light destroys MRSA strains grown in culture .
In the current study , " Blue 470 - nm Light Kills Methicillin - Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) in Vitro , " the authors exposed bacterial colonies of MRSA to various doses of 470 - nm light , which emits no UV radiation .
The two MRSA populations studied -- the US - 300 strain of CA - MRSA and the IS - 853 strain of HA - MRSA -- represent prominent community - acquired and hospital - acquired strains , respectively .
The authors report that the higher the dose of 470 - nm blue light , the more bacteria were killed .
High - dose photo- irradiation was able to destroy 90.4 % of the US - 300 colonies and the IS - 853 colonies .
The effectiveness of blue light in vitro suggests that it should also be effective in human cases of MRSA infection , and particularly in cutaneous and subcutaneous infections .
" It is inspiring that an inexpensive naturally visible wavelength of light can eradicate two common strains of MRSA .
Developing strategies that are capable of destroying MRSA , using mechanisms that would not lead to further antibiotic resistance , is timely and important for us and our patients , " says Chukuka S. Enwemeka , PhD , FACSM , Co - Editor - in - Chief of the Journal and first author of the study .

New York , January 9 , 2009
–
The Committee to Protect Journalists condemns the Israeli military ’s bombing today of a Gaza City building that houses the offices of a number of international news organizations .
The Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) attacked the rooftop of Al - Johara Tower , an eight - story building located in Al - Rimal neighborhood in Gaza City , which houses more than 20 international news organizations , according to multiple news outlets .
Al - Jazeera reported that at least one journalist was injured while filing a report from the roof of the building .
The journalist was not immediately identified .
Staff at Al - Shifa Hospital , where the journalist was taken , said the injuries were minor , according to a statement on Web site of the Iranian Arabic - language Al - Alam TV .
Satellite transmission equipment on the roof of the building was also damaged in the attack , the Iranian English - language Press TV said on its Web site .
Mark Regev , spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , defended the strike in an interview with Al - Jazeera , saying that communications equipment in the building could have been used by Hamas .
At least one journalist has been killed in Gaza in direct relation to his work since the Israeli offensive began on December 27 , CPJ research shows .
Basil Ibrahim Faraj , an assistant cameraman for the Palestinian Media and Communications Company , died on Tuesday at a hospital in Egypt after suffering head injuries when his crew came under fire on the first day of the military campaign , according to multiple news reports .
Atif Issa , director general of Palestinian Media and Communication Company , told CPJ that Faraj and three other three crew members were on assignment for Algerian TV when their car was hit during an airstrike near Al - Wa ’d Association for Prisoners in Gaza .
The other crew members were injured .
Turkish , French , and Iranian news organizations are among those located in the Al - Johara Tower , which is meters away from the Shawa and Hosari Tower , which houses a number of major media outlets .
Coordinates for both buildings were provided to the Israeli military , and floodlights were kept on both roofs to identify the buildings , according to print and television accounts .
“ The Israeli military knows the location of TV facilities houses and news bureaus in Gaza .
It is simply unacceptable that working journalists and their offices should come under fire in this way , ” said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney .
“ Journalists enjoy protections under international law in military campaigns such as the one in Gaza .
Israel must cease its attacks on the media immediately . ”
Media facilities have come under Israeli fire in two other instances since the military campaign started .
On January 5 , the IDF bombed the offices of the Hamas - affiliated Al - Risala newsweekly , according to multiple regional news agencies .
On December 29 , the IDF shelled the headquarters of Al - Aqsa TV , destroying the facilities .
The station continues to broadcast from a remote location .
The IDF has sporadically taken over the frequencies of Al - Aqsa and the Gaza - based Sawt al - Sha’b radio to call on Palestinians to abandon Hamas , according to Agence France - Presse and local news reports .
In two letters sent to Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak since the beginning of the offensive , CPJ demanded an explanation for the targeting of Palestinian media and called on Israel to lift the restrictions it has placed on the entry and movement of journalists in Gaza and southern Israel .
CPJ has not received a response yet .
A comparison of Sony 's corporate unit sales data and comments made by an investor relations spokesperson for Microsoft suggest that PlayStation 3 outsold Xbox 360 worldwide for the three months ending 30th September .
The PS3 shifted 2.43 million consoles throughout the period , according to freshly - published Q2 FY 2008 figures - nearly double that for the same stretch last year .
This puts Sony ahead of Microsoft , which recently told AFP the 360 shifted 2.2 million units for the same period .
We 're not entirely sure where all the PS3 sales have come from .
The Xbox 360 , after all , experienced a price cut in early September , prompting all sorts of sales - boasts from the platform holder , particularly in the US , and it's well known that the Microsoft console has been doing well in Japan and in the UK for a while .
Whatever the reason , this promising pre-Christmas surge puts the PS3 at a worldwide total of 16.84 million units .
The Xbox 360 , if you remember , stands at around 24 million , although Microsoft has n't posted exact figures .
Nintendo has sold 5 billion squillion Wiis .
Sony 's games division also cut losses from JPY 96.7 billion ( GBP 624 million ) to JPY 39.5 billion ( GBP 255 million ) for the three - month period .
Perhaps it found some more blind Venetian monks to carve blue diodes out of the irises of virgin panthers .
PSP sales rose slightly to 3.18 million units to help achieve this , while the PS2 dipped to 2.5 million units - further pushing PS3 finally to the forefront of the Sony operation .
The Cost of Fearing Strangers
What do Bruce Pardo and Atif Irfan have in common ?
In case you ’re not familiar with their names , let me rephrase :
What do the white guy who dressed up as Santa and killed his ex-wife and her family ( and then committed suicide ) and the Muslim guy who got thrown off a recent AirTran flight on suspicion of terrorism have in common ?
The answer is that both of them had their intentions badly misread .
The one who should have been scary to people who knew him was n’t ; and the one who scared the people who did n’t know him turned out to not be scary at all .
As we ’ll see below , this is a common pattern .
But before going forward , let me first backtrack a bit .
Pardo was a churchgoer whom no one pegged as a homicidal maniac .
“ He ’s a totally different person from what you hear and see on the news for what he did , ” said a family friend named Amanda Dunn .
“ I ’m shocked , literally , I ’m shocked .
I ca n’t believe that ’s actually the same guy . ”
Irfan , born in Detroit , is a tax attorney who lives with his family in Alexandria , Va .
He was on his way from Washington to Florida with several members of his family for a religious retreat .
He and his brother were reportedly discussing which are the “ safest ” seats on an airplane .
“ Other people heard them , misconstrued them , ” an AirTran spokesman told the Washington Post .
“ It just so happened these people were of Muslim faith and appearance .
It escalated , it got out of hand , and everyone took precautions . ”
The “ precautions ” involved removing all the Irfans from the plane and calling in the F.B.I. to question them .
They were promptly cleared by the F.B.I. as definitely - not - terrorists , but AirTran still would n’t fly them to Florida .
So which would you be more scared of : an American Muslim family you knew nothing about or the guy from your church who had just gone through a divorce ?
As we wrote in Freakonomics , most people are pretty terrible at risk assessment .
They tend to overstate the risk of dramatic and unlikely events at the expense of more common and boring ( if equally devastating ) events .
A given person might fear a terrorist attack and mad cow disease more than anything in the world , whereas in fact she ’d be better off fearing a heart attack ( and therefore taking care of herself ) or salmonella ( and therefore washing her cutting board thoroughly ) .
Why do we fear the unknown more than the known ?
That ’s a larger question than I can answer here ( not that I ’m capable anyway ) , but it probably has to do with the heuristics — the shortcut guesses — our brains use to solve problems , and the fact that these heuristics rely on the information already stored in our memories .
And what gets stored away ?
Anomalies — the big , rare , “ black swan ” events that are so dramatic , so unpredictable , and perhaps world - changing , that they imprint themselves on our memories and con us into thinking of them as typical , or at least likely , whereas in fact they are extraordinarily rare .
Which brings us back to Bruce Pardo and Atif Irfan .
The people who did n’t seem to fear Pardo were friends and relatives .
The people who did fear Irfan were strangers .
And they all got it backward .
In general , we fear strangers much more than we should .
Consider a few supporting pieces of evidence :
+ In the U.S. , the proportion of murder victims who knew their assailants to victims killed by strangers is about 3 - to - 1. ( Source : U.S. Department of Justice . )
+ Sixty - four percent of women who are raped know their attackers ; and 61 percent of female victims of aggravated assault know their attackers .
( Men , on the other hand , are more likely to be assaulted by a stranger . )
( Source : D.O.J. )
+ How about child abduction ?
Is n’t that the classic stranger crime ?
This 2007 Slate article explains that of the missing children in one recent year , “ 203,900 were family abductions , 58,200 were nonfamily abductions , and only 115 were ‘ stereotypical kidnappings , ’ defined in one study as ‘ a nonfamily abduction perpetrated by a slight acquaintance or stranger in which a child is detained overnight , transported at least 50 miles , held for ransom , or abducted with the intent to keep the child permanently , or killed . ' ”
+ And if you ’re really concerned about mass murder — which , given its rarity , you really should n’t be — you ’d probably do well to look around your neighborhood instead of focusing on strangers , or foreigners , or people who look like they might , maybe , possibly be foreigners .
A study of mass murderers between 1976 and 1995 found that 63 percent of them were white , 33 percent were black , and just 3 percent all other ethnicities .
So the next time your brain insists on fearing strangers , try to tell it to cool out a bit .
It ’s not that you necessarily need to insist that it fear your friends and family instead — unless , of course , you are friends with someone like Bernie Madoff .
Do n’t forget that the greatest financial fraud in history was committed primarily among friends .
And with friends like that , who needs strangers ?
[ Note : I discussed this subject on The Takeaway . ]
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , the main food distribution group in Gaza , has suspended operations , claiming Israel killed a UN driver .
UNRWA announced Thursday that it would suspend its operations in Gaza until further notice .
“ UNRWA has decided to suspend its operations in the Gaza Strip due to hostile activities targeting its workers , ” the group said .
UNRWA officials have accused Israel of killing one of the group 's workers .
UN workers allege that Israeli soldiers fired on truck drivers near the Erez crossing in northern Gaza on Thursday afternoon , killing one .
The trucks were clearly marked as UN vehicles , they said .
IDF officials say they will investigate the claim .
The dead driver was identified as Adnan abu - Hasna .
Hours after the UN charged Israel with the killing , a MDA paramedic reported that the driver had been shot by Hamas snipers , and not killed by an IDF tank shell .
The driver and two other drivers who were badly injured suffered bullet wounds , not shrapnel injuries , the medic said .
The medic said IDF soldiers had also reported that the drivers were shot .
The soldiers ran into Gaza to rescue the two wounded drivers , endangering their own lives , the medic said .
Arab medics disputed his report , and said they had brought the wounded drivers to the crossing .
The wounded were taken to Barzilai hospital in Ashkelon .
On Tuesday evening , Gaza residents reported that an IDF tank shell had hit a UN - run school , killing 40 people who had taken shelter in the building , among them 10 children .
UN officials in Gaza accused Israel of firing on the school for no reason .
IDF troops said they had responded to mortar fire from the direction of the school .
The tank shells fired by soldiers ignited explosives hidden near the building , setting off powerful secondary blasts that were responsible for most of the deaths , they said .
UNRWA distributes food to approximately 750,000 residents of Gaza , and runs many of the area 's schools .
It was created to help Arabs who fled pre-State Israel during the War of Independence , and later began assisting their descendants as well .
UNRWA defines all descendants of Arabs who lived in pre-state Israel as " refugees . "
Red Cross Accuses Israel of Delaying Access
The Red Cross slammed Israel on Thursday as well , claiming that Israel had delayed ambulances as they attempted to enter Gaza .
The international organization demanded that Israel allow ambulances from the Palestinian Authority 's Red Crescent to access areas in which soldiers are fighting Hamas in order to evacuate the wounded .
Red Cross workers said they had found 12 corpses and 19 people in houses in the Zeitun neighborhood of Gaza City following intense fighting .
They accused the IDF of war crimes , saying soldiers had failed to help those who survived the battles , some of them children .
The IDF sent out this statement in response : " The Israel Defense Forces is engaged in a battle with the Hamas terrorist organization that has deliberately used Palestinian civilians as human shields .
The IDF works in close cooperation with international aid organizations during the fighting so that civilians can be provided with assistance . "
" The IDF in no way intentionally targets civilians , " the statement continued , " and has demonstrated its willingness to abort operations to save civilian lives and to risk injury in order to assist innocent civilians .
Any serious allegations made against the IDF 's conduct will need to be investigated properly , once such a complaint is received formally , within the constraints of the current military operation . "

The same real estate boom and bust that delivered a devastating body blow to the U.S. economy also brought an enormous wave of failed and allegedly fraudulent investment schemes .
There are plenty of reasons besides fraud and bad faith that real estate deals failed in recent months .
Falling prices and lenders ' wholesale retreat from the market killed countless legitimate transactions .
Unscrupulous opportunists only made matters worse .
Veteran white - collar investigators and prosecutors say they have n't seen this many similar questionable acts since the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s .
Now , law enforcement and the courts are trying to clean up the mess while victims pay for their costly mistakes .
From Portland to Albany to Bend and beyond , Oregonians hoping to cash in on the boom have instead suffered major financial setbacks in real estate deals gone awry .
There was the disabled veteran and his wife in Linn County who borrowed on their credit cards to put $ 50,000 into a failed Willamette Valley land deal .
There was the single mother in Bend whose builder / developer ran out of money , leaving her and about 40 others with uncompleted homes and thousands of dollars in debt owed to banks and unpaid subcontractors .
No criminal charges have been filed in either of the schemes .
Today 's wave of dubious deals is more pervasive and grass - roots in nature than the S&L debacle , which primarily involved thrift executives and their borrowers .
Developers , mortgage brokers , appraisers , bankers and borrowers alike are under the microscope of state securities regulators and federal prosecutors .
" We 've always had people fudging the numbers on their loan application to buy the home they wanted to live in , " said Joe Boyer , supervisory special agent for the FBI in Portland .
" During the boom , we had people trying to do 50 homes .
It was all about the real estate appreciation . "
Boyer is a key member of a mortgage fraud working group in Portland formed among local , state and federal investigators to combat real estate and mortgage fraud .
A key factor behind the boom and its frightening aftermath is the pervasive human desire to make easy money .
This decade 's real estate debacle started to form just months after the collapse of an earlier investment bubble .
The 2001 collapse of the dot - com Internet companies cost the economy an estimated $ 5 trillion .
Countless starry - eyed investors came to rue the day they bet their hard - earned cash on the latest dot - com pet retailer or online grocer .
Two years later , Internet stock promoters were supplanted by another generation of boosters who said real estate was the new can 't - miss opportunity .
They were enabled by a lending industry that lost its bearings and started making loans to unqualified buyers and ignoring signs of rampant duplicity .
Mortgage fraud emerged as the trademark crime of the boom .
Unscrupulous brokers worked through straw buyers to obtain bank loans , pocketing thousands of dollars for themselves from the loan proceeds while the " buyer " often never made a single payment .
But the ever - rising tide of escalating real estate prices hid the problem .
" The underlying premise was that real estate values would always go up , " said Karin Immergut , U.S. attorney in Portland .
" If they got into trouble , they could always sell it .
If the bank had to repossess it , they could put it on the market and make money .
" Now , we 're seeing the whole house of cards crumble . "
Indeed , just like New York financier Bernard Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme , the real estate bubble has popped .
Individual investors , some of whom went into hock to grab a piece of the real estate gold , now face foreclosure and financial ruin .
The feds were well aware of the mortgage industry issues before the house fell down .
Chris Swecker , former assistant director of the FBI in Washington , D.C. , warned in the boom year 2004 of widespread fraud in the industry .
Swecker , now retired , predicted bogus home loans could cause multibillion - dollar losses to financial institutions .
Swecker 's prescient warnings were wrong in only aspect :
He vastly underestimated the losses and the impact on the broader economy .
But the feds did n't intervene in a more forceful way in part because much of the FBI 's resources were diverted to combat terrorism .
Besides , rising real estate prices kept losses to a relatively low level -- at least until 2006 and 2007 .
Federal sentencing guidelines are based on provable financial losses .
Absent a large tangible loss , perpetrators are unlikely to get much of a sentence beyond probation , which gave prosecutors little motive to push mortgage or real estate cases .
Even the most bogus mortgage deal did n't lose much money as long as homes continued to appreciate in value -- which they did in Oregon until mid-2007 .
Now , only time and the courts will determine whether the cases addressed here are bad luck , bad faith , or worse .

Big plan ' all made sense ... but it was all a lie '
Albany - based Willamette Development Services started small in 2006 , but with a big idea : building homes and small commercial projects the length of the Willamette Valley .
With few resources of its own , the company used other people 's money , raising $ 6 million from about 40 investors .
In 2006 , at the height of Oregon 's land rush , dozens of people jumped at the opportunity .
Some said they took out second mortgages on their homes or borrowed on their credit cards to come up with the $ 25,000 minimum investment .
The company 's pedigree was modest .
No history , no track record of success .
It was the brainchild of Joe LaCoste , a former Oregon State University running back who left his high school teaching job in 1996 to enter the mortgage and real estate business .
He formed several companies , some of which earned the attention of state securities regulators .
In one example of problems , regulators in 2006 entered a cease and desist order against one of those companies , Lunceford & LaCoste , for brokering mortgages without a license .
But with Willamette Development Services , LaCoste and the rest of his management team were convincing .
Investors said they ere promised 13 percent interest annually .
" It all made sense , " said Rebecca Lu , a Corvallis real estate agent who invested $ 200,000 herself and persuaded her elderly parents to invest $ 25,000 .
" They hired architects and engineers .
But it was all a lie . "
The company started 11 projects , including a residential subdivision in Santa Clara , near Eugene , and a minimart in McMinnville .
It failed to complete even one .
" Our homes were n't getting built , we were spending too much money , " LaCoste said .
" I was n't quite sure why all this was happening . "
Investors stopped getting interest payments in November 2007 .
LaCoste 's partners , led by his brother - in - law , Medford mortgage broker Craig Sweet , ousted him in January 2008 .
The company became inactive within a few months .
LaCoste blames
Sweet and others in his management team , who he said failed to perform .
Sweet declined to comment .
Investors have filed two lawsuits against the company , LaCoste and other partners .
They claim the company lied to investors and used their money to pay off other investors -- the classic definition of a Ponzi scheme .
Several investors told The Oregonian they had been interviewed by the FBI .
LaCoste says he has not talked to anyone at the FBI , and no criminal charges have been filed .
LaCoste said he 's been made the fall guy for the failures of other partners and the downturn of the market .
" We were in a real tough real estate market , " he said .
" We were doing the wrong thing at the wrong time .
So were about 10 million other developers around the country . "
" They could n't build a single home in 18 months , " said Jay Mutschler of Corvallis , who lost his $ 50,000 investment .
" WDS was so mismanaged , it 's ridiculous .
The question is : Was Joe just so inept that he could n't manage it right , or was it a Ponzi scheme ? "
LaCoste and his wife have formed a new consulting company , Witham Investments , which he said helps other real estate developers through financing and operational challenges .
" Our company puts honesty , integrity and compassionate capitalism above all other business priorities , " Witham 's Web site says .

Dreamers wake up to big losses in central Oregon
Joanie Krehbiel wanted in on the real estate action .
The Bend woman , a single mother of a toddler , knew she needed another business to complement her seasonal bicycle rental operation .
Central Oregon 's real estate boom offered an opportunity , she figured .
In 2006 , Krehbiel hooked up with Don Loyd , a longtime central Oregon developer who said he liked teaching amateurs how to prosper at the real estate game .
The deal was simple : Loyd 's investors would contribute $ 5,000 of their own money and obtain a construction loan to cover the cost of building a house .
Loyd 's company , Aspen Tree Homes , would serve as general contractor .
Loyd 's investor could then move in to the completed house , sell it or rent it out .
" Don was the ringleader , the Pied Piper , " Krehbiel said .
" We were supposed to make $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 per home . "
So confident was Krehbiel , and so hot was the market , she signed up to do two deals with Loyd and got 11 friends and family members involved in Loyd projects .
In all , Loyd estimates , he built homes for 100 people , launching projects from Crook to Klamath counties .
For some of those investors , the dreams of real estate riches failed to pan out .
Loyd admits that he walked away from about 40 projects when he ran out of money .
Today , some of Loyd 's investors owe thousands of dollars on bank loans but have only partly built homes or bare lots to show for it .
Many have lost their good credit after missing payments .
They face thousands of dollars in construction liens filed by subcontractors who were n't able to get their money from Loyd .
Four participants in Loyd 's plan have sued him , his son Kevin Loyd and Aspen Tree Homes .
They also sued West Coast Bank , the Lake Oswego lender that funded many of their loans .
They claim West Coast gave Loyd access to the borrowers ' construction loan proceeds without proper authorization from the borrowers .
A lawyer for West Coast declined to comment .
This marks the second time West Coast Bank has been caught up in a questionable homebuilding deal in central Oregon .
West Coast also funded several mortgages to former employees of Desert Sun Development , another failed real estate firm that allegedly falsified employees ' loan applications and accessed their loan proceeds without authorization .
Loyd says he 's done nothing wrong , adding that he 's a victim himself of the real estate crash .
He blames his problems on West Coast Bank for not advancing him construction loan proceeds in a timely manner .
He says he spent $ 300,000 of his own money to pay subcontractors after West Coast Bank refused to release loan proceeds .
" I am not a rip - off artist , " Loyd said .
" I worked in Bend for 35 years .
I had a good reputation .
One major burp in the economy and that reputation is gone . "
One piece of Loyd 's investment operation illustrates on a micro-level how the prevalence of investors hoping for a quick profit skewed the real estate market .
Twelve of Loyd 's projects were in the tiny town of Chiloquin , which is between Bend and Klamath Falls and one of the poorest communities in Oregon .
In the best of times , it would have been difficult for Chiloquin to absorb the Loyd homes , which were expensive by local standards .
But similar to one - time boomtowns like Las Vegas and Sacramento , the presence of so many real estate flippers looking for a hefty profit worsened the real estate bust when it finally came .
" It 's the nicest subdivision in Chiloquin , " said Terry Nash , a Klamath Falls Realtor who listed the Loyd homes .
" We started at $ 289,000 and got down to $ 220,000 .
I 've had one offer , a very low offer . "
Federal and state investigators are looking into Aspen Tree Homes , alerted to the case by Darren Goodding , a Lake Oswego private investigator hired by one of the participants .
Krehbiel said she is trying to hang on financially .
She figures she 's spent $ 50,000 , most of it from a $ 40,000 equity line of credit on her own home , trying to salvage her investment with Loyd , whom she wants held accountable .
" He needs to never do this to anyone again , " she said .
" And he needs to be punished . "

Vegas deal slams even Oregon 's big players
It was n't just real estate amateurs who got burned in the crash .
A disastrous Las Vegas condo conversion launched by Portland developer Terry Bean resulted in claims of fraud and securities law violations by his investors , who read like a who 's who of Portland power brokers .
In 2006 and 2007 , Bean raised $ 7.3 million for his company , Orchid Investors LLC .
Among the investors were companies and trusts affiliated with Frank Dulcich , head of Pacific Seafoods , the nation 's largest seafood processor ; Robert Philip , head of Schnitzer Investments , a business arm of the wealthy Schnitzer family ; Gerry Bidwell , a prominent former Portland stockbroker ; and Richard Akerman , a Lake Oswego businessman and member of the Lake Oswego school board .
Orchid proposed to buy a 280 - unit apartment complex , renovate it , and sell the units as condos .
Bean made his name with dozens of similar projects in Portland .
Though the displaced renters disliked the process , the goal was to generate fat profits for Bean and his backers .
But he made the ill - fated decision to go ahead with the Orchid project just as Sin City 's once red - hot market cratered into one of the worst sinkholes of mortgage defaults and foreclosures in the nation .
Orchid defaulted in February 2008 on a $ 27 million loan from Bank of America .
That same month , two of Bean 's investors in Orchid , Dulcich and Akerman , sued Bean and David Gifford , Bean 's partner in the deal .
They claim that in a 2005 appraisal of the property , Bean withheld crucial information about falling home prices and rising inventories of unsold homes in the neighborhood .
They also allege Bean failed to disclose that he tried to buy the same apartment complex for $ 19.2 million in October 2004 .
Less than a year later , Bean 's company bought the property for more than $ 35 million .
" I think any reasonable investor would want to know that the property had doubled in price , " said Mike Esler , a Portland attorney representing Dulcich and Akerman .
Dulcich and Akerman are seeking repayment of the $ 2 million and $ 1.1 million , respectively , they invested .
John Parsons , Bean 's lawyer , said Orchid was killed by the " demise of the national real estate market . "
" The irony is that most of Terry 's business partners have made millions of dollars over the years , " Parsons said .
" This project goes bad , and all of a sudden it 's about an alleged failure to disclose rather than the reality of the national economy . "
Since the lawsuit was filed in February , the Orchid drama has gotten more tangled .
Bank of America sued Orchid in April , demanding immediate repayment of the $ 27 million .
Bean had personally guaranteed more than $ 20 million of the debt .
The bank ultimately settled with Bean , repossessing the property and forcing him to repay about $ 3.5 million in cash .
Bean has filed a counterclaim against Dulcich and Akerman , accusing them of reneging on their obligation to help Bean pay off the bank .
Bean sued Philip on the same grounds .
" The bottom line is , it was a partnership , " Bean said .
" We signed personal guarantees .
I was the only one who stepped up to the plate . "

The majestic old - growth forests of western North America , greening patches of the landscape from Arizona to British Columbia , may be far more vulnerable to subtle climate change than scientists previously believed .
A study published today in the journal Science reveals that these western forests are dying at faster rates as regional average temperatures climb more rapidly than the global average .
" Tree death rates have more than doubled , " says study co-author Phillip van Mantgem , a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
He and his team analyzed data ( collected from 1955 to 2007 ) on about 58,000 trees , including firs , pines , hemlocks and others , in 76 old - growth forest plots covering six western states and a Canadian province : Arizona , Colorado , California , Idaho , Washington , Oregon and British Columbia .
Their findings : 11,000 trees had perished during the observation period , even though no logging , development or other major activities occurred in the study zones .
The researchers pinpointed the rise in regional temperatures as the likely culprit in their demise after ruling out other possible suspects , such as air pollution and forest management practices .
They note that the average regional temperature , though a mere one degree Fahrenheit ( 0.6 degree Celsius ) warmer , translated into less snow , longer dry seasons , and increased soil evaporation , which stress out trees , making them more vulnerable to destructive insects and disease .
Meanwhile , bugs and pathogens , which thrive in hotter temperatures , grow stronger , making them an even bigger threat to the fading forests , according to Kenneth Raffa , a professor of forest entomology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison .
" You sort of have a double whammy there , " says David Breshears , a professor of natural resources at the University of Arizona 's Institute for Environment and Society in Tucson .
Exacerbating the problem : not enough new trees are sprouting to replace the dead and dying old ones .
" It 's like a human population , " says study co-author Nathan Stephenson , a USGS research ecologist .
It shrinks , he says , when the mortality rate outpaces the birth rate .
" If you saw that going on in your hometown , " he adds , " you 'd become concerned . "
This pattern could eventually lead to sparser forests in which trees are younger and about half the size of what they are now .
Today 's towering old - growth forests help to mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide ( a greenhouse gas that speeds global warming ) .
But if the trends observed in this study continue , van Mantgem says , these key carbon - sinks could actually become a net source of carbon in the atmosphere , a phenomenon that has already been observed in tropical climates .
" If anything , it 's a warning bell , " van Mantgem says about the study 's findings .
" A lot of people like to think of these majestic old - growth forests as unchanging , but this showed us that they do in fact respond rather quickly to the environment . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
An Ohio - based food distributor has voluntarily recalled two brands of peanut butter after it was told salmonella found in an open five - pound tub sold under the King Nut label .
King Nut Cos , in a statement released Saturday , said it immediately contacted its customers and asked them to remove all King Nut peanut butter and Parnell ’s Pride peanut butter from the market .
The Solon , Ohio - based King
Nut supplies peanut butter to food service companies that distribute the products to institutions like hospitals , schools , restaurants and nursing homes .
The brands are not sold directly to consumers .
King
Nut said it asked customers to stop distributing all peanut butter with lot codes beginning with the number eight and has canceled orders with the manufacturer , Peanut Corporation of America .
Officials for Peanut Corporation of America , based in Lynchburg , Virginia , could not be immediately reached for comment .
Martin Kanan , King
Nut ’s chief executive , said , “ because we do n’t manufacture peanut butter , we will do what we can to get this product out of distribution and will work with the manufacturer to inform others of this problem . ”
On Friday , Minnesota health officials issued a product alert for King Nut brand creamy peanut butter after finding a jar that was contaminated with a strain of salmonella linked to an outbreak across the United States .
Since September , the outbreak of salmonella food poisoning has sickened at least 399 people in 42 states and sent at least 70 people to the hospital , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The CDC , Agriculture Department , Food and Drug Administration and state health officials are trying to trace the source of the outbreak .
An outbreak of salmonella was linked to Peter Pan brand peanut butter in 2007 .
ConAgra Foods
Inc closed a Georgia plant after more than 300 people became ill in that outbreak .

Crimea
War bullets collided in a billion - to - one chance
As an illustration of luck , it does n’t get much more explosive .
This remarkable picture shows how two bullets from opposing troops fused after striking each other in mid-air .
The odds of the clash are said to be a billion - to - one and it could well have saved the lives of two soldiers .
Billion to one chance : Two bullets ( one French , one Russian ) which fused in mid-air during the Crimea War .
It is almost impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins
What makes the discovery more incredible is that the bullets are 150 years old and were found on the battlefields of the Crimean War , now in Ukraine .
One has been identified as Russian , the other French .
The discovery is said to have been made close to Balaclava , site of the notorious Charge of the Light Brigade , one of the most notorious events in British military history .
The finder of the bullets - a walker whose name has not been disclosed - is said to be seeking to sell the unique war memorabilia to a military museum .
Conflict : French troops march on Russian lines in the Crimean War
The Ukrainian authorities were unable to throw any light on the exact circumstances of the find or who had validated the discovery as being genuine Russian and French bullets .
A spokesman for the local authority in the Crimea said : ' We have no official information about this discovery . '
Nor has the exact site of the discovery been disclosed , though there has been a wide discussion of the bullets in blogs .
Warfare at its most courageous and tragic :
The Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854 during the Crimean War
The Crimean War , between 1853 and 1856 , was fought between tsarist Russia and an alliance of Britain , France and the Ottoman Empire .
More than 374,000 perished in the campaign , including 2,755 British killed in action , 2,019 from wounds and 16,323 from disease .
At issue was European influence over the territories controlled by the declining Ottoman Empire .
The bullets would originally have looked like this
The Crimea War also brought to public attention the pioneering nursing of Florence Nightingale - called ' The lady with the lamp ' - who cared for soldiers killed in battle but also from diseases such as typhoid , cholera and dysentery .
The Charge of the Light Brigade was seen as highlighting the failings of aristocratic , self - centred generals who appeared to have little concern for casualties .
It is recalled in the poem by Allfred , Lord Tennyson , as showing war at its most courageous and horrific .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into a chilly Hudson River on Thursday , apparently after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from New York 's LaGuardia Airport , according to officials and passengers .
i Reporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the scene in the river .

Everyone on board was accounted for and alive , officials said .
About 15 people were being treated at hospitals and others were being evaluated at triage centers .
Flight 1549 , headed to Charlotte , North Carolina , was airborne less than three minutes , according to FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown .
The pilot radioed to air traffic controllers that he had experienced a bird strike and declared an emergency , a New Jersey State Police source said .
" I think a lot of people started praying and just collecting themselves , " said passenger Fred Berretta .
" It was quite stunning . "
Watch passenger describe landing »
He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart , but it did not .
" It was a great landing , " Berretta said .
Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia saw the plane clear the George Washington Bridge by less than 900 feet before gliding into the water about 3:31 p.m. , an aviation source told CNN .

Witness Ben Vonklemperer said he watched the plane from the 25th floor of an office building .
" If someone 's going to land a plane in the water , this seemed the best possible way to do it , " Vonklemperer said .
" The way they hit it was very gradual .
A very slow contact with the water . "
As the situation began to settle Thursday evening , the flight 's pilot , Chesley B. " Sully " Sullenberger , emerged as a hero , with praise being heaped on him by passengers , officials and aviation experts .
" I do n't think there 's enough praise to go around for someone who does something like this .
This is something you really can't prepare for , " said former Delta pilot Denny Walsh .
" You really do n't practice water landings in commercial airplanes .
Just the sheer expertise he demonstrated is amazing . "
US Airways CEO Doug Parker said it would be premature to speculate about the cause of the accident until the National Transportation Safety Board , which is sending a team to the site , completed an investigation .
A source familiar with the situation , however , told CNN the pilot reported a double bird strike , but it was unclear whether that meant birds in both engines or two birds in one engine .
The pilot initially said he needed to go back , and air traffic controllers started to give him clearance to do so , but the pilot said he wanted to head to Teterboro , New Jersey , because it was closer .
That was the last transmission from the pilot , the source said .
Passenger Alberto Panero said that within a few minutes after takeoff , he heard a loud bang and smelled smoke .
Watch passenger say he heard a loud bang »
" That 's when we knew we were going down and into the water .
We just hit , and somehow the plane stayed afloat and we were able to get on the raft .
It 's just incredible right now that everybody 's still alive . "
Passenger Jeff Kolodjay of Norwalk , Connecticut , said he was sitting in seat 22A , near one of the engines .
" The captain came on and said , ' Look , we 're going down .
Brace for impact . '
Everyone looked at each other and we said our prayers .
I said about five Hail Marys , " said Kolodjay , who was headed to Charlotte to play golf .
" The plane started filling with water pretty quick , " he said .
" It was scary .
There was a lady with her baby on my left - hand shoulder , and she was crawling over the seats . "

Police , fire and Coast Guard boats , along with commercial ferries , were quickly on the scene as passengers lined up on slightly submerged safety chutes .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said later Thursday that the plane was tied to a pier at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan .
As night fell , Coast Guard and FDNY boats remained at the scene .
President Bush commended those involved in the rescue .
" Laura and I are inspired by the skill and heroism of the flight crew as well as the dedication and selflessness of the emergency responders and volunteers who rescued passengers from the icy waters of the Hudson , " he said .
Bloomberg also commended the pilot for not leaving the plane until he had checked to make sure everyone had been been evacuated .
" It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out , " Bloomberg said .
" I had a long conversation with the pilot , " Bloomberg said .
" He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off , and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board , and assures us there were not . "
" There is a heroic pilot , " said Gov. David Paterson .
" We have had a miracle on 34th Street , I believe we now have a miracle on the Hudson . "
The temperature in New York was 20 degrees about the time of the crash off Manhattan 's west side .

Dr. Gabriel Wilson , associated medical director of the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital , said 55 survivors were checked out and cleared to leave from the scene .
Those being treated at hospitals included a husband and wife with hypothermia at Roosevelt Hospital , as well as a flight attendant with a leg fracture , hospital spokeswoman Michelle Stiles said .
Since 1975 , five large jetliners have had major accidents in which bird strikes played a role , according to the Web site of Bird Strike Committee USA , a volunteer group dedicated to reducing the frequency and severity of the strikes .
More than 56,000 bird strikes were reported to the FAA from 1998 to 2004 , according to the group 's Web site .
People who believe they may have had relatives on the flight may call US Airways at 1-800- 679-8215 within the United States , the airline said .

The city plans to close several blocks of Broadway to vehicle traffic through Times Square and Herald Square , an experiment that would turn swaths of the Great White Way into pedestrian malls and continue Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s effort to reduce traffic congestion in Midtown .
Although it seems counterintuitive , officials believe the move will actually improve the overall flow of traffic , because the diagonal path of Broadway tends to disrupt traffic where it intersects with other streets .
The city plans to introduce the changes as early as May and keep them in effect through the end of the year .
If the experiment works , they could become permanent .
The plan was described by several people who were briefed on it this week .
Mr. Bloomberg was expected to announce the plan Thursday .
A City Hall spokesman declined comment in advance of the announcement .
Outgoing CIA Director Michael Hayden is going around town telling folks he has warned President - elect Barack Obama " personally and forcefully " that if Obama authorizes an investigation into controversial activities like waterboarding , " no one in Langley will ever take a risk again "
Upon learning this from what we former intelligence officers used to call an " A - 1 source " ( completely reliable with excellent access to the information ) , the thought that came to me in the face of such chutzpah was from Cicero 's livid oration against the Roman usurper Cataline : " Quousque , tandem , abutere , Catalina , patientia nostra ! " - or " How long , at last , O Cataline , will you abuse our patience ! "
Cicero had had enough .
And so , apparently , has Obama , who has been confirmed once again of the wisdom of his vote against Hayden 's becoming CIA director .
It was striking that Obama did not even mention Hayden on Jan. 9 , when the President - elect formally named Leon Panetta as his choice to run the CIA and Dennis Blair to be director of national intelligence .
Obama did announce that Mike McConnell , whom Blair will replace after he is confirmed , has been given a sinecure / consolation prize - a seat on the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board .
Hayden , an Air Force general , should be given a seat in the military prison in Leavenworth ( see below ) .
It is not only a bit cheeky , but more than a little disingenuous that Hayden should think to advise Obama " personally and forcefully " against investigating illegal activities authorized by President George W. Bush , since Hayden himself might already be described as an unindicted co-conspirator based on publicly available information .
Hayden has loudly bragged about the crimes in which he was directly involved , and defended others , like what he has called " high - end " interrogation techniques - waterboarding , for example .
Could it be clearer ?
" Waterboarding is torture , " said President - elect Obama last Sunday to George Stephanopoulos .
Torture is a crime .
Obama added , twice , that no one is " above the law , " although also citing his " belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backward . "
Despite the President - elect 's equivocations , it seems that President Bush and the current CIA director may have a problem .
And apparently Hayden 's palms are sweaty enough to warrant , in his view , a thinly veiled threat .
In the outrage category , that threat / warning goes well beyond chutzpah .
What an insult to my former colleagues at the CIA to suggest that they lack the integrity to fulfill their important duties in consonance with the law ; that they would treat the new President like a substitute teacher !
Assessing Hayden
" Should have been court - martialed " was the judgment of the late Gen. Bill Odom about Hayden when Odom was interviewed on Jan. 4 , 2006 by George Kenney , a former Foreign Service officer and now producer of " Electronic Politics . "
And President Bush " should be impeached , " added Odom with equal fury .
Odom ruled out discussing during the interview the warrantless eavesdropping that had been revealed by the New York Times just a few weeks earlier .
In a memorandum about the conversation , Kenney opined that Odom appeared so angry that he realized that if he started discussing the still - classified issue , he would not be able to control himself .
Why was Gen .
Odom so angry ?
Because he , like all uniformed officers , took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; because he took that oath seriously ; and because , as head of the National Security Agency from 1985 to 1988 , he did his best to ensure that all employees strictly observed NSA 's " first commandment " - Thou Shalt Not Eavesdrop on Americans Without a Court Warrant .
Also disappointed was former NSA Director Admiral Bobby Ray Inman , who led NSA from 1977 to 1981 and was one of the country 's most highly respected senior managers of intelligence and an author of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) of 1978 .
At a public discussion at the New York Public Library on May 8 , 2006 , Inman took strong issue with Hayden 's flouting of FISA :
" There clearly was a line in the FISA statutes which says you could n't do this , " said Inman .
He went on to call specific attention to an " extra sentence put in the bill that said , ‘ You ca n't do anything that is not authorized by this bill . ' "
Inman spoke proudly of the earlier ethos at NSA , where " it was deeply ingrained that you operate within the law and you get the law changed if you need to . "
Hayden the Martinet
In contrast , Michael Hayden , who was NSA director from 1999 to 2005 , chose to salute when ordered by Vice President Dick Cheney to create and implement an aggressive NSA program skirting the strict legal restrictions of FISA .
Hayden then proceeded to do the White House 's bidding in conning the invertebrates posing as leaders of the Senate and House intelligence " oversight " ( more accurately - " overlook " ) committees .
Sen .
Jay Rockefeller is a sorry example of the fox co-opted by the hens .
There is precious little the administration and intelligence community did not get away with under his feckless tutelage of the Senate intelligence overlook committee .
For a discussion of how politicians like Rockefeller and other intelligence " overseers " work hand - in - hand with the folks they are supposed to be overseeing , see " Jay Rockefeller Awarded Intelligence Public Service Medal : For Telecom and Torture Immunity ? "
Rockefeller famously sent a handwritten note to Cheney expressing some misgivings about warrantless eavesdropping , but then misplaced the copy he had squirreled away in his safe .
Cheney ridiculed him recently on TV , revealing that Rockefeller recently asked him if he could please make him another copy and send it to him .
In December 2005 , when the NSA program of warrantless eavesdropping hit the press , Hayden agreed to play point man on handling the smoke and mirrors .
Small wonder that the White House later deemed him the perfect man to head the CIA .
A whiff of conscience showed through during Hayden 's nomination hearing , though , when he flubbed the answer to what was supposed to be a soft , fat pitch from administration loyalist , Sen. Kit Bond , R - Missouri , now vice - chair of the Senate intelligence overlook committee :
" Did you believe that your primary responsibility as director of NSA was to execute a program that your NSA lawyers , the Justice Department lawyers , and White House officials all told you was legal , and that you were ordered to carry it out by the President of the United States ? "
Instead of the simple " Yes " that had been scripted , Hayden paused and spoke rather poignantly - and revealingly :
" I had to make this personal decision in early October 2001 , and it was a personal decision ... I could not not do this . "
Why should it have been such an enormous personal decision whether or not to obey a White House order ?
No one asked Hayden , but it requires no particular acuity to figure it out .

This is a military officer who , like the rest of us , swore to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; a military man well aware that one must never obey an unlawful order ; and an NSA director totally familiar with the FISA restrictions .
That , it seems clear , is why Hayden found it a difficult personal decision .
Did the new , post - 9/11 " paradigm " - created by then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and Cheney 's lawyer David Addington - trump the Constitution ?
Was not illegal electronic surveillance a key part of the second article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon , approved by a 28 to 10 bipartisan House Judiciary Committee vote less than two weeks before Nixon resigned ?
No American , save perhaps Admiral Inman and Gen. Odom , knew the FISA law better than Hayden .
Nonetheless , in his testimony , Hayden conceded that he did not even require a written legal opinion from NSA lawyers as to whether the new , post - 9/11 comprehensive surveillance program , to be implemented without court warrants and without adequate consultation in Congress , could pass the smell test .
Hayden said he sought an oral opinion from then - NSA general counsel Robert L. Deitz , whom Hayden has now brought over to CIA as a " trusted aide . "
In the fall of 2007 , Hayden launched Deitz on an investigation of the CIA 's own statutory Inspector General , who had made the mistake of being too diligent in investigating abuses like torture .
Enough said .
Hayden Comfortable With Torture
As the Senate Armed Services Committee has now confirmed , President Bush , by executive order of Feb. 7 , 2002 , gave carte blanche to torture .
That was four years before Hayden was confirmed as CIA director .
But when asked to be chief apologist for abusive torture techniques , Hayden again saluted .
And after nearly two years as chief of CIA , Hayden confirmed ( on Feb. 5 , 2008 ) that , in 2002 - 03 , " 9/11 mastermind " Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other " high - value " detainees had been waterboarded .
Waterboarding , an extreme form of interrogation going back at least as far as the Spanish Inquisition , has been condemned as torture by just about everyone - except the legal experts of the Bush administration , including Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who is still having trouble making up his mind on this issue - for reasons that should be abundantly clear .
Oddly , Mukasey is on record as saying that waterboarding would be torture if applied to him .
And National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell told Lawrence Wright of the New Yorker magazine , " Whether it is torture by anybody else 's definition , for me it would be torture . "
McConnell then let the cat out of Mukasey 's bag , saying , " If it is ever determined to be torture , there will be a huge penalty to be paid for anyone engaging in it . "
It is a safe bet that this would be an extreme embarrassment , at least , for anyone in charge of an agency engaged in torture .
Small wonder that Hayden has now summoned the chutzpah to warn the incoming President against launching an investigation into such matters .
Former CIA head George " we - do - not - torture " Tenet who - with the President 's Feb.
7 , 2002 , executive order in hand - was responsible for implementing torture policies , has evidenced some unease regarding the possibility that he might be held to account for taking liberties with national and international law .
Tenet included these telling sentences in his memoir :
" We were asking for and we would be given as many authorities as CIA ever had .
Things could blow up .
People , me among them , could end up spending some of the worst days of our lives justifying before congressional overseers our new freedom to act . "
( At the Center of the Storm , p. 177-178 )
Protesting Too Much
As the torture revelations piled up , Hayden again went front and center defending waterboarding and offering pitiable excuses for the destruction of tapes of the interrogation of high - value detainees , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
On Fox News last June , for example , Hayden insisted that after 9/11 , " it was the collective judgment of the American government that these techniques would be appropriate and lawful , " including waterboarding , which he referred to as a " high - end interrogation technique . "
Hayden protested , " Now , if you ask me was it lawful , the answer is absolutely . "
He went on to explain , " Literally thousands of Americans " have been waterboarded in training , and he suggested that this experience provided " a body of knowledge as to what the transient and permanent effects would be . "
Hayden made it clear that he was prepared to instruct his torturers to waterboard again , if the President ordered it .
Never mind that all those folks waterboarded in training knew it would stop as soon as they cried Uncle ; never mind that the " technique " is among the most iconic and notorious forms of torture , for which American officers as well as Japanese and Germans have been prosecuted and convicted ; never mind Hayden 's dubious claims that valuable intelligence has been gotten through waterboarding .
And never mind the crystal - clear observation made on Sept. 6 , 2006 , by Lt. Gen. John Kimmons , head of U.S. Army intelligence : " No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices .
I think history tells us that .
I think the empirical evidence of the last five years , hard years , tells us that . "
Chalk it up to my bias - and my experience as an Army intelligence officer - but I 'll take Kimmons 's word over any blue - suited desk jockey - no matter how many stars on the shoulder of the latter .
Sanctimonious Sam
What brings up Cicero 's outrage again is the aura of sanctity with which Michael Hayden has attempted to envelop himself .
His blind fealty in implementing and then defending the administration 's defiance of the law on eavesdropping made him well qualified , in the administration 's eyes , for the job of CIA director .
And Hayden gave every evidence of eagerness to be in charge of waterboarding and other " high - end " interrogation techniques .
Hayden likes to brag about his moral training and Catholic credentials .
At his nomination hearing , for example , he noted that he was the beneficiary of 18 years of Catholic education .
That set me to counting my own years of Catholic education - only 17 .
Seems I missed the course on " Ethical High - End Interrogation Techniques . "
The sooner Hayden is gone ( likely to join the Fawning Corporate Media channels as an expert commentator , and to warm some seats on defense - industry corporate boards ) the better .
His credentials would appear quite good for that kind of work .
Quousque , tandem , abutere , Hayden , patientia nostra !

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Key measures of President - elect Barack Obama 's economic recovery plan are facing a barrage of criticism from some Senate Democrats , with one charging that the plan 's tax breaks were a return to " trickledown " economics .
Sen .
Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , says many of the tax credits in the stimulus plan amount to " trickledown " economics .
During a lengthy closed - door meeting Thursday evening with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill , Larry Summers , chosen to head the National Economic Council , and senior Obama adviser David Axelrod heard complaints about the stimulus plan , according to two senior Democratic aides who attended the meeting .
" The concern seemed to be that people feel like the infrastructure projects are certain to create jobs and the business tax breaks are less certain to create jobs , and that 's what our focus needs to be , " one of the aides said .
Democrats also appealed to the Obama team to figure out a way to ensure that money for roads and bridges filters down to cities , counties and local planning boards .
The aide said some members are " fearful that governors will have all the say . "
Wisconsin Democrat Ron Kind , a member of the House tax writing committee , described the meeting as a discussion on a variety of proposals .
" I do n't think anyone really expects this stuff is going to come down from some mountain written on tablets and given to the Congress .
But certainly , there 's going to be a lot of deference toward what the administration is thinking , but there are areas that can be tweaked and improved upon , " Kind said .
Democrats made it clear that they plan to put their stamp on the massive economic stimulus bill .
New York Democrat Charlie Rangel , who chairs the tax panel , said negotiations are continuing about which specific tax proposals will remain in the package .
Obama wants a bill on his desk by mid-February , putting negotiations on a fast track .
The Obama team will return Sunday for another session with Senate Democrats .
Summers held back - to - back meetings Friday , first with the full House Democratic caucus and then with the Democratic members of the Ways and Means committee , which is drafting the tax cut part of the plan .
On Thursday , key members of Obama 's party emerged from a closed - door meeting of the Senate Finance Committee criticizing central tax measures of the president - elect 's proposals .
Watch Obama explain his tax proposals »
In particular , members criticized said they did not think the idea of giving employers a $ 3,000 tax credit for each employee they hire would work .
" I 'd rather spend the money on the infrastructure , on direct investment , on energy conversion and other kinds of things much more directly and much more rapidly and much more certainly create a real job , " said Sen .
John Kerry , D - Massachusetts .
Several Democrats also said they were down on a tax proposal for payroll tax credits -- amounting to about $ 20 per paycheck and totaling $ 500 per person and $ 1,000 for couples earning less that $ 200,000 a year .
Sen . Ron Wyden , D - Oregon , said he doubted that proposal would do much to stimulate the economy .
" We have an example from the first stimulus that indicates just giving people $ 500 to $ 600 , while certainly welcome when there 's this much economic hurt , may not be the best use of stimulus , " Wyden said .
Instead , pumping more money into infrastructure spending would be more effective in creating jobs , Wyden said .
None of the senators CNN spoke with after the Finance Committee meeting said they thought the opposition to these provisions would derail the bill but suggested that many meetings would be needed with the Obama team to hammer out an agreement .
On the other side of the Capitol , House Democratic Whip Jim Clyburn , D - South Carolina , said Democrats were discussing including the alternative minimum tax as part of the package , in addition to the payroll tax cut and business tax credits the Obama team has proposed .
Clyburn made it clear that Hill Democrats are n't inclined to give Obama everything he wants .
" Democrats are going to be Democrats , " he said .
" We 're creative thinkers .
We do n't believe in group think . "
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that House committees will begin action on Obama 's proposed economic recovery package in the next couple of weeks , with a vote in the full House slated for the week after Obama 's inauguration .
In a speech Thursday , Obama said it was imperative that Congress move quickly to pass the stimulus package once he takes office .
" We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime , a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks , " Obama said at George Mason University in Virginia .

That crazy jungle gym ... I think I saw it on the last continent too ...
Or was it when I played through this exact same mission as the blue army ?
I bought a crate of , like , 217 peanut butter granola bar from Costco for $ 6 this one time .
Probably the best deal I 've ever gotten in my life , but given the chance I do n't know if I 'd do it again .
I kept them upright on the floor in my closet by the door and grabbed one for breakfast each workday , bending just a little further down each week .
I 'd eat a bar in three bites and stuff my hands back in my pockets , shivering on the Dunellen train platform before the sun came up .
Sometimes , between the cold closet and colder morning air , they 'd harden and stick in my teeth , keeping me occupied almost all the way to Newark .
Other times I 'd be so tired , hungry , and hungover from last night 's fight and drinking in the dark that I ate without tasting .
But as sick as I got of seeing those bars , on days on the way to the end of that box when I 'd forget to take one for breakfast , it was like a void in my morning .
That pretty much sums up how I feel about Endwar .
My save says 84 percent done , and something tells me I 'll have to bend pretty far to hit bottom .
It has n't gotten much more difficult than when it began , despite dividing the three campaigns into " easy , " " normal , " and " hard , " and it has n't thrown a new combat element or objective at me since the 12th tutorial mission .
At worst playing it is nauseating , at best it can be played unconscious , but I 've been playing the same game for so long now I can't imagine when it finally does end how else I 'll be able to fill my time on the commute or commode .
Anyway , it 's late and I 've got to brush my teeth and play some Endwar before I pass out .
Maybe tonight I 'll make it to 86 percent completion .
( A quick reminder for readers who wonder why the banks should n’t be allowed to go bankrupt , like any other company that made the kinds of mistakes banks made .
The answer is that the banking system is the engine of the economy ; if banks stop functioning , economic activity will grind to a halt .
Indeed , at least some of the pain we are going through now is the result of the banking system ’s not functioning properly . )
The key point here is that any systemic solution has to deal with the bad assets , once and for all .
They need to be properly valued and they need to be isolated .
“ How do you know how big the hole is on the balance sheet of Citi until you have a decent valuation ? ” asks the Princeton economist Alan Blinder .
That is the primary reason the banking system ca n’t attract private capital and has to rely on the government  no prospective investor has any idea how deep the hole is .
That will only start to become clear when these assets are either written down to zero ( unlikely ) or start trading again .
The second point is that the next round of recapitalization  and it now appears the next $ 350 billion of TARP money is going to be used primarily for that purpose  needs to encompass the entire banking system , and needs to be truly enormous .
Simon Johnson , a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. , and a well - known blogger on banking issues , says he believes that it will take $ 1 trillion to really do the trick  money , presumably , the government will get back once the banking system is healthy again , and private capital comes in to replace the government ’s capital .
“ It ’s not rocket science , ” Mr. Johnson said .
“ When you do a recap , you need overkill .
But then , you also have to take the bad assets off the books . ”
In the recent deals it cut with Citi and Bank of America , the government tried to “ ring - fence ” bad assets  that ’s its phrase , not mine  by agreeing to absorb losses on securities that have been identified as toxic .
But that is still a piecemeal , one - bank - at - a - time approach .
Mr. Blinder , a former
Fed governor , told me that he thought the government should be thinking about the entire problem differently : “ It should go market to market instead of institution to institution . ”
He pointed to actions by the Federal Reserve as a possible model : it has revived the commercial paper market by creating a commercial paper funding facility  and has done the same with several other important debt markets .
In effect , it is guaranteeing the smooth functioning of those markets .
And that approach has worked .
As it turns out , Ms. Bair  who , thankfully , will remain the head of the F.D.I.C. in the new administration  has been thinking along the same lines .
She , Mr. Bernanke and Treasury officials have begun talking about a new kind of bank , one that would be created and capitalized by the federal government , and whose sole purpose would be to buy up bad assets .
Instead of ring - fencing bad assets one bank at a time , it would warehouse them in one place , much the same way the Resolution Trust Corporation did for real estate assets during the savings and loan crisis .
Would the sale of these assets cause further write - downs ?
Of course .
That is why you would need to throw more capital into the banks as part of a systemic solution .
But at least you would finally know how deep the hole is .
“ You would have to mark the assets at the price they were selling for , ” Ms. Bair told me .
“ I think that is an advantage . ”
At long last , there would be some certainty .
Private capital wo n’t return to the banking system until that happens .
( CNN ) --
What was the name of that guy with that stuff in that place with those things ?
Do n't you remember ?
Scientists have found mechanisms for how the brain creates short - term and long - term memories .
We all suffer occasional lapses in memory .
Some people suffer severe neurological conditions , such as Alzheimer 's , that rob them of their ability to form memories or remember recent events .
Three new studies shed light on the way the brain forms , stores and retrieves memories .
Experts say they could have implications for people with certain mental disorders .
When did it happen ?
Newly born brain cells , thousands of which are generated each day , help " time stamp " memories , according to a computer simulation by scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , California , and the University of Queensland in Australia .
The research was published in the journal Neuron .
These cells do not record an exact , absolute date -- such as January 28 , 2009 -- but instead encode memories that occur around the same time similarly .
In this way , the mind knows whether a memory happened before , after or alongside something else .
Neuroscientists believe that if the same neurons are active during two events , a memory linking the two may be formed .
For example , you might remember that , on a day a few years ago , you went to a restaurant and then went to a baseball game .
Researchers think the same neurons are active during both events , which results in an association with each other when you remember them .
In fact , the same young neurons respond to everything that happens for several weeks , said two of the study 's co-authors , professor Fred Gage and graduate student Brad Aimone from the Salk Institute .
While associations are known to form based on sight , smell , and other senses -- you may remember last year 's baseball game through the taste of a hot dog today , for example -- their computer model shows that the young brain cells also link through time .
" Even though these young cells are only a small percentage of the overall circuit , we believe that their effect may be enough to give people the sense of " this happened around the same time as " something else , Gage and Aimone wrote in an e-mail .
The findings could have promising implications for diseases that involve a neurogenesis deficit -- in other words , a lack of new brain cells being born -- which happens in conditions such as depression , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's , the authors said .
A therapy that boosts the creation of neurons may alleviate some memory problems .
Potential therapies include medications , a special diet or even running , since previous research has shown that running increases the creation of neurons , Aimone said .
The computer simulation showing the time - stamp effect in the study is novel and original , said Joe Manns , assistant professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
It also explains why , for example , you recognize your car both when it 's very dirty and very clean , and why you can remember where you parked your car today even though you had a different space yesterday .
Storing in the short - term
You may remember reading this exact sentence in a few minutes , but not in a few days .
That 's because our brains handle both long - term memory , which enables us to recall events from the distant past , and short - term memory , also called working memory , which encompasses the most transient , fleeting memories .
Research in mice published in the February issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience found that an individual nerve cell in the front part of the brain can hold traces of memories on its own for as long as a minute , possibly even longer , said senior author Don Cooper , assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center .
This idea , that an individual nerve cell can hold a trace memory , is also related to drug addiction , the study found .
By giving cocaine to mice in the laboratory , the researchers explained why the drug impairs short term memory : Cocaine causes a buildup of dopamine , a brain chemical that decreases the individual nerve cells ' ability to hold moment - to - moment information .
The study is an important contribution to the field of working memory because it shows the molecular mechanisms involved in the process , said Michael Kuhar , professor of neuropharmacology at Emory University , who was not involved with the research .
One distant but possible implication is that medication focusing on the neuron receptors investigated in this study would help someone who has serious problems with attention and executive decisions , he said .
Although the study was conducted on mice , when speaking about individual nerve cells , it 's reasonable to say that an isolated mouse nerve cell is the same as a human one , Kuhar said .
The two differ more markedly in complicated neural pathways and circuits , he said .
Holding for the long term
So , what about remembering things in the long run ?
Research in the Journal of Neuroscience this week supports the idea that different brain structures are involved in forming short - term and long - term memories .
The authors took brain images of participants as they answered questions about events that happened in the last 30 years .
The hippocampus , a brain region known to be involved in short - term memory , and related structures were most active when participants recalled recent events .
Activity in these regions declined for events older than one year , and remained low for events 13 to 30 years old .
Meanwhile , as memories got older activity increased in the frontal , temporal , and parietal cortices , located on the surface of the brain , researchers found .
That means these regions may serve as long - term memory storage .
This model of memory structures make sense in the context of Alzheimer 's disease , said study co-author Larry Squire , professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Diego .
Alzheimer 's patients often have trouble forming short - term memories , but less difficulty recalling older memories .
" It helps us understand that Alzheimer 's disease begins with memory problems because the very same structures we 're talking about here [ the hippocampus and related structures ] are the ones affected in the disease , " he said .

The song is based on the Harry Enfield character Loadsamoney
The single , Credit Crunch Christmas , features the chorus : “ Sorry we ****** up your Christmas , but really we do n’t give a s***. ” [>
WATCH THE SNEERING VIDEO FOR YOURSELF RIGHT NOW ... [> [>
One of the bankers , called the City Boyz , claims to have roped in his young son to sing in it .
The song was a result of a boozy session and has echoes of Harry Enfield ’s loathsome Loadsamoney TV character from the 1980s , with the line : “ We have made loadsa money , in fact we ’re swimming in it . ”
HEARTLESS : Viewers are wished a ' Merry Crunch Christmas '
The song , available from iTunes , starts off innocently , with the child singing about how people are sad due to the credit crunch and how there will be no Christmas lunch or Nintendo toys for many .
The video features drawings of dole queues and Woolworths stores closing down before launching into the unapologetic chorus .
It also shows footage of bankers drinking and urinating in a London pub .
Later lyrics include lines about people not being able to meet their Visa interest payments . [>

The City Boyz , named as Ciarran “ The Brawler ” , Dave , Jeremy and Marcus , declined to reveal their employers ’ names but are City bankers and stock brokers .
One claimed to work for the collapsed investment house Lehman Brothers .
City Boyz spokesman
Dave said : “ We were down O’Neills , p****d as usual and p****d off that we were getting the blame for the crunch all the bloody time .
“ Then we all thought you know what , we do n’t really give a s**t .
We ’ve all done OK , sod ’em .
One of the guys came up with this chorus .
We had the whole pub joining in so we knew were on to something ! ”
In keeping with the City ’s reputation for looking after its own interests , royalties from the record will go towards another drinking session .
Dave snidely said : “ All the proceeds are going behind the bar … you could say it ’s a charity record ! ” [> [>
The song is on track for the Top 100 , but the bankers claim that it could get into the Top 10 , such is the support they say it is getting from the City .
BEDFORD HEIGHTS , Ohio ( CNN ) --
After two years of traveling around the country and criticizing President Bush , President - elect Barack Obama said Friday that he " always thought [ Bush ] was a good guy . "
Barack Obama tells CNN's John King that it was " tough " for him to request the additional bailout funds .
" I mean , I think personally he is a good man who loves his family and loves his country , " Obama said in an exclusive interview with CNN's John King .
During the election season , Obama frequently campaigned against what he called Bush 's " failed policies " and promised a " clean break " from the past eight years .
Asked if there was anything he wanted to take back , now that he has spent more time with the president , Obama praised Bush 's team for helping with a smooth transition and said part of what America is about is being able to have " disagreements politically and yet treat each other civilly . "
Obama also said he thought Bush made " the best decisions that he could at times under some very difficult circumstances . "
" That does not detract from my assessment that over the last several years , we have made a series of bad choices and we are now going to be inheriting the consequences of a lot of those bad choices , " Obama said .
In addition to his relationship with Bush , Obama also discussed some key issues that he will face in the first days of his administration , including national security and the economy .
Even before taking the oath of office , Obama has already faced a showdown with Congress over releasing what remains of the $ 700 bailout bill that Bush and Congress authorized before the election .
The $ 350 billion that the Senate approved will come with specific conditions , Obama said .
" There 's nothing wrong with us placing some conditions , making sure that the money 's not going to executive compensation , making sure you 're not seeing big dividend payoffs to shareholders and making sure that money is being left so that we can get credit flowing again , not just for individual homeowners who are losing their homes , but also small businesses who are the lifeblood of this economy .
" If they can't get credit , then they end up having to shutter their doors .
And when they shutter their doors , people lose jobs .
They then can't pay their mortgage , and you start down the road that we 're on .
We want to reverse that path , and that means that 's the way we use the next $ 350 billion that Congress voted on , and that was a very tough vote for a lot of people .
And it was tough for me to have to request it , " he said .
Obama sat down with King after he took a factory tour in Bedford Heights , Ohio .

Fast Geometric Hashing for Automated Astrometry is a fascinating presentation about a solution to the problem of examining a photo of a section of the sky , and figuring out what part of the sky it is .
It involves geometry , and algorithms , a clever hashing algorithm for that returns the same result independent of rotation and scale , mapping , search trees , and so on .

PS : the whole thing has been hooked up with the flickr API to automatically identify objects in astronomy pictures on flickr .
Very cool .
Let 's take a look at the stories behind some of your favorite spices .
1. Pepper
If you eat enough pepper you 'll start to sweat , which explains why the ancients thought the stuff made an excellent medical treatment .
The Chinese employed it as a treatment for malaria , cholera , and dysentery , while Indian monks used it as a sort of PowerBar : they swallowed small amounts of the stuff in hopes that it would help them survive their long treks through the rough countryside .
Later , pepper became so valuable that it served as a de facto form of currency ; it was used for centuries in Europe to pay rent and taxes .
In one exceptional case , it was also used for ransom : Attila the Hun is said to have demanded about 3,000 pounds of the stuff in 408 C.E. ; in exchange , he promised to lay off the city of Rome and stop sacking it .
2. Salt
It 's probably been the most valuable food additive in all of history , mostly because it did such a good job of preserving foods in the centuries before the refrigerator was invented .
Salt mines in Chehr Abad , Iran , also testify to the stuff 's ability to preserve people .
Four " salt men "  have been discovered there , eerily mummified by what they were digging for ; two of them may date as far back as 650 B.C.E .
But the use of salt far predates the Iranian salt men .
In China , writings that are something like 4,700 years old testify to its value ; the Peng - Tzao - Kan - Mu , the earliest known treatise pharmacology , mentions more than 40 kinds of salt .
And a tragic piece of Chinese folklore that has probably been around since the time of the Peng - Tzao - Kan - Mu tells a story of how the phoenix , that majestic mythical bird , first brought salt to the attention of a lowly peasant — who was accidentally put to death by a temperamental emperor before anyone realized the value of what he had found .
3. Cinnamon
Although it 's originally from the hard - to - reach island of Ceylon ( a.k.a. Sri Lanka ) , cinnamon has been a global sensation for millennia .
It first appears in Chinese writings that date to 2800 B.C.E. ( they called it kwai ) .
Cinnamon was also used by the Egyptians in embalming , perhaps , as with salt , for the same reason that it became a popular cooking spice — its warm aroma and antibacterial properties could hide the stench of food starting to go bad .
The Romans had attachments to cinnamon , too , both medical and sentimental .
Pliny the Elder records the stuff as being worth about fifteen times its weight in silver .
And the Roman Emperor Nero , known for both his evil tendencies and his extravagance , sacrificed a year 's supply of the stuff as an apologia for murdering his wife — although we 're guessing Roman spice merchants failed to appreciate the gesture .
4. Nutmeg
Like cinnamon , this one 's been a popular spice since the days of , yep , Pliny the Elder , who writes about a curious plant that bears two spices :
Nutmeg is the plant 's seed ; mace is made from a fleshy covering around the seed .
Nutmeg 's distinctive scent ( think eggnog ) has made it consistently popular throughout the ages ; Emperor Henry VI reportedly had workers blanket the streets of Rome with the aroma in celebration of his crowning .
The vast majority of the world 's nutmeg now comes from the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada — in fact , the local economy is based almost entirely on tourism and nutmeg exports , and the spice is the centerpiece of the country 's flag — but that 's not where the plant originated .
In fact , nutmeg did n't even exist in Grenada until British sailors brought it there in the early 1800s ; it 's from the East Indies , not the West Indies .
The British had good reason for introducing an invasive species , though :
The combination of a blight , political upheaval , and Dutch merchants who burned nutmeg warehouses to keep the prices high had pretty much wiped out the world supply of nutmeg at that point .
5. Ginger
There 's plenty of debate over whether Marco Polo brought back pasta from his trip to China , but one thing is certain : he did bring back ginger .
Hugely popular in the Roman Empire , ginger suffered roughly the same fate as said empire ; by Polo 's days , it was barely known in the West .
Polo and company reintroduced it as a rare luxury , and it stayed that way for centuries .
In fact , Queen Elizabeth was a noted enthusiast , and some historians think she may have invented the gingerbread man .
6. Horseradish
Anything that tastes as strong as horseradish has got to have a history of use in medicine — and indeed , horseradish does ; in the 3,500 years that humans have been eating it , they 've used it to treat everything from rheumatism to tuberculosis , from lower back pain to low libido .
Hippocrates wrote about it ( along with the 400 other spicy medicines he recommended ) , and the oracle at Delphi was a big fan , too ; he supposedly told Apollo that " the radish is worth its weight in lead , the beet its weight in silver , and the horseradish its weight in gold . " 
Horseradish had a bit of a renaissance during , well , the Renaissance ; as a food fad , it spread all over Europe and Scandinavia , and by the late 1600s , it was a British staple , eaten alongside beef and oysters and made into pungent cordials .
Which is all fine and good ( we like the stuff too ) , but why is it called horseradish ?
The answer has very little to do with horses .
The Germans call the stuff " meerrettich , "  or " sea radish , "  since that 's where it grows .
English - speakers may have picked up the word and bastardized it to " mare - radish , "  which then became not - necessarily - a - female - horse radish .
We , however , prefer the more descriptive name that some American settlers used for it ; they charmingly ( and accurately ) called it " stingnose . " 

This article has been edited from a previously published version to correctly indicate it was the Canadian International Development Agency that said it would take 455 days to provide records about Ottawa 's polio campaign in Afghanistan .
OTTAWA–A secretive Conservative government shares the blame for an access - to - information system that is dogged with delays and on the brink of " crisis , " a scathing report says .
Information Commissioner Robert Marleau issued a hard - hitting condemnation yesterday of Ottawa 's " risk - averse , disclosure - averse " atmosphere that denies Canadians the information they 're entitled to about the workings of the federal government .
And he singled out the Conservatives ' " stranglehold in the centre on communications " and challenged Ottawa 's " tendency to withhold information . "
" It will take the leadership of the government to change and turn this around .
No amount of my barking or biting is going to change that , " Marleau said .
" I think it 's important this government make crystal clear what its intentions are on transparency . "
The Conservative government came to power in 2006 , in part on a promise to reform outdated access - to - information laws and make Ottawa more open and accountable .
But yesterday , Marleau was forced to appeal to Prime Minister Stephen Harper to follow U.S. President Barack Obama 's lead and send a clear message that open government is a priority .
" Public servants do want to serve Canadians , and when they hear it from the Prime Minister that it is a priority to be more transparent and be more diligent in the disclosure of information , it would have a considerable impact . "
Treasury Board President Vic
Toews , who is responsible for the file , refused to talk to reporters yesterday .
In the Commons , he boasted that the Conservatives made Crown corporations open to information requests , but he sidestepped questions about the long delays plaguing the system .
Under legislation first introduced in the mid-1980s , Canadians can pay $ 5 to request information from federal agencies .
But in his 156 - page report , Marleau noted how requests frequently become bogged down in delays that stretch upward of 100 days .
He said filling information requests within 30 days – the statutory guideline – has become the " exception . "
He said the intent of the law – to force federal departments to disclose information about their operations – is being undermined by overburdened , poorly trained staff and apathy at the highest levels of government .
Marleau surveyed 10 federal institutions in how they responded to access to information requests during the 2007 - 08 fiscal year and judged that six performed " below average . "
The defence department , Foreign Affairs , Public Works and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ranked among the worst performers of the departments surveyed .
Foreign Affairs took , on average , 132 days to meet requests .
Public
Works took an average of 126 days .
Marleau noted how the defence department established a so - called " tiger " team to vet all access requests related to Canada 's military mission in Afghanistan , even though it meant delays of a month and more .
" They were part of the difficulty in the early , timely disclosure of information about Afghanistan , " he said .
But those delays continue .
Just this week , the Canadian International Development Agency told the Star it would take 455 days to provide records about Ottawa 's polio campaign in Afghanistan .
The commissioner said while departments are well within their rights to ask to extensions past the 30 days , " those extensions are getting longer and longer and longer ... and I do n't think it is reasonable " when it takes up to 180 days for information to be made available .
Marleau noted that besides the barrage of complaints to his office about excessive delays , he also hears from people complaining about excessive fees .
The opposition parties are threatening to unite to force the government to live up to the letter of the access to information law .
Already the New Democrats have a private member 's bill before Parliament calling for sweeping changes .
Liberal MP Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Scarborough East ) said Canada was once a " beacon " for openness and transparency but " that light has ... been extinguished . "

Even on the day that Henderson was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame , he still mused about playing one more game with the Oakland Athletics .
“ I always want to reappear in a uniform with Oakland , ” Henderson said .
Henderson ’s superb career as a leadoff hitter was defined by speed and success , themes that continued Monday when he was elected into the Hall in his first year of eligibility .
As Henderson sprinted into the Hall with 94.8 percent of the vote , Jim Rice squeezed in through a closing door .
In Rice ’s 15th and final year on the ballot , he received 76.4 percent .
For election , players need 75 percent of the vote from veteran members of the Baseball Writers ’ Association of America .
Of the 539 ballots cast , Henderson notched 511 votes and Rice 412 .
Rice , a slugger for the Boston Red Sox , surpassed the necessary threshold by seven votes .
Outfielder Andre Dawson followed Rice with 67 percent and pitcher Bert Blyleven had 62.7 .

Interesting article about how MIT is moving from massive lectures to interactive sessions .
Attendance is up and failure rates are down .
' bout time .
We constantly think that we need more teachers .
That may not be the case .
In fact we may need fewer , better teachers in combination with better automation ( particularly in college ) .
Some points :
The delta of experience between attending a lecture and watching a video of a lecture ?
Nada .
If anything , the video is better since you can rewind it , view it at the best vantage point ( vs. at the back of a big lecture hall ) , and view it in a quiet relaxed space .
Video lectures ( as most colleges are doing now ) make it possible to get the best .
A dozen of the best lecture series could serve to replace 99 % of lectures now being given by less gifted teachers .
Interactive education , like what MIT is providing now , is highly computerized .
Almost all of it could be done online .
The interactive process of learning / application via collaboration is something that is perfectly suited for virtual worlds .
JIT information in combination with simulated real world application within a collaborative environment is something that is going on with WoW right now ( on a massive scale ) .
OF course , this means that the system could become extremely productive .
There 's very little need to attend a school in person .
Geographic decentralization is possible ( at a huge reduction in expense ) .
There 's also little need for most of the teachers at the mid to upper levels of education .
All measures of productivity would zoom through the roof .

All that needs to happen in this space is for a University with a solid brand to open it up virtual undergraduate education to a million or two students ( at much less cost than presently ) .
It would not only become the most profitable school in the world ( even with massive reductions in fees ) , it would produce some of the most capable students in the system .
Unfortunately , the quality of entrepreneurship in academia is terrible .

Comet and Meteor
Credit & Copyright : Babak Tafreshi ( TWAN )
Explanation :
This meteor streaking toward the horizon through the early morning sky of January 4th is from the annual Quadrantid meteor shower .
Aligned with the shower 's radiant point high in the north ( off the top of the view ) , the meteor trail passes to the right of bright bluish star Beta Scorpii .
Remarkably , near the top of the trail is a small spot , the fuzzy greenish glow of a comet .
Discovered in July of 2007 , Comet Lulin ( C/2007 N3 ) , is too faint now to be easily seen by the unaided eye , but will likely brighten to become visible to skygazers by late February .
The well - timed skyscape featuring both comet and meteor is particularly appropriate as cometary bodies are known to be the origins of planet Earth 's annual meteor showers .
Just what is it about moobs ?
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
The number of men having breast reduction operations in the UK is rising dramatically , but is this really the result of the media spotlighting the physical flaws of male celebrities ?
This is an era when glossy magazines and tabloids delight in the most minor flaw of the female celebrity .
The actress with bags under her eyes , the singer with an untrimmed armpit , the model with a sweat patch , all are presented blinking in the paparazzo's flashbulb as their imperfections are chronicled .
All are highlighted with red circles and magnification .
And the same process has been applied to male celebrities in recent years .
EXCESSIVE MALE BREASTS
Pubertal gynaecomastia , common in boys , sees breast tissue grow due to hormonal imbalance
In most boys it disappears by end of puberty Breast growth can be side effect of drugs used to suppress prostate cancer Can be caused by genetic condition like Klinefelter 's Syndrome Other causes include : Obesity Anabolic steroid use
When both the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and leader of the opposition David Cameron were pictured enjoying the sun in the summer of 2006 , newspapers from tabloid to broadsheet passed comment on their " moobs " .
Every man has breast tissue , but some have excessive breasts .
This ranges from classical cases of gynaecomastia , prompted by a range of causes , to breasts enlarged entirely by deposits of fat over the pectoral muscles .
But whatever the cause British men seem to be increasingly concerned over the state of their chests .
The latest figures from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons ( Baaps ) seem to bear out this obsession .
Surgeons carried out 323 male breast reduction procedures in 2008 , up a staggering 44 % from 2007 .
It would be easy to assume that the UK is a nation where men are rapidly becoming more obese , and they are taking a surgical shortcut to get rid of male breasts that are merely deposits of fat on top of their pectoral muscles .
Simon Cowell was mercilessly ribbed for his physique , but has since embarked on a fitness regime
But this is not the full picture says consultant plastic surgeon and Baaps member Dalia Nield .
She concedes that anything up to a third of the men seeking breast reductions are simply obese .
But she says the rest of the rising numbers of operations are people who are suffering gynaecomastia - excessive breasts - caused by other factors , such as a hormonal imbalance .
Among these , a common type is pubertal gynaecomastia , where boys develop the excessive breast tissue during adolescence .
" Many of those young men if they do n't have a very marked gynaecomastia they do n't necessarily seek help , " says Ms Nield .
" But I see many of these pubertal cases later in life when they put on weight and it becomes more obvious . "
Genetic disorders like Klinefelter 's Syndrome - having an extra " X " chromosome - also account for some cases , and there are a rising number of men suffering from excessive breast tissue as a side effect of drugs prescribed for prostate cancer .
Treatment of this type of cancer has improved in recent years , says Mrs Nield , leading to more cases .
But how can one explain the dramatic upwards trajectory for male breast reduction procedures ?
In 2005 , only 22 were performed .
' Tremendous distress '
Mrs Nield suggests that much of the increase may be due to the media publicising the surgery option .
Many of those pieces mocking the imperfections of the middle - aged celebrity also contain a factbox that talks about non-obesity gynaecomastia and explains that surgery is an option .
MOOBS : THE ETYMOLOGY
Portmanteau word of " man " and " boobs " First reference in UK newspaper in June 2004 Satirical website manboobs .co.uk domain name registered in January 2003
Term assumed to be of US origin
The effect , Mrs Nield suggests , is that men who might have been suffering in silence for years , realise they are not alone and are spurred on to seek out surgery .
" It is a cause of tremendous distress , " says the surgeon .
And there is no doubting that the last few years have seen an increasing attention to this particular physical flaw .
A search of the LexisNexis newspaper databases suggests the word made its debut in a British newspaper in June 2004 .
Since then it has been used 161 times .
There have been more than 350 references to " man boobs " over the same period .
" Moobs " clocks up 281,000 hits on Google .
Kerri McPherson , a chartered health psychologist at Glasgow Caledonian University and a member of the men's health group , Scotland , is an expert on male body image .
" I would argue that what the media is really discussing is just representing the growing concerns of everyday men .
This concern has always been there but they have not been able to articulate it . "
And it could be argued that media mockery reinforces the negative body image of the excessive male breast sufferer , it also might free some from isolation and paranoia that they could have been burdened with a decade ago .
John McCririck was also mocked after appearing on Celebrity Big Brother
The presentation of " moobs " as something suffered by a slew of male celebrities might make life easier for the ordinary bloke sitting in a pub discussing his problem with his mates .
" More and more people are being given a language to talk about concerns about their body , " says Dr McPherson .
" Particularly with what is a very feminine [ characteristic ] if a man was talking about [ having ] breasts [ decades ago ] they would have been a source of ridicule . "
Paula Singleton , a researcher in the health faculty at Leeds Metropolitan University , is doing a PhD on the attitudes shown by men planning to have breast reduction surgery , entitled " Bruises heal but moobs last forever - men 's account of cosmetic surgery for gynaecomastia . "
" It seems like you can hardly turn on the telly and open a newspaper without it being mentioned , " she says .

Chandler tries to cancel his gym membership Ross : Whoa - whoa - whoa , hey !
Now remember what we talked about , you gotta be strong .
Chandler : Yes .
( In a stronger voice ) Yes !
Ross :
One more time , " Hey , do n't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs ? "
Chandler : No !
I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts !
Seinfeld , 1995 .
George is upset after seeing his dad 's moobs Jerry : So what ?
A lot of older men have that Kramer : No , not these .
These were real hooters .
George : I was throwing up all night .
It was like my own personal Crying Game .
Kramer :
Well , maybe you 're gonna get 'em too , George .
George : Yeah , that 's right .
What if it 's a genetic thing , like father like son ?
" [ Those planning surgery ] described feelings of shame , anxiety and embarrassment .
They had suffered everything from being shouted at from a bus to teasing from work colleagues doctors smirking and laughing at them and saying ' get down the gym ' . "
Of course , it would be wrong to group men with excessive breasts into justifiable " moobs " - ie a hormonal , chemical or genetic cause - and unjustifiable " moobs " - those caused primarily by obesity .
Both sets of men may be suffering psychologically at a time when the male body is under increasing scrutiny .
In the academic world , most of the theorising about body image has traditionally been about women , but now researchers are starting to look at changing attitudes among men .
" Men are starting to feel those appearance pressures more and more , " says Ms Singleton .
And this growing body consciousness could lead to more men making their way through the surgeon 's doors .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I have pretty pronounced man-boobs , but I 'm transgendered and I live that way most of the time .
When I see the pain , cost and hassle that others go through to achieve a convincing cleavage , I count myself very lucky .
Talk about a silver lining .
Susan , London
It is also linked to a certain kind of testicular cancer , as my brother unfortunately found out last year .
He lost a testicle , and gained a little set of man-boobs .
Oddly enough , he was n't particularly impressed with the swap .
Anyway , perhaps all this male self - image pressure will make some men a bit more sensitive about making stupid off - hand comments about women 's bodies .

Many people suffering from this are on male hormone blocking treatment for prostate cancer , and some have to stay on it for life if they are in remission from a high grade cancer .
There is one way of halting or slowing the breast tissue growth by zapping them with radiotherapy .
I was left with two brown discs for months after I had this treatment .
I do n't know what was worst to explain at the gym .
Dave Young , Gloucestershire , UK
You really cannot begin to comprehend the overwhelming effect of gynaecomastia unless you 've lived with it .
I suffered in shame and silence for over 20 years before I even * heard * the term , believing myself a freak , and thinking I was alone .
Staying home , wearing ill - fitting baggy clothes and walking stooped over to hide " them " - all common to men who suffer , and I do mean SUFFER , this condition .
It has lead me to thoughts of self - mutilation and suicide many times .
I am 38 , and never had a relationship as I cannot bear to reveal the existence of " them " to anyone .
Now , thanks to the indescribably shallow celebrity gossip journalists , the ridicule of the schoolyard has spread to the adult world .
Think on this .
The cry of rejoice from men who've had their condition " fixed " with surgery is one which would seem totally insignificant to most people , who might take it completely for granted .
Is it " look at me , I 'm a chiselled Greek god " ?
No , it is merely , " I can wear T - shirts " .
Anon
The sad thing about these politicians is that their physique " issues " will affect the minds of a vapid electorate .
These are middle - aged men we 're talking about , not teenagers .
They sit at desks all day pushing pens for a living , what do you expect ?
I 'd rather they concentrate on that than doing buttock clenches .
Will I find it hard to believe that only 22 operations of this nature were performed in 2005 .
I had this surgery early in 2004 and there was a thriving community of men all posting on an internet support forum having the same kind of operations .
My own surgeon had two more such operations to do that week .

There is much mention of hormonal balance being involved in the generation of male breasts , but no reference to the pervasive use of hormones in meat and dairy production , or the presence of hormones in drinking water .
These appear to be the most likely root cause of hormonal imbalance in men - and consequent moobs .
Gregory Sams , London I 'm under great pressure regarding my physical appearance .
I used to exercise regularly but had a problem with my back and have not been able to train for the last three years .
As I 'm in my early 40s , my chest has drooped considerably to the point where I have to wear loose clothing and do n't like to take my top off on holiday .
I have contemplated surgery as it has really knocked my confidence .

Do n't you think " moobs " is a truly ugly word compared with the elegant alternative " dadderies " ( etymology obvious ) ?

Why do we find it socially acceptable to put a pair of " man boobs " online without any sort of censoring ( or bikini top ) , but should the BBC ever grace its front page with a pair of female boobs , they 'd get fined / in hot water ?
It 's not fair .

Where will Brocade focus its efforts ?
It will press on with DCX and FCoE and its HBA / converged network adapter strategy .
It may well take on thrusting Ethernet suppliers such as Blade Network Technologies but an issue is intelligence in the network .
Presently there is a lot of SAN intelliegence in Brocade 's directors and the DCX .
Will this survive the transition to FCoE ?
Cisco has yet to show signs of transitioning its MDS storage switching functionality into its Ethernet switches .
This SAN intelligence is something that Brocade can use , either to make a block storage - aware Ethernet switch or to push downstream , in whole or part , to a virtual switch running as a VMware virtual machine or its equivalent in a Hyper - V environment .
The ability to provide a single Ethernet networking ' pipe ' ' to a hypervisor and carve it up dynamically into differently sized chunks with diffferent qualities of service for different VMs looks to be something that will be needed by hypervisors , either directly or via API access to an Ethernet switch .
Distributing virtual desktop images across the network could be another focus within the overall virtualisation play .
If Cisco starts introducing its own servers in competition to Dell , HP and IBM then Brocade should find it easier to talk to the server vendors about populating their blade servers with its Ethernetworking front - end gear such as HBAs and NICs and putting its bladed switches into their blade infrastructure .
It 's going to be an interesting 2009 but do n't expect fast fireworks .
The recession will limit expenditures and Brocade will spend many months absorbing Foundry and bringing the two companies together .
It 's got experience at this , having digested McData in the past .
The data centre server and storage chess board has now got a new player and the existing Ethernet suppliers will , you might think , be keen to push their own products and strategies whilst Brocade goes through the Foundry digestion process .
They might make headline - grabbing announcements whilst Brocade is pre-occupied and try to push the company on the backfoot .
Cisco probably has a Brocade - Foundry competition team already pushing buttons and Cisco is where announcement fireworks might come from , particularly around the twin axes of FCoE and virtualisation . ®

Color is a major consideration in any Web design .
Whether for an individual , small company , or major corporation , color scheme is one of the most significant factors in the overall look and appearance of a website .
In some cases , the designer may have the sole discretion in making color choices , but many times a color scheme has already been established and needs to be followed .
In situations where a company already has a strong brand , color usage for the website can either build or take away from this .

In some cases , the designer may have the sole discretion in making color choices , but many times a color scheme has already been established and needs to be followed .
In situations where a company already has a strong brand , color usage for the website can either build or take away from this .
You may want to take a look at the following related posts :
In this article , we ’ll take a look at the impact that website color schemes have on the overall branding of a company , and we ’ll also look at plenty of examples .
We wo n’t be going into the subjects of color choices for branding or the psychology of colors , but rather we ’ll look at established companies to see if the colors in their website branding are consistent with the rest of their marketing .
There are companies in every imaginable industry that have spent many years and a lot of money along the way to create a specific image and brand recognition with customers .
In these cases , their corporate websites should obviously benefit from this established identity and should work to make it even stronger .
However , as we ’ll see throughout this article , this is not always the case .
Some companies do an excellent job of blending their traditional offline image with a modern website , and others have not taken full advantage of their existing brand images when building their websites .
The example websites we ’ll be looking at in this article all belong to companies that have built their brand using specific colors .
When you think of these companies , you think of a specific color , and probably a familiar logo that contains these colors .
Because branding is so dependent on customer perception , customers also have certain assumptions and expectations of companies that have an established brand .
Many of these examples are major retailers , restaurants and companies that have physical locations where customers can go to purchase products or services .
In these cases , each company typically has established colors for the store itself , signage outside the stores , advertising and promotion campaigns and a company website .
The branding is usually more effective if the company ’s website has a similar feel to that of the physical stores and the identity that the company has developed over time .
Impact of a Website ’s Colors
Whether you ’re looking at a website , a flier in a newspaper , a magazine ad or a retail catalog , color choices are critical to the branding of a company .
Most companies have chosen a standard color scheme that is used consistently throughout their marketing materials .
When a website is well designed and effectively uses colors that have been branded over the years , the website and the company benefit from the familiarity that the website and the brand have with customers .
Loyal customers to the company may be new to the website , but if the website is branded consistently with the company as a whole , those visitors are likely to feel at home instantly because of the consistency .
Colors are critical to building the brand ’s image , just as logos are important for the same reason .
With many retail companies looking to boost revenue through increased online sales , converting traditional retail shoppers to online customers is a critical step .
Many retailers are effectively creating websites that have a very similar look and feel to the actual retail stores themselves .
The style and colors of the brand are often replicated as much as possible throughout the website , which creates a more unifying experience for online visitors who have also shopped at the physical retail locations in the past .
By building one consistent brand image , the company is able to more effectively meet its customers in the marketplace , whether that is online of offline .
Impact of Color on Visitors
When visitors come to the website of a brand they know very well , they ’ll often have certain things they expect to find .
Of course , they ’ll expect to see a company logo that they ’re accustomed to seeing .
They ’ll expect a certain type of content according to the type of website it is .
They ’ll expect a design style that fits the corporate identity .
And they ’ll expect to see familiar colors .
In many cases , they probably do n’t even realize they have all of these expectations ; but imagine a company that has branded itself with a particular color for years and years , and now you visit the company ’s website and that color is not a major part of the design .
You ’ll probably be a little surprised , and the website is unlikely to have as familiar a feel as it would have with the traditional colors .
If a company has branded itself a certain way and with specific colors , customers and others familiar with the company will have subconsciously associated those colors with the company .
When these people arrive at the company ’s website , those colors will be a big part of the experience and determine whether the visitor feels connected to the website or senses a disassociation with the rest of the company ’s branding efforts .
Evaluating Use of Color
In order to take a good look at this subject , we ’ll need to evaluate a number of companies and websites .
In the examples here , we ’ll see some that do an effective job of working with the company ’s existing branded image and color scheme , and we ’ll see some that do n’t use company colors in quite the way that you might expect .
All of these companies have used specific colors very significantly in their branding .
Most are very well - established international companies that everyone is familiar with , and in most cases you could associate a color with the brand just by hearing the company name .
Wal - Mart
Wal - Mart has branded itself over the years as the leader in low - cost retail goods .
Along the way , it has used the color blue in just about all of its branding efforts .
In recent years , Wal - Mart has been trying to upgrade its image in the eyes of customers , but the familiar blue color has not gone away , although the logo did get an update not too long ago .
Like most retailers ’ websites , Wal - Mart ’s is primarily white , but there is plenty of blue to give it the familiar feel .
Navigation and headlines are blue throughout most of the website – the same blue color and same Wal - Mart logo found at Wal - Mart ’s retail locations , in fliers and advertisements and in all of its other marketing materials .
Throughout the website , orange and yellow are used as secondary colors , but the heavy use of blue in graphics , navigation and headers is what really gives the website a familiar Wal - Mart feel .
McDonald’s
Fast food giant McDonald ’s is very well recognized for its golden arches and prominent red .
However , the US home page for McDonald ’s does little to build on this strong brand that has been built over a long period of time .
The golden arches logo is there , but black is used much more heavily than the gold and red color scheme .
Certainly , the website does need to be more than just gold and red , as that would be very hard on the eyes , but it seems that the McDonald ’s website does n’t quite feel like McDonald ’s because of this color difference .
Even by just using a white background instead of a black background , the gold and red would stand out more in the design , instead of being overpowered by the black .
An area for potential improvement is the primary navigation menu at the top of the page .
A red background here would do more to promote the McDonald ’s brand and build familiarity with visitors and customers .
With the navigation menu currently designed on a black background , gold could be used either in the text colors or on hover .
Coca - Cola
For decades , the Coca - Cola brand has been built with a very familiar red and white color scheme .
Everything from product packaging to displays in retail stores to advertisements has predominantly used the same color scheme , and as a result the Coke brand is one of the strongest in the world .
The Coca - Cola website does use the red and white color scheme , but there is much less red than you would expect .
The website could easily be a better fit with the company ’s corporate identity with a design that has a red background instead of the gray currently being used .
The well - known Coca - Cola logo is also not used prominently on the home page .
There is a very small logo at the top of the page above the main navigation , which can also be seen on a few of the product labels displayed .
The corporate identity could possibly be enhanced by using a larger logo at the top of the page and by showing it in red , or in white on a red background , rather than in gray on a white background .
Pepsi
Coca - Cola ’s major competitor , Pepsi , has also used a standard color scheme in its own branding efforts over the years .
The red , white and blue color scheme is a Pepsi staple , and the website is true to form in this area .
Most of the website is blue and white with some red in the logo , which stands out more because red is used sparingly .
Just about everything on the home page is red , white or blue .
ING
Financial services provider ING has branded itself with a blue and orange color scheme .
As expected , its website strongly uses these company colors , with orange and blue being almost the only colors used on the website , aside from the white background and the dark gray text .
The main navigation menu is orange , and headlines are blue .
Of course , the logo also uses orange and blue on the white background .
ING ’s online banking customers also see the familiar orange and blue every time they visit their accounts at ING Direct .
This website uses more orange in the design , but the color scheme and branding are consistent .
Ford
US automaker Ford has built its own brand with steady and consistent use of blue .
The Ford website obviously is an extension of this branding effort as blue is used as the background color .
Although a brand ’s colors do n’t necessarily have to be used as the background color of the website ( most companies still use a white background ) , Ford manages to push its brand with heavy use of blue on the website .
Even design elements such as the search button and the secondary navigation towards the bottom of the screen use shades of blue .
One potential area for improvement in terms of corporate identity would be to use the Ford logo in the header , rather than just the words “ Ford Motor Company . ”
The logo does appear on the home page , but it ’s smaller and a bit less noticeable than it would be in the header .
Best Buy
Best Buy customers know that the company makes heavy use of its blue and yellow color scheme .
Even store employees are easily recognizable in their blue shirts .
Consistent with the rest of the company ’s marketing and branding , the Best Buy website uses the familiar color scheme .
Blue is used throughout the website , in the header navigation and even in graphical elements .
Yellow is used more sparingly but is certainly a significant part of the website ’s design .
Because yellow is used in only a few places , it has more of an impact in contrast to the blue colors , and the items in yellow really stand out and draw attention .
The Best Buy logo , the yellow shopping cart , the “ Go ” button on the search form and the “ see Steven ’s story ” button all stand out because of the yellow color .
As a result , Best Buy ’s website is able to use very little color outside of its standard blue and yellow , and it is still able to emphasize what it wants .
Hershey’s
Chocolate maker Hershey ’s has naturally used the color brown for its own branding .
Within the Hershey ’s family , several smaller brands each has its own identity and marketing approaches , but for the company as a whole , brown is the predominant color .
It should be no surprise then that the Hershey ’s website is very brown .
In my opinion , the Hershey ’s website is more effective at using the company ’s established brand and colors on its website than just about any other website featured here .
The white background in the content area keeps the website user - friendly , but there ’s no mistaking the Hershey ’s brand , and the website makes you want to eat one of its products .
Brown is used for the background of the website ( with a white background for the content area ) , as well as the header and primary navigation , the links lower on the page , the items in the sidebar and the website footer .
The design does a good job of matching the color scheme to the colors of products in photos that appear on the website , such as the one shown in the screenshot below .
Bank of America
Bank of America makes use of the US national colors of red , white and blue as the company ’s typical color scheme .
It ’s not unusual that a company attempts to brand itself with national colors , the intent being to benefit from customers ’ loyalty to those colors .
The Bank of America website clearly builds on this established brand by using only these colors on the website .
The background is white , with a red navigation menu and blue used for links and the log - in box at the left of the screen .
T- Mobile
T- Mobile typically uses a bright pink in its marketing and branding .
Often , this color is not the most heavily used color because it can be overpowering and too much to look at if overused , but it will always appear somewhere in the company ’s branding .
The website makes effective use of this color in the navigation menu , the logo , as well as headlines and links throughout the website .
The white background keeps the color scheme from being too over - the - top and makes the website easy to look at , but still maintains the familiar T - Mobile look .
Aside from pink and white , other colors on the website are gray and a soft blue .
Pictures of the products used throughout help to give the website a more engaging appearance .
The other colors that are used help to soften the look of a design that features as bright a color as pink , but the identity and branding impact of the pink is still obvious .

CVS Pharmacy traditionally uses red and white at its retail stores and throughout its branding .
The familiar red color is used heavily in the CVS website in the background ( although the content area has a white background ) and in the header .
There are a few different shades of red used throughout the design , and various shades of blue and gray are also used .
Product photos have some additional colors , but throughout the website there is no way to miss the common red and white of the CVS corporate identity .
In this case , the red in the header and background has more of an impact than the blues used in the main content area .
If those colors were reversed , the website would have a much different feel and would lack similarity with the corporate identity .
Merrill Lynch
Financial services provider Merrill Lynch has traditionally used a lot of blue in its branding .
The Merrill Lynch website uses a few different shades of blue , along with a white background .
The color blue is used for links throughout the website and headings in some places .
Aside from the blue , there are a few red highlights , but mostly just black and gray .
The Merrill Lynch bull logo is shown in white on the blue header .
Target
Target ’s retail stores and all of its marketing use red and white as the company colors .
Inside the stores , you ’ll see Target employees in red shirts as well .
When shopping online at Target ’s website , you ’ll also see the standard color scheme .
The website uses a white background and a good bit of gray , but there is still plenty of red to give the Target feel .
On the white background , the red in the Target logo really stands out .
The logo is a big part of the company ’s identity , so allowing it to stand out by using a white background is effective .
The color red is used for maximum impact in the design .
The red bar advertising the clearance sale , the words “ Spend $ 50 , get free shipping ” and the text “ Free shipping ” in a few places all stand out because of the red .
If red were used more heavily instead of white and gray , this effect would not be possible .
Circuit City
Circuit City also uses red and white in its branding and marketing .
As with Target ’s website , white and gray are used throughout , but the red still has a dominant presence .
Circuit City actually uses more red than Target .
The primary navigation menu , the featured product area and a few other design elements are all red .
Home Depot
Home Depot ’s marketing materials and its retail stores rely heavily on the use of its familiar orange .
Surprisingly , the company website does little to build on that existing brand .
Orange is used in the logo , although the logo is very small , and is only used for a few other elements throughout the website , such as buttons .
A larger logo would help for corporate identity purposes , and an orange header or main navigation menu ( instead of the dark gray ) could also help .
Although the orange is used sparingly , it does n’t make as much of an impact as the red in Target ’s design because the Home Depot website uses a greater number of colors .
The green and yellow , as well as the colors in the product photos , reduce the impact of the orange .
AIG
International insurance company AIG uses blue in its branding and marketing .
Appropriately , the company ’s website is mainly blue and white .
The blue and white logo sits on a blue background just above a tabbed navigation menu that is also blue .
By using different shades of blue , AIG has created a design that does n’t need several other colors , which would n’t help build on the corporate identity anyway .
Staples
Office supplies retailer Staples consistently uses red in its stores and throughout its marketing materials .
Surprisingly , the company ’s website makes much less use of red than you would expect .
Blue is actually used more prominently than red , which does n’t seem to be the case with any other type of branding that the company does .
As a result , the website does n’t fit so well with the corporate identity and seems to be a bit out of place .
The website could have a much more familiar Staples feel if it had a red header or a red background , instead of the gray that sits outside of the content area .
Additionally , red could be used for the headers “ Office Supplies , ” “ Technology ” and “ Furniture , ” instead of blue .
Another option would be to use fewer colors and more white and gray , which would give the red more impact .
As it is , the website uses a lot of different colors , but makes little impact with any of them .
UPS
UPS probably uses color in its branding as much as any other company .
UPS ’s familiar brown color appears on everything from its trucks to employee uniforms , and is even referred to by name in its marketing efforts .
However , brown is not used as heavily on the UPS website as you might expect .
Brown is used in the header and in some headlines throughout the website , but it seems to break the mold that UPS has been building so strongly in its branding with the color brown .
One option would be to use different shades of brown , rather than some of the other colors that are used , such as green and blue .
The website would have a much different feel if the green area of the header , where it says “ UPS United States , ” were also brown and if the primary navigation were a slightly different shade of brown .
Another option would be to center align the website and use a brown background outside of the content area ( currently , the website is left aligned with an all - white background ) .
NBC
NBC ’s multi-colored peacock logo is very well known and has been around for a long time .
Although the logo is used several times throughout the NBC website , the colors are n’t really used repeatedly .
More color could be used in the navigation menu , instead of white on gray .
Another option would be to use some color in the headlines instead of the gray that is used in many places .
MSNBC makes better use of the familiar colors in its header .
How Does this Affect You as a Designer ?
All of the examples we looked at throughout this article were websites of major companies that , in most cases , have an international presence .
The average Web designer works mostly on websites for small - to medium - sized businesses and will likely never work for companies of this size and magnitude .
However , there are still some lessons that can be applied to websites of smaller companies that do n’t have an established brand recognized around the world :
1. Consistency .
As we ’ve seen , consistency throughout all marketing media is powerful .
Any business attempting to build a strong branded image should include its website in its overall marketing plan , and the design should reflect the image being built .
This includes logos , color schemes , taglines and anything else used to develop the business ’s identity .
Whether the business is big or small , consistency is needed .
2 . The subconscious of customers .
Most of the time , customers do not consciously associate specific colors with a company .
But over the course of time , with a company ’s successful branding efforts , those customers will match the colors and company whether they realize it or not .
This means that what customers subconsciously associate with a company can affect their experience on the website .
Even with smaller businesses , customers and website visitors may have some prior experience with the business that can affect how they perceive the business .
3 . The impact of re-branding and redesign .
During a website redesign , even for a small business , choices of color and its impact on overall branding should be considered .
As we ’ve seen with the example websites , once a brand has been established , customers and visitors will have certain expectations of the website .
Even small businesses that have been working to build their brand could take a step backwards if significant branding changes are made during the redesign process .
Of course , there may be times and reasons to go ahead with a re-branding attempt , but the impact should be considered and the pros and cons weighed .
4 . Make color choices wisely from the start .
Because it can be difficult to make significant changes to color schemes once considerable branding efforts have been made , it is not a decision that should be rushed in the first place .
When a company is being established or a new website is being planned and developed , colors should be given plenty of thought and consideration .
A solid choice from the start will make everything easier down the road .
Pretty sure that the average American is way ahead of the President and his administration , Congress , the media , Wall Street , and academia ( particularly that amateur sport called economics ) on where the economy is headed .
This confidence report is particularly telling :
U.S. consumer confidence plunged to another record low in February ...
The Conference Board , an industry group , said on Tuesday that its sentiment index fell to 25.0 from a downwardly revised 37.4 in January .
The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was for a reading of 35.5 .
[ JR Note : that 's not a miss , that is absolute incompetence ]
This is why it is n't useful to put to much faith in " great leaders , " the disillusionment can catalyze failure :
In February , the expectations index plunged to 27.5 from 42.5 the previous month .

Music in the workplace may make the day pass quicker but it's a benefit that can come with a hefty price tag , as some small business owners are starting to find out .
Lyn Ball was preparing for her next customer at Mane Connections , the hair salon she runs in a market town in the South West of England , when a man , looking not unlike a sales rep , popped into her shop .
But far from trying to sell her anything the visitor introduced himself as being from the Performing Right Society ( PRS ) and promptly issued her with a demand for a £ 200 music licence .
What had Ms Ball done to warrant this notice ?
Turn on her radio .
BENEFITS OF MUSIC AT WORK Improves productivity in jobs that are repetitive , mundane or undemanding Improves performance in physically - demanding jobs Raises employee morale Improves employees ' physical health Improve employee co-operation Source : PRS Len Attwood , a car mechanic , had a similar visit recently , despite having no radio of his own at his Essex workshop .
But he and his two staff had been used to tuning into music stations using radios in customers ' cars .
It was a way of " cheering up the workplace " says Mr Attwood , from his premises in Witham .
But in the eyes of the PRS a workplace that ticks along to the backdrop of musical accompaniment is better than one that is suffused with silence - and that 's worth paying for .
More than half a million businesses across the UK are estimated to be playing music illegally , it is estimated .
Some , Ms Ball says , are simply unaware they have to pay for something that is almost incidental .
" I think it 's a con , " she says .
" The radio is hardly audible - it 's there to provide a bit of background noise .
It 's there for staff .
How does it differ from someone listening to your car radio if you give them a lift ? "
Radio in bedroom
" And why should a small business - which already has to pay for lots of red tape - have to pay royalties on something the radio station has already paid for ?
' We work in silence now ' - garage owner Len Attwood
There 's nothing new about the need to pay royalties in this way .
The PRS has been licensing music for use since it was formed in 1914 .
But some believe it has recently stepped up its efforts to recoup cash , and in some cases is taking matters too far .
Steve Scaife , who runs a nine - room guest house in Plymouth , says he has been pursued despite the fact that the only radio on the premises is in his bedroom .
" Because the people who ran the business before us had a PRS licence we 've been constantly pursued to buy one .
It 's been going on for years now - letters and visits threatening court action . "
Mr Scaife 's woes have been taken up by local MP Alison Seabeck , who raised the matter in Parliament at the end of last year .
" Everyone accepts that people who produce music should benefit from their efforts , " Ms Seabeck tells the BBC .
" But the evidence is that the PRS have had a blitz of businesses who previously had n't been approached to pay .
People feel intimidated and there seem to be anomalies in the way licensing operates .
I 'd like to see that addressed . "
But despite the fact that the Federation of Small Businesses also believes there has been a crackdown , the Performing Rights Society itself says it is largely business as usual .
£ 44 upwards
Any rise in demands is simply down to the fact it 's easier to gather data on companies , it says .
The James Bond theme writer says if it was n't for the support he got from the PRS early in his career , he 'd still be sweeping floors in Luton Airport
Keith Gilbert
But is this not just heavy handed enforcement to boost the balances of wealthy pop stars ?
Keith Gilbert , of the PRS , says not .
" A surprising number of songwriters work on the making of today 's successful pop songs and 90 % of our 60,000 members earn less than £ 5,000 a year from royalties , " says Mr Gilbert .
" [ James Bond music writer ]
David Arnold says if it was n't for the support he got from the PRS early in his career , he 'd still be sweeping floors in Luton Airport .
The royalties we collect allow creative people to keep being creative . "
The PRS use data collected by a specialist monitoring service to decide how to divide up the money collected from its business licences - which vary from £ 44 to many thousands for large retail chains - is distributed .
Yet the body recognises it faces a problem with public recognition of its name and work .
In an effort to be more up front , it is about to rebrand as PRS for Music and launch an awareness programme .
' Like a morgue '
In Parliament , David Lammy , the minister for intellectual property , said he thought the PRS could improve its complaints procedure .
He has since spoken to the organisation on a new code of practice it is introducing .
Mr Gilbert denies that people are intimidated .
He says all calls made by staff , based at PRS headquarters in London or from a call centre the organisation uses , are monitored and operatives are rewarded for being accurate and straightforward in their dealings with the public , rather than for the amount of money they collect .
" I 'd urge anyone who has a problem or question about the licence system , to contact our customer service department and I want to emphasise that we have n't got the power to fine people or send bailiffs around .
When there is a dispute , we try to settle it reasonably and amicably . "
Ultimately though , every business which plays music to enhance the environment for staff or customers needs to pay .
" A factory owner who refused to pay for a £ 96 licence called me to complain that his workshop was ' like a morgue ' now , " Mr Gilbert says .
" And that is our point .
Music makes a big difference to the workplace .
Its creators should get their just rewards . "

Nedved retirement was one of the most discussed topics even from the beginning of the season .
Nedved arrived at Juventus in 2001 as a replacement for Zidane who left “ The Old Lady ” for Real Madrid .
Since his arrival Nedved featured regularly in the Juventus first team .
The 36 year - old player proved his loyalty for the club when he decided to stay with Juventus and play in Serie B after Calciopoli scandal .
The Czech midfielder has finally decided that he will retire at the end of the season .
The most decisive factors in taking the decision were :
1 . The advancing age .
2. Contract negotiations with Juventus failed .
3. Juventus already searching for a replacement .
4 . Does n’t want to play for other team .
5 . Want to retire in glory .
Playing on the wing at the highest level every week is not an easy task for a 36 year old man .
Nedved looked tired often this season and this could be one reason for making him consider quiting .
Contract negotiations have failed , Nedved refused to accept Juventus proposal “ pay as you play deal ” .
Also the veteran midfielder could be disappointed by the fact that Juventus was searching for a replacement even from the beginning of the season .
A retirement at the perfect time is what every player wishes .
Zidane is one of the players who retired early even if he could play few more years .
Now everybody regrets him and definitely Nedved would like to happen as well in his case .
Playing for another team at the end of career is not a good choice and lot of great players made this wrong step at the end of their career .
Whatever his finnal decision will be Nedved will remain a football legend , a world - class player .

The rumours that a PS3 price cut is to be announced this coming Easter holiday intensified this week , as Sony approaches the end of the current financial year on 31 March .
It looks very likely that a price cut will be announced in April , the first month of the new financial year .
Clearly Sony is not going to confirm or comment on rumours before that date , in order to not destroy demand prior to Easter .
" Recent channel checks indicate increased speculation for a PS3 price cut announcement from Sony in the next couple of days , " Janco Partners ' Mike Hickey told Edge this week .
" We think the company needs to reduce the current price by $ 100 to effectively restart unit velocity at retail .
We believe the market is expecting a PS3 price cut in April or by June E3 at the latest , " the analyst added .
" If Sony does not cut the price of their console , we expect the continuation of languishing PS3 hardware sales and the potential for publishers to accelerate their reallocation of resources away from the PS3 console . "
Unfortunately , Hickey then immediately undermined his own credibility by adding : " We are also hearing continued speculation that Sony is working on a non-Blu-ray PS3 console , which could enable them to make the aforementioned hardware price reduction . "
Riiiight …
Back in the real world
Sony will announce a PS3 price cut following the end of its financial year on 31 March .
We will have to put up with another month and a bit of rumours until we know for sure how much that price drop will be .
" We suggested late last year that a price cut would take place after the end of Sony 's fiscal year , " Screen Digest 's Senior Analyst Piers Harding - Rolls told TechRadar .
It certainly wo n't be ' within days ' then .
" The company has had its hands tied concerning a price reduction this fiscal year , but we expect things to loosen up after the end of March , " adds the Screen Digest analyst .
" I would be somewhat surprised if the company announced a straight price cut this far in advance of any move as people will just hold out for the drop .
" The strength of the Yen makes any price drop in Europe a more costly exercise , so this factor is likely to have an impact on the extent of any pricing movement .
Any price cut will need to be sizeable enough to make an impact , yet take into account that a lot of Euro and Sterling value has been lost already due to the rising value of the Yen . "

In April of 2008 , President Bush signed into law S.1858 which allows the federal government to screen the DNA of all newborn babies in the U.S.
This was to be implemented within 6 months meaning that this collection is now being carried out .
Congressman Ron Paul states that this bill is the first step towards the establishment of a national DNA database .
S.1858 , known as The Newborn Screening Saves Lives
Act of 2007 , is justified as a “ national contingency plan ” in that it represents preparation for any sort of public health emergency .
The bill states that the federal government should “ continue to carry out , coordinate , and expand research in newborn screening ” and “ maintain a central clearinghouse of current information on newborn screening … ensuring that the clearinghouse is available on the Internet and is updated at least quarterly ” .
Sections of the bill also make it clear that DNA may be used in genetic experiments and tests .
Read the full bill : http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xp…
Twila Brase , president of the Citizens ’ Council on Health Care warns that this new law represents the beginning of nationwide genetic testing .
Brase states that S.1858 and H.R. 3825 , the House version of the bill , will :
• Establish a national list of genetic conditions for which newborns and children are to be tested .
• Establish protocols for the linking and sharing of genetic test results nationwide .
• Build surveillance systems for tracking the health status and health outcomes of individuals diagnosed at birth with a genetic defect or trait .
• Use the newborn screening program as an opportunity for government agencies to identify , list , and study “ secondary conditions ” of individuals and their families .
• Subject citizens to genetic research without their knowledge or consent .
Read her entire analysis of the implications of this bill here : http://www.cchconline.org/pdf/S_1858_NB…
Brase states that under this bill , “ The DNA taken at birth from every citizen is essentially owned by the government , and every citizen becomes a potential subject of government - sponsored genetic research . ”
All 50 states are now routinely providing results of genetic screenings to the Department of Homeland Security and this bill will establish the legality of that practice plus include DNA .
Ron Paul has also vigorously argued against this bill making the following comments before the US House of Representatives :
“ I cannot support legislation … that exceeds the Constitutional limitations on federal power or in any way threatens the liberty of the American people .
I must oppose it . ”
“ S. 1858 gives the federal bureaucracy the authority to develop a model newborn screening program .
Madame Speaker , the federal government lacks both the constitutional authority and the competence to develop a newborn screening program adequate for a nation as large and diverse as the United States . … ”
“ Those of us in the medical profession should be particularly concerned about policies allowing government officials and state - favored interests to access our medical records without our consent …
My review of S. 1858 indicates the drafters of the legislation made no effort to ensure these newborn screening programs do not violate the privacy rights of parents and children , in fact , by directing federal bureaucrats to create a contingency plan for newborn screening in the event of a ‘ public health ’ disaster , this bill may lead to further erosions of medical privacy .
As recent history so eloquently illustrates , politicians are more than willing to take , and people are more than willing to cede , liberty during times of ’ emergency . ”

? Ecuador ’s government said Wednesday it will expel a U.S. Embassy official who allegedly disputed the transfer of a senior police investigator amid a growing diplomatic spat over Washington ’s aid to the South American nation .
It is the second expulsion order against a U.S. Embassy official this month by President Rafael Correa , who has accused American officials of “ insolence ” for conditioning aid on the right to veto personnel choices .
Mark Sullivan , the Embassy ’s first secretary in the embassy ’s office of regional affairs , must leave the country within 48 hours because of his “ unacceptable meddling , ” Foreign Minister Fander Falconi said .
Falconi said Sullivan , in a meeting with police in early February , questioned a decision by Ecuadorean Police Chief Jaime Hurtado to transfer the head of the Special Investigations Unit to another police post .

In a remarkable experiment , researchers found that a man who was rendered completely blind by several strokes could deftly navigate an obstacle course unaided , easily avoiding boxes and sidling around pieces of office equipment .
The patient , known only as TN , was left blind after damage to the visual ( striate ) cortex in both hemispheres of the brain following consecutive strokes .
His eyes are normal but his brain cannot process the information they send in , rendering him totally blind [ BBC News ] .
Researchers say TN 's successful performance was an example of the phenomenon " blindsight , " and say it suggests that some small amount of information is being transmitted from his undamaged eyes to a more primitive part of his brain , which operates beneath the level of consciousness .
TN usually walks with a cane , but researcher Beatrice de Gelder convinced him to put it aside and to try to navigate the obstacle course without its help .
He was able to do so flawlessly , despite being unable to consciously see any of the obstacles .
Head down and hands loose by his side , he twisted his body to slalom slowly but surely between a camera tripod and a swingbin , and neatly stepped around a random series of smaller items .
" At first he was nervous , " says de Gelder .
" He said he would n't be able to do it because he was blind . "
The scientists broke into spontaneous cheers when he succeeded [ Nature News ] .
The experiment , published in Current Biology [ subscription required ] , is the most advanced example of blindsight yet recorded .
Brain scans had previously revealed that TN could recognise facial expressions , since the amygdala region showed increased activity when he was faced with fearful , angry or joyous faces .
This suggested his mind could process some visual information , albeit subconsciously [ New Scientist ] .
Researchers have also tested patients who have lesions on one side of their visual cortex , leaving them blind in one direction of sight .
But when objects were placed in those patients ' blind spots , they were able to tell researchers whether they were oriented horizontally or vertically .
Some experts are skeptical of the latest findings from TN 's stroll down the corridor , and say that his hearing should have been blocked to rule out the possibility that he was getting an auditory assist :
Some blind people can use their hearing to assist in navigation , sensing the reflection of sound waves to help them locate obstacles .
" We do n't think this is likely to be the answer [ in TN ] because echolocation is not so efficient for small objects , and he could avoid them with precision , " says de Gelder [ Nature News ] .
The latest findings will have limited applications in medicine and therapy , as most cases of blindness are not caused by brain damage .
But de Gelder says the study illuminates the sophistication of our vision system : " It shows us the importance of these evolutionary ancient visual paths .
They contribute more than we think they do for us to function in the real world . "

Quinn ’s actions follow a legal opinion issued last night by Atty .
Gen. Lisa Madigan who said she believed the state could enact a special - election law that would effectively force Burris from office .
Under the Constitution , a governor ’s appointments to fill Senate vacancies should be considered temporary until an election is held , she said .
Quinn , appearing on “ The Steve Cochran Show ” on WGN - AM ( 720 ) , said he spoke to the top two Democrats in the General Assembly today about the possibility of moving ahead with the legislation , which would take advantage of a clause contained in the U.S. Constitution ’s 17th Amendment .
Gov. Pat Quinn said today that if embattled U.S. Sen .
Roland Burris does n’t step down within the next two weeks , he wants lawmakers to send him a bill to set up a special election that could effectively remove Burris from office .
But under current state law , appointments to Senate vacancies last until the next federal election , which is scheduled for next year .
Burris was appointed by former - Gov. Rod Blagojevich to fill the vacancy left by President Barack Obama .
The appointment came three weeks after Blagojevich ’s Dec. 9 arrest on federal criminal charges of allegedly trying to sell the Senate seat for personal or political gain .
Last week , Quinn called for Burris to resign , joining other leading Democrats who say he can no longer effectively represent the state after he revealed more extensive contacts with Blagojevich allies than he had originally testified to before the Illinois House panel weighing Blagojevich ’s impeachment .
Quinn had proposed legislation that would allow him to name a temporary caretaker to the Senate vacancy , subject to a Burris resignation , followed by a quick special election .
But Burris has made clear he does not intend to resign .
“ I think the optimal course is if the senator , upon reflection , talking to his family and friends , especially the people of Illinois , comes to realize that being U.S. senator at this time is not an avenue of service for Roland Burris , ” Quinn said .
“ If he voluntarily resigns , it really accelerates everything and makes it much better , ” the governor said .
“ Now , after a short reasonable period of time , if he does n’t do that , then I think we should pursue ahead with a ( special - election ) statute .
I ’ve urged the two legislative leaders today in Springfield , when I was there .
to go ahead and do that .
Let ’s get it on the books . ”
Asked what a reasonable time was for Burris to contemplate before steeping down , Quinn responded , “ I think two weeks is enough . ”
Republican lawmakers in Springfield seized upon Madigan ’s opinion and said a special election should be held with a primary on April 7 and urged the Democratic - controlled General Assembly to move quickly with legislation to authorize the vote .
But Illinois Senate President John Cullerton ( D - Chicago ) said he was awaiting some guidance by the Illinois House , where Speaker Michael Madigan has said his caucus is divided on the issue .
Madigan is the father of the attorney general and a veteran Southwest Side lawmaker who also heads the Illinois Democratic Party .
Cullerton has supported holding a special election since Blagojevich was arrested , but said he remained concern about cost estimates of $ 40 million to $ 50 million to hold a special election .
The House speaker also has cited cost concerns as a major impediment .
But Sen. Matt Murphy ( R - Palatine ) , who is sponsoring special - election legislation , said the balloting could cost half that amount or less and said the state could subsidize the costs to local election authorities by tapping $ 15 million set aside in the current budget for pork - barrel projects .
Quinn also said he did n’t believe the $ 50 million price tag being touted by some election officials and opposing lawmakers and said he believed a special election was needed “ after all of the controversy and scandal that we ’ve had in our state ” as a way to “ clear the air . ”
“ Upon review , I do n’t think the cost of the election would be as great as some people are saying , ” Quinn said .
“ I do think we should have a special election to replace Barack Obama ... and I think that is the best way to help the most people in Illinois and our country get over something that has really harmed us . ”
Earlier today , Quinn said he asked his chief of staff and top lawyer to look into revelations that Burris ’ son was hired by a state agency five months ago .
The Illinois Housing Development Authority said in a statement today that the agency hired Roland Burris II last September after he submitted a resume in response to a job posting on CareerBuilder.com ( the jobs web site is partly owned by Tribune Co ) .
The younger Burris was then twice interviewed by agency officials and then offered a $ 75,000 - a- year job as senior counsel , according to the statement .
Burris II is one of four senior counsels and his primary focus is closing " multifamily transactions , " the agency said .
" Mr. Burris is a graduate of Howard University and the Northwestern University School of Law .
He has a wealth of experience in law and finance and comes to the Authority with over twenty years of real estate and municipal bond experience , " agency spokeswoman Man Yee Lee said in a statement .
Burris II got the job despite a $ 34,163 tax lien the IRS filed last summer against their South Side home .
Quinn said he did n’t want to prejudge the matter of the younger Burris but said it “ deserves some serious review ” and it was likely a recommendation would be offered to the housing agency 's executive director .
In Chicago , a group of African - American aldermen came to Burris ’ defense , warning politicians seeking his ouster that they could lose support from the black community .
“ I would just suggest to those people who seek to run in the wards of the City of Chicago where there are people of color living that they should tone it down , because some of us are taking notes , ” said Ald. Freddrenna Lyle ( 6th ) , city chairman of the Cook County Democratic Organization .
“ Those people will run at their peril . ”
Ald. Carrie Austin ( 34th ) , chairman of the City Council Black Caucus , said all caucus members back Burris and the call for others to back off .
“ We want this cutting and bleeding to stop , ” Austin said .
“ He is in our federal government legally .
He has been sworn in as our United States senator . ”
She said the accusations against Burris are “ lies , innuendos and speculations to just muck up ( Burris ’ ) 30 - plus year record .
We say it ’s time for this to stop , and if it does not , we shall remember this at the next election . ”
For his part , Burris offered no comments in Washington today although his office noted in a news release that as “ the nation ’s only African American senator ” the junior senator from Illinois “ applauded the swift passage ” of a resolution to authorize a plaque to commemorate the role of slave laborers in constructing the U.S. Capitol building .
Burris was a co-sponsor of the resolution .
President - elect Barack Obama asked President Bush to request the $ 350 billion remaining in the financial rescue package , the White House said Monday , shortly after Mr. Bush finished a news conference .
The White House press secretary , Dana M. Perino , issued this statement :
This morning , President - elect Obama asked President Bush to formally notify Congress , on his behalf , of his intent to exercise the authority under the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act to access the last tranche of $ 350 billion in funding for Treasury programs addressing the financial crisis .
President Bush agreed to the president - elect ’s request .
We will continue our consultations with the president - elect ’s transition team , and with Congress , on how best to proceed in accordance with the requirements of the statute .
Mr. Bush ’s last news conference opened with cordial words for the reporters who have covered his eight years in office .
Acknowledging that relations have been strained at times – that some had “ misunderestimated me ” – he called their work generally professional and thanked them for their work .
There was a bit of the usual teasing , as he pronounced Suzanne Malveaux ’s given name in the French manner she prefers , noted that he used to say it like a Texan , and then referred to himself as George , pronouncing it like the first name of Monsieur Pompidou .
The reporters got down to business for the 45 - minute session , asking Mr. Bush whether he would make any move in his last week in office to request the second half of the $ 700 billion bailout from Congress .
He demurred , suggesting that it is most likely that the new Congress will deal with the new president on that matter .
“ I do n’t intend to make the request unless he specifically asks me to make it , ” he said , speaking of Mr. Obama .
If that seemed to tiptoe up to the edge of a premature handoff of power , it also showed that the outgoing and incoming chief executives are on roughly the same wave length on how to do business with each other .
“ There will be a moment when the responsibilities of the president land squarely on his shoulders , ” Mr. Bush added .
But he later said the burdens of the Oval Office were sometimes exaggerated .
He refused to discuss any pardons , including pre-emptive pardons for anyone involved in interrogations of captives in the campaign against terrorism .
He became passionate in defense of some of his policies , saying the presidency could not be a popularity contest , and that he would not have endorsed the Kyoto global warming treaty just for popularity , or blamed all the problems of the Middle East on Israel just to gain popularity among her critics and enemies .
Warming to the theme , he said he had nothing to apologize for in the tough actions he took after the terrorism attacks of 2001 .
“ Do you remember what it was like around here after Sept. 11 ? ” he demanded .
“ I do . ”
Mr. Bush had a few words of advice for the Republicans , who he said could mount a comeback .
“ Our party , ” he said , “ has got to be compassionate and broad - minded . ”
Asked if it troubled him that some people in the country were angry at how he handled the war and other matters , he said most of the people he met were civil even when they disagreed with him .
He said that any president experienced some harsh criticism and that Mr. Obama would too .
“ They are not angry , they are not hostile people , ” he said .
“ I view those who get angry and yell and say bad things and all that kind of stuff as just a few people in the country . ”
He said when he returns to Texas he will be able to look in the mirror every morning without regret .
“ When I get out of here , I am getting off the stage , ” he said .
“ I have had my time in the Klieg lights . ”
" We should not be panicked into financial profligacy and the burdening of future generations of Australians with huge amounts of debt . "
Mr Howard said it took 10 years for Australia to repay $ 96 billion in federal debt left when his government came to office .
" We can only contemplate the length of time needed to liquidate the $ 200 billion of debt at the very least our nation now faces as a consequence of recent policy decisions , " he said .
" Malcolm Turnbull and his colleagues were absolutely right to oppose the government 's stimulus package .
" It needlessly plunges Australia deeply into debt with a poorly - targeted spending spree . "
Spending measures should be reduced but be targeted to removing obstacles for employers to hire new staff as the crisis progresses , Mr Howard said .
Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull , who spoke after Mr Howard , said generations of Australians would carry the burden of Mr Rudd 's package , which he said he would fear would place Australia far further into debt than the projected $ 200 billion .
" We have great challenges ahead of us but we have at the head of the country a prime minister that is firing off all his ammunition in the first moments of the battle , " he said .
" If and when economic circumstances get harder and tougher , how much will he spend ... $ 200 million could become $ 300 million or more .
" It may not just be our children that are paying off this debt , but our children 's children . "
Mr Howard also used the speech , the first in a series of annual speeches named by the Menzies Research Institute in his honour , to urge Mr Rudd not to dismantle WorkChoices legislation .
" If , as appears certain , the Rudd government proceeds to dismantle not only our industrial relations changes but also take the country back in the area of industrial relations to conditions obtained 20 years ago , then that will be the first occasion in a generation that an Australian prime minister has turned his back on a significant economic reform , " he said .
" That will send a very bad signal to the rest of the world about this country 's appetite for continuing economic reform . "

Have you ever wanted to be in the middle of a buyer ’s market ?
If you managed to stash some liquid funds , then you ’re primed for this economy ’s meltdown .
A buyer ’s market , or soft market , exists when there are more sellers than buyers .
This excess of supply over demand results in lower prices , often so low that you ’ll end up with your jaw dragging the floor in disbelief over the savings , which can be ten cents on the dollar at times .
To help you search out these bargains , we ’ve compiled some instances where you can fill your vault with some worthy investments .
From artwork to wine , you ’ll discover luxuries that could be worth more as the economy recovers .

Some ticket prices might include tailgate parties or other incentives to boost ticket values .
Some baseball teams are freezing prices for 2009 , so fans can take advantage now of their favorite seats for the ballgame .
In cases like the Hannah Montana concerts , where most tickets have been scarce and prices as high as $ 3,479 were paid for a single front row seat at a gig in Uniondale , N.Y. , the Las Vegas venue for Hannah Montana has been reduced to $ 14 per ticket by overspeculation .

Rights groups argue that journalists face a culture of intimidation
The murder of Sri Lankan newspaper editor Lasantha Wickramatunga highlights the claim often made by human rights groups that the country is one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists to operate .
He is the latest in a long line of Sri Lankan journalists who have been murdered or silenced over the past two decades .
Many of the victims have not met their fate in the country 's war zone , because for much of the past 20 years independent journalists have been banned from reporting from the conflict areas .
Instead they have been targeted in Colombo - and nearly all of them had records of exposing official corruption or what they said was inept handling of the war against the Tamil Tiger rebels .
The war now appears to be reaching its final , crucial stage as the army continues to make in - roads into the rebels ' northern stronghold .
' Iconoclastic journalist '
" Mr Wickramatunga 's death is a serious blow for press freedom because he was one of the few reporters in the country who could write authoritatively about the government and Tamil Tigers ' conduct of a brutal war which has claimed thousands of lives over the years but has been consistently under - reported by much of the world 's media , " said Priyath Liyanage , editor of the BBC 's Sinhala service .
Recent coverage of the war has increased tension in the media Campaigning groups such as Reporters Without Borders say that the targeting of journalists has worsened in recent years .
Only on Tuesday , gunmen armed with grenades ransacked offices of the largest private TV broadcaster in the country .
" Sri Lanka has lost one of its more talented , courageous and iconoclastic journalists , " a Reporters Without Borders statement said .
" President Mahinda Rajapaksa , his associates and the government media are directly to blame because they incited hatred against him and allowed an outrageous level of impunity to develop as regards violence against the press .
Sri Lanka 's image is badly sullied by this murder , which is an absolute scandal and must not go unpunished . "
Amnesty International last year said that at least 10 media workers were killed over a two - year period .
It said that many more were abducted , detained or had disappeared .
Last month Human Rights
Watch called on the government to free prominent Tamil journalist , JS Tissainayagam .
His magazine accused the government of " shamefully using anti-terror laws to silence peaceful critics " .
Criminal libel
One of those reporters who steadfastly refused to be silenced was Lasantha Wickramatunga .
A flamboyant and colourful character , he was not afraid to expose the perceived wrongdoings of the country 's most influential politicians .
The Rajapaksas are swollen ... with the pride of bloodthirsty euphoria [ following the fall of Kilinochchi ] and are unable to think beyond the destruction of the Tamil Tigers and its leadership
Lasantha Wickramatunga
I interviewed him in Colombo in 2000 , when his paper was closed down because it mockingly avoided censorship regulations by reporting the opposite of what had really happened .
At that time the army was in retreat and the northern Jaffna peninsula was close to falling to the Tigers .
The paper avoided the censor by reporting that Jaffna was safe in the government 's hands and that the army was on the offensive .
On another occasion Mr Wickramatunga obtained the credit card details of a government minister to show that his bills were being illegally paid for by a foreign company eager to invest in the country .
While some of the material Mr Wickramatunga produced arguably veered towards the prurient , his " publish and be damned " attitude to journalism meant that at times he was able to expose high - profile cases of government corruption which meant that he received numerous death threats and several periods of detention .
' Flamboyant '
" I believe it is my duty not to accept anything the government tells us at face value , " he told me , " and it is especially our duty not to allow the press in Sri Lanka to be brow - beaten or censored .
We need to tell the outside world about the horrific nature of the war in which we are currently involved . "
His work exposing government dealings in arms procurement deals - especially a recent agreement to buy MiG fighters from Russia - earned him a reputation as one of the country 's most fearless reporters .
Many Sri Lankan journalists say they are being gagged by the govenrment
At the same time it also earned him a reputation as being one of the strongest critics and bitterest enemies of the governing People 's Alliance party .
Few reporters would dare write what he did in his most recent editorial - in which he referred to the president 's " bloodthirsty euphoria " following the fall of the Tamil Tiger - held town of Kilinochchi last week .
" Should we fail meaningfully to address the aspirations of the Tamil people that survive this holocaust , we can be sure as night follows day that history will repeat itself ... and all the bloodshed and all the sacrifice made to bring the war to a conclusion will have been in vain , " he said .
While there is little evidence to suggest Mr Wickramatunga was unduly partisan in his reporting , his position was perhaps undermined by his known support for the opposition United National Party , for whom he once stood as a parliamentary candidate .
BBC Sinhala editor , Priyath Liyanage , says Mr Wickramatunga " was one of Sri Lanka 's most flamboyant , brave and outspoken journalists " .
" His death is a further grievous blow to press freedom in a country where few openly dare to question the government 's handling of the war . "

<-- Part 2 : U.K Government Destroying Britain to Help Banks ?
Bankrupt Britain
Part 3 : Is the BBC Hiding Britain 's Bankruptcy ?
by Chris Tew , February 4 , 2009
A growing number of economists , journalists , businessmen and
investors are warning of Britain facing an Iceland style bankruptcy .
But barely a whisper of this potential catastrophe is heard from the BBC .
This avoidance of critical economic topics is rife among major news broadcasters
Despite a growing number of economists and journalists pointing out the potential for a U.K government bankruptcy it is rarely if ever mentioned in the main British TV news broadcasts .
With a growing and real concern for the U.K government becoming bankrupt it is a moral obligation of a news network to address the issue and inform its audience .
However , many U.K news organizations are failing to inform the public of either side of this argument .
Why is the topic of a U.K bankruptcy being avoided ?
The BBC Avoids Topic of U.K Bankruptcy
Since BBC
News is the largest broadcasting news gatherer in the world and a major U.K news source for the general public I will focus on the BBC , although other major news could be equally as guilty .
I searched the BBC website for an article which discusses the potential of U.K bankruptcy and I could n't find anything apart from :
An unavoidable mention of David Cameron discussing the prospect of U.K bankruptcy .
The BBC had no choice but to mention the bankruptcy since it was from a transcript of Prime Minister 's question time .
David Cameron 's bankruptcy stance has been quoted in a small number of articles without further insight into the problem .
a brief mention in a single article discussing current newspaper stories .
The article said :
" The Daily Mirror calls for an end to the doom - mongering .
The paper reminds its readers that Britain is not bankrupt , and it remains one of the world 's biggest economies . "
It seems that the BBC believes these limited quotes are the only information the British public deserve regarding a U.K government bankruptcy .
When the BBC announced the recession was official they broadcast the news report below which also did not discuss any prospect for a U.K bankruptcy nor did it touch on some of the damaging fundamentals of the U.K economy mentioned earlier in this article :
" Why is the BBC avoiding the topic of a U.K bankruptcy ? "
The BBC's ' recession ruse ' continues with mediocre stories such as Obama 's choice of puppy getting high profile website and TV coverage while U.K bankruptcy remains an untouched taboo .
Other rarely ( if ever ) touched subjects include :
Tell the BBC & Other News Broadcasters to Inform the Public !
Northern Rock was the first run on a British bank in 150 years , the U.K has record levels of public and private debt , banks have received extortionate bailouts while continuing to freeze credit markets , and the U.K government is facing rumors of bankruptcy .
With so many discussing the prospect of a U.K bankruptcy the British public deserves more explanation from the BBC than a single sentence , copied from another newspaper .
Critical analysis of government actions along with the viewpoints of people opposing the actions of the government should rightly be heard on the BBC .
This topic deserves prime - time news coverage on BBC1 and in - depth articles on the BBC website .
If you feel that you are unhappy with the BBC 's coverage ( or any news broadcasters coverage ) of the recession and the many points of view that are being unheard then please take just 2 minutes to let the BBC know .
Click here to make a complaint to the BBC or any other news broadcaster you are unsatisfied with .
If you are not in the U.K make a complaint to news broadcasters in your country .
For example , if you are in the U.S complain to Fox News .

Comment on this article
Portland , Ore. , is known for its independent spirit , green practices , handcrafted beer , cycling culture and idyllic setting , nestled between the Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast .
The city ’s distinct neighborhoods mean variety for visitors and allow Portland ’s many personalities to shine through .
Whether toting along the kids or enjoying an adults - only weekend , Portland is best enjoyed through some of its popular pastimes , specialties and unique neighborhoods .
Getting Around
Portland is an easy place to explore , with some of the smallest , most walkable city blocks in the country .
This means it ’s easy to navigate from one block to the next in the downtown core , and there ’s a lot to see .
If you ’re going farther , hop on Tri-Met ’s buses , Max light rail trains or the Portland Streetcar , which will take you across town and give you a view — sometimes for free ; downtown Portland ’s “ Fareless Square ” is an area in the Southwest core that allows riders to hop on and off the Max trains for free .
Tri-Met also has convenient places to stow bikes on its trains , buses and the streetcar , should you decide to take part in Portland ’s favorite alternative form of transportation , cycling !
Bike lanes are common fixtures on most downtown streets , and are being improved all the time .
Because so many people cycle in Portland ( more people commute to work via bicycle per capita than any other city in the United States ) , drivers are generally more considerate of cyclists , there is ample bike parking and there are spots to rent bikes when you want to see the city at a faster pace than a stroll .
[ Read more in our Biking Portland article . ]
Tri-Met offers a public transportation system that Portlanders are proud of : it ’s clean , efficient and less crowded than systems in bigger cities .
It ’s not so overwhelming that older children could n’t navigate it themselves , and there ’s ample seating and usually many children and parents aboard trains , especially those running out of the city toward Hillsboro and Gresham .
The Max also runs out to Portland International Airport ( PDX ) , offering a convenient and low - priced alternative to most airport transportation .
Portland Neighborhoods
From Portland ’s Northwest 23rd neighborhood with its upscale boutiques and coffee shops , to the Hawthorne District on the east side of the Willamette River , the neighborhoods of Portland can sometimes seem like totally different planets , let alone areas in one not - so - huge city .
This is part of what makes Portland so interesting for visitors .
Some neighborhoods are old , some are new and many are undergoing renovation , revitalization , and in some cases , gentrification .
Portland ’s Pearl District is a great example of this .
Long called the “ Brewery Blocks ” for its abandoned brewery warehouses , it now hosts condominiums , hip eateries and art galleries that Portland ’s young professionals relish .
The most recent new neighborhood in Portland is the South Waterfront .
Located on the southwest side of the Willamette , it now plays host to stylish high - rise condominiums and apartments , new restaurants and Portland ’s aerial tram , which transports doctors and other hospital staffers from near the shores of the river up into the West Hills and Oregon Health Sciences University in space - age vessels that traverse the city like gondolas .
Grab a gelato at Bella Espresso that ’s imported from Milan , or cozy up to any of the new restaurants that seem to open weekly in the brand - new area .
Farther west , Northwest 21st and 23rd Streets have made a name for themselves as shopping and strolling meccas , where people dine on the sidewalks in summertime beneath trees with twinkling white lights .
Be sure to check out Coffee Time , which has become not just a coffee shop , but a local gathering place .
Stroll down 23rd and duck into the boutiques , like Frumoasa and Blake on your way to the Marrakech restaurant , where authentic Moroccan food is served to diners who lounge on the floor .
As a rule , neighborhoods on the east side of the river are funkier and more independent , and flanked with more industrial land .
The Hawthorne District offers coffee shops , restaurants , bakeries , theaters and shopping with an independent edge .
A favorite is the Por Que No taqueria , which offers funky Mexican food selections and usually has a line out the door .
Streets like Southeast Main and Southeast Mississippi have seen great improvements and the rise of some fabulous independent restaurants in the last five years , such as Colosso , which serves re-imagined Spanish tapas and a mean cocktail .
Top Portland Attractions
Must - See Sites for Adults
A visit to one of Portland 's many local microbreweries is absolutely in order .
Take a brewery tour at Widmer Brothers , or belly up to the bar at the Bridgeport Brewery ’s in - town brewpub for some refreshment and some of the best beer you can find .
If you ’ve got your pooch in tow , check out the east side ’s Lucky Labrador Brewing Co. , where a casual atmosphere and great sudsy beer are offered on their dog- friendly patio .
[ Read more about Portland ’s Breweries . ]
On weekends , Portland comes alive with farmers ’ markets , from the Portland Farmer ’s Market on campus at Portland State University to the best - known Saturday Market , located underneath the Burnside Bridge in downtown .
Buy artisan goods and organic food while browsing through art and listening to music as you navigate the adventurous crowd through the mazes of unique booths .
The Portland Art Museum is the oldest museum on the West Coast .
Founded in 1892 , the museum features more than 42,000 objects for your viewing pleasure with everything from an outdoor sculpture garden to a vast collection of Native American Art .
Visit the Pittock Mansion , home to the founder and publisher of Portland ’s Oregonian newspaper .
Henry and Georgiana Pittock lived on this 46 - acre estate from 1914 to 1919 , and the property has come to symbolize the original development boom of Portland when it was a young city .
The castle - like mansion is furnished with period pieces , including antiques and fine art , and the grounds are a wonderful place for a picnic .
On a nice day , cruise the Willamette River on the Portland Spirit , which also offers lunch , brunch and dinner cruises .
And no trip to Portland is complete without a visit to the venerable Powell ’s Books , one of the largest independent new and used bookstores in the world .
It takes up an entire city block and regularly hosts guest authors and other events .
There ’s also a rare book room , so you can finally find that first edition Palahniuk novel that you ’ve been craving .
Must - See Sites for Families
Portland ’s a great spot for families because it ’s so good to its own resident families .
The city ’s classic spot for kids is the Oregon Zoo , perched in the West Hills and recently renovated and improved .
The zoo offers kids a chance to see and learn about both exotic and regional animals , like the Stellar sea lions that swim at Stellar Cove , a large exhibit that educates about creatures of the Pacific Northwest .
Admission : $ 9.75 for adults ages 12 to 64 ; $ 8.25 for seniors 65 and over ; $ 6.75 for children 3 to 11 ; free for kids under 3 .
Tel . 503-226-1561 , www.oregonzoo.org.
A spot for more hands - on education is the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry ( OMSI ) .
Here , kids can learn about scientific principles and discoveries in many active ways , view an IMAX movie or see the museum ’s submarine , which is docked outside the museum facility located on the east side of the Willamette River .
Admission : $ 11 for adults , $ 9 for kids 3 to 13 and seniors over 65 .
Tel . 800-955-6674 , www.omsi.edu.
Finally , the Portland Children ’s Museum offers more chances for kids to play with interactive exhibits as they learn .
The museum features science exhibits , including one about how Portland was built , and fun attractions like a climbing wall .
Tel .
503-223-6500 , www.portlandcm.org.
Portland Green Spaces
Throughout the city , there are parks with plenty of space for kids to run and play , such as the famous Tom McCall Waterfront Park which runs along the west side of the Willamette River in downtown Portland .
Depending on the time of the visit , there could be a festival or concert going on in the park , and many offer a chance for the whole family to enjoy some of Portland ’s atmosphere and personality .
Try heading up into the West Hills near the zoo to explore Portland ’s huge Forest Park or Washington Park , which plays host to the Rose Gardens , Japanese Gardens and breathtaking views of the city skyline from above .
[ Read more about Portland ’s green spaces in our Portland Parks article ] .
Outdoor Adventures
Mount Hood is about an hour out of town and a mecca for skiing , snowboarding , sledding , snowshoeing and even hiking in the summer .
Skiers have a choice between Mt. Hood Meadows and Timberline , and deals abound in local newspapers and ski shops .
Renting equipment from REI while in town can be a better deal than renting gear up at the mountain .
Hiking , mountain biking and rock climbing are favorite pastimes in the Portland area , and the wide - open Pacific Northwest provides lots of space and opportunity to try them .
Many
Web sites offer directions and reviews for trails , but you need n’t go far : Portland ’s huge Forest Park is right in the city and offers spots for mountain biking and hiking .
For rock climbing , most popular spots are a little further out of town and into the Columbia River Gorge , but there are rock climbing gyms throughout town to get practice or sign up for a lesson .
Portland Rock Climbs is a good resource for anyone wanting to get involved with the sport .
Where to Stay
Hotels in Portland range from classic to artsy and family - friendly to romantic and couple - focused .
Staying in a downtown hotel means that public transportation and activities are just steps from your door , and you can find great places to stay that cater to your every need .
Celebrating Oregon ’s nearby wine country inside the city , the Hotel Vintage Plaza serves regional wines and honors their family guests with a special package called “ Growing up Gourmet ” that welcomes families with a bottle of wine for the parents and grape juices made from the same grapes for kids , plus a three - course gourmet dinner at the adjoining Pazzo Ristorante where the chef will let the family watch as they prepare an Italian meal .
Complimentary valet parking is also included .
Rates start at $ 384 per night .
www.vintageplaza.com
Other top options include the Hotel Lucia , with its chic design aesthetic and room service provided by Thai restaurant Typhoon , or the Jupiter Hotel , which adjoins the Portland hot spot Doug Fir Lounge , and provides a party atmosphere well into the night on weekends .
[ For a green hotel stay , read our Eco- Friendly Portland Hotels article . ]
Where to Eat
Portland ’s food scene offers the work of great chefs , alongside lots of creative options for kids .
If it ’s just the adults on the town , head to Portland City Grill , on the 30th floor of the U.S. Bancorp Tower , which overlooks much of the city and offers a creative selection of entrées and a great happy hour in the bar with live piano music .
Another classic restaurant with a great city view is the Chart House , which is perched in the West Hills and serves sophisticated seafood and steaks .
When the kids are in tow and fine dining is n’t going to be the way to eat , check out fun restaurants like Peanut Butter & Ellie ’s Café , which makes toddler - friendly food and offers a play area where kids can scream and run around without fear of dirty looks .
Unfussy food like pizza is offered up in a special way in Portland , with local joints like Pizzicato , offering gourmet pies for the whole family .
Street food in Portland is also very popular , with ingenious recipes that can be eaten in the park or while walking around town .
Even local microbreweries allow kids into their restaurants , and the character - filled McMenamins chains , with artistically restored buildings and pub food that ’ll keep kids happy while mom and dad kick back with a pint of locally - brewed ale or one of the company ’s wines , grown and processed at its Troutdale , Oregon estate .
Top Coffee Shops
A staple in every Portland neighborhood is the coffee shops .
While Seattle to the north is known for its native - born Starbucks , true Portlanders have their favorite independent coffee shop and many offer a place for art to be displayed and independent professionals to work and converse on weekdays .
Here are the best ones to sample :
Portland ’s Stumptown Coffee Roasters are the original indy - coffee spots in the city .
They offer cozy spots in their cafés and knowledgeable employees who care about the coffee they bring to Portland .
A newer local coffee roasting company is Cellar Door Coffee Roasters , which recently opened its café on the east side , near Hawthorne Boulevard .
Finally , for the ultimate Portland coffee experience , swing through the Black Sheep Bakery ’s bike - thru window in the morning for a cup of coffee and a vegan muffin .
Whether it ’s a romantic getaway or a family vacation , there ’s something to keep everyone entertained , fed and continually exploring this city that ’s known for its independent spirit .
Join the laid - back vibe and stroll down green urban streets , or enjoy a frothy microbrew or cappuccino while people - watching in one of the city ’s vibrant neighborhoods .

Have you ever loved a narrative so much that it took over your life ?
That 's what happened to me with Dragonriders of Pern - especially when it became an online world .

When I was young , I set stories in my favorite fictional worlds , and wrote fanfic based on my favorite games , books and TV series .
At sixteen , a friend introduced me to multi-user shared hallucinations ( MUSHes ) , online text - based games with a narrative driven by roleplaying .
Here was the intersection of gaming and fanfiction : with only words as a background , the action was player - generated and often rooted in writing skill .
And you got to live out fantastical lives of your making .
Text - based games were some of the first to take root on early computers , owing to the relative simplicity of coding and sharing .
Textual adventures like Zork , Rogue , and Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy used fixed - width text display on simple backdrops to in order to render description and maps , while action advanced via keyboard input .
Advertisement
With internet connectivity , MUDs ( multi- user dungeon / domain ) were born , and more fantastical , interactive roleplaying came to the fore .
You could still quest , but you could also be joined in questing by other people sitting at similar terminals .
Online text - based games sprang up to cater to players of every inclination .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
MUSHes and their hack - slash MUD and MUCK cousins are still around , of course , and some are thriving .
But they 've seen an exodus of players to the massively multiplayer games like World of Warcraft and EvE Online , virtual environments like Second Life , and the now innumerable options for roleplaying on the internet .
In the time when we labored with dial - up and modems , though , a text screen was a great way to reach another world .
Even via
Telnet , the trusty network protocol tool , in the school library .

My own particular poison was PernMUSH , set up with the trappings of Anne McCaffrey 's popular Dragonriders series but with restrictions because McCaffrey disproved of meddling with her copyrights .
And yes , I 'd argue that Pern qualifies as science fiction , though it relies heavily on dragons — the inhabitants reached Pern in a spaceship , and that technology plays an important role throughout .
The Pernese developed telepathic dragons in a hierarchy of colors ; dragons bonded with their chosen riders to fight the scourge of Thread , an airborne ropy spore inclined to eat through things .
In the game , you could be anyone you wanted .
You had only to create a character : develop a description , think about their history and personality , and write their interaction as you would a story but in real time .
Advertisement
The most popular occupation was dragonrider — as might be expected — but you could also be a healer or a steward or a craftsperson .
To become a dragonrider involved a long administrative process of applications , peer review , and demonstrating roleplaying skill .
By the end of my time on MUSHes I was helping to write dragons — complicated bits of code and detailed personality description that would enable the rider to leap around in - game on a special object .
Some new player would be thrilled to receive a new dragon , as I had once been .
In many ways , being on MUSHes was like an intensive writing class , always observing other people 's styles and learning to respond quickly but descriptively .
Roleplaying took the form of " poses , " written description constantly advanced by the players , as well as special pre-arranged plots and events to get everyone involved .
Advertisement
It is hard to overstate the emotional intensity that could be generated between players and within the disparate communities .
These were people who passed months , even years together , roleplaying sagas but also talking OOC , or out of character , in private messages and on public channels .
It was no surprise that close friendships and allegiances formed , and no few IRL ( " in real life " ) weddings .
The sense of belonging to " your " area of the game was pervasive , a precursor to the guilds that would soon come built - in on graphical games .
Advertisement
When you are playing every day as the same character , it can become difficult to disentangle the character 's activities and actions from your own .
After all , you 're creating this fictional life , in real time , and it's a short leap to emotional investment .
Avatars can often be a reflection of the things we wish we could do or resemble , and it 's irresistible to find yourself in a place that highly values writing and gaming ability .
Some were obsessed with it , and many of us spent a majority of our free hours there — even in the age of dial - up , internet addictions seemed to be at hand .
These days , we 're more used to people passing their time online .
Advertisement
While it provided a wonderful creative outlet , PernMUSH was also lesson in politics .
It has never ceased to amaze me how fast people are to create drama in forums designed for entertainment , but the internet has reproduced that tendency in perfect infinite microcosms .
Whether it 's Democrats versus Republicans , XBOXes versus PS3s , or J.J. Abrams diehards versus
Trek purists , we all love to take sides and nitpick and gossip and sometimes mutiny .
Advertisement
In live - action communities , it 's no different , and in many ways more intense .
With some people elevated to levels of leadership over others , resentments and second - guessing are inevitable .
The games that I was on would all eventually suffer from scandals and player shortfalls and burnout and dropout .
The close relationships we formed could result in cliques and infighting .
We 're all very human , even in fantastical worlds generated by machines .
Advertisement
But today I 'm still left with overwhelmingly fond memories and gratitude for the game , which was there when I needed it , and taught me many things and introduced interesting people from around the world .
For a sixteen year - old with a 36 kbps modem and a family phone line , it provided an escape from everything ordinary .
Because of it I also learned the early web and text - based coding and made the requisite youthful Geocities websites .
It was another internet era , but sometimes I miss the narrow focus of it in our current crowded , noisy environs .
Lots of us have likely passed through our share of online communities .
Ever find yourself still thinking about one or two in particular , wishing that you could travel back for just a little while ?

This started with Don Ringe 's guest post " The Linguistic Diversity of Aboriginal Europe " .
He followed up with a more detailed account of " Horse and wheel in the early history of Indo - European " , and an answer to some questions under the title " More on IE wheels and horses " , and then this morning 's post " Inheritance versus lexical borrowing : a case with decisive sound - change evidence " .
Readers have added a large number of interesting and provocative comments and questions ( 110 on the original post alone ) .
As usual , responses are often too long to fit comfortably in the comment format , and our traditional practice has been to respond in follow - up posts where interest and time permit .
Continuing that tradition , I 've posted below Don 's response to a comment by Etienne on Don 's follow - up post on the history of the word for horse .
Though the background is complex , this fragment of the conversation is quite coherent on its own .
Here 's Etienne :
There is a core assumption in your posts : namely that the proto - Indo - European form in fact had the meaning " horse " .
But let us imagine that the original meaning was less definite , perhaps " large quadruped " or the like ( the meaning " donkey " of the Armenian reflex is worthy of notice in this context ) .
If we imagine a spread of Proto - Indo - European that took place before the domestication of the horse , it is more than plausible that the subsequent spread of domestic horses would lead to the inherited Indo - European word ( * whatever its phonological form had in the meantime become in various Indo - European - speaking communities * ) everywhere undergoing a process of semantic narrowing and becoming the word for " horse " .
Here 's a partial analogy : all Germanic languages today have a cognate of English " God " to refer to the Christian god .
The original meaning of the proto-Germanic word was a non-Christian god , obviously : but if we had no knowledge of the chronology of the spread of Christianity compared to the chronology of the break - up of Proto - Germanic , we would have no way of knowing whether the proto - Germanic word ( however accurately we are able to reconstruct it as far as phonology goes ) referred to the Christian god or not .
In like fashion , I accept the reconstruction of the phonological form of the Proto - Indo - European form of the word which in attested Indo - european languages meant " horse " , but am less certain as to its original meaning in the proto - language .
Don 's response :
Etienne ’s point is well taken .
As he undoubtedly knows , the irregularity of semantic change does n’t allow us to reconstruct meanings with the same precision with which we can reconstruct forms .
I do n’t know of any positive evidence for the scenario he sketches , and a ( near - ) unanimous shift in so many subfamilies might be a long shot , but the point is that it ca n’t be excluded completely .
( The shift in the meaning of god seems less extreme to me , partly because there was an institution — the Christian church — exerting pressure in that direction for centuries , and partly because there was already a tradition of coopting the Greek and Latin polytheistic words for the monotheistic religion .
The latter would have been obvious for a long time , because in parts of the western half of the ( former ) Empire Greco - Roman polytheism hung on till at least the late 6th c. CE ; see Richard Fletcher ’s book The bar­barian conversion for some eye - opening discussion . )
Also , regardless of what kind (s ) of equids the PIE ‘ horse ’- word meant , it ( or its ancestor ) must surely have been applied to wild equids first ; so the existence of such a word in the protolanguage really does n’t provide evidence for the domestication of horses .
So far as I can see , the hard linguistic evidence for a relatively “ shallow ” date for PIE is the wheeled vehicle terminology .
It ’s true that Anatolian provides no good evidence for ‘ wheel ’ itself , but Hittite does have two inherited words for parts of the traction apparatus .
The most striking is ḫissas ‘ thill ’ ( the pole that attaches the wagon to the harness ) , cognate with Sanskrit īṣā́ ‘ thill ’ .
The PIE word is reconstructable as *h 2 iHsó - or *h 3 iHsó - ( where “ H ” is any of the three “ laryngeal ” consonants ) ;
I ’d hazard a guess that it was feminine , like the Skt. word ( thus nom .
sg. *h 2/3 iHsé-h 2 , etc. ) , since Hittite lost the feminine gender and can be expected to have remodelled the endings .
The meaning is very specific and the word is not derivable from any verb root , so this is about as good as palaeolinguistic evidence gets .
But the other bit of evidence is reasonably good as well .
Hittite iukan ‘ yoke ’ is clearly cognate with Skt. yugám , Gk. ζυγόν / sdugón / , Lat. iugum , Old English ġeoc , etc .
The noun is derived from * yewg - ‘ join ’ , but it never means just any means of joining , always specifically ‘ yoke ’ .
Moreover , its formation is unusual ( though not as odd as that of ‘ wheel ’ ) : though neuter o-stem nouns with zero - grade roots do appear in various daughter languages , very few are shared by a large number of sub­groups ; so this is another derived noun that was probably derived only once .
Now , if you really want to you can argue that these items could have been used with sleds ( though in that case the PIE “ homeland ” should have had snowy winters ; the steppes would do , but central Anatolia probably would n’t ) .
But I think the natural interpretation is that these are wheeled - vehicle terms .
I think most of the evidence that can be brought to bear on the problem of the IE dispersal is actually archaeological .
We need to find the best possible fit between the archaeological data , which are sometimes extensive , and relevant linguistic data , which are usually restricted .
It usually turns out that you can fit quite a few different archaeo­logical scenarios to the linguistic data , but not all equally easily ; and the more stretching and squeezing you have to do to make it all fit , the less likely the result is to be correct .
( It has to be remembered that extrapolating into prehistory is always a probabi­listic en­deavor .
Smoking guns are very rare . )
I ’m prepared to accept David Anthony ’s hypothesis for the time being because I think it ’s the most likely so far , and because he ’s backed it up with a great deal of detailed archaeological evidence ; I ’ve never seen any­thing like that from Colin Renfrew , for instance .
( Not that I ’m rejecting all of Renfrew ’s work — I think his work on pre-Celtic Britain is very impressive ; I just think Anthony ’s done better with the IE dispersal problem . )
But I do n’t care deeply whether Anthony turns out to be right in the long run , or about any specific conclusions ; it ’s the data and the methodology that matter .

In a few hours , George W. Bush will walk out of the Oval Office for the last time as president .
As he leaves , he carries with him the near - universal opprobrium of the permanent class that inhabits our nation 's capital .
Yet perhaps the most important reason for this unpopularity is the one least commented on .
Here 's a hint :
It 's not because of his failures .
To the contrary , Mr. Bush 's disfavor in Washington owes more to his greatest success .
Simply put , there are those who will never forgive Mr. Bush for not losing a war they had all declared unwinnable .
Here in the afterglow of the turnaround led by Gen.
David Petraeus , it 's easy to forget what the smart set was saying two years ago -- and how categorical they all were in their certainty .
The president was a simpleton , it was agreed .
Did n't he know that Iraq was a civil war , and the only answer was to get out as fast as we could ?
The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- the man who will be sworn in as vice president today -- did n't limit himself to his own opinion .
Days before the president announced the surge , Joe Biden suggested to the Washington Post he knew the president 's people had also concluded the war was lost .
They were , he said , just trying to " keep it from totally collapsing " until they could " hand it off to the next guy . "
For his part , on the night Mr. Bush announced the surge , Barack Obama said he was " not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq are going to solve the sectarian violence there .
In fact , I think it will do the reverse . "

Bush ’s Last Heist : the Meltdown and Bailout Frauds
by Damien
Long time ‘ existentialist ’
Damien files the following report confirming that the ‘ finanicial meltdowns ’ and subsequent bailouts are deliberate frauds , scams on a global scale .
Damien picks up the story …
From the SeattlePI .
Com via Market Ticker :
The FBI was aware for years of “ pervasive and growing ” fraud in the mortgage industry that eventually contributed to America ’s financial meltdown , but did not take definitive action to stop it .
“ It is clear that we had good intelligence on the mortgage - fraud schemes , the corrupt attorneys , the corrupt appraisers , the insider schemes , ” said a recently retired , high FBI official .
Another retired top FBI official confirmed that such intelligence went back to 2002 .
The problem , according to the two FBI retirees and several other current and former bureau colleagues , is that the bureau was stretched so thin that no one noticed when those lenders began packaging bad mortgages into bad securities .
Both retired FBI officials asserted that the Bush administration was thoroughly briefed on the mortgage fraud crisis and its potential to cascade out of control with devastating financial consequences , but made the decision not to give back to the FBI the agents it needed to address the problem .
After the terrorist attacks of 2001 , about 2,400 agents were reassigned to counter terrorism duties .
In Oct 2008 Mr Lynn Turner , former chief accountant of the SEC , gave evidence to the US House Oversight Committee investigating the collapse of insurance giant AIG .
He testified that the SEC Office of Risk Management , which had oversight responsibility of all US securities , including swaps , had been progressively cut by the Bush administration from 146 personnel .
By Feb 2008 only one person was left for assessing corporate financial risk management for the entire US securities market !
Here ’s Rep. Peter Welch ( D - VT ) questioning Lynn Turner :
Welch : “ You said that the SEC office of risk management was reduced to a staff .
Did you say , of one ? ”
Turner : “ Yeah , when that gentleman would go home at night he could turn the lights out in February of this year .
We had just gotten down to one person at the SEC responsible for identifying the risks at all the institutions ” .
Welch : “ So that included the $ 62 trillion dollar credit default swap ? ”
Turner : “ That ’s correct . ”
The Bush regime is a crime syndicate !
It ’s that simple .

Soros :
No bottom for world ' financial collapse ' Reuters
Published : Saturday February 21 , 2009
Print This Email This Renowned investor George Soros said on Friday the world financial system has effectively disintegrated , adding that there is yet no prospect of a near - term resolution to the crisis .
Soros said the turbulence is actually more severe than during the Great Depression , comparing the current situation to the demise of the Soviet Union .
He said the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September marked a turning point in the functioning of the market system .
" We witnessed the collapse of the financial system , " Soros said at a Columbia University dinner .
" It was placed on life support , and it 's still on life support .
There 's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom . "

Richard Manley , 38 , later admitted a total of 19 charges , including indecent assault , taking an indecent picture of a child , and distributing child pornography .
His former fiancee , a 35 - year - old mother - of - two who had been in a relationship with him for four years , told the South Wales Echo : " Thank God I never married him .
I was just days away .
" I had a lucky escape . "
Manley , of System Street , Adamsdown , Cardiff , was given a six - year prison sentence at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday .
The court heard the offences came to light last September when Manley 's partner confronted him after receiving a text message alleging he was a paedophile .
The woman , who did not want to be named , called police after Manley admitted taking an indecent photograph of a child in her underwear , and indecently touching her .
When police arrested him on 12 September , he told them : " I did take the picture , and sent it , years ago . "
Manley later wrote a letter to his former partner , confessing to further offences he had committed .
Huw Evans , prosecuting , told the court Manley , an aircraft technician , became interested in child pornography in 2000 and shared photographs with others on the internet .
Robin Shellard , defending , said Manley resigned from his job in a letter to his employers after the offences came to light .
He said his client feels " real remorse " , and added : " It is to his great credit that he has come forward before the world , and that has been a very difficult thing for him to do .

" The hardest thing was confessing all to his partner , the woman he loved and still loves deeply , and who perhaps will never forgive him .
" But he thought it was for the best that everything he did should come into the open , so he could try to get the help he needs . "
In one of the letters , Manley wrote : " It was a time of life I regret , and I do n't intend to repeat it . "
Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told Manley he suffered from " perverted lust " .
He banned Manley from working with children for life , and ordered him to be placed on the sex offenders register .

Arizona AG : Marijuana legalization could curb Mexican drug cartel warfare David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday February 27 , 2009
Print This Email This Goddard : Cartel violence has killed over 1,000 in Mexico ' this year . '
When President Bush vowed to " smoke 'em out " in the chase for Osama bin Laden -- who his administration claimed to be America 's greatest enemy -- he meant it in the Wild West sense , not the California sense .
Who'd have thought that by the time his predecessor took office , otherwise conservative officials would be considering another way of smoking out a new and growing threat to Americans ' safety : Mexican drug cartels , whose profits are largely derived from the illegal smuggling and sale of marijuana .
On Friday , Democrat Terry Goddard , Arizona 's Attorney General , said that while he's not in favor of legalizing marijuana , he thinks it should be debated as a way of curbing violence in the increasingly deadly clashes between Mexico 's gangs .
He emphasized that over 1,000 people have been killed in cartel - related violence " this year . "
Thursday , the Mexican government said it was sending 5,000 soldiers to Ciudad Juarez , a border town racked with violence , which recently saw its police chief resign and its mayor 's life threatened .
The troops are in addition to 2,000 others already station there .
Speaking to CNN's Kiran Chetry about the firearms trade between the US and Mexico , he noted that almost all the guns seized in Mexico 's drug war came from the US .
" This is the source , " he said .
" This is the gun store for a great deal of the world . "
" What 's the answer ? " asked Chetry .
" There 'd have to be a variety of answers , " he said .
" But one of 'em would be to enforce our laws more aggressively . "
Goddard said he believes new firearm purchasing requirements could be key in helping stop what 's called " straw buying , " or purchasing a weapon with no intent of actually owning it and instead turning it over to a criminal for a fee .
" If we could isolate those , we 'd find a lot of the criminals , " he suggested .
" The entire trade , of course , is fueled by the selling and buying of drugs , " said Chetry .
" There are some who make the case , including a former deputy foreign minister of Mexico who now works for the Brookings Institution -- somebody by the name of Andres Rosenthal -- who says maybe we need to rethink our drug laws . "
Rosenthal is one of a growing chorus of former Latin American leaders who have voiced support for the legalization of marijuana .
" He says , ' As with the repeal of prohibition , the US must follow a common - sense approach by thinking the unthinkable :
The gradual legalization of some drugs .
The US must realize that all drugs are not created equal , ' " said Chetry .
" They go on to say that marijuana , maybe some methamphetamines , do not have the same harmful effects and legalization might make a difference .
Do you agree ? "
" Well , I do n't , " said Goddard .
" But I do think the debate needs to go forward .
We need to find a better way to handle ...
Right now , the item that 's fueling the violent cartels , the murders in Mexico , the cartel wars that are going on right now that have resulted in over 1,000 deaths this year , I think we need to take a very aggressive stand on that and marijuana is the number one producer for the cartels .
Sixty to 70 percent of their gross profits comes from marijuana .
So , I think we need to look very hard at something we have n't looked at for years . "
" So , that lends some credence to the argument ... Of legalization , " said Chetry .
" It 's certainly is a strong argument for getting that debate front and center and finding whatever options we might have to cut off the devastation in Mexico , " said Goddard .
" What we fear here on the Arizona border is the cartel on cartel battle is going to end up spreading across the border .
" If we can't stop it in Mexico , we 're gonna end up with violence in the United States and none of us want that , " he concluded .
" Over the years , cannabis has become more potent and is associated with an increasing number of emergency room admissions , " a recent International Narcotics Control Board report stated .
According to the UN agency , cannabis was often the first illicit drug taken by young people .
Opponents of legalization often refer to it as a " gateway drug , " implying it could lead to later use of harder drugs such as cocaine or heroin , which have much higher toxicity levels and rates of addiction .
" When today 's youth use marijuana , they are using the same drug used by youth in the 1960s and 1970s , " claims the Drug Policy Alliance , an organization which promotes legalization issues in Washington , D.C. " A small number of low - THC samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration are used to calculate a dramatic increase in potency .
However , these samples were not representative of the marijuana generally available to users during this era .
Potency data from the early 1980s to the present are more reliable , and they show no increase in the average THC content of marijuana .
Even if marijuana potency were to increase , it would not necessarily make the drug more dangerous . "
The group calls the " gateway drug " argument a " myth . "
A recent Zogby poll found 44 percent of Americans support the legalization of marijuana .
In 2001 that figure was significantly lower : just 34 percent , according to a USA Today - CNN - Gallup poll .
On Tuesday , President Obama 's Attorney General announced the federal government would not conduct police raids on marijuana dispensaries in states which have approved cannabis for medicinal purposes .

The number of people in jail or prison in the United States hit another record at the end of last year , according to a report from the US Department of Justice 's Bureau of Justice Statistics released Thursday .
According to the report , Prisoners in 2007 , 2,293,157 people were behind bars at the end of last year , roughly two - thirds of them serving prison sentences and one - third doing jail time .
overcrowding at Mule Creek State Prison ( from cdcr.ca.gov )
Drug offenders made up 19.5 % of all people doing time in the states , or roughly 400,000 people .
In the federal system , drug offenders account for well over half of the 200,000 prisoners ( those numbers are not included in this report ) , bringing the total number of people sacrificed at the altar of the drug war to more than half a million .
Parole and probation violators accounted for about one - third of all new prison admissions last year .
It is unclear how many violations were for drug - related reasons , but that number is undoubtedly substantial .
The imprisoned population continued to grow last year , albeit at a marginally slower rate than the decade as a whole .
The number of those imprisoned grew by 1.8 % last year , down from 2.8 % in 2006 , and slightly lower than 2.0 % a year average since 2000 .
The population behind bars continued to grow at a faster rate than the population as a whole last year .
The number of people imprisoned per 100,000 population -- the imprisonment rate -- rose from 501 in 2006 to 506 last year .
It was 475 per 100,000 in 2000 .
Since 2000 , the number of people behind bars increased by 15 % , while the US population increased by only 6.4 % .
The prison populations in 36 states and the District of Columbia increased during 2007 .
The federal prison population experienced the largest absolute increase of 6,572 prisoners , followed by Florida ( up 5,250 prisoners ) , Kentucky ( up 2,457 prisoners ) and Arizona ( up 1,945 prisoners ) , resulting in 58.7 % of the change in the overall prison population .
Kentucky ( 12.3 % ) , Mississippi ( 6.5 % ) , Florida ( 5.6 % ) , West Virginia ( 5.6 % ) , and Arizona ( 5.4 % ) reported the largest percentage increases in their prison populations .
The prison populations in the remaining 14 states decreased .
Michigan's ( 1,344 ) and California 's ( 1,230 ) prison populations experienced the greatest absolute decrease , while Vermont ( down 3.2 % ) , Montana ( down 2.8 % ) , Michigan ( down 2.6 % ) , and New Mexico ( down 2.6 % ) prison populations had the largest percent decreases .
America 's position as the world 's leading jailer , in both absolute and per capita terms , remains unchallenged , and the war on drugs is playing a significant role .
Interestingly , the BJS report comes one day after a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that 43 states face budget shortfalls next year .
As for the federal budget deficit , well , who can even keep up with that ?
There is no “ A , R or P ” in the government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , quipped U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive Richard Davis Tuesday morning in front of about 300 business people in Minneapolis .
“ It ’s just troubled , ” the 50 - year - old CEO said at the Thrivent Financial for Lutherans ’ Business Leaders Forum .
The forum invites executives to discuss how business and their principles intersect .
In his hour - long speech , Davis spoke about the economic crisis and the banking industry ’s role in that crisis .
But he kept the mood light , calling himself a “ banker dude ” and “ Christian guy , ” and at one point revealed that back in high school , he had been fired from his first job , at Toys “ R ” Us .
Davis also said banking remains a critical part of society , despite its current troubles .
“ Bankers are dream makers , ” he said .
“ We do n’t make anything .
We do n’t build anything .
We do n’t fix anything .
We do n’t break anything .
We get behind everyone who does . ”
But Davis was critical of the U.S. Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program introduced last fall , saying that while the program was well intended , it has turned out to be “ lousy . ”
Created to encourage lending to small businesses and consumers , TARP started by shoveling tens of billions of dollars at the country ’s biggest banks but soon was expanded to include banks of all sizes .
Minneapolis - based U.S. Bancorp got $ 6.6 billion .
“ I will say this very bluntly : We were told to take it .
Not asked , told .
‘ You will take it , ’ ” Davis said .
“ It does n’t matter if you were there on the first night and you were told to sign on the dotted line before you walked out of the office , or whether in the days that followed , you were told to take it . ”
But by Tuesday afternoon , a U.S. Bancorp spokesman said Davis had misspoke , and meant that because the largest banks in the country took TARP money , U.S. Bancorp and others were forced to do so as well , for competitive reasons .
Davis went on to say in his talk that while government officials marketed the program as a way to entice banks to lend again , TARP actually was designed to give solid banks like U.S. Bancorp some extra cash to buy weaker banks in the system .
U.S. Bancorp did just that late last year when it acquired the assets of two failed banks in California , Downey Savings and Loan and PFF Bank & Trust .
“ We were told to take it so that we could help Darwin synthesize the weaker banks and acquire those and put them under different leadership , ” he said .
“ We are not even allowed to mention that . …
We were supposed to say the TARP money was used for lending . ”
But Davis is talking about it now , he says , because he and others oppose current and future strings attached to the program .
Davis did n’t detail those strings , but he said he and some peers intend to voice their opinions to Washington , D.C. , soon .
“ Now they ’re punishing you for having the capital , ” he said , adding that he refuses to stand by and let his company become “ collateral damage ” in an attempt to nationalize the banks .
Davis touted U.S. Bancorp as a strong player in a weak industry , but also gave props to local competitors Wells Fargo & Co. , TCF Financial Corp. and Bremer Financial .
“ That ’s why this city will continue to come through this difficult time better than almost any major city in America , ” said Davis , who came to Minnesota from California .
“ We did n’t get into the stupid stuff two years ago that would have impaired us from doing the normal stuff today .
So there . ”
Davis also disclosed that a number of other states and cities have been working hard to lure U.S. Bancorp away from the Twin Cities , but assured the crowd that so long as he remains in charge , the company will stay right where it is .
The company employs more than 10,000 people in Minnesota .
Near the close of his speech , Davis suggested that what the panic - stricken world needs more than ever now is a little bit of courage and some faith that it will get through this dark period .
“ Perhaps what we should do is check ourselves and say , ‘ OK , it is tough . ’
What can we — any two of us , any five of us , any 200 of us — do to improve the outcome of this difficult circumstance , ” Davis said .
“ And by the way , where ’s the faith ? …
Where ’s the belief that something is going to turn here and we might actually have a chance ? ”
Davis offered up Chesley “ Sully ” Sullenberger as an example of that faith and courage .
Sullenberger is the US Airways pilot who last month crash - landed his damaged plane into the Hudson River in New York , saving all of the plane ’s passengers .
Sullenberger did n’t know for sure he’d be able to make that landing , “ but he believed , ” Davis said .
“ His faith helped him land that plane . ”

Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks were the first since Mr Obama took office Iran 's president has responded to an overture by the new US president by demanding an apology for past US " crimes " committed against Iran .
The US " stood against the Iranian people in the past 60 years " , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during an address in the western region of Khermenshah .
" Those who speak of change must apologise to the Iranian people and try to repair their past crimes , " he said .
The US president has offered to extend a hand if Iran " unclenched its fist " .
President Barack Obama discussed the possibility of a softening of US policy towards Iran in an interview recorded with a Saudi - owned Arabic TV network on Monday .
Mr Ahmadinejad will , as expected , stand for re-election in June , close aide Aliakbar Javanfekr told Reuters news agency on Wednesday .
Strong tirade America 's crimes against Iran , the Iranian leader said in his televised speech , included support for the Iranian coup of 1953 and backing for Saddam Hussein in the Iran - Iraq war of the 1980s .
God willing , he [ George W Bush ] has gone to hell
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Ahmadinejad on the attack Timeline : US - Iran ties Stakes high for Obama on Iran The Iranian president welcomed the possibility of US change , but said it should be " fundamental and effective " rather than just a change of tactics .
The remarks are the first Iranian comment on the US since Mr Obama took office eight days ago .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran describes it as one of Mr Ahmadinejad 's strongest tirades against the US .
Our correspondent says we may see twists and turns out of Iran as its leaders work out whether Mr Obama is offering real change and what they may offer in return .
While he was playing to the crowd , adds our correspondent , he could also be staking out his position ahead of Iran 's presidential election in June .
Mr Ahmadinejad congratulated Mr Obama after his election in November but the message was criticised in Iran and received a cool response from Mr Obama .
' Hell ' for Bush Mr Ahmadinejad also attacked US support for Israel and its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He called on Mr Obama to withdraw US troops from their bases around the world and for America to " stop interfering in other people 's affairs " .
Referring to Mr Obama 's predecessor , George W Bush , he said he trusted that he had " gone to hell " .
Relations between Washington and Tehran reached new lows in recent years over attempts by the US and its allies in the United Nations to curtail Iran 's nuclear programme over fears it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
Tehran says its programme is to develop civilian nuclear power only .
The new US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , said on Monday that she was looking forward to " vigorous diplomacy that includes direct diplomacy with Iran " .
The US broke off diplomatic ties with Iran in 1979 , after students stormed the US embassy in Tehran after the Islamist revolution overthrew the US - backed Shah .

Nine people , including two adults , were injured .
At least six others in Spain and four in France have died in storms that have socked the region , authorities and Spanish media reported .
The sports complex collapsed shortly after 11 a.m. ( 5 a.m. ET ) in Sant Boi de Llobregat , a suburb just west of the city , near the Prat airport .
The boys who died , who were 9 to 12 years old , were among 17 youngsters playing baseball outside when strong winds began blowing .
The adults took 11 of the children into the building , authorities told CNN sister network CNN +.
The winds caused the metal roof and part of the building 's concrete siding to collapse on those inside , said a reporter for CNN +.
Watch rescuers dig through the rubble »
The six boys who stayed outside were not hurt .
Earlier official reports that said they had been injured were wrong .
Emergency workers thought they had rescued all survivors and recovered all bodies from the building by early afternoon , the CNN + reporter said .
Spanish media have reported winds of up to 99 mph in parts of Catalonia , whose capital is Barcelona .
Strong winds have also had much of northern Spain on alert .
The winds would signify a Category 2 hurricane , which has wind speeds that range from 96 to 110 mph , according to the Saffir - Simpson scale .
The winds toppled garbage containers and other objects in Madrid .
Various northern airports had delays , as did high - speed train service between Madrid and Barcelona , authorities said .
A Civil Guard officer in northwestern Spain died when a tree fell on him as he tried to clear other fallen trees , and a woman in Barcelona was crushed by a wall that caved in .
The severe weather , which began Friday night , has also pummeled southwestern France , knocking out power for about 1.2 million homes , according to Electricite de France .
On Saturday , two drivers in the city of Les Landes were killed when heavy winds downed trees that fell on their cars .
A 78 - year - old man also died after being struck by debris near his home , police said .
In Gironde , a 73 - year - old woman who was on a respiratory machine died after her home lost power .
Regions hit include Pyrenees - Atlantiques , Hautes - Pyrenees , Gers , Haute - Garonne , Gironde , Lot-et - Garonne , Aude and Pyrenees - Orientales , officials said , with fallen trees and damaged roads hindering access .

Atlanta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
It took Norma Margeson a few minutes to learn to control the skinny metal robot .
But instead of viewing it as a machine , she soon warmed up to it as a companion .
Georgia artist Norma Margeson has embraced a robot prototype that can fetch household items for patients .
" Oh , I love it , " she said .
" I think it is such a unique character .
It has a personality all its own .
It can be a friend , a very good friend . "
Margeson , an artist from Marietta , Georgia , is learning how a health care robot dubbed El - E ( pronounced " Ellie " ) can help her accomplish some simple household tasks .
El - E is being tested by Margeson and other patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease .
" We named it El - E because she reminds us of an elephant .
She has this one arm that is sort of gray that can lift objects and move up and down , " said Professor Charles Kemp , director of the Center for Healthcare Robotics at Georgia Tech in Atlanta .
Right now Kemp and his colleagues are focusing on programming El - E to locate and fetch common household items such as a hairbrush , a bottle of pills , a cell phone or a TV remote .
El - E also can open doors .
Watch El - E the robot in action »
A robot with those skills could provide some independence for patients with motor impairments and a respite for caregivers .
Kemp said he hopes his robots could help people in wheelchairs , the elderly and those with such diseases as arthritis and diabetes .
" There is still significant research to be done in order to make robots like El - E function in real homes on a daily basis , " Kemp said .
" Real homes contain a diverse array of objects , have obstacles that make robot navigation difficult , have varied lighting , contain fragile items , provide shelter to pets and family members , and have messy areas . "
Kemp has been working for more than a year with Jonathan Glass , a neurology professor at Emory University in Atlanta and director of the Emory ALS Center .
" What Charlie and his team have been very focused on is not what they can make the robots do , but what they can make the robots do that 's important to people , " Glass said .
" We may think of things that are relatively trivial -- picking up a cell phone , picking up a remote control for a TV set or even pushing a button somewhere that they cannot quite reach .
That may seem to be a small thing to somebody .
But to these folks , it 's a very big thing . "
El - E is about 5 feet tall , with a single robotic arm that can move up and down to pick up objects at different heights .
The robot swivels and rolls on a motorized , wheeled base .
During a demonstration in a living - room setting at Georgia Tech , Margeson used a laser pointer to identify objects she wanted El - E to deliver to her .
Patients with different levels of mobility also can use head - mounted pointers or touch pads .
El - E retrieved bottles of pills and a water bottle when Margeson pointed to them , but its claw could not get a proper grip on a cell phone .
Like any young creature , however , the robot is designed to learn from its mistakes .
" In this case , it missed the object .
It should try again actually , and it should recognize that it did n't succeed , " Kemp said .
Formal studies have shown El - E to be an efficient worker .
In 127 out of 134 trials ( 94.8 percent ) , the robot successfully picked up the requested object .
Kemp and his students have studied the work of service dogs to try to mimic the most useful assistive functions .
And while El - E will never be the warm and loving companion that a German shepherd or a Labrador might be , there are efforts to make El - E interactive and at least somewhat anthropomorphic .
When El - E is ready to work , it says : " Waiting for laser command . "
After the patient points at an object , the robot acknowledges , with the words , " Detected laser pointer . "
Patients can decide whether El - E should put the object on a table or put it directly in their hands .
" If you look at me , I will deliver to your hand , " says the robotic voice .
Glass said that many ALS patients have , by necessity , learned to be tech savvy .
" For the most part , patients at this stage of the disease are used to dealing with technology , " he said .
" They 're used to dealing with motorized wheelchairs ; they are used to dealing with automatic speaking devices and computers . "
But programming a robot to do " human " things involves a lot of hardware and software .
El - E is powered by a Mac Mini with the Ubuntu Linux operating system .
" It needs to have a laser to navigate and to find objects on the surface , " Kemp said .
" It needs to have this camera so it can know where to move its hand .
It needs to have these four sensors so that it can know as it is moving how much to grip on the object , when to stop moving down , when to let go of the object when handing out the object to a person . "
Kemp 's Web site , http://www.charliekemp.com/, includes video that shows what El - E sees as it navigates across a room .
Depending on funding , Kemp said he hopes home health care robots may be available in less than 10 years .
By that time , El - E may have learned how to carry a plate of hot food from the microwave to the table and pick up a glass without breaking or spilling it .

Hugo Chavez 's government is also faced with rising inflation
The Venezuelan government has cut the official number of dollars Venezuelans can spend abroad with their credit cards from $ 5,000 to $ 2,500 a year .
The measure aims to preserve foreign currency reserves amid the global economic crisis and Venezuela 's own declining oil revenues .
It tightens restrictions in place since a prolonged oil strike in 2003 .
Further economic announcements are expected from President Hugo Chavez in the first part of 2009 .
The new measure means Venezuelans going abroad can only count on a maximum of $ 2,500 dollars a year , down from $ 5,000 , on their credit cards .
The cash sum travellers can have also been reduced from $ 600 to $ 500 a year .
It also sets new limits for cash withdrawals in dollars from $ 400 to $ 250 a month .
If they want more , they will have to buy dollars on the black market which operates at more than twice the fixed exchange rate of 2.15 bolivars to the dollar .
Under the new rules , credit card holders will only have access to dollars from the Commission of Foreign Exchange Administration ( Cadivi ) once they have had their cards for six months .
Oil dependence Economists in Venezuela predict that this will be the first of a series of measures to be announced in January , aimed at preventing capital flight in reaction to the global economic crisis and the current low oil prices .
President Chavez has said that his popular social programmes will be funded irrespective of the price of oil , but the opposition say that he will be forced to take serious measures unless the price recovers from around $ 40 a barrel soon .
Those measures could include cuts on public spending , particularly major infrastructural projects , or even a currency devaluation , says the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas .
Mr Chavez recently announced a plan to double production in non-oil sectors of the economy , such as gold , steel and cement , to try to move the economic base away from its heavy dependence on oil .

Ninety organizations , mainly French , decided to prosecute Israel at the International Court for committing War Crimes against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip as the Israeli offensive left more than 1033 Palestinians dead , and over 4580 wounded in its first two weeks .
The French Lamond Newspaper reported that the organizations prosecuting Israel in the International Court are pro-Palestinian and that this step comes as several Arab and international organizations are also moving towards filing lawsuit against Israel for war crimes against the unarmed Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip , especially since Israel is using internationally banned weapons in its war such as White Phosphorus .
A French lawyer who phrased the lawsuit said that the eight article of the Rome Conventions specifies a war crime as " a deliberate act that aims at harming civilians and causing great suffering , harming them physically , destroying their property in a way that cannot be justified " .
The lawyer , Jill Devier , said that a country cannot justify its war crimes by saying that it was subjected to missile fire " even if the Palestinian homemade shells fired into Israel also constitute a war crime " .
He added that the lawsuit against Israel is well supported by two main legal basis ;
1 . The inequivalent Israel attack against Gaza , as it includes shelling heavily populated areas .
He said that this issue was also raised at the Security Council on December 31 .
2 . The targets of the Israeli shelling were mainly civilian , as most of the casualties are children and women , and the army also shelled governmental facilities , mosques , sport clubs , and a building which had journalists on its rooftop .
Responding to a question regarding the chances of winning the lawsuit especially since it is prosecuting figures in a country that does not recognize the international court , Devier said that this issue makes the case more difficult but added that several Israeli officials have dual citizenships and could be prosecuted in the countries of their second citizenship .
Another possibility , he added , is that the United Nations can form special courts or the security council can call for a lawsuit against Israel , yet he said that the two options are hard to achieve under the current international situation , most likely referring to the biased US government support to Israel .
The number of Palestinians killed in the ongoing Israeli offensive and illegal war against Gaza exceeded 1000 , while at least 4,418 were wounded .
Most of the casualties are women , elderly and children .
How we use IRC at Last.fm
Everyone that works at Last.fm is typically connected to our IRC server .
We have different channels per team , as well as a company - wide channel , and a few channels dedicated to automated monitoring .
Sometimes it makes much more sense to discuss / ask questions on IRC instead of email , and it 's useful to be able to raise people who are not in the office .
That said , the main reason I 'm writing this post is to mention the dev-support bot we use : irccat .
IRCCat - Development support bot
The irccat bot joins all your channels , and waits for messages on a specified ip : port on your internal network .
Anything you send to that port will be sent to IRC by the bot .
IRCCat - as in , cat to IRC .
Using netcat , you can easily send events to irc from shell scripts :
echo " Something just happened " | nc - q0 somemachine 12345
That will send to the default channel only ( first in the config file ) .
You can direct messages to specific combinations of channels ( # ) or users ( @ ) like so :
echo " #syschan Starting backup job " | nc - q0 somemachine 12345
or :
echo " #musicteam , #legal , @alice New album uploaded : ... " | nc -q0 somemachine 12345
Some of the things we automatically send to appropriate IRC channels :
SVN commits
JIRA issue tracker updates
Nagios alerts for monitored hosts and services
Deployment notices to testing / staging / production
Results of automated tests if something bad happens
Links to pics from security camfeed when someone opens the office door out of hours
We also post messages from automated backup jobs etc , which helps correlate such events with any unusual load spikes or glitches in usually - smooth graphs .
In addition to providing a cat - to - irc conduit , irccat will also hand off commands to a script you can provide .
We use this to expose lookup tools and some admin functions to our support staff and developers .
The handler script we use is PHP , and has access to our core website libs .
Typing " ?pokereleasenode " , " ? lookup user RJ " or " ? uncache artist Radiohead " is faster than writing a throw - away script , more accessible to non-developers , less hassle than a web interface and creates a public log so people can see what 's going on .
The bot is written in Java , it 's easy to build and configure , all the deps are included :

KOHAT , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Taliban fighters beheaded a Polish hostage in Pakistan Saturday , according to a spokesman for the militants who said the body would n’t be handed over until some captured Taliban were released .
Speaking in Germany , Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said his government had received “ unofficial confirmation ” Piotr Stancza , an engineer and a father of one , had been killed .
“ We do not have a solid proof but we have received unofficial confirmation that this tragedy indeed took place , ” Tusk told reporters in Munich in comments broadcast live on Polish TV .
The Taliban spokesman , identified only as Mohammed , told Reuters Stancza , 42 , was killed because Pakistani authorities failed to free the militants before a deadline expired at midnight Friday .
“ We have killed the man after authorities refused to release our colleagues , ” the Taliban spokesman told Reuters .
“ We will now only hand over his body after our demands are met . ”
He said Stanza was executed in the south Waziristan tribal region , a known haven for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters .
An intelligence official in the region , who requested anonymity , said the Taliban had demanded 200,000 rupees ( $ 2,540 ) in exchange for the body .
Officials were unable to verify the Taliban claim , and the two principal hostage negotiators handling Stancza ’s case could not be reached for comment .
Speaking on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich , Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters :
“ We have used every opportunity to avert this . ”
Stancza was kidnapped on September 28 while visiting one of his company ’s sites near Attock city , about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the capital , Islamabad .
Gunmen shot dead his Pakistani driver , bodyguard and translator before taking him hostage .
Militants had demanded 60 of their comrades should be freed , but later cut their demand to four of their top men and negotiations have intensified over the past 10 days .
Attacks on foreign aid workers , company employees and diplomats have increased in Pakistan over the past year , especially in areas near the border with Afghanistan , where Taliban and al Qaeda militants are battling government forces .
An American heading the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) office in southwestern province of Baluchistan , was abducted last week and his driver was shot dead .
Two Chinese telecommunication engineers , two Afghan diplomats and an Iranian diplomat were kidnapped in northwest Pakistan , though one of the Chinese later escaped .
The Other People of Color
Asians are considered racial minorities , but there is very little effort to include their people , customs , and or specific issues within the context of LGBT organizations .
They are overshadowed by other races and rarely taken into account .
In a survey taken among LGBTQ Asians it was discovered that ...
" Nearly every respondent ( 98 percent ) had experienced at least one form of discrimination and / or harassment in their lives .
Nearly all respondents ( 89 percent ) agreed that homophobia and / or transphobia are problems within the broader API community .
78 percent of respondents agreed that API LGBT people experience racism within the predominantly white LGBT community .
Only 50 percent of respondents said that English was their native language .
Yet nearly all LGBT informational and advocacy materials are produced in English . " ( Asian Nation ) .
Queer Asians are typically caught in a crossroads facing lack of acceptance from the broader heterosexual Asian community , while also struggling for understanding and acknowledgment from within the white dominated queer community .
Westernized Stereotypical Thinking of Asian Sexuality :
Many people perceive Asian women to be soft , delicate , thin , and submissive in nature .
They are thought to be sex - objects for the lust of others .
To the contrary many Asian men are thought to be devoid of any sexuality , they often go unaccounted for under the false stereotype that Asian men have a smaller penis size .
Asian men are either discounted or considered " exotic " and are also objectified .
These stereotypes about Asian sex and sexuality play into both the straight and gay communities and are wrong and serve as a misrepresentation of the wide spectrum of people who are Asian .
Offensive Terminology :
Rice Queen -
A term for older white gay men attracted to Asians , assumed to be desperate and fetishizing Asians .
Potato Queen - Gay Asian men who date older rich white males .
Sticky Rice - Two Asians who are a couple , they are stereotyped as being obsessed with all things Asian and only sticking with one another .
Panda Hugger - A gay male who prefers Asian men .
The Asian Asexual Dilemna :
Eastern cultures tend to be very quiet about sexuality in general which creates a problem for all sexual minorities .
In particular within Asian families is a strong sense of family structure and desire to carry on the legacy of the family .
An Asian who is asexual likely faces more challenges if they choose either not to reproduce or to settle down with a partner altogether .
There is even a joking yet offensive facebook group called Asians Against Asexuality .
The Transgender / Intersex Asian Experience :
The Eastern world has a long history of embracing transgender behavior as well as people who have ambigious genitalia , and many cultures regard trans people and intersex people as " third gendered " and they hold their place in society .
In recent decades with Western ideology influencing Asian nations , there has been increased discrimination and misunderstanding directed towards trans people .
Places like Thailand are considered the transsexual haven of the world , but even there recently a battle was waged to overturn a blood ban on queer men .
While it is quite possible that transgender and intersex identity is more prevalent within the Asian world , this group goes unaccounted for and has very little research and / or resources available as they pertain to trans Asians .

Monterey , Calif .
SPACE is becoming an increasingly perilous place .
It is dangerous , of course , because more and more countries are venturing into orbit .
But it is also dangerous because there are precious few international agreements governing national actions in space .
No rules of the road forced Russia to de-orbit its long - defunct Cosmos 2251 spacecraft , which would have prevented its collision last week with Iridium ’s communications satellite .
Yet this event probably left at least 2,000 pieces of hazardous debris in orbit around the earth ; all of this debris will have to be tracked and avoided by other spacecraft for decades .
Instead of continuing to cling to the theory of “ freedom of action ” in space , all space - faring countries would be well advised to sit down and talk about mutual restraint and coordination .
The alternative is unacceptable : we will lose our ability to operate in some of the most useful regions of orbital space , particularly those closest to the earth ( 60 to 1,000 miles up ) .
In many respects , our level of sophistication in dealing with space “ traffic management ”  the active and dead satellites and orbital debris that whiz around the earth at speeds of 18,000 miles per hour  is reminiscent of the early days of car travel , when a lack of rules resulted in frequent accidents .
If the plant is supplied with water directly , it will not have much of a need to stretch out its ' root system .
So having the string extending only a little bit up through the soil rather than the entire way up should , in theory , encourage growth of the root system of the plant because it will have to grow outwards to obtain the necessary water .
GOP Sen .
Bunning threatens to sue fellow Republicans Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday February 24 , 2009

It was n't so long ago when one of the GOP 's greatest rallying cries -- apart from keeping homosexuals away from wedding chapels -- was the elimination of frivolous lawsuits .
" Tort reform , " they called it , evoking images of ambulance - chasing , money - grubbing " trial lawyers " and greedy , spoiled Americans eager to sue over so much as spilled coffee .
But really , what could be less frivolous than a little old - fashioned infighting ?
On Tuesday , Senator Jim Bunning threatened to sue fellow Republicans if they do not support his bid for reelection in 2010 .
Bunning 's threat was leveled after rumors that the National Republican Senatorial Committee was courting David Williams , president of the Kentucky State Senate , to take a shot at the incumbent senator 's seat .
" Support of incumbents is the only reason for ( the NRSC's ) existence , " Bunning said .
" So if they recruited someone and supported them in a primary against me , I would be able to sue them because they re not following their bylaws . "
" Just to clear up any potential confusion , the NRSC supports Sen. Bunning , " Sen .
John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , chairman of the NRSC , told Kentucky 's Courier - Journal .
The Texan called it a " misunderstanding , " though Bunning was much more terse .
" I dont believe anything John Cornyn says , " the senator told the Courier - Journal .
" Ive had miscommunications with John Cornyn from , I guess , the first week of this current session of the Senate .
He either doesnt understand English or he doesnt understand direct :  Im going to run ,  which I said to him in the cloakroom of our chamber . "
" Amber Wilkerson , a spokeswoman for the N.R.S.C. , wrote in an e-mail message that Mr. Cornyn 'has no intention of recruiting a primary opponent against him , ' " reported the New York Times .
" She added that the meeting with David Williams , the president of the Kentucky Senate , was just a courtesy visit . "
For just a Tuesday , Sen .
Bunning is having one bad week .
Monday , after a firestorm of criticism , he apologized for predicting Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would be dead within nine months .
Ginsburg was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
In his apology , Bunning misspelled Ginsburg 's name .
Of course , it was not the senator 's first scrape with controversy .
" Bunning once compared [ a Democratic challenger 's ] appearance to one of Saddam Hussein 's sons , and made an unsubstantiated claim that his wife wound up ' black and blue ' after an alleged encounter with his rival 's staffers at a political picnic , " reported USA Today after Bunning narrowly won reelection in 2004 .
" The senator also admitted he was unaware that a group of Army reservists had refused a convoy mission in Iraq , and said he had n't read a newspaper in weeks and relied on Fox News for information . "

An extra £ 4.3 million will go to protecting bees and conducting research into the threats they face , the Government announced today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Bee colonies in Britain have suffered significant losses in the last two years , according to the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) .
Bees play an important role in agriculture , with the value of commercial crops that benefit from bee pollination estimated at £ 100 million to £ 200 million a year .
Honey is worth some £ 10 million to £ 30 million .
But bee populations face a growing number of threats including pests and diseases such as the varroa mite , while many colonies were hit by the bad weather in the past two summers .
Today Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said an extra £ 2.3 million would be spent over the next two years supporting the work of the National Bee Unit ( NBU ) to help English beekeepers cope with the problems facing their colonies .
The money , which is in addition to the £ 1.3 million the NBU receives each year , will help the unit identify all those who keep bees and provide expert advice to them on tackling diseases and looking after their colonies .
Mr Benn also announced an extra £ 400,000 a year over the next five years for research into bee health - tripling the amount currently spent each year on the area from its current level of £ 200,000 .
Defra said the extra £ 2 million for research was part of a comprehensive bee health strategy which is currently being developed .
Mr Benn said : " Bees are vulnerable to a number of threats .
Pests and diseases , when combined with poor summers can leave colonies unable to survive the winter .

" We must get to grips with this , to see just how serious a problem it is , what the impacts on pollination are , and what we can do in response . "
Speaking at the Royal Society of Chemistry today , Mr Benn also said science would help steer humans through the " perfect storm " of climate change , environmental degradation and water and oil scarcity which threatened our ability to feed the world population while protecting the environment .
Buying a home can be lots of fun .
It ’s exciting to see all those years of dreaming come to life in a place you can finally call your own .
It ’s easy to get caught up in the excitement before asking yourself the most important question of all :
How much house can I afford ?
The hard truth is , it does n’t matter if the kitchen is fabulous or the backyard is big .
If you ca n’t pay the mortgage each month or find the cash to fix what ’s broken , your home will be a burden — not a blessing !
Figuring out how much house you can afford does n’t have to be rocket science .
Here are some smart tips to help you buy a home within your budget .
How Much House Can I Afford ?
What is your monthly take - home pay ?
Maximum Mortgage Payment How Much House
You Can Afford Based on a interest rate on a - year fixed mortgage .
Now that you know what you can afford , get your mortgage here or try our full mortgage calculator .
Calculate the Price You Can Afford Based on Your Income
Okay , all you really have to do is crunch a few numbers to figure out how much house you can afford .
And if math is n’t your thing , hang in there .
We ’ll walk you through it step - by - step .
We ’ve never lost a patient .
Find expert agents to help you buy your home .
And , for you married folks , make sure you go over the results with your spouse .
You both need to be on the same page when it comes to your budget and what you can actually pay .
After all , shopping for your “ home sweet home ” will feel — dare we say — romantic once you and your sweetheart set shared expectations .
Simply follow the steps below .
1 . Add up your total monthly income .
Let ’s say you bring home $ 2,400 a month and your spouse brings home $ 2,600 a month .
Your total monthly take - home pay would be $ 5,000 .
2. Multiply it by 25 % to get your maximum mortgage payment .
If you earn $ 5,000 a month , that means your monthly house payment should be no more than $ 1,250 .
The calculator below will show you a ballpark figure for how much house you can afford based on your down payment amount and maximum house payment .
3 . Use our mortgage calculator to determine your budget .
Sticking with our example of an income of $ 5,000 a month , you could afford these options on a 15 - year fixed - rate mortgage :
$ 187,767 home with a 10 % down payment ( $ 18,777 )
$ 211,238 home with a 20 % down payment ( $ 42,248 )
$ 241,415 home with a 30 % down payment ( $ 72,424 )
$ 281,650 home with a 40 % down payment ( $ 112,660 )
Remember : this is just a ballpark !
Do n’t forget that grown - up stuff like property taxes and homeowner ’s insurance will top off your monthly payment with another few hundred dollars or so ( icing on the cake ) .
And if you think you ’ll be buying a home that ’s part of a homeowners association ( HOA ) , you ’ll need to factor those lovely fees in as well .
For an easy way to see how those costs will impact your home - buying budget , try our mortgage calculator .
For example , if you plug in a mortgage amount of $ 211,238 with a 20 % down payment at a 4 % interest rate , you ’ll find that your maximum monthly payment of $ 1,250 increases to $ 1,514 when you add in $ 194 for taxes and $ 71 for insurance .
To get that number back down to a monthly housing budget of $ 1,250 , you ’ll need to lower the price of the house you can afford to $ 172,600 .
Use the calculator to try out other combinations to find the right mortgage amount , interest rate and down payment combo that will work for your budget .
4. Factor in homeownership costs .
Okay , your emergency fund can cover major home disasters .
But if you ’ll be saving up for a few home upgrades or you ’re a first - time homeowner , build room in your monthly budget for those expenses so there are no nasty surprises .
These costs may include :
Increased utilities
New appliances
Ongoing repairs
Routine services ( pest control , HVAC tune - ups , etc. )
Maximize Your Down Payment
Your down payment amount makes a big impact on how much home you can afford .
The more cash you put down , the less money you ’ll need to finance .
That means lower mortgage payments each month and a faster timeline to pay off your home loan !
Just imagine a home with zero payments !
Now , we ’re always going to tell you that the best way to buy a home is with 100 % cash .
But if saving up to pay in cash is n’t reasonable for your timeline , you ’ll probably wind up getting a mortgage .
If that ’s you , at the very least , save up a down payment that ’s 10 % of the home price .
No ifs , ands or buts .
But a better idea is to put down 20 % or more .
That way you wo n’t have to pay private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) .
PMI protects the mortgage company in case you do n’t make your payments and they have to take back the house ( foreclose ) .
PMI usually costs 1 % of the total loan value and is — you guessed it — yet another fee that ’s added to your monthly payment .
( Boo ! )
Let ’s backtrack for a second : PMI may change how much house you thought you could afford , so be sure to include it in your calculations if your down payment will be less than 20 % .
Or , you can adjust your home price range so you can put down at least 20 % in cash .
Trust us .
It ’s worth taking the extra time to save for a big down payment .
Otherwise , you ’ll be suffocating under a budget - crushing mortgage and paying thousands more in interest and fees .
Do n’t Forget to Budget for Closing Costs
Alright , do n’t freak out here .
But a down payment is n’t the only cash you ’ll need to save up to buy a home .
There ’s also a hefty closing cost to consider .
On average , closing costs are about 4 % of the purchase price of your home .
1
Your lender and real estate agent buddies will let you know exactly how much your closing costs are so you can pay for them on closing day .
These costs cover important parts of the home - buying process , such as :
Appraisal fees
Home inspections
Credit reports
Attorneys
Homeowner ’s insurance
Do n’t forget to factor your closing costs into your overall home - buying budget .
For example , if you ’re purchasing a $ 200,000 home , multiply that by 4 % and you ’ll get an estimated closing cost of $ 8,000 .
Add that amount to your 20 % down payment ( $ 40,000 ) , and the total cash you ’ll need to purchase your home is $ 48,000 .
If you do n’t have the additional $ 8,000 for closing costs , you ’ll either need to hold off on your home purchase until you ’ve saved up the extra cash or you ’ll have to shoot a little lower on your home price range .
Whatever you do , do n’t let the closing costs keep you from making the biggest down payment possible .
The bigger the down payment , the less you ’ll owe on your mortgage !
Know Which Mortgage Option Is Right for You
Okay , now let ’s talk about types of mortgages .
Most of them ( ARM , FHA , VA , USDA ) are garbage designed to help you pay for a home no matter your financial situation .
When you do the math , you find that these mortgages charge you tens of thousands of dollars more in interest and fees and keep you in debt for decades longer than the option we recommend .
That ’s why getting the right mortgage is so important !
Setting boundaries on the front end makes it easier to find a home you love that ’s in your budget .
Here are the guidelines we recommend :
A fixed - rate conventional loan .
With this option , your interest rate is secure for the life of the loan , keeping you protected from the rising rates of an adjustable - rate loan .
With this option , your interest rate is secure for the life of the loan , keeping you protected from the rising rates of an adjustable - rate loan .
A 15 - year term .
Your monthly payment will be higher with a 15 - year term , but you ’ll pay off your mortgage in half the time as compared to a 30 - year term — and save thousands in interest .
Your monthly payment will be higher with a 15 - year term , but you ’ll pay off your mortgage in half the time as compared to a 30 - year term — and save thousands in interest .
A monthly payment that ’s no more than 25 % of your monthly take - home pay .
This leaves plenty of room in your budget to achieve other goals like saving for retirement or putting money aside for your children ’s college fund .
Get Preapproved for a Mortgage
When you get a mortgage , make sure you know the difference between fancy - sounding terms like getting prequalified and preapproved .
A lender can prequalify you to buy a house in just a quick conversation with you about your income , assets and down payment .
Getting preapproved takes a little more work .
A lender will need to make sure your financial information is accurate and submit your loan for something called preliminary underwriting , which is just another step in the approval process that determines how much money they ’ll let you borrow .
Sure , it takes some extra time to get preapproved .
But , boy , is worth it when you begin your home search !
A preapproval letter shows sellers you ’re a serious buyer and that they can sell their house faster if they choose your offer over competing offers that have n’t been preapproved .
But be careful !
Your mortgage lender will most likely approve you for a bigger mortgage than you can actually afford .
Do not let your lender set your home - buying budget .
Ignore the bank ’s numbers and stick with your own .
Knowing your house budget and sticking to it is the only way to make sure you get a smart mortgage you can pay off as fast as possible .
Work With a Buyer ’s Agent
Though your search for homes may start online , it should n’t end there .
You can do a lot of research on your own , but you need the help of an expert when it comes to actually finding and securing your perfect home .
An experienced real estate agent can help you figure out how much house you can afford and what kind of homes you can expect to find , considering your market and price range .
How does a buyer ’s agent get paid ?
In most cases , the seller pays the fees , so using a buyer ’s agent is free to you !
What should you look for in a buyer ’s agent ?
You may know a lot of real estate agents in your area .
But keep in mind that not all agents bring the same knowledge and experience to the table .
You want an expert who can show you how to buy a home !
A true rock star will have the following :
Shared financial values and a respect for your budget
Great communication skills that make you feel like you ’re their only client
An impressively long list of homes sold every year
Extensive experience and networks in your local market

ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
A group of gay and lesbian Republicans has traveled to the site of the GOP convention this week to help convince its party that it is time to stop being on the " wrong side " of the same - sex marriage issue .
Log Cabin Republicans President Patrick Sammon says " momentum is on our side . "
" Clearly , the tide is turning , " said Scott Tucker , communications director for the Log Cabin Republicans .
" It 's important for the Republican Party to be inclusive on this issue , because we are at risk of being on the wrong side of history . "
Although the group 's president , Patrick Sammon , acknowledges that few politicians in either party support " marriage equality , " as the group dubs the same - sex marriage issue , " it 's clear momentum is on our side . "
Sammon and other Log Cabin Republicans pointed to a poll indicating that the party is starting to move closer to their positions .
A CBS News / New York Times poll released Monday found that 49 percent of the delegates to the Republican convention support allowing same - sex marriages or civil unions .
The poll 's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
A CNN / Opinion Research Poll conducted in May found that nearly half of those surveyed supported either same - sex marriages or civil union .
Twenty - four percent supported same - sex marriages , while 27 percent backed civil unions .
Forty - three percent backed neither option .
The poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Despite his opposition to same - sex marriage , the Log Cabin Republicans said they endorsed Sen .
John McCain , the GOP 's presumptive Republican presidential nominee , on Tuesday because he embraces an approach to politics they want their party to return to .
McCain is an " inclusive Republican who believes that our party needs to get back to our core unifying principles that lead us to victory in the ' 90s , " Tucker said , noting that the Arizona Republican has had a long relationship with the Log Cabin Republicans .
" He 's a very inclusive Republican , a different type of Republican , " Sammon said " At the same time , we have honest disagreements on some issues . "
In making its endorsement , the group pointed to the Arizona senator 's opposition to a federal constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage as being a man and a woman .
The amendment has strong support from social conservatives and would have reversed the decisions by Massachusetts , California and New Jersey to allow same - sex marriages .
" That took a lot courage for a senator from a red state to buck his own party , " Tucker said .
Although McCain personally opposes same - sex marriage , he voted against the amendment , in part , because he believes the issues should be left to the states .
" John McCain stood up for us ... and I want to stand up for John McCain , " said David Valkema , a director of a fine arts foundation in Chicago , Illinois .
" He does n't care about my sexuality .
He cares that I am an American .
" He 's teachable , " Valkema added .
Despite her positions on gay rights issues being largely unknown , Sammon said , the Log Cabin Republicans were also satisfied with McCain 's choice of running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Unlike McCain , Palin has expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment , but Sammon said the group was comfortable with her being on the Republican ticket because of her 2006 decision to veto a bill that would have banned the state from providing benefits to same - sex partners of employees .
" She 's a great choice , " Valkema said .
" We 're learning more every day , but what we know , we like . "
Although Palin was as blank slate for the Log Cabin Republicans , the group was extremely happy that McCain did not choose Mitt Romney , a former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate who was often mentioned as being on McCain 's short list of vice presidential choices , Tucker said .
While on the campaign trail , Romney often railed against his home state 's decision to allow same - sex marriages .
" We would have had a problem ... if Sen. McCain would have chosen someone who used gay people as a wedge issue , " Tucker said .

But surely shutting down all state prisons would do the trick ?
That , too , would only get him about a quarter of the way there .
Now what if he were to close every prison and cut off funding for health care and other services for the poor ?
Now we ’re in the ballpark .
Schwarzenegger on Thursday delivered his annual State of the State address , and there was only one topic on his mind : A budget deficit that ’s ballooned to $ 40 billion through mid-2010 .
How does the average taxpayer begin to make sense of that sum ?
Not easily .
“ It ’s like a number that ’s out there , but it ’s so big that it almost becomes meaningless , ” said Adrienne Gates , a 50 - year - old San Jose resident who keeps fairly close tabs on news out of Sacramento .
“ It ’s like hearing stories about how fast the universe is expanding . ”
Even state lawmakers seem only now to be coming to grips with the enormity of their problem , after months of finger - pointing .
No matter how big the shortfall got over the past year , Democrats and Republicans hewed to their long - held opposition to deep program cuts or tax increases .
It ’s been only this month , with the state literally on the verge of not being able to pay many of its bills , that signs have emerged that both sides realize they ’re going to have to make major concessions .
“ There is n’t a real will to hunker down until you have to , ” said Barbara O’Connor , director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at Sacramento State University .
“ But it ’s reached the point where they do n’t have a choice .
Polemics do n’t work . ”
Still , even a governor and Legislature in perfect ideological harmony would struggle to close a deficit this big .
Consider that $ 40 billion is the amount the state shells out of its general fund each year for the public school system .
Payroll for California ’s roughly 230,000 civil servants tallies a mere $ 18 billion — not including legislative aides or people who work for the state ’s courts or university systems .
( Those 149,000 additional folks are n’t under the governor ’s control , but even if Schwarzenegger could fire them , their salaries would n’t be enough to patch the $ 40 billion deficit . )
California ’s shortfall is larger than the entire yearly budget of every other state except New York .
It exceeds the gross domestic product of more than 100 countries , including Syria , Costa Rica and Kenya .
Closer to home , it ’s 40 times the size of San Jose ’s general operating fund , which pays for most of the city ’s basic services .
And it ’s a devilish 666 times the size of San Jose ’s projected deficit of more than $ 60 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1 .
In nongovernment terms , $ 40 billion would buy about 78,000 houses in Santa Clara County at the November 2008 median price of $ 515,000 .
That ’s almost half of all of San Jose ’s single family homes .
It ’s also $ 3 billion more than the combined net worth of Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page , according to Forbes .
And $ 40 billion could purchase more than 500 Boeing 737-800s .
Of course , the governor and lawmakers are n’t talking about buying airplanes .
They ’re weighing cuts to programs that educate kids and help the needy , as well as tax increases at a time families are stretching to make ends meet .
“ Because of the recession and the slide in the stock market , the deficit has grown so big , so quickly , ” said H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for Schwarzenegger ’s finance department .
“ And it ’s forced a menu of very difficult decisions to be put on the table . ”

The Krishnamurti Connection and Buddhism
The following paragraphs were solicited and published in two articles by a small , American , Midwestern Buddhist newsletter .
They record an attempt to think through a comparison between the example and teachings of Krishnamurti and the Buddha .
This is a particularly relevant exercise , given the little known fact that Krishnamurti was known to have mentioned once or twice during his life , that he had been a pupil of the latter .
Krishnamurti tried , more or less success fully , never to use this fact in public .
At least once however , after a talk , one of his listeners was , by way of introducing a question , explaining to Krishnamurti that the Buddha had said such - and - such .
On this occasion , before K could stop himself he blurted out a forceful : " He never said that . "
He did occasionally give the impression of not suffering fools gladly .
Further information can be downloaded from the " K server " at tu-berlin .
( from Bob James : silenus@calvino.alaska.net to ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de in /pub/doc/krishnamurti/related/ and thence to Pannyavaro , BuddhaNet )
The paragraphs are inaccurate here and there and some needed comments have been introduced in {curly brackets} .
1. Background : The Krishnamurti Connection
Science and medicine tell us that humans are mammals and are therefore related to many other animals which share our environment .
Among the things that we share in common with animals are certain characteristic bodily functions .
More specifically these functions are grouped into systems such as the circulatory system , the muscular system , the digestive system , and the nervous system .
All animals need these systems in order to survive .
Some animals depend more on one system than on the others for survival .
Most animals make heavy use of the muscular system and the digestive system to move about and to assimilate food , but parasitic worms have little need for muscles to move or a digestive tract to process their nourishment .
Perhaps more so than any other animal humans depend on a highly developed nervous system which has evolved into a higher capacity for memory with an enhanced ability for abstract thinking .
So highly developed is the human ability for memory and abstract thinking that humans have given various names to the products {not products : just because tennis balls are delivered in cans and projected by racquets , does not enable us to conclude they are the products of either} of their nervous systems .
Names such as concepts , theories , ideas , and beliefs have been applied to human thought processes .
Over the ages the thoughts and beliefs of humans have grown more and more important to them , partly because thoughts were often heavily relied upon for survival , but also because the intense emphasis that was placed on thoughts and beliefs made them seem real to most all humans .
As time went on many of the beliefs began to take on a reality and a life of their own , independent of the external reality that humans and other animals had hitherto known .
Some of the beliefs became so real and so powerful to those whose nervous systems created them , that they became substitutes for reality .
In the harsh struggle for survival suffering was frequently inevitable , and it could only be expected that humans would sooner or later learn to escape from the miseries of existence by living in a non-real world generated by their highly advanced nervous systems .
The enhanced ability of humans to think their way out of problems thus led to a surprising new activity -- escape from the realm of reality into a world inhabited by beliefs .
In all likelihood this activity came about merely as an accidental byproduct of a superior brain stem .
Thus the human animal separated itself from other animals by using its nervous system for something that it had never been used before to any great degree by any other animal -- for the sustenance of beliefs that had no basis in reality .
Up to this point the use of beliefs and thoughts as a human diversion away from the acute struggle for survival seems somewhat innocuous .
But another unexpected surprise was in store for that advanced human nervous system .
Humans began to idolize and worship their beliefs .
They grew attached to the thoughts that they felt could cushion them from the fearful necessities of living .
Their thoughts became crutches which they could always fall back on .
Like cripples , many humans began to cling to their beliefs desperately .
Beliefs were treated as possessions .
Fearful that some outside group with different beliefs might deprive them of their mental possessions , many people were prepared to fight and die for the products of their own nervous systems .
Animals had fought and died for food , for territory , and for mates , but never before had animals engaged in deadly battles to preserve one set of beliefs over another .
By this time the beliefs were given even more high - sounding names such as ideals , freedom , conscience , God , country , sacred path .
Humans lacked the objectivity and insight to see that concepts such as " my ideal " , " my freedom " , " my God " , " my path " , and " my country " never appear walking down the streets in broad daylight , and that their reality was an illusory one that only existed within the brain stems of the humans who harbored the beliefs .
Most humans lacked the perspective to know and understand the dilemma that the human animal had inadvertently fallen victim to , but there were some .
In human history mention is made of a few rare individuals who had the objectivity and the perspective with which to understand the human plight .
Many of the words recorded from these prophets echoed again and again in one form or another : " Know thyself " was probably the most common advice offered by all prophets .
And yet , this advice has been almost totally ignored , being drowned in one belief system after another throughout most cultures and religions of the world .
Humans , being blinded by their possessiveness for their own thought creations , failed to pay attention to this most important dictum .
Instead they took the words of their prophets and tried to interpret them as beliefs , almost literally .
Rather than trying to look inward and trying to understand what they had created within their brain stems , they succumbed to the tyranny of their petty beliefs .
They unwittingly followed paths which their nervous systems and its beliefs had laid to ensnare them .
We know too little about some of the prophets that may have had some insight into the human predicament .
Those who may have had the gift {it is no gift} of this insight include the leaders of the major religions and a handful of gifted mystics .
Jiddu Krishnamurti was one of these mystics .
Krishnamurti ( 1895 - 1986 ) was born of a Brahmin family of less than moderate means in southern India .
His life might have been a much more uneventful one if it had not been for the Englishman , Charles Webster Leadbeater , who discovered the boy , dirty and undernourished , walking along a beach near Madras at the turn of the century .
Charles Leadbeater shared the prestigious position of being one of the two top leaders of the Theosophical Society with Annie Besant , its president .
The Theosophical Society had evolved into a powerful organization {it has never been and is not now powerful in any ordinary meaning of that word} that had branches in every industrialized country throughout the world .
Its members were often {occasionally , as in any other organization} wealthy and influential .
Its goals were to form a sort of world order or religion that would ultimately combine all existing religions , both western and eastern , into one unitary world order .
The Theosophical society was looking for a world teacher , a prophet of sorts , who would become the leader for this new world order .
{ Poorly phrased but more or less correct .
As long as one understands this phrase " world order " to have nothing whatever to do with politics or religion .
The number of secular organizations from Amnesty International to the United Nations who have adopted a portion of the goals of the Theosophical Society , without acknowledgment , are yet to be counted .}
It was in Krishnamurti that Leadbeater saw an instrument for this new order .
With the approval of Annie Besant and his parents Krishnamurti and his brother , Nitya , were sent off to England to be educated .
By the time he had reached the age of twenty Krishnamurti had become very fluent in English .
As a gifted speaker and writer he had been introduced to the intellectual and social life of England .
The Theosophical Society formed a new organisation named " The Order of the Star of the East " and made Krishnamurti its leader both in temporal and spiritual matters .
For a number of years Krishnamurti presided over large gatherings of theosophists from all over the world .
He was acclaimed and accepted as the prophet of the new order .
Then two unexpected events changed things forever in the life of Krishnamurti .
His brother , Nitya , died of tuberculosis in 1925 , and in 1929 while resting in the estate of a friend in the Ojai Valley of California , Krishnamurti was attacked by {what seemed to his friends to be} feverish dreams .
One day he wandered into a nearby grove and stopped to rest underneath a pepper tree .
It was while he lay under the tree that indescribable feelings of unity with nature overtook him .
He claimed that he could in some sense merge with the insects and the leaves on the pepper tree .
He claimed to be able to see things with greater clarity than ever before in his life and that he had touched the face of the infinite .
Within two years of these experiences Krishnamurti formally disbanded " The Order of the Star of the East " .
To the amazement and disappointment of Annie Besant and some of the other theosophists , he gave up all the power and prestige that he had gained under their tutelage .
He proclaimed that truth could not be found through membership in any organization that was created by man and that no organization should be established by men to show others the correct path to truth .
In short , each person would have to find truth for themselves .
2 . " Truth is a pathless land . " :
The Teachings
For Krishnamurti the conglomeration of thoughts and beliefs that each human acquires and builds upon into adulthood go together to form the ego .
A self - propagating thing , the ego is that bundle of nervous energy which strives to maintain the thoughts which it needs to identify itself .
For example : I am white , I am black , I am Christian , I am a pagan , I am an Englishman , I am a Chinese , I am John , I am a republican .
The ego thrives on labels such as these .
Labels are thoughts , having no objective reality , but they do serve a purpose , to discriminate between what I am and what I am not .
The use of labels facilitates the fragmentation of the universe .
By virtue of labels and fragmentation the human nervous system ( ego ) has subdivided a universe which in its primeval innocence had hitherto only known oneness .
Krishnamurti often refers to this process as one of divisiveness and insularity .
For Krishnamurti the ego is a process that consumes nervous energy in order to set itself apart from the rest of the universe .
The ego owes its existence to fear of all that is unknown , and this fear is acquired after birth by all humans as soon as they begin to deal with the unknown .
The energy tied up in the beliefs which comprise the ego serve as a buffer against the memories of hurt that each human acquires and subsequently carries as a burden .
{ Correct}
The divisive nature of mankind is responsible for all of the suffering which mankind endures .
Divisiveness occurs both internally and externally .
Within ourselves we build images of what we want to be or what we think we should be .
But these images can never reflect what we truly are .
A conflict exists between reality and mental images which cannot be resolved by thought , because it is thought that is projecting these images in the first place .
Any attempt by thought to resolve the conflict ends in more confusion , frustration , and suffering .
External divisiveness occurs with thoughts , images or beliefs like " we are different from them " or " we are better than them " .
Comparisons are made , and in order to make comparisons we must first create mental scales of good and bad , black and white , smart and stupid , right and wrong , high and low .
These , of course , are all examples of duality , and thus duality becomes a tool for subdividing and fragmenting external reality .
As usual , fear is the prime motivation .
We are fearful of the reality of knowing exactly what we are .
To avoid this fear we find security by indulging in mental creations - images of being good as opposed to being bad or being right as opposed to being wrong .
The process leads us gradually into a state of insularity or separation from that which causes the fear .
For example , one might have Jewish blood and be fearful of learning the truth .
To avoid having to acknowledge the truth one could go on a rampage of hate and destruction bent on a " final solution " of eliminating all the evidence that the Jewish race ever existed .
Clearly , external divisiveness can be the cause of much suffering .
What are we exactly ?
According to Krishnamurti we are emptiness .
In some of his writings he describes this emptiness as the nowhere from which joy emerges without a cause and the nowhere to which it returns .
The nowhere is timeless - not having a beginning or an ending , but not having a duration either for duration would imply time .
Subjective time is a product of our advanced human memories .
We can remember our pasts so well that we very readily form images of the past that seem real .
We do this better than most other animals .
But our superior ability for abstract thinking enables us to foresee certain events in the future , e.g. when the temperature drops low enough we may predict that water will freeze .
We may become so obsessed with our ability to anticipate future events that our anticipations may seem to be real to us .
We ' believe ' that a past and a future exists because our nervous system has very real powers of making predictions for the future and our memory is likewise powerful in recalling the past .
The flow of images that our nervous systems construct of the past and the future deceive us into thinking that there is something like a concrete past and a concrete future .
Like many other prophets and mystics , however , Krishnamurti reminds us that the only reality lies ' now ' in the present moment .
The illusion which we experience as the passage of subjective time is intimately tied into the ego .
When we experience time we are always doing something of this sort :
1. Waiting to get something or to go somewhere .
2 . Working ( and waiting ) to earn money .
3 . Studying to become better in a skill or a discipline .
4 . Growing impatient to achieve or obtain something .
In each case the ego is using its favorite tool , duality , and making comparisons to go from a state of lesser possessiveness to greater possessiveness .
Krishnamurti points out that this process which has ego at its heart gives rise to the passage of subjective time .
Egolessness , therefore , implies timelessness .
He acknowledges that there is a place for ego .
Humans need ego to survive in daily living .
Beliefs , thoughts , and memory are necessary to fend for our daily requirements .
We need to earn a living and know when to cross a street safely by remembering what a green light means .
The aborigine must use memory and thought in order to prepare the tips of spears or the shafts of arrows .
But thoughts and beliefs are never sacred !
They are not to be worshipped as things in themselves .
Thought , no matter how elevated or holy it may seem , is no more a sacred product of the nervous system than defecation is a sacred product of the digestive system .
How easy it is to be deceived by the illusion of sacred thoughts .
Krishnamurti has stated that there is only one way to achieve a deep , fundamental and permanent change in our personalities , and that is through a kind of profound , spontaneous insight into our inner nature -- " know thyself " .
This insight , it turns out , is the equivalent of meditation .
In order to cause such a change , this meditation must be without concentration because concentration involves will power and this implies ego activity .
Any activity involving concentration , discipline , effort , or force will only cause superficial changes .
The underlying mechanism will remain unchanged .
He describes a type of meditation where insight and revelation come to the meditator of their own accord as opposed to meditation which rigidly follows a path , a discipline , or a method set down by others .
One can not use the ego to force itself into inactivity because the use of force implies ego activity .
When Krishnamurti refers to insight he means an instantaneous insight .
He means insight which does not require time , deliberations , or tedious analysis by the ego process .
Krishnamurti's insight is so vivid and dynamic that it also becomes its own action .
In other words action with a response takes place simultaneously with insight , and there is no passage of subjective time in which to think or invoke belief systems .
Experiences of this sort may be incredibly powerful :
1 . A mother who steps between her child and a rattlesnake threatening to strike .
She does this without a moment 's hesitation to think about Christian ethics deploring suicide , whether she should say ten hail Mary 's first , etc .
2 . The many accounts of soldiers in combat who threw themselves upon hand grenades to save their comrades without wasting an instant on their belief systems .
One may well guess that even some atheists may have been up to it .
3 . Some years ago a passenger airliner lost part of its hull near Hawaii , a few passengers perished , but most landed and survived .
A stewardess , interviewed on TV , said : " there was no fear -- no time for fear , we all acted spontaneously to the needs of each other without giving thought . "
She said it was all played out in slow motion .
Time seemed to stop .
There was no time for belief systems and no time to get out a handy - dandy bible or Koran or ' Gita ' .
No time for the Lord 's prayer .
4 . Young persons in love ( perhaps for the first time ) refer to dying for each other and moments when time seems to stop .
One notices that love in this case crosses all artificial , man-made , religious boundaries .
Not much thought given to the Christian , Hindu , or Moslem God when lovers meet .
No time to waste on belief systems .
A communist can love a capitalist , a Satanist a Christian , no time , no thought given to the ' rules ' , the ' covenants ' , the ' commandments . '
Love cannot be constrained by rules that are taught at the foot of a guru .
5 . Athletes in long distance racing sometimes attain a state where they are overcome with passion .
They report experiencing feelings of such intense joy that they become overwhelmed and begin to cry .
They report that they sometimes seem to be running in slow motion .
Once again time seems to slow or stop .
Their whole thoughts , minds , bodies are given up , surrendered , or sacrificed to the task at hand .
There is no time to waste on belief systems .
All energy must be sucked back out of belief systems and applied to the race .
The same pattern appears in all the examples above .
The ego has been sidestepped because the effort and the task at hand are so intense that there is no time for ego involvement .
In such moments the ego loses its authority and its energy .
It is the same energy which is used to maintain divisiveness or insularity .
The energy then becomes available to be channeled for more efficient use in accomplishing the task .
Without ego time seems to stop .
There is no doubt about the need to accomplish the task because doubt implies a divisive personality , and divisiveness has vanished with the ego .
The act becomes an act of love , sacrifice , or surrender , because all the mental , physical , and psychic energy expended in maintaining the ego must be withdrawn from selfish pursuits and focused on the task at hand without any second thoughts .
This act is unconditional , all - consuming and therefore , very passionate .
If one feels a need to hesitate and give a thought to the advice of Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha then one 's whole being is not totally united in the act , because some ego with its divisiveness still remains .
In that case one could not say that one unconditionally loved one 's child , a comrade - in - arms , or the other airline passengers .
In this manner love and compassion are negated by faith , belief , thought , and even hope .
We often hear testimony from persons , such as the stewardess , who stated that their lives were permanently changed by their experiences .
They claim that because of their " peak experience " they feel that they live more fully now .
It is much more common for us to feel that we love this person or that thing or some god , but no sooner is the statement made and our minds are already thinking about rules to follow , Christian rules , Hindu rules , conditions , etc .
" You will love your God by not eating meat on Fridays " or " You will love your God by destroying the infidels . "
Krishnamurti in his discussions and dialogues is not being theoretical or otherworldly .
Denying any guru - like authority , he urges us not to take his word for anything he says , and urges us to find out for ourselves .
His message , therefore , becomes very immediate and real .
3. The Krishnamurti Connection With Buddhism
In many ways Krishnamurti's message is similar to the one that Buddhism teaches .
Both point to the ease and susceptibility of the human mind to succumb to conditioning as the origin of all our human problems .
Both doctrines , therefore , prescribe the use of an intense awareness of all of our mental processes , thoughts , memories , beliefs , hopes , and fears in order to gain that state of enlightenment which Krishnamurti calls insight or complete and unconditional freedom .
On the surface there appears to be conflict between Krishnamurti and Buddhism on some points .
To Krishnamurti the process of enlightenment takes place instantaneously , like a sudden awakening .
To most Buddhists enlightenment would take place only after years of painstaking meditative practice and countless rituals .
In the preceding we examined the nature of human psychological time .
Time is measured by humans usually through a process of increase or decrease .
We sense that time is passing because we are growing older or earning more money or waiting to be promoted to a higher rank .
More precisely , psychological time is our perception of the process of increase or decrease and nothing more .
Without that perception there would be no sense of passage of time .
When we talk of working and meditating over a period of years to achieve enlightenment it is the same as saying , " I will create the passage of time by undergoing a process of ' increase ' from a lower to a higher spiritual level " .
By taking this approach we will have avoided taking the discontinuous leap into enlightenment , and instead we will have created our own delay in achieving enlightenment .
As we mentioned earlier , the human ego is involved with this process .
In fact , one could say that the human ego is this process , i.e. perception ( increase / decrease ) = psychological time = ego .
It stands to reason that any Buddhist authority who urges others to work real hard over a long period of time in order to achieve enlightenment is selling an ego package .
Yet , we sometimes hear such advice coming from Buddhists .
Krishnamurti's view of enlightenment is not that of a gradual one which increases slowly over years of hard work , because that sort of ego - related process creates its own delay and thus insures that the end is never attained .
In Krishnamurti's view enlightenment comes by its own accord where and when it chooses , and there is little that we can do about it .
It comes to us at auspicious times like a major discontinuity in our lives , and it reminds us of some Buddhist accounts of awakening which were induced by an unexpected slap to the face or a blow to the body .
Ego involvement in enlightenment ( or meditation for that matter ) is no more than an interference which will negate the process .
It is the author 's opinion that Krishnamurti's views provide us with more insight into The Sutra of the Heart of Transcendent Knowledge than most explanations available from the Buddhist world .
In the Sutra , Avalokitesvara states that there is no birth and no cessation , ... no decrease and no increase , ...
It is the exact same process which Krishnamurti dwells upon in volume after volume of his works .
Enlightenment is a state that is timeless which means that its chief attribute is one of no - time , meaning no involvement with ego or ego - created time .
Once an acknowledgment is made by the ego that time is required to attain enlightenment , the search has gone off on a hopeless tangent and will end in failure .
The ego has to surrender its jurisdiction in the matter of enlightenment and allow something which is infinite and unknowable to take its course .
To Krishnamurti any process of thought is unsacred .
Thoughts of the dharma or Buddha are as unsacred as any other type of thought .
The only thing remaining sacred in Krishnamurti's view is that which thought is incapable of capturing or the unknowable .
All thoughts are mere human creations of the human brain stem and are forever incapable of capturing that which is infinite and unknowable .
At first it seems that most Buddhists would agree with the foregoing paragraph .
But there is plenty of Buddhist literature available which encourages Buddhists to meditate upon sacred images or thoughts or The Eight - Fold path or some mandala or mantra .
It is self - evident that a state of complete emptiness is impossible as long as any images whatsoever persist in the mind .
The Sutra says that emptiness is form and all form is emptiness , yet many Buddhist leaders keep on encouraging others to fill this vast , wonderful emptiness with a product of the human nervous system as if that product is sacred enough to occupy space as long as it has received the authorized stamp of approval from a duly appointed Buddhist authority .
Some Buddhist groups conduct prayer meetings .
Prayer is an obvious exercise of the ego , a deliberate , calculating way to gain an increase over a period of time .
There are some who feel that more prayer results in more gain .
It is another attempt to attain something despite the fact that there is no attainment .
4. No Path , No Progress , No Goal
" ... the bodhisatvas have no attainment , they abide by means of prajnaparamita . "
To Krishnamurti there is no " path " , no procedures , no organization , and no rules that should be laid down by men for other men to follow on the road to enlightenment .
As part of the path , Buddhists must observe a very typical , man-made , structure which begins at the top with The Three Precious Ones : the Buddha , the Dharma , and the Sangha .
Each of these pillars has subsets of rules associated with it : The Five Skandhas , The Eight Siddhis , etc .
Some would have us believe that learning all these articles of faith are necessary for enlightenment .
Much Buddhist literature suggests that in following Buddhism there is a great object that one must attain and that one progresses towards this goal as one takes each step along the path .
To Krishnamurti setting a psychological goal and working for progress in any direction will only lead to more confusion and suffering .
Any attempts at psychological self - betterment will amount to no more than just one more futile duplication of many similar past efforts , all of which had previously failed .
The typical pattern of human behavior that we always seem to fall into , perhaps by virtue of conditioning , is the " work for a reward " stereotype .
One finds a religion and sees something desirable in it which becomes an object of attainment .
The next step is to devise a plan to acquire the object , and finally , with great deliberation we set about to carry out that plan with hard , unrelenting work .
Krishnamurti tells us that the " work for a reward " operandi has been tried countless times by homo sapiens , but it has never led us to anything new or different in the area of spiritual enlightenment .
What do we make of all this ?
Buddhist leaders round the world tell us that there are Buddhist goals and a path of hard work and attainment for reaching these goals .
Here again Krishnamurti seems to be more in agreement with the very core of Buddhist teachings than the Buddhists themselves .
The Sutra of the Heart of Transcendent Knowledge sounds more like Krishnamurti than does many of the Buddhist teachers : " There is ... no path , no wisdom , no attainment , and no nonattainment ... "
Here Krishnamurti is telling us to live up to the precepts of this great Buddhist Sutra .
He is not telling us to follow a path , but to under stand that there is no path .
He tells this just as bluntly and simply as the Sutra does .
There is no apparent sympathy or embellishments for the benefit of those who either fail to understand or for those who have beliefs in goals to which they must continue to cling .
5 . No Apostolic following
Buddhist teachers are prone to exhort us to believe in the principles that Buddhist leaders have laid down for them over the centuries , and there are authoritative Buddhist lineages with apostles who have been appointed to carry out this task .
For Krishnamurti even the faintest aroma of authority is totally detrimental to spirituality , because authority implies that someone has been placed in a position of acceptance .
Anyone who accepts any truth from someone else has not yet found it within himself .
As long as people are unwilling or for any reason unable to find truth within themselves there will be no possibility of obtaining any true spiritual insight .
According to Krishnamurti the person is not important , but what he says is .
In many of his writings he pleads and begs the reader not to accept anything on his authority , but instead to undertake a profound inward search to verify the truth ( or untruth ) of anything he says .
Advice with an uncanny similarity appears in the Kalama Sutra where the Buddha says , " Do n't believe in me , do n't believe in others , do n't believe in something because it is written in books , but really see for yourself what practice is conducive to the weakening of greed and delusion . "
If we are not to believe in the Buddha , other Buddhists , or Buddhist scriptures then of what value is a Buddhist lineage ?
Perhaps not much , but Krishnamurti has an answer to this .
The only useful function that he could ever claim for himself was , as he put it , as a mirror .
He felt that he could help those most in need by reflecting an image of themselves that would be so vivid that no one could fail to recognize the simple fact that our true nature was that of a vast , unlimited emptiness .
If Krishnamurti's role for himself were also applicable to Buddhist leaders then the Buddhist clergy would serve better as instruments of reflection rather than reservoirs ready to spout endless dictums :
The Six Realms of cyclic existence , The Ten Bhumis , The Four Performances , The Four Noble Truths , and so on and on and on .
What of all the rules that the Buddha has passed down to us over the centuries ?
Accounts have it that just before his death the Buddha entrusted his monks to discard all minor rules , saying he knew they were able to discern the essence of dharma .
Overcautious , the monks decided they could n't decide , and kept all the rules .
In effect , they denied the Buddha 's last wish .
Had Krishnamurti sat in the place of the Buddha , and had he made but one rule , it might have been " know thyself " , and all other rules would have been declared to be minor and therefore to be discarded .
Although Krishnamurti has left us with no apostolic succession to continue with his work , he did establish a foundation before he died .
The Krishnamurti Foundation which has an office at Ojai , California , another in Brockwood Park , England , and a third in Madras , India , makes all of his work available either in print or on sound & video recordings , and on CD - ROM .
Some of the tapes contain various impressions of Krishnamurti which were recorded during interviews with prominent world figures from many different fields .
In one such interview with Rinpoche Sumdung the Buddhist teacher stated that in his opinion the Buddha taught on two different levels .
The first level was that of the average human being .
This was the level that Buddha used when he spoke to the masses , and it was on this level that Buddha taught rules , dharma , rituals , etc. Rinpoche Sumdung went on to say that the second level , a higher level , was the one which the Buddha used to communicate in - depth wisdom as in the sutras .
The " Heart Sutra " was such a higher form of communi- cation .
Finally , Rinpoche Sumdung said that the Buddha " compromised " himself by teaching on the two different levels , because eventually obvious discrepancies were sure to appear between the two levels .
In the preceding paragraphs we have been dealing with some of these problems .
Rinpoche Sumdung concluded by saying that in his opinion Krishnamurti never addressed the masses from the lower level like the Buddha did .
He always taught at the level of the sutra and for that reason there is much agreement between Krishnamurti and " The Heart Sutra " .
Krishnamurti , therefore , never " compromised " {not quite the best choice of a word ; perhaps what the Rinpoche meant would be better expressed by the word " overextended " } himself in the same manner as the Buddha did .
Rinpoche Sumdung felt that on this second level Krishnamurti's teachings were identical with those of the Buddha .
Krishnamurti remained true , at times obstinately steadfast , to the Sutra level of teaching during his whole life , and his teachings were consequently more difficult for the public to assimilate .

Khadija Saqir beside her ruined house in Gaza
By Aleem Maqbool
BBC News , Gaza
Most Palestinians are desperate for results from talks between the two main Palestinian factions , Hamas and Fatah , in Cairo aimed at ending their bitter political split .
The division has torn apart Palestinian society .
That seems particularly true in Gaza , where the disagreements are even playing their part in hindering recovery after the conflict .
In al - Atatara , in northern Gaza , 57 - year - old Khadija Saqir bursts into tears as she shows us the ruins of her home and garden .
They were destroyed by shelling during the Israeli offensive .
The tanks came through this neighbourhood .
" This is where we used to sit as a family , " she says quietly , between sobs , as she points to the remains of a room where part of a coffee table is visible among the debris .
" Our fruit trees used to stand there , but they are all gone . "
We are struggling even to get in the food , the medicine , the blankets , the clothes , just to keep people alive
John Ging
United Nations ' relief mission
More than a month since the ceasefire , Khadija and her husband spend their days in a tent close by .
They have no idea where the help , or the hope , is going to come from .
Israel , and Egypt , are continuing to do what they have done for over a year and a half , by keeping Gaza 's borders tightly controlled , allowing little more than a small amount of basic aid in .
I went to see John Ging , the head of the United Nations ' relief mission here , to ask what construction materials had been permitted to enter Gaza to help rebuild the thousands of damaged homes .
The answer was unequivocal .
" Nothing .
Zero .
Not one bag of cement , " he said .
" We are struggling even to get in the food , the medicine , the blankets , the clothes , just to keep people alive .
" Donors have been very generous , and massive amounts of aid have reached other countries in the region , we just are not being allowed to get them in through the crossings . "
Border crossings
But Mr Ging said it was not just the huge external political factors which were serving to prolong the suffering of Gazans in this way .
" Tragically , we have the internal divisions on the Palestinian side which are crippling and mean there is no immediate solution to open up the crossing points . "
Israel regards Hamas , the faction running Gaza , as a terrorist organisation .
It will not deal with Hamas at the border crossings , and so for the most part , they remain shut .
It is also Israel 's stated aim to put pressure on the Islamist faction through these tight restrictions .
Border crossings between Gaza and Egypt are restricted Egypt says it can only fully open its crossing with Gaza under the previous arrangements , where the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , not Hamas , manned the terminal .
So a possible solution is that Gaza 's borders with both Israel and Egypt be operated by the PA , currently led by Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah , and not Hamas .
However , that would need rare agreement between the two rival Palestinian factions .
Some in Hamas , which won parliamentary elections in early 2006 , feel the party should not cede any power .
Many in Fatah feel Hamas ' behaviour since winning those elections means they should give up much more than just control of the crossings .
Beside the rubble of her home , Khadija Saqir said she was desperate for the parties to set aside their differences and for her leaders to think more about the lives of people like her .
" It does n't make sense that there is division among brothers , among families " she says .
" When the Israelis came they did not differentiate between Hamas and Fatah , we were all under fire .
" We need unity even to rebuild our house , even to open the borders , " says Khadija .
" I need them to come back united . " ' Paralysing ' life Dr Raji Sourani , head of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , says the Palestinian divisions continue to have a wider , deeper impact on Gaza .
For our survival as a people , as a cause , we have to have unity
Raji Sourani
Palestinian Centre for Human Rights
" The split is paralysing all aspects of life from A to Z ; socially , procedurally , administratively , politically , there is no other way to rebuild Gaza but through unity . "
Hamas in Gaza and Fatah in the West Bank both say they 're serious about reconciliation .
Dr Sourani says it is crucial that this time they mean it .
" For our survival as a people , as a cause , we have to have unity , " he says .
" If there is any sense of responsibility among Palestinian leaders they should see this and act on it , or the people will reject them forever . "
Analysts , like Raji Sourani , say Hamas and Fatah coming together is not just about the practicalities of being able to rebuild , but also about offering the people of Gaza hope .
There is very little of that here now .
John
Ging of the UN says that with every day that goes by without people being offered a way out of their misery , more trouble is being stored up for the future .
" This is not just about all those who have died or all that has been destroyed , this is having a profound impact on the mindsets of the people here , " he says .
" They are looking to the international community , to Israel and yes , to their own leaders , to find whatever means to live up to their legal responsibilities and give people here the right of a dignified existence , " Mr Ging says .
" Right now everyone is failing them , and that needs to change now .
The window of opportunity to turn things around is closing very fast . "

Bill Gross is managing director of the world ’s largest bond fund , Pimco , which manages some $ 790 Billion Dollars in assets .
Pimco also is managing the commercial - paper assets for the Federal Reserve as part of the government ’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility program .
As such , Pimco is in many ways an insider .
In his January 2009 Investment Outlook , Gross writes that it is not only Madoff who ran a Ponzi scheme , but the entire U.S. economy is a Ponzi - like scheme .
He calls it " our Ponzi - style economy " .
This may be obvious to many of us .
But the fact that Gross said it is news .

In what has been billed as a world first , four music companies and internet server provider Eircom have agreed to work together to end illegal music downloading .
The settlement brought to an end an eight - day trial in which the music companies were suing Eircom as the country 's largest internet service provider - over illegal downloading .
The four music companies have agreed to provide Eircom with the IP addresses of internet users detected illegally uploaded or downloading music .
For its part Eircom is agreeing to implement a three - step process - informing a subscriber if their IP address has been detected infringing copyright , warning the subscriber that if they do not stop they will be disconnected , and finally disconnecting the user if fail to heed the warning .
EMI Managing Director and Chair of IRMA Willie Kavanagh says he is delighted that a settlement has been reached and that the four music companies involved - EMI , Warner , Sony , and Universal - will now be looking to have similar arrangements put in place with the rest of the country 's internet service providers .
Israel ’s 22 - day war in the Gaza Strip may have saved the Labor Party of Defense Minister Ehud Barak from the indignity of falling to single - digit representation in the Knesset in next month ’s elections , but recent polls suggest it has also assured that the next coalition government will have no need of Labor as a partner .
Indeed , the biggest winners in the post - war polls were not the leftist Labor Party but the right wing opposition , who cheered the popular war on and lamented its ending .
And while before the Gaza flareup the ruling Kadima Party and the rival Likud Party were virtually neck - and - neck , Likud now seems to be coasting to an easy victory .
But the benefit is n’t all Likud’s .
Avigdor Lieberman ’s Yisrael Beiteinu really cashed in on their leaders staunch anti-Arab comments at a time when the nation ’s Arab minority was being publicly reviled for opposing the war .
His repeated calls to require Arabs to take a loyalty oath or lose their citizenship seems to have really connected with the war - time mentality of the population .
Likud is eying the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu as a coalition partner ( to the point of ordering activists not to publicly criticize Lieberman ) .
If the polls prove sound , those two and the Shas Party , which forced the new elections by abandoning the Kadima coalition amid rumors of a back - door deal with Likud , will be within a handful of seats of an unprecedentedly hawkish tripartite coalition .
A couple of years ago , fed up with Microsoft Windows , our whole family switched to Macs .
Since then we 've often giggled delightedly at the commercials portraying a PC as a hapless fat guy in a suit .
A Mac , after all , is " the computer for the rest of us , " as Apple 's ads used to say .
We own five Macs , along with iPods and other Apple paraphernalia .
But recently , when we needed a new computer , we ended up buying a PC running Microsoft Vista .
The reason is simple : Macs nowadays are computers for the rich .

Was watching an excellent Charlie Rose last night where he interviewed Malcolm Gladwell and Geoff Colvin on their books about Talent , Performance and Achievement .
Some excellent thoughts came through :
IQ does n’t make much difference to your performance .
After about 120 IQ points , it no longer gives you that much of an advantage .
This probably rings true for most of us , as I think we can all name someone who clearly has a high IQ but is not be the most effective person overall .
Natural talent is mostly a myth .
There is such a thing as natural talents , they are necessary but not sufficient for greatness .
People who are great at their craft are not great exclusively due to natural talent .
Deliberate practice is the key .
Those who do better , are those who are always looking to improve .
Those who push themselves to learn more and perfect their craft .
Trying harder really does make the biggest difference .
You need a lot of practice to be at the top of your craft , 10 k hours ( approx 10 years ) at least .
The more the better and after the ten year mark you seem to hit a stride ( that I would guess is both about expertise acquired AND commitment to improvement ) that begins your path to greatness
Of all that I pondered from this program , number four was the most interesting for me .
In thinking of my own career in Talent , I often wonder if I ’ve been doing this too long , if maybe there is not enough left for me to learn and moving on might be the right strategy .
With this new insight I realize that I ’m between 25 and 30 k hours into this field , really just hitting my stride .
Instead , my time would be best spent continuing to put deliberate practice to work into this field perfecting my craft .
So as I look to 2009 I plan to challenge myself with deliberate practice by
reading more — staying aware of the progress in our space .
— staying aware of the progress in our space .
sharing more — blogs , twitter , conversations , etc .

This is the second installment of a little series of discussions .
They 're not much more than that , just discussions .
And I hope I 'm inviting discussion rather than quenching it .
But I 'll be honest — the goal of this series is to pound a stake through the heart of a certain way of thinking about the world that has become quite popular .
If my series fails in that regard , I hope it may still provide some entertainment value .
Part one ,
The fish , was about a twisty line and a fish 's examination of it .
Today we move to a twisty plane .
There are many kinds of computer programs , and many ways to categorize them .
One of the broadest and most interesting program categories is embedded systems .
These systems are the centerpiece of today 's little chat .
Embedded systems are a bit tricky to define because they come in so many shapes and sizes .
Loosely speaking , an embedded system is a little world of its own : an ecosystem with its own rules and its own behavior .
So an embedded system need not even be a computer program : a fish tank is also a kind of embedded system .
We call them embedded systems because they exist within the context of a host system .
The host system provides the machinery that allows the embedded system to exist , and to do whatever it is that the embedded system likes to do .
For fish tanks , the host system is the tank itself , which you may purchase from a pet store .
A tank has walls for holding the water in , filters and pumps for keeping the water clean , lights for keeping the fish and plants alive a little longer , and access holes for putting your hand through to clean the tank .
There 's not much to it , really .
The embedded system is everything inside : the water , the plants , the rocks , the fish , and the little treasure chest with bubbles coming out .
For computer games , another popular kind of embedded system , the host system is the computer that runs the game : a PC , a game console , a phone , anything that can make a game exist for a while so that you may play it .
Programmers have been building embedded systems for many decades : a whole lifetime now .
It is a well - studied , well - understood , well - engineered subject .
Gamers understand many of the core principles intuitively ; programmers , even more so .
But in order to apply all that knowledge outside the domain of embedded systems , we will need some new names for the core ideas .
The most important name is the One - Way Wall .
I do not have a better name for it .
It is the most important concept in embedded systems .
In lieu of a good name , I will explain it to you , and then the name will stand for the thing you now understand .
It 's the best I could come up with .
But first let 's dive into an embedded system and see what this wall looks like from the inside .
I will assume you 've played Mario Kart , or you 've at least watched someone else play it .
Mario Kart is the ultimate racing game in terms of sacrificing realism for fun .
It bears so little resemblance to reality that it's a wonder it tickles our senses at all .
The Karts skid around with impossible coefficients of friction , righting themselves from any wrong position , and generally making a mockery of the last four centuries of advances in physics .
It 's really fun .
Mario Kart , like all games , has a boundary around the edge of the playing area .
In Mario Kart you bump into it more often than in most other games , which is part of the reason I chose it to be our Eponymous Hero .
If you want to win a race , you will need to become quite good at accelerating around corners , which means you will spend a fair amount of time bumping up against an invisible wall .
You know the wall I 'm talking about , right ?
It 's invisible , so you can see right past it to the terrain beyond .
But the wall is there , and you are not permitted to venture beyond it .
In slower - paced games , when you arrive at the invisible map boundary , you will sometimes be told by the game : " You ca n't go that way .
Turn back ! "
And since that is your only option , you comply .
These invisible boundaries are non-negotiable .
In other games , you may stop on contact with the boundary , or perhaps bounce off .
But the boundary is always there .
Imagine Mario and Luigi chatting about the you - can 't - go - that - way wall .
Their conversation might go something like this : " Luigi , my brother ! " " Maaaarioooooo ! " " Yes , Luigi .
I am a here .
Tell me my brother , why is it that every a time I a spin around the cactus in the third a bend of the Desert a Track , I get a stuck and have to start accelerating from nooooothing ? " " Whaaaaa ? " " Brother , the Desert a Track !
It 's Number a Three !
You know the big a bend , where you have to slow down ?
I am always a forgetting to slow , and I just a stop .
Just a like that ! "
" I do n't know , Brother .
That Bowser , he is always a squishing me right before I hit that turn , and I am a flat like a pan a cake for a looooong a time . " " What about that a time two races ago , where Wario hit you and you a spun around and you a headed for the hill , and you got a stuck and wailed for me ? " " Ah , that Wario !
I will get him next a time ! " " Why did you not just turn around then ? "
" My Kart , it did not a move , no matter how I wailed .
" " That is a what I am a speaking of , Brother .
Your Kart moves in all other places , but if you head for the hills , it just a stops a suddenly ! "
" I a hate a stopping a suddenly . " " Yes , Brother .
So do I .
But why can we not traverse that a part of the hill ?
What is on the other a side ? "
" I think it is Track 4 , Brother .
They do not want you to wind up in the lake . "
" Whaaaa ?
Who is this a ' they ' ?
And why can we a not see the lake from a Track a 3 ?
I think there is a nothing there , Brother .
Just a more hills .
" " No , my brother .
I think it is a Track a 4 .
Or maybe Track a 2 .
There must be a something there .
" " Perhaps you are a right , my brother .
We should get a back to a racing now .
We can talk a more about a this after the next a race . " " Yes , brother .
I will a get that Wario this a time !
" In our Highly Realistic Dialog , Mario is wondering about the Invisible Boundary at the edge of the track .
He asks his brother the seemingly obvious question : " What is on the other side ?
" As a gamer , if you pause to consider the question at all , the answer seems to be : " Nothing I care about . "
The invisible ( or sometimes visible ) Boundary seems just like any other wall .
It is designed to keep you in where you 're at , or out of where you 're not , depending on your point of view .
But the gamer 's view is that the boundary does have another side .
You have no way to get there , but it exists .
For maximum gameplay immersion a game universe needs to appear consistent .
Thus , when you peer through the wall it appears that the other side is just more of the same .
To an embedded systems programmer , Mario 's question is complete nonsense , like a fish asking the temperature of the water on the other side of the glass .
There is no water on the other side , and for that matter a fish can't ask questions , so the question itself is based on nonsense premises .
From a perspective within the Mario Kart universe , the " other side " of the Invisible Boundary is ... a kind of nothingness .
The embedded world quite literally ends at the boundary .
The level designers usually try to make it appear as if the current world continues on , but this is an illusion .
They discontinue the model 's polygons beyond the line of sight .
Put another way , the water stops at the edge of the tank .
The nothingness beyond the Invisible Boundary of an embedded system is much deeper and more significant than simply not having objects there .
In that nothingness there is no programmatic substrate upon which to place objects .
If you were to ask : " What lies between Mario 's head and Luigi 's head , " the answer may well be " nothing " , since no game objects may overlap the line between their heads at the particular time you ask the question .
But that " nothing " is qualitatively different from the " nothing " on the other side of the Invisible Boundary .
Between Mario and Luigi there is a space – a place in their universe where objects and forces and logic apply , even if they are Mario Kart 's twisted versions of physics and logic .
That universe ends abruptly at the surface of the boundary .
The question " What 's on the other side " is well - formed in a strictly mathematical sense .
You could project a line from Mario to the nearest boundary , and ask the more precise question : " If Mario is at distance D from nearest boundary B , what overlaps the point P obtained by extending the Mario - boundary line L to a distance D beyond B ? " ( " Whaaaaa ? " )
The new formulation of the question is more well - formed , but it is every bit as semantically nonsensical .
In the context of the Mario Kart universe , the system boundary truly only has on side , and Mario and Luigi are on that side .
From their perspective , we can't meaningfully ask the question " What 's on the other side ? "
However , there is a semantically significant interpretation of " the other side " of that invisible boundary .
To get to this better answer we must leave Mario 's universe .
From the perspective of an embedded systems programmer , the entire Mario Kart universe is data structures laid out in the memory space of some machine .
There is a program — the game engine — that interprets the data in a way that makes it appear to be a universe that is similar to ours in various intuitively appealing ways , yet different from our universe in various fun ways .
It is very unlikely that the polygons and other level data are laid out in strictly contiguous order in the host machine 's memory space .
It is more likely that they are spread out , with gaps , like dominoes spilled on a tile floor .
The question " What 's on the other side ? " , when viewed from the perspective of a systems programmer , might be phrased more precisely and meaningfully as follows :
" What occupies the memory spaces adjacent to the memory used by the Track Three Desert Level ?
" This is the same as Mario 's question , but we had to step outside the Mario Kart universe in order to ask the question in a way that made sense .
The Mario Kart universe , like most game universes and in fact most embedded systems , is designed to appear complete .
There is apparently " stuff " beyond the boundary ; you just can't go that way .
When we step up into the host system and ask the analogous question about the " other side " , both the question and the potential answers become much more complex : many orders of magnitude more complex , in fact .
Fortunately , due to the Mario Kart system being so simple , increasing the complexity still gives us a vaguely accessible problem .
Let 's try to cook up an answer to this new , more complex question regarding the contents of the program memory space on the " other side " of the invisible wall .
In terms of atomic program units ( say , bits or bytes ) , the amount of memory used by a game like Mario Kart is actually high enough to defy our sense of scale .
A game with hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes of runtime data has billions of discrete elements , which is too many for us to keep track of individually .
One of the key jobs of a programmer is to organize their code so that the elements can be managed at human - CPU scale : up to seven " things " at a time .
But this organization can't mask the fact that billions of individual elements exist , each with its own role to play in supporting the embedded system .
Hence , even for a game as " simple " as Mario Kart , we 're stuck imagining how it works internally .
Even the programmers who built the game have only a dim and incomplete mental model of the game .
It 's like building a skyscraper , or a city : you build it a piece at a time , and it 's rarely fruitful to try to picture everything inside of it simultaneously .
Anything that goes wrong or is out of place in the program could take days to track down with state of the art tools .
That 's just how it is .
We 're not able to comprehend large problems all at once ; we can only attempt it in small increments .
Bearing this necessarily incomplete understanding in mind , what exactly would we find in the machine memory between the elements of Mario and Luigi 's track mini-universe ?
The answer is familiar to programmers and perhaps surprising to non-programmers .
The answer is : almost anything .
It could be elements of a different program , or random garbage not being interpreted by any program , or supplemental data for the Mario Kart universe , such as language translation strings .
Or Luigi could be right : it could be Track 4 , pre-cached for the next race .
Perhaps not exactly the way he 's imagining it , but ... close .
Our little visualization of the host system 's memory raises another natural question : what would happen if you " zapped " Luigi 's Kart across the boundary ?
This question is n't entirely as nonsensical as " what 's on the other side ? "
With the proper programming tools , you might be able to observe changes in the machine memory as Luigi's Kart moves , and these changes might follow an observable pattern that leads to a relevant prediction of sorts .
As just one possibility , Kart motion might be represented as shifting a Kart memory structure along the sequential indexes of an in - memory array .
This arrangement is unlikely for performance reasons , but it 's certainly possible , and should serve to illustrate the point .
If you were to find that moving Luigi's Kart ten meters ( in the scale of Luigi 's track universe ) resulted in a structure motion of 1000 memory addresses , then you might make the reasonable prediction that in another ten meters his representation would move another 1000 addresses .
This might well put him beyond the end of the physical memory array .
In most real - world scenarios this would be a bug , and would result in some sort of nasty response from the machine , such as a game crash .
Or in a more user - friendly environment , the game engine might simply prevent his motion in that direction and move him back into his universe .
This might put his Kart in an uncomfortable position , but it will at least be a real position according to the logic of the Mario Kart universe .
At least the Kart wo n't have disappeared .
However , it is infinitesimally possible that Luigi's Kart could be moved into another physical machine process in the host system — say , another instance of Mario Kart running on a time - sharing operating system or virtual machine — in such a way that Luigi and his cart physically disappear from the old universe ( a process address space ) and appear in the new universe ( another process address space ) .
Even if this infinitely remote possibility were to occur , chances are high that the sudden appearance of Luigi and his Kart would wreak local or even global havoc in the new universe .
He might get lucky and crush Bowser into a pan - a cake , but more likely he would wind up stuck in a stone wall or a hill , unable to move .
Or even more likely , his Kart 's memory structure would be copied into a non-game area , such as the translation string section , and Luigi 's sudden mysterious appearance might manifest as nothing more than garbled speech from one of the other characters .
There are many possibilities , too many to imagine .
The most important takeaway here is that no matter how unlikely Luigi 's safe intra-universe migration may be , it is possible .
With some external help from the host system , it would even be straightforward : perhaps no more than a few days work from a skilled programmer .
In real - world programs sharing adjacent address spaces , it 's improbable ( but possible ! ) that migrating data from one process to another in a randomly chosen destination spot would have semantically meaningful results in the destination address space .
To put it in simpler terms : under just the right circumstances , Luigi could teleport to the other side , and wind up in a different world .
An embedded system is a little environment .
My Betta in the previous installment of this little series lived in a very simple embedded system .
Its most obvious difference from my own environment is that the tank was filled with water , while my room was filled with air .
The differences from the host system can yield different behavior and different rules .
In the fish tank , the rules are only a little different — for example , most things are more buoyant inside the tank .
In a virtual embedded system , the rules and behavior might be completely different from those of the host system .
It all depends on how the embedded system was designed to work .
Every embedded system has a containing surface , which might be called its frontier .
The frontier is one - sided in the sense that the rules of the embedded system may simply stop at the boundary : there is no " other side " .
In some embedded systems ( such as a Euclidean space embedded in a non-Euclidean space ) , even the supposedly intuitive notion of extending a line across the boundary only has meaning on one side , the " inside " of the frontier .
If there is a formal mathematical term for this One - Sided Frontier idea , I 've yet to come across it , and I 've spent quite some time looking .
If you have any suggestions , let me know .
The closest I could find are the spaces that are undefined in noncontinuous functions , such as the Tangent function for a value of 90 or 270 degrees .
If you ask a questionat these values of , the answer is something like " You ca n't go that way .
" So the other side of the frontier is .
This statement has a deep , almost philosophical meaning to programmers .
It doesmean " nothing " ; no , no no !
It means anything .
It is a modern - day Wand of Wonder , a Bag of Tricks , a Horn of Plenty , a Box of Chocolates .
You never know what you 're going to get .
If a computer program 's code inadvertently reaches into , then it has stepped across a mystical wall into another universe , and anything could happen .
It 's as if Gremlins have taken over the machine .
Your PC speaker might beep erratically or continuously .
Your video array might burst into random fireworks .
Your printer might fire up and print out mysterious symbols .
Your program may even continue to operate normally , but with the addition of unexplainable and unrepeatable phenomena .
I have seen all these things happen .
All C/C++/ assembly programmers have seen bugs like this — program bugs with " crazy " behavior .
The bugs are so spooky , and so hard to track down , that computers are now designed to be gatekeepers at the Wall , and when you try to step across they say STOP !
It 's much better to be blocked immediately than to let your program wander into , where ghosts may take hold of your data in ways that may even cause your legal department to take notice .
Stranger things have happened , as they say .
This computerized gatekeeping is commonly called " protected mode " .
The computer checks every addressing instruction , and any time a program tries to access the memory area outside its own , things halt immediately .
When you see the message " segmentation fault " , or a blue screen of death , or some other sign that a fatal , unrecoverable program error has occurred , it is almost always because someone or something in the embedded system tried to escape .
From the perspective of a computer game , the system frontier is relatively uninteresting .
It 's not much different from any other obstacle .
However , in other embedded systems these frontiers are almost mystical in nature .
They provide endless fascination for computer scientists working in the domain of programming languages , which are yet another kind of embedded system .
To see how it works , let 's consider the situation in Mario Kart , which is simpler .
In Mario Kart , most of the racers are computerized opponents , or AIs .
A few of them , usually at least one , are controlled by people , using steering wheels or other physical controllers .
Sometimes ( e.g. in simulation mode ) all the opponents may be computerized .
In order for people to interact with the embedded system , there must be some way to send information back and forth across the system frontier .
Coming from the Mario Kart side , we typically have video and sound signals .
The embedded system generates these signals and sends them to your TV or device .
Coming from the people side , we typically have motion input : which way to move the Karts .
The signals begin as your physical motions : buttons you press , or in newer controllers , the direction you tilt the controller .
They are sent from the host system to the embedded system and they generally produce observable effects in the embedded system .
Like magic !
Mario
Kart is especially interesting because the external camera is physically present within the game .
You can see it in the instant replays of your races : a little guy with a camera , floating behind you on a little cloud .
The game designers have arranged things so that you can almost never see him while racing , because he 's always flying behind your head , along your line of sight .
But he 's there .
And in fact that camera is always there , in all video games .
It 's just that the Mario Kart designers have chosen to reify him as a cute little turtle guy with a camera , floating behind you on a cloud .
The external camera is a one - way hole in our one - way wall : it sends data out of the embedded system .
For all intents and purposes it also sends the sound data , since the sounds are usually scaled as a function of distance from the camera .
During a race , there 's a lot of stuff going on in the embedded system , and there 's a lot of stuff going on in the host system .
But they constrain their communication via mostly - invisible channels , and these channels are restricted in the kinds of communication they may convey .
Your controller can send motion inputs , but ( at least today ) it can't send video data .
And ( at least today ) the characters in the game can't control your arms and legs , the way you can control theirs .
Hopefully now you should have a mental picture of this magical wall between an embedded system and the Great Undefined Beyond on the " other side " of its system frontier .
The wall may have deliberate holes in it : channels , really .
Information may flow across these channels in predefined ways .
And the channels are almost always invisible to occupants of the embedded system .
I 've spent a lot of effort telling you about a rather strange , twisty kind of surface : the frontier of an embedded system .
This frontier exists for all embedded systems .
It may have " holes " ( data channels ) in it .
The number and nature of these channels is entirely up to the designers of the embedded system .
Programmers sometimes call these channels " reflection " or " metaprogramming " .
The holes in the frontier may or may not be detectable within the embedded system itself .
They may only be detectable within the host system .
This , again , is up to the designers .
For most of the embedded systems I know of , the channels are " well defined " , in the form of application programming interfaces offered to either the embedded system or the host system for communicating across the frontier .
But you need a channel for this kind of communication .
Setting it up is usually not cheap .
And setting up meta - reflection ( in other words , being able to " see " the channel from within the embedded system or host system ) is even more work .
So most of the time , channels through the embedded system frontier are completely invisible and undetectable from inside the embedded system .
They 're quite real , and information flows either one way or both ways , but they cannot be detected from within the embedded system , and their behavior is intrinsically non-repeatable via experimentation .
When data comes across these invisible channels , stuff " just happens " in the embedded system , with no clear indicator nor explanation as to why .
In our discussion so far , I have intentionally blurred the distinction between the host system ( such as a fish tank or a game console device ) and the host system 's host system ( such as your bedroom or living room ) .
But you 've probably noticed by now that all host systems are embedded in some larger system .
This is just the way things work .
The fish tank is in your bedroom , which is a system embedded in a house , which is a system embedded in a neighborhood , embedded in a county , a nation , a continent , a planet , a solar system , a galaxy , a universe .
It 's perhaps not as clear in the case of fish tanks , but host systems often overlap and even cooperate .
A city is composed of many interleaved subsystems .
So is your body .
It 's not always a simple containment relationship .
Systems are made of , and communicate with , other systems .
But one way or another , all systems are embedded systems .
There is no reason to assume that our Universe works any differently .
Our Universe is a system ; that much should be self - evident .
It has boundaries ; astronomers and astrophysicists have recently even determined that the boundary appears to be a dodecahedron .
We are already painfully aware of the question " what happened before the Big Bang , if in fact the Big Bang occurred in the way all the evidence suggests " , and its inherent nonsensicality .
What happened before the beginning of Time ?
What lies beyond the end of the Universe ?
Programmers already know intuitively the answer to these questions .
The answer is : is there .
Undefined isthe same as " nothing " , no indeed .
It 's anything .
And we can't go that way .
This has ramifications for the way we think about things today .
I believe I will have more to say about this soon .
Right now I think I will go play Mario Kart : a game as fun as any I think I 've ever played .
On the heels of the interview with Tessa Dick , last wife of Philip K. Dick , comes an interview with Rudy Rucker , often called the heir apparent to Philip K. Dick .
Winner of two Philip K. Dick Awards , Rudy Rucker is the author of the novels Frek and the Elixer , Spaceland , and many others .
He also has a interest in self - publishing : putting out a book of paintings through Lulu , allowing a free download of his novel Postsingular , and publishing ebooks with e-reads .
Here the visionary writer talks about mixing traditional publishing with the new publishing technology .
Self - Publishing Review :
Tell us about some of the ways in which you ’ve been getting involved in non-traditional forms of publishing .
Rudy Rucker :
For a number of years now , I ’ve been posting documents online in the Acrobat PDF format on my Writing page .
I ’ve posted a book - length collection of my collected interviews , and book - length writing notes for each of my last seven books .
Recently it ’s gotten to the point where my writing notes are longer than the novels that I ’m working on .
In an idealized writer ’s paradise , I ’d be able to publish and sell these books of writing notes to fans and devoted scholars , but in this real world , I ’m happy to just give them away — although I do put copyright notices on them .
Publishing my real books is hard enough , without trying to find commercial publishers for my notes !
Recently I decided to get two of my earlier novels back in print , The Sex Sphere and Spacetime Donuts .
I ’d hoped that Tor Books might reissue them under their Orb imprint , but they did n’t feel this was a commercially viable option — and I did n’t find much small press interest either .
I started doing some research on POD ( print on demand ) books , and ebooks , and I began thinking about possibly publishing my reprints in these formats myself .
If you ’re handy with a computer , it ’s not particularly difficult or expensive to do this , and , if you buy an ISBN ( book ID number ) and put the ebook into a certain format , you can get your title listed on Amazon .
The one thing that hung me up in terms of reprinting my two old novels was that I did n’t have them in electronic form , and I had the impression that scanning them through some OCR ( optical character recognition ) software would be fairly painful and time - consuming .
So I arranged for the company E - Reads to put The Sex Sphere and Spacetime Donuts into POD and ebook form , including the Amazon Kindle format .
To make the E - Reads editions look nice , I made a painting for each of them , and I got my daughter Georgia Rucker to incorporate these paintings into covers .
Georgia is a professional graphic designer ( see her site , www.grfix.com ) , and the books look great — you can find links to them on Amazon or on the E - Reads site .
The process has n’t been entirely smooth , as E - Reads has had some trouble arranging for the proper printing of the covers in the POD edition , but I think that will be ironed out quite soon .
Working with E - Reads , I did n’t have quite as much control over the book ’s appearance as I would have liked , and I still had a yen to create a book all by myself .
So I went ahead and designed a book of my paintings called Better Worlds , and I made it available in POD format on the Lulu site .
I have n’t actually purchased an ISBN for Better Worlds yet , but I might still do that so I can get it listed on Amazon .
SPR : Why did you choose to self - publish your art book , Better Worlds , rather than looking for a publisher of art books ?
You ’re an established writer , so you ’re in a better position than most .
RR : Although I ’m a well - known writer , I have zero reputation as a painter , and I was daunted by the prospect of trying to approach serious art world publishers .
Also I liked the idea of very rapidly getting the book all designed and , in some sense , into print .
Those who ’ve put together photo books as gifts know how this feels .
By the way , I did n’t actually use the Lulu photo book templates to design my art book because these templates insist on cropping your pictures to certain fixed aspect ratios .
And my paintings are in all kinds of different width - to - height ratios .
Perhaps some other sites have more flexible photo book formats , I do n’t know .
What I did instead was simply to design the paintings book in Microsoft Word , and to save this file as a PDF file , taking some pains to ensure that the images got saved at a ( non-default ) high resolution of 400 pixels per inch .
And then I uploaded the PDF to Lulu , and that ’s the book , designed exactly the way I want .
A nice thing about this set - up is that every now and then I can redesign the book and add all my most recent paintings !
SPR : Why did you choose Lulu over iUniverse , BookSurge , Wordclay or other print - on - demand outfits ?
Are you pleased with the process and outcome ?
RR : I did a fair amount of online research into the various do - it - yourself POD publishers , and I put up a long blog post about what I learned .
One thing that ’s not so well known is that pretty much all of the different POD publishers use the same printer , which is Lightning Source , owned , I believe , by the Ingram Book Group , who distribute most standard paper books into bookstores .
If you get serious about producing a POD book on your own , I think it ’s possible to declare yourself to be a publisher , and cut a deal with Lightning Source yourself .
My impression is that most of the user - friendly POD publishing companies are fairly similar in terms of services and costs , although some of them seem slanted towards selling expensive editing and promotion packages to the aspiring author — which can easily turn into a vanity - press - style rip - off .
Promoting a self - published book is indeed a problem , but I think one needs to come up with original solutions .
My angle is that over a lifetime of publishing , I ’ve managed to build up a “ brand ” around my name .
And I have a blog which gets quite a few readers .
Not that this works all that well , even for me .
I blogged about Better Worlds , and the superblog BoingBoing picked up my post and mentioned it , and even so , I ’ve only sold about ten copies of Better Worlds to date — sold , that is , to people other than me .
I myself bought a few for Christmas gifts , which was , come to think of it , my original motivation for the project .
But I also think of using the books as promotional devices for getting myself some gallery shows .
Not that I ’ve gotten around to trying this .
For now , I just paint for fun , and I ’m not eager to open up a fresh source of the kind of worry and heartache that writing for commerce brings .
SPR : What ’s your relationship to painting versus writing fiction ?
It ’s great to see the cross-pollination of the painting “ The Sex Sphere ” on the cover of the novel of the same name , but I notice a much different style in your painting than in your novels .
Like “ Welcome to Mars ” ( above ) can be described as a kind of childlike utopia and your novels do n’t really fit that description .
RR : In my own head , my paintings look very much like the scenes in my novels .
Since I ’m known as a cyberpunk , people sometimes imagine that my novels are dark and full of machines , but that ’s not the kind of book I ’m writing these days .
In recent years I ’ve become interested in scenarios where the machines have withered away and been replaced by bio - tweaked plants and animals , or futures where our computational devices have migrated down into the very quantum vibrations of the atoms around us .
And this leads to a world that does in some ways resembles a utopian fantasy landscape .
SPR : You offer your novel , Postsingular , for free online as a Creative Commons download .
What ’s your experience been with people downloading that book compared to people buying other novels through ebook distributors ?
RR : Well , it was Corey Doctorow who talked me into this .
Corey posts all of his novels as free ebooks , that is , as Creative Commons downloads in PDF , HTML , text and other formats — and he does this as soon as the novels come out in print .
He argues that the free ebook release creates enough buzz and reader interest to outweigh any attrition in sales .
And certainly Corey ’s books do sell very well .
So I got my publisher , Tor Books , to give me permission to try this out with Postsingular .
I posted some free ebook versions of the book online at my website , a couple of weeks after Tor printed the hardcover .
This did create some buzz , and I got some interesting fan email .
Like one guy said , “ I just read your novel on my phone , ” and another said , “ I read it on my screen in my cubicle at work . ”
As for the book ’s actual sales , they were , I think , slightly better than my usual average , but not radically better , although we have n’t yet seen any numbers for the trade paperback edition , which just now came out .
So far as I know , Tor does n’t want me to release a free ebook version of the forthcoming Hylozoic , which is a sequel to Postsingular .
I would n’t mind doing one — after all , writers want first and foremost to be read — but there ’s also an argument along the lines of , “ We hooked them with a freebie , now let ’s make them pay . ”
In any case , the hardback of Hylozoic comes out at the beginning of June , 2009 , and by then we ’ll have decided about any possible free ebook edition .
By the way , in addition to those reprints I was talking about , a couple of my novels are available as commercial ebooks to buy , and we really have n’t seen jack in sales — we ’re selling dozens of ebooks , not thousands .
At least until recently , most people have been utterly unwilling to buy ebooks , although plenty of people are happy to read free ebooks .
Of course it could be that with devices like the Kindle , this is going to change .
SPR : You ’re a visionary who writes incredibly inventive tales about how technology might inform our lives in the future .
What do you think self - publishing might be like in the near and distant future ?
Are we at the beginning of a radically different future for publishing ?
RR : First let me say something about magazines , and then about books .
For the last couple of years I ’ve been editing and publishing an SF ezine called FLURB at www.flurb.net.
I enjoy doing this , but it ’s strictly a non-commercial labor of love on my part , and on the part of my obliging authors .
Originally I started my ezine because I had a story rejected by some stuffy ezine editor , and I was like , “ Screw this , why not do it myself ? ”
The self - publisher ’s mantra .
As it turns out , FLURB has done pretty well — there were n’t any other SF ezines with quite my kind of sensibility .
The upside of an ezine is that there ’s virtually no expense for the publisher , the downside is that there ’s no income .
The upside of no income is that there ’s no bookkeeping , the downside is that I ca n’t pay money to extract more commercial efforts from my authors .
But the upside of being non-commercial is that I ’m closer to the realm of revolutionary art , which is a place that I like to be .
The commercial models for ezines are sidebar ads , pay - per-view , paid subscriptions , or begging the readers for spare change .
The downsides of these approaches is that you might block out a large number of casual readers or that you might not ( in the case of ads or begging ) make enough money to make it worthwhile degrading the experience of the ezine .
And , as I mentioned , if you do have a tiny trickle of income , then you have to figure out how to share it with the authors .
By the way , I once tried having sidebar ads on my blog , and , because I sometimes discuss philosophical topics , I was getting ads from born - again evangelists and right - wing pundits , which really was n’t worth the income of , like , nineteen cents a day .
At some point , taking sidebar ads can feel like being a very cheap prostitute .
But the sidebar - ad model does work for massively trafficked sites like BoingBoing .
Okay , so what about books ?
For an author , the value - added for going to a traditional paper publisher has been ( a ) they pay you an advance , ( b ) they edit and design the book , ( c ) they distribute the book , and ( d ) they promote it .
But now suppose that you ’re dealing with a publisher who plans to produce your books only in POD and ebook formats .
And for sure there will be more and more publishers like this in the years to come .
As I mentioned above , a reasonably computer - literate person can form their own “ press ” and publish POD and ebook formats themselves .
In this case , ( a ) the author gets no advance , but gets a bigger cut of any profits down the line , ( b ) edits and designs the book on his or her own , possibly with the help of friends , ( c ) distributes it through exactly the same channels as the publisher would have , and ( d ) tries to promote it .
Really , the biggest hang - ups are no advance and no promotion .
Even if only for the advances , there will always be a place for publishers .
Although self - publishing might theoretically earn you more money in the long run , there ’s nothing like getting a substantial check soon after finishing your book .
It often takes five years or longer before an author ’s royalties earn out the amount of the advance .
And it ’s not unusual for a publisher to advance an author more money than the book ends up earning ( and , no , the author does n’t have to pay back the money from an overly generous advance ) .
Advances are a big deal .
Re : promotion , for mid-list writers like me , promotional media advertising is n’t really a factor .
My publishers mention each of my novels in a multi- book ad in the SF trade zine Locus , and that ’s about it .
But they do send out review copies .
Of course a self - publisher can send out ebook review copies for no cost — but this is really a mass spam ad .
And reviewers are , of necessity , adept at ignoring spam .
Having a commercial publisher lends credibility .
That is , if my book comes out under the aegis of a familiar publisher , people feel assured that the work is of professional quality — as opposed to being the maunderings of a senile madman .
Over time , it could be that a highly respected social network arises , a place where certain self - published books can be given a stamp of approval .
But here , of course you ’re again faced with the problem of promoting your book to the people who use this network .
It ’s a tricky problem , and the inevitable mathematical fact is that the little guys get very few sales .
The thing is , there ’s so many books , and so little time to read , that people are very harsh in pruning down .
For awhile people had this utopian belief in a “ long tail ” model , under which even the most arcane and niche - oriented book would sell a few copies .
But this was only speculation .
It might turn out that , starting at a certain point not all that far out along the tail , the only self - published book sales are to the authors ’ friends and relatives .
Which is n’t a complete disaster .
If the people you hang around with have all gotten a copy of your book — well , that ’s not so bad .
Back in the realm of commerce , one area where POD and ebook publication really seems to make sense to me is when I ’m talking about a book that for whatever reason is not feasible to publish in print .
Suppose , for instance , that I wanted to publish my cumulative journals , written in electronic form over the last twenty years .
This would weigh in at maybe half a million words , and if printed , might run to seven volumes .
I ’d be lucky to sell a few hundred of these sets .
But if I published the journals as an ebook , I can see people electronically flipping through it as a casual entertainment .
They might use it as a book of divination , like the I Ching !
Another thought .
I ’m a dedicated blogger , and over the last few years , my blog has replaced my journal in my life .
The difference is that my blog is profusely illustrated , and it contains a lot of hyperlinks .
I could see eventually publishing my cumulative blog as an ebook as well .
Of course , in a sense , my blog already is a hyperlinked ebook , in that you can access all of it online .
But I think it would have a different feel if I wrapped it up into a single file that you could dip into offline .
And the big win would be that I could make the pictures larger and with photo - quality resolution , so the blog would take on more the quality of an art book .
As for the external links in my cumulative blog — it is possible to preserve hyperlinks in , say , a PDF document .
I think that , in the future , most ebooks will be likely to have hyperlink tendrils reaching into the broader world .
SPR : This is great – “ The upside of being non-commercial is that I ’m closer to the realm of revolutionary art , which is a place that I like to be . ”
Thanks a lot for taking the time .
Oyvind sez , " Some weeks ago , NRK – Norwegian Broadcasting – signed a deal with music rights holder organisation TONO in Norway .
The new deal gives NRK right to publish podcasts of all previously broadcasted radio- and tv-programs that contains less then 70 % music .
Podcast containing music may be up for four weeks , while our podcast without music stay up on our server forever .
One result of this deal , is that we now can publish ' Vår daglige Beatles ' – ' Our Daily Beatles ' in English – as a podcast .
In this series from 2001 , journalists Finn Tokvam og Bård Ose tells the story of every single Beatles tracks ever made , chronologically .
Each episode contains a 3 minute story about each track ( sadly for our international visitors – in Norwegian ) and the actual Beatles tune .
This is – as far as we know – the first time you can download the Beatles ' music legally .
Neither iTunes nor Amazon have The Beatles in their music stores . "
Last ned alt av " The Beatles " – og historien om hver enkelt låt
( Thanks , Oyvind ! )
From the ' well where else would you host from ? ' files : InternetNews.com has learned that a new survey set for official release on January 20th will report that 40 percent of open source project developers are planning on cloud deployments for their projects .
The data comes from a survey of 360 developers conducted in November 2008 by Evans Data .
The biggest winner in terms of what cloud service developers plan to use is Google 's App Engine at 28 percent of respondents .
Amazon came in second at 15 percent .
Not surprisingly developers 52 percent of developer claimed to be using a virutalized Linux environment and over half are using the MySQL database .
It all seem fairly obvious to me .
Apps Engine is free so it makes for an easy choice to get started with the cloud , though Google does not use MySQL for its database back end - instead App Engine uses Big Tables ( which frankly I still do n't quite understand how to use as well as MySQL ) .
The cloud after all is really what ?
A fancy new term for distributed hosting ?
It makes sense to want to offer apps as a service and it makes sense to want to do it cheaply on massively scalable platforms like Google and Amazon .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A number of atheists and non-religious organizations want Barack Obama 's inauguration ceremony to leave out all references to God and religion .
President - elect Barack Obama will use the Bible Abraham Lincoln used for his inauguration .
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Washington , the plaintiffs demand that the words " so help me God " not be added to the end of the president 's oath of office .
In addition , the lawsuit objects to plans for ministers to deliver an invocation and a benediction in which they may discuss God and religion .
An advance copy of the lawsuit was posted online by Michael Newdow , a California doctor and lawyer who has filed similar and unsuccessful suits over inauguration ceremonies in 2001 and 2005 .
Joining Newdow in the suit are groups advocating religious freedom or atheism , including the American Humanist Association , the Freedom from Religion Foundation and atheist groups from Minnesota ; Seattle , Washington ; and Florida .
The new lawsuit says in part , " There can be no purpose for placing ' so help me God ' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to God , other than promoting the particular point of view that God exists . "
Newdow said references to God during inauguration ceremonies violate the Constitution 's ban on the establishment of religion .
Newdow and other plaintiffs say they want to watch the inaugural either in person or on television .
As atheists , they contend , having to watch a ceremony with religious components will make them feel excluded and stigmatized .
" Plaintiffs are placed in the untenable position of having to choose between not watching the presidential inauguration or being forced to countenance endorsements of purely religious notions that they expressly deny , " according to the lawsuit .
Among those named in the lawsuit are Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts , who is expected to swear in the new president ; the Presidential Inauguration Committee ; the Joint Congressional Committee on Inauguration Ceremonies and its chairwoman , Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California ; and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee and its commander , Maj. Gen. Richard Rowe Jr.
The two ministers scheduled to participate in the ceremony also are named : the Rev. Rick Warren and the Rev. Joseph Lowery .
The document includes a quotation from Warren on atheists : " I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says , ' I do n't need God . ' "
Newdow told CNN that he did n't name President - elect Barack Obama in the suit because in addition to participating as a government official at the ceremony , he possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs .
" If he chooses to ask for God 's help , I 'm not going to challenge him , " Newdow said .
" I think it 's unwise . "
Newdow said that as a member of a racial minority , Obama should have respect for atheists , who also are members of a minority .
Newdow said religious references in the inauguration ceremony send a message to non-believers .
" The message here is , we who believe in God are the righteous , the real Americans , " he said .
Newdow said it 's unconstitutional to imply that atheists and others are not as good .
He acknowledged that his suit is unlikely to be successful .
" I have no doubt I 'll lose , " he said , adding that he hoped to eventually succeed through appeals and hoped future inauguration ceremonies would exclude religious references .

ROME , Italy ( CNN ) -- Police Wednesday arrested the suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad following a two - day manhunt after he eluded police by crawling through sewer pipes , according to Italian media reports .
Italian police examine a sewer that may have offered an escape route for a suspected mafia boss .
Giuseppe Setola , 38 , was arrested near Caserta north of Naples , according to Italy 's state - run ANSA news agency and reports in the La Repubblica and Corriere Della Sera newspapers .
" This is a great moment for the ( Italian ) state , " Naples anti-Mafia prosecutor Franco Roberti told ANSA after Setola 's arrest .
" We were certain ( Setola ) was in a situation of great difficulty .
We promised all the citizens that he would be caught .
We have kept that promise . "
Setola is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples on Monday , as police closed in on him , according to the reports .
That tunnel connects to the sewer system in Caserta .
Corriere published photos of anti-mafia police searching through what was described as Setola 's trash - strewn bunker and the tunnel .
Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months , and had already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew , according to the reports .
Monday was the third time he avoided arrest .
Setola is allegedly the head of a killing team run by the powerful Casalesi clan which belongs to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra .
He got out of jail last spring after a doctor ruled that he was legally blind .
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into that ruling .
Corriere published a photo of Setola wearing sunglasses with his left eye bandaged .
Do n't Miss Corriere del Mezzogiorno
The Casalesi clan is featured in the best - selling book " Gomorrah " -- a play on the word " Camorra " -- written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection .
Saviano recently said he may have to leave Italy to escape constant death threats from the mafia and its supporters .
Police began cracking down on Setola and his colleagues after the murder of six West African immigrants in the nearby town of Castel Volturno in September .
After those killings , the Italian government activated the army to help bolster efforts against the Casalesi clan , which is believed to have killed more than 20 people since May .
The two suspected members of his squad have given police information about his movements .
In November , police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations .
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s minority Conservative government may seek the temporary suspension of Parliament to stop opposition parties from voting it out and taking power , an aide to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Tuesday .

The Liberals , New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois signed a deal on Monday committing them to bringing down the government , just seven weeks after it won re-election with a strengthened minority , and forming a coalition government to replace the Conservatives .
The formal agreement quickly triggered one of the worst political crises in Canada ’s history .
The opposition -- which says Harper is not doing enough to tackle the fallout from the financial crisis -- proposed forging a formal coalition of Liberals and New Democrats , with the separatist Bloc promising its support .
The Harper aide , describing the proposed deal with the separatists as “ an affront to our democracy ( and ) incredibly dangerous ” for Canada , said the government would fight the coalition plan “ with every legal means at our disposal ” .
This could involve asking Governor General Michaelle Jean -- the personal representative of Queen Elizabeth , Canada ’s head of state -- to temporarily suspend Parliament , he said .
Jean , who is in Prague on a state visit , said she would cut short her trip to try to resolve the crisis .
“ I have decided that it is time for me now to go back home because my presence is required , ” she told Reuters .
Earlier she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that the drama “ certainly requires a lot of attention ” .
Jean mainly plays a figurehead role .
That said , her word is final when dealing with constitutional matters .
Harper told Parliament that the coalition deal was “ the worst mistake the Liberal Party has ever made in its history ” .
Conservative legislators chanted “ Shame , shame ” at the opposition during an often charged session of Parliament .
“ The highest principle of Canadian democracy is that if you want to be prime minister , you get your mandate from the Canadian people , not the separatists , ” said Harper .
Dion shouted back : “ Every member of this House has received a mandate from the Canadian people ...
The prime minister does n’t have the support of this House any more . ”
The Harper aide said political rallies would be held to protest against the proposed coalition and said Harper might make a national televised address .
The Conservatives also released two radio ads , one of which said : “ This is Canada .
Power must be earned -- not taken . ”
BUDGET PROMISED FOR JAN . 27
Harper -- facing his worst crisis since first winning power in January 2006 -- has promised a budget for January 27 and could seek to shut down Parliament until then .

If Harper lets the confidence vote go ahead , he would face a strong likelihood of losing .
The Canadian capital has not seen such tension and political uncertainty since a failed 1995 referendum in Quebec on whether the province should break away from Canada .
Under their coalition plan , the opposition parties promise to present a major economic stimulus package as well as help for the struggling auto industry .
The parties said the new prime minister would be Dion , who led his party to such a bad defeat on October 14 that he has promised to quit once members choose a replacement in May .
The proposed coalition government would stay in power until at least June 30 , 2010 .
Media reaction has been largely negative .
Columnist John Ivison of the National Post said the coalition would mean Canada becoming “ the world ’s coldest banana republic ” .
The Globe and Mail , which endorsed Harper in the election , ran a lead article savaging what it called his “ horrendous miscalculations ” and suggested he consider quitting .
It also said Dion was “ a humbled and defeated party leader ... ( who ) has never earned the right to govern . ”
The Conservatives hold 143 of the 308 seats in the House of Commons and need the support of at least one opposition party to remain in power .
The Liberals have 77 , the Bloc has 49 and the NDP has 37 .
There are two independents .
Armed robbers — some dressed in drag — made off with $ 100 million in loot from a lightning - fast jewelry store theft in central Paris , in what police Friday called one of France 's costliest jewel heists .
Three or four thieves swiped rings , necklaces and luxury watches from display cases at the Harry Winston store near the Champs - Elysees , a police official said .
They brandished handguns and threatened about 15 employees , hitting some on the head with guns , the official said .
At least two of the bandits were men wearing wigs and dressed as women , at times spoke a foreign language , and knew employees ' names , the official said .
After the theft , the robbers fled .
The official , who was not authorized to be publicly named according to agency policy , said it was among France 's biggest - ever jewel thefts .
New York - based Harry Winston said in a statement : " We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation .
Our first concern is the well - being of our employees . "
A spokeswoman for the company would not provide further details on the theft .
It was unclear whether anyone was injured .
The boutique , on the expensive Avenue Montaigne , was closed to the public Friday .
Three of the five display windows stood empty of their usual wares .
The store was targeted in a similar theft in October 2007 , when three people forced employees to open safes and hand over euro10 million worth of jewels .
A security monitoring group for the French jewelry industry has reported a 20 percent rise in armed robberies this year over last , with 132 incidents in the first 11 months of 2008 .
In London , police have reported a recent rise in holdups of security vans .
Police say it could be linked to the credit crunch and predict the trend to continue as Christmas approaches .
In at least two conversations during the investigation , Dritan complained to Omar that when he and his friends went to the Poconos and shot guns at a firing range , they never had enough weapons .
He said that he hated to wait , and that having more guns would solve that problem .
The STEREO ( Ahead ) spacecraft observed this visually stunning prominence eruption on Sept. 29 , 2008 in the 304 wavelength of extreme UV light .
It rose up and cascaded to the right over several hours , appearing something like a flag unfurling , as it broke
NASA 's twin STEREOspacecraft are offering the first glimpse of the far side of the sun , the spaceagency announced today .
The two spacecraft , launched Oct. 25 , 2006 , are beaming back over - the - horizon images " thathave researchers and forecasters glued to their monitors , " according to astatement .
" This is a perspectivewe 've never had before , " says STEREO mission scientist Lika Guhathakurtaof NASA headquarters .
" We 're now monitoring more than 270 degrees of solarlongitude - that 's 3/4ths of the star . "
Just in time
Because the sun rotates , all of it is seen from Earth over time .
But at any given time , only half of thestar is visible .
Scientists who monitorsolar eruptions and the space storms they hurl toward Earth are eager tomonitor the whole star 24/ 7 .
Seeing storms on the far side , which is of coursejust as bright and active as the near side , would improve forecastingabilities .
" After all these years , " Guhathakurta quipped , " we 're finally getting to see the dark side of thesun . "
Since the two STEREOspacecraft went into orbit around the sun at the beginning of 2007 , they havebeen slowly drifting apart from Earth , and from each other .
They are now 90 degrees apart .
They will be in their final positions on Feb.
6 , 2011 , hovering 180 degrees apart and imaging the entire sun all the time .
That timing willmatch with the next expected peak in solar activity .
The sun is at a low pointin it 's 11 - year cycle of activity now .
But over the next few years , sunspotswill become more common and flaresmore frequent .
The peak will likely occur in 2012 .
Dangerous solar storms canhappen anytime , however .
A major one , thought to occur every 100 years or so , could debilitate communication and power systems on Earth , according to aNational Academy of Sciences reportearlier this month .
Already better
Because of the way the sunspins , STEREO - B gets a sneak preview of sunspots and coronal holes before theyrotate around and face Earth .
" I know forecasters atNOAA 's Space Weather Prediction Center monitor STEREO - B very closely , " said Chris St. Cyr of the Goddard Space Flight Center .
" It lets them knowwhat 's coming . "
Already , STEREO - B enjoys a3 - day look - ahead advantage over Earth - based observatories .
No images were releasedtoday .
However , the probes are equipped with sensors that measure the speed , direction and composition of the solar wind ; receivers that pick up radioemissions from explosions and shock waves in the sun 's atmosphere ; telescopesthat image the solar surface and all the tempests that rage there ; and coronagraphsto monitor events in the sun 's outer atmosphere .
" So , really , " says Guhathakurta , " we 're not only seeing the sun 's dark side , we 'refeeling , tasting and listening to it as well . "

Begin proofing !
“ Proofreading is vitally important , hard to do well , and tedious as hell . ”
~ Brian Clark
That ’s the best quote I ’ve ever heard about proofreading , but I ’d like to extend Brian ’s remarks a bit .
In fact , I ’ve got 14 tips just about guaranteed to make you a better proofreader , and maybe make the task a tad less terrible .
Ready ?
You ’re still watching for those typos , right ?
# 1 : Assume a proofreader mindset .
Proofreading is tedious , but so is exercise .
Who really wants to do 25 pushups , right ?
I do n’t .
But , imagine someone challenged you to do them .
Would you refuse the test and let the antagonist think he won ?
Or , would you take the challenge to prove him wrong ?
I ’m betting you ’d take the challenge and you ’d no longer think pushups were tedious either .
Your mind would be in a different place where resolve , confidence , and a heightened sense of attention and focus replaced the tedium .
You ’d be in the zone and you ’d finish the set with perfect form to prove your worth .
Well , why not transfer this mindset toward your proofreading ?
In fact , you may already be in that mindset .
In the first sentence of this post I challenged you to find 25 misspelled words ( I lied ; there are n’t any ) .
Up to this point , you were reading differently than you normally read were n’t you ?
You were progressing at a slower pace , paying extra attention to detail , and most important , inspecting every word instead of scanning .
You were proofreading instead of reading .
You examined every word because I challenged you to .
So , why not challenge yourself by imagining that errors exist in everything you write ?
Presto , you now have the proper mindset to become a great proofreader .
Now you ’re ready to take your imagination even further by using our next tip .
# 2 : Think book deal , baby !
How tedious would proofing be if you knew you had a book deal coming ?
Instead of an antagonist challenging you , the thought of being a published writer would automatically make proofing more appealing and less of a chore .
So , before you hit that publish button for your posts , imagine you ’re the proofreader and that ’s the last time anybody will proof your work before millions of eyes see it .
Now your mind is right , but you still need concrete tools to complete your transformation .
Proofreading is hard to do well … without a routine .
Proofreading well is tough , but getting in the habit of following the remaining tips will help you overcome the challenge .
# 3 : Read and write every day .
Sounds too simple and unrelated to work properly , but it does .
Like magic , the more you read ( while using tip # 1 ) the easier proofreading becomes .
The more you write , the less you repeat common writing errors .
If you hate writing , or reading , or both , you can change this with our next nifty tip .
# 4 : If you hate to write , write about something you hate .
If you hate to read , read about something you love .
Sometimes it ’s easier to write about something that gets your dander up , like politics .
So , even though you may love writing within your current niche , as a writing exercise , choose a topic that frustrates you to no end and witness the ease of releasing emotion onto paper .
Reading is different .
Reading is easier for me when I genuinely love the subject matter .
Since love is an attentive emotion , it leads to longer periods of concentration .
And since all bloggers read other blogs they love , it makes sense to practice our next tip .
# 5 : Practice Proof–Love with other bloggers .
Bloggers already practice link–love between each other , so why not offer to proof each other ’s posts before they go live ?
It ’s simple human nature that proofing someone else ’s work will increase the desire not to miss anything , and doing so is great proofing practice .
# 6 : Write …run away … then read .
After you finish writing , walk , run , or jog away from your screen before you start proofreading .
Fixing everything at once will only allow errors to fool your eyes into believing they do n’t exist .
Take a break , and come back with your well - rested proofreader mindset .
You ’ll be happy you did , and you ’ll be ready for our next tip .
# 7 : Slow down !
We touched on this with the first tip , but it ’s important enough to explain further .
Try reading at a slower pace than you normally do .
If you can read a whole blog post in two minutes , try doing it in three minutes when you proofread .
Act as though you are trying to explain the text to someone that did n’t quite understand it the first time you spoke it to them .
# 8 : Read aloud , and read silently if time permits .
In a quiet setting , read your post aloud ( and silently if possible ) .
If you do n’t have time for both , I would suggest reading aloud , since your mouth has to voice each word and your ears pick up the errors better than your mind sensing errors as you read silently .
If you ’re lucky enough to have another person nearby when you ’ve finished writing , use the next tip .
# 9 : Have someone else read your post .
Find anybody who can read , ( English major not required ) and have them proofread your post .
Chances are they will spot silly errors you missed , even if you proofed your post twice .
Someone unfamiliar with your post wo n’t have preconceived notions of how it should sound , so they wo n’t subconsciously gloss over any mistakes .
They ’ll also let you know if your story makes sense , which is a great measure of how your blog audience might perceive your post .
And speaking of perceptions , our next tip is critical toward those .
# 10 : Avoid the passive voice .
Look out for any form of to be .
Examples : is , are , am , was , were , has been , have been , had been , will be , can be , should be , would be .
In your word processor , do a search for each of the words above .
If verbs follow them , it ’s probably a passive voice sentence that you should rewrite .
Incorrect passive voice example : Some errors are missed by proofreaders .
Corrected active voice example : Proofreaders miss some errors .
You ’re trying to be an authority to your readers , so write with authority .
Using your word processor ’s find functionality in this manner will help you tremendously and will come in handy for our next tip .
# 11 : Keep a list of words you misspell .
Some words are hard not to spell incorrectly .
Keep a list of such words and do a search and destroy for them .
For example , I would always put an s on the end of toward , so I always search for this word to see if I butchered it again .
To check your misspelled words , as well as general writing guidelines , you ’ll need some resources in case you forget .
# 12 : Keep reference resources nearby .
Master the rules and reference them when you forget .
Do so with offline and online resources such as Merriam - Webster , The Little , Brown Handbook , and The Elements of Style to name a few .
If you learn to love the rules of writing , you ’ll love reading these references time and again , and your proofing will dramatically improve .
Remember that proofreading is vitally important … for authority .
Take proofreading lightly and blog readers may remind you of our next proofreading tip .
# 13 : Avoid copy errors or blog readers may take back the authority they loaned you .
Content marketing makes you a subject matter expert .
It makes you a perceived authority in your niche .
Silly typos detract from that authority .
Proofreading errors are pimples on a face and scratches on a new car — unwanted blemishes distracting from the underlying qualities of the subject matter .
Would you rather have pimples or a clean face ?
Would you buy a new car with scratches on the paint ?
If one sale walks away due to proofreading errors , that ’s one too many , which leads us to our final proofreading tip .
# 14 : Bloggers should devote an amount of time to proofreading that , at the very least , equates to the value of one lost sale .
If you sell gumballs for 3 cents each , you obviously wo n’t be as concerned with proofreading as the blogger who sells yachts , but do try to spend a proportionate amount of time practicing the proofreading craft .
Over time , these 14 tips will transform your proofreading efforts .
No , they wo n’t make you perfect .
They have n’t made me ; I miss an occasional MahSteaK , but practicing them will certainly make you better prepared than the clients who hire me .
This snippet adds simple partial support to your templates .
You can pass data to the partial , and use it as you would in a regular template .
It is different from Django 's { % include %} , because it allows you to pass a custom variable ( context ) , instead of reusing the same context for the included template .
This decouples the templates from each other and allows for their greater reuse .
The attached code needs to go into templatetags folder underneath your project .
The usage is pretty simple - { % load ... %} the tag library , and use { % partial_template template - name data %} in your template .
This will result in template passed as template - name to be loaded from partials folder .
The .html extension will be appended to the file name .
The file has to be in one of template paths accessible to the loader ) and rendered with data as its context .
The data is available in the template as an item context variable .
You can find more information in the relevant Django documentation
Designing and building data driven dynamic web applications the one web , domain driven , RESTful , open , linked data way
For the past few months I 've been touting a presentation around the BBC entitled ' How we make websites ' .
It 's a compendium of everything our team has learned from long years developing / programmes , the recent work on / music and the currently in development /events .
As a warning there 's very little original thinking in here .
For those familiar with the concept of one web , the importance of persistent URIs , REST , Domain Driven Design and Linked Open Data it'll probably be old news .
Possibly it 's interesting to see all these threads tied up in one place !?!
Maybe it 's interesting to see them all from a user experience point of view ?!?
Anyway , as ever , it 's built on the thinking and achievements of many clever people over many years who are too numerous to mention here .
Although obviously I 'll make an exception for Paul Clifford and TimBL . :)
The presentation is here and the ( slightly ) expanded text is below for the sake of accessibility and Google .
Explore the domain
This should be clear from the business requirements - it might be food or music or gardening or ...
Employ a domain expert .
Get them to sketch their world and sketch back at them .
Concentrate on modelling real ( physical and metaphysical ) things not web pages - try to blank from your mind all thoughts of the resulting web site .
This work should never stop - you need to do this through the lifetime of the project as you refine your understanding .
Identify your domain objects and the relationships between them
As you chat and sketch with your domain expert you should build up a picture of the types of things they 're concerned with .
Make a list of these objects .
As your knowledge of the domain increases you 'll build up a picture of how your objects interlink .
You can sketch basic entity relationship diagrams with your domain expert and keep sketching until the picture clears .
Bear in mind you 're trying to capture the domain ontology - this is n't about sketching database schemas .
The resulting domain model will inform the rest of your project and should be one of the few artifacts your project ever creates .
Check your domain model with users
Run focus groups and speak to users .
Get them to sketch their understanding of the domain and again sketch back at them .
After several round trips you should be able to synthesise the expert model and the user model .
User - centric design starts here - if you choose to model things and relationships between those things that users can't easily comprehend no amount of wireframes or personaes or storyboards will help you out .
Check to see if your website already deals with some of your domain objects
If it does then reuse this functionality by linking to these pages - you do n't want to mint new URIs for existing objects .
Having more than one page per thing confuses users and confuses Google .
Try to think of your website as a coherent whole ; not as a collection of individual products .
And as ever , do n't expose your internal organisational structures through your website .
Users do n't care about departments or reporting lines .
The glory will always come from building skyscrapers - the real challenge lies in decent town planning .
It 's more difficult to build new services that stitch into your site and stitch into the web than build shiny , shrink wrapped , self contained products .
Design your database
Translate your domain model into a physical database schema .
Source your data
Check if there are business systems in your organisation able to populate your schema .
Check if there are existing websites outside your organisation you can use to populate your schema .
Give preferential treatment to any websites that offer their data under a liberal licencing agreement - you can buy in data to help you slice and dice your own data but if you do this you might not be able to provide an open data API without giving away the 3rd party 's business model .
If your organisation AND an open data website can provide the data , consider the danger in minting new identifiers for your own data - can you easily link out / can you easily get links in ?
Data licensing is one of those areas that often gets ignored in project planning .
If you fail to consider it or get it wrong it can severely curtail your plans further down the line .
Pipe in your data
Whether you choose to use your business data or buy data or use open data you 'll need a way of piping it into your database schema .
You 'll probably have to reshape it to make it suitable for publishing .
Make your models
In an MVC framework your models should contain all your business logic .
This mean they should capture all the constraints of your database schema plus all the extra constraints implied by your domain model .
Design your URI schema
Your URI schema should follow naturally from your domain model .
As an example if you 're dealing with books and a book can have many authors then ../: book / authors should list all the authors of that book .
At Audio and Music we tend to use large walls and lots of post-its to design our URIs .
Add some string to show links and journeys and there 's no need to ever draw another site map .
This is n't just about designing URIs for resources you link to - sometimes your pages will be made up of other transcluded resources - all of these subsidiary resources should be addressable too .
It means you can easily change your user experience layer by taking out transcluded resources and linking to them instead or removing links and transcluding .
By making every nugget of content addressable you allow other sites to link to it , improve your bookmarkability and increase your SEO - cf. an individual ' tweet ' .
Bear in mind that some representations ( specifically mobile ) will need smaller , more fragmented representations with lower page weight - designing your subsidiary resources to be addressable allows you to easily deal with this requirement - transclude the content on a desktop machine , link to it on a mobile .
This is where we begin to talk about one web and REST .
Each thing should be one resource with one URI - the representation you get back ( whether desktop HTML or mobile XHTML MP or RDF or YAML or JSON ) should depend on what your user agent asks for via content negotiation .
It means I can send a link to a friend from a desktop machine , they can click on that link from a mobile and they 'll get back a representation appropriate to their device .
Or vice versa .
One web with no mobile ghetto .
It 's important not to confuse URI design with site structure and user journeys .
If you 're used to working on hierarchical silo sites then the URI structure often determines the navigation .
This is n't true here .
Think of the individual resources as tent poles - the user journeys are the canvas that gets draped over later .
It 's nice if URIs are human readable .
It 's also nice if they 're hackable .
It 's an absolute prerequisite that they 're persistent .
Do n't sacrifice persistence for the sake of prettiness or misguided SEO .
URIs are your promise to the web and your users - if you change them or change their meaning you break that promise - links break , bookmarks break , citations break and your search engine juice is lost .
Remember : Cool URIs do n't change .
Make hello world pages for your primary domain objects
For now all they need is an h1 with the title of the object .
Make hello world pages for your primary aggregations
For now all they need is an h1 with the title of the aggregation and a linked list of things aggregated .
Define the data you need to build each of your pages
Traditional wireframes lump together data requirements ( via annotations ) , page layout and ( by implication ) document design .
It 's best to split these out into 3 distinct tasks .
The first task is to define the data requirements .
For each URI define the data needed to build all representations of the thing .
Just because the HTML representation does n't need to show the updated date does n't mean the RSS or Atom or RDF do n't need it .
Some resources will transclude others .
There 's no need to define the data required for these - just reference the transcluded resource .
Build up your HTML pages and other representations
Now you know what data you need you can begin to surface this in your representations .
If you 're working in HTML make sure you design your document to be semantically correct and accessible .
Try not to think about page layout - that 's the job of CSS not markup .
Document design should be independent of page layout .
In general your page should be structured into title , content , navigation - screen readers do n't want to fight through calendar tables etc to get to the content .
Add caching and search sitemaps
Knowing what can be cached and for how long is a vital part of designing your user experience .
Cache for too long and pages go stale .
Do n't cache for long enough and you send unnecessary traffic across the wires and place extra strain on your application .
Cached pages will also be faster and smoother to render in a browser .
And if your users are paying for data on a mobile every extra connection means bigger bills , which is definitely a user experience issue .
An example : if you 're creating a schedule page for today 's TV you want to cache for performance reasons but you do n't want to cache it for too long since schedules are subject to change .
But you can cache yesterday 's schedule more aggressively and last week 's schedule more aggressively still .
Creating XML search sitemaps helps search engines know which bits of your site have been updated .
Which helps them to know which bits to re-index .
Which helps to make your content more findable .
Apply layout CSS
Add layout CSS to your HTML pages .
Experiment with different layouts for your markup by moving elements around the page .
You 're wireframing !
Test and iterate
You should be testing with real users at every stage of development but it 's particularly important to conduct usability AND accessibility tests now .
It 's like testing traditional wireframes but you 're testing on the real application with real application behaviours and real data ( no lorum ipsum nonsense ) .
Sometimes the results of your testing will require changes to layout CSS , sometimes to markup , sometimes to the data you need to surface and sometimes to the underlying domain / data model .
Bear in mind if you 're using data from existing business systems there may need to be heavy investment to make changes to that data model and employ the staff to admin those changes .
Occasionally it might even mean renegotiating contracts with outside data providers .
All design and usability issues are fixable - some just need more lawyers than others : )
Apply decor CSS
Over the top of your wireframe application you can now start to add visual design and branding .
This is exactly the same process as taking a paper wireframe and applying design treatments over the top except you 're mainly working in CSS .
Experiment with different treatments - see how far you can stretch the design with the markup given .
Sometimes you 'll need to add additional markup to hook your CSS off .
Now 's the time to add background imagery for headers , dividers , buttons , list items etc so best to open Photoshop / Illustrator to make your design assets .
And test and iterate
Never stop testing .
Remember that personas are just abstractions of people - it 's always better to use real people .
Ideally you should be able to adjust your code / markup / CSS to respond to user requests .
If you can afford the recruitment / developer time there 's no better way to test than with a user sitting alongside a developer - the developer can react to user requests , tweak the application and gain instant feedback without the ambiguity that sometimes comes from test reports .
Again you should accessibility test - some of the design / decor changes may affect font sizes etc - make sure your users can still read the page .
Add any JavaScript / AJAX
By designing your browsable site first and adding in Javascript / AJAX over the top you stand a better chance of making an accessible web site - one that degrades gracefully .
As ever Google et al are your least able users - search bots do n't like forms or JavaScript - sites that degrade well for accessibility also degrade well for search engines .
Making every subsidiary resource addressable and providing these resources serialised as XML or JSON makes adding AJAX relatively trivial .
You 'll probably need to tweak your CSS to adjust to life with JavaScript / AJAX .
And test and iterate
Again test your site for accessibility and usability with JavaScript turned on and off .
Continue
Follow the same steps for each development cycle .
Some development cycles will just be about surfacing new views of the existing domain model ; some will require expanding your domain model .
Now you know your domain model and have made each domain object addressable layering over new views and more subtle user journeys should be trivial .
And keep testing !
The UK Statistics Authority ( UKSA ) has done its bit this week in keeping the government honest , at least when it comes to its use of statistics .
Within 24 hours of the Home Office releasing unverified and selective statistics , despite the protests of government statisticians , Sir Michael Scholar ( chair of the UKSA ) wrote a public letter to the Prime Minister 's Office criticising the government 's actions .
The quick response from the independent body responsible for ensuring the quality of official statistics generated a lot of media attention , not only highlighting the mistakes made in this instance , but also showing the power the UKSA may wield to stop the misuse of statistics .
Only complete and verified figures can show whether knife crime is falling .
The Home Office issued a factsheet on Thursday 11 December highlighting a reduction in knife crime in areas taking part in the Tackling Knives Action Programme .
The factsheet claimed , among other things , that " the number of teenagers admitted to hospital for knife or sharp instrument wounding in nine [...] police force areas fell by 27 per cent according to new figures published today . "
Sir Michael stated , in his letter to Downing Street , that these statistics were not only published before the government statisticians had had the opportunity to fully check the quality of the figures , but also despite the statisticians who produced them and the National Statistician Karen Dunnell trying to stop their " premature , irregular and selective release " .
The UKSA was created in April this year in order to rebuild public trust in government statistics .
A survey of public confidence in statistics in March 2008 found that only one in five people think figures are compiled without political interference , and the UK came last in a 2007 survey within European countries designed to evaluate people 's trust in their governments ’ statistics .
The UKSA does not produce its own statistics , instead it overseas the Office for National Statistics , monitoring and reporting on all official figures produced for the UK .
Official statistics are produced according to the National Statistics Code of Practice covering the collection and analysis of data , confidentiality , presentation and public release of statistics .
As an independent body reporting directly to Parliament ( rather than government ministers ) , the UKSA evaluates the quality of official statistics , and through its online publication hub provides a source of official statistics that aims to be " accessible , clear and free from political bias " .
The government 's release of the knife crime figures breached several National Statistics Code guidelines at once .
According to the Code , figures should be released only when a project has been completed , they should be released in full , and they should be released separately from political comment regarding policy issues .
The government 's knife crime campaign , however , will not be completed until March 2009 , and the published figures , according to Sir Michael , were unchecked and selected to make a political point .
The government 's press release , in which the figures were mentioned , clearly advocates the government campaign , and the release date was chosen to coincide with the launch of the No to knives campaign endorsed by Gorden Brown .
What 's more , the figures were released against the advice of the statisticians involved in producing them and the National Statistician who , according to the Code , should be consulted before publication of any figures .
While opposition politicians were quick to detect the whiff of unashamed spin , Sir Michael , in his letter to Downing Street , pointed out that actions like these are likely to further undermine the public 's trust in statistics .
Yesterday Home Secretary Jacqui Smith apologised for the release of the statistics , admitting that officials had been " too quick off the mark with the publication of one number " relating to knife crime .
Sir Michael said he had received a letter from the prime minister 's office which acknowledged some errors .
Not the unreserved apology statisticians would have wished for , but nevertheless a high - profile acknowledgement of the UKSA 's concerns , and an embarrassing episode for the government .
Perhaps this strong public action by Sir Michael and the UKSA will reassure the public and help to rebuild trust in statistics , despite the government 's actions .
At the very least , debates like these will remind the public that not all statistics are bad and that some simple checks can go a long way when it comes to assessing their quality .
Thanks to the concerted efforts of Martin Pitt , Sebastien Bacher and several others , notify - osd and several related components landed in Jaunty last week .
Thanks very much to all involved !
And thanks to David Barth , Mirco Muller and Ted Gould who lead the development of notify - osd and the related messaging indicator .
MPT has posted an overview of the conceptual framework for “ attention management ” at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotificationDesignGuidelines, which puts ephemeral notification into context as just one of several distinct tools that applications can use when they do n’t have the focus but need to make users aware of something .
That ’s a draft , and when it ’s at 1.0 we ’ll move it to a new site which will host design patterns on Canonical.com .
There is also a detailed specification for our implementation of the notification display agent , notify - osd , which can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD and which defines not only the expected behaviour of notify - osd but also all of the consequential updates we need to make across the packages in main an universe to ensure that those applications use notification and other techniques consistently .
There are at least 35 apps that need tweaking , and there may well be others !
If you find an app that is n’t using notifications elegantly , please add it to the notification design guidelines page , and if you file a bug on the package , please tag it “ notifications ” so we can track these issues in a single consistent way .
Together with notify - osd , we ’ve uploaded a new panel indicator which is used to provide a way to respond to messaging events , such as email and IRC pings .
If someone IM ’s you , then you should see an ephemeral notification , and the messaging indicator will give you a way to respond immediately .
Same for email .
Pidgin and Evolution are the primary focuses of the work , over time we ’ll broaden that to the full complement of IM and email apps in the archive – patches welcome 🙂
There will be rough patches .
Apps which do n’t comply with the FreeDesktop.org spec and send actions on notifications even when the display agent says it does not support them , will have their notifications translated into alerts .
That ’s the primary focus of the effort now , the find and fix those apps .
Also , we know there are several cases where a persistent response framework is required .
The messaging indicator gets most of them , we will have additional persistent tools in place for Karmic in October .

Authors ' Quotes on Psoriasis
After careful review , the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) has declared that Merck 's psoriasis drug ( which actually sounds like a sports car or a dinosaur , not a drug ) is too dangerous to use on humans .
Sales of the drug will now be suspended in Europe following revelations that three patients suffered bizarre brain infections called ( PML ) .

The unique element with handmade shoes is the fact that they are tailored to meet your needs and preferences .
But even then , some shoemakers only produce bespoke footwear and can fashion a pair following a client ’s design , colour , and style preferences to ensure a perfect and comfortable fit .
Compared to the shoes made using machines with no manual input , the handmade shoes offer a kind of comfort that can not be equalled .
And although the handmade footwear tends to be more expensive than their machine - made ones , owning one such pair is a delight for many .
From the comfort to the attention to detail , this handmade footwear is cut above the rest and below are the reasons why .
1. Leather quality
Most of the factory made shoes that are put together using machines tend to be made of cheap quality leather .
As a result , these shoes will develop splits and cracks with a relatively short period .
Moreover , any repairs done to them will not last , and they may lose their shape and fail to mould perfectly to the feet .
Such problems are rare with the handmade shoes since they are made from genuine , premium quality leather for a sturdy build that lasts .
2. Sole
Aside from the use of premium quality leather , the sole of the footwear should be of high quality to offer maximum support and comfort .
The regular formal shoes mostly use soles made from materials that do not provide the same level of cushioning that the rubber soles used in the handmade footwear do .
3. Regular vs. premium shoes
The materials used in making the shoes is what differentiates the premium handmade footwear from the regular shoes .
Every element , right from the leather , lining , and stitching thread and everything else is of high quality , and the design is one of excellence and meant to deliver complete comfort .
4. Machine vs. hands
The making of a pair of shoes has various stages .
For the big manufacturers that have a production line run by machines , will make several shoes with a very short period with no resting periods in the process .
However , for the handmade shoes , the craftsmen take their time to think through every phase of the production process .
As a result , there are no flaws since everything is done meticulously compared to the hurried process that is more about increasing the production rate as opposed to producing quality products .
Other than the above reasons mentioned above , below are some of the top benefits of handmade shoes that make them a better choice :
Perfect fit and comfort – Bespoke shoes are also referred to as “ comfort footwear ” of the material used and how they are made .
They flat rubber soles that allow for even weight distribution , soft inner lining , and flexible yet sturdy leather .
Variety – Handmade footwear can be found in a variety of design , texture , colour and style options for men , women , the youth and children .
Uniqueness and versatility – with handcrafted shoes , you can have the pride of wearing footwear that is of a limited edition without having to spend a lot of money on the designer shoes .
You get to own a unique pair that exudes versatility through its elegance in style and design .
Durability – Quality materials and construction are the primary elements that ensure handmade shoes last long without losing their style or the comfort they provide .
While handmade shoes may be expensive than their counterparts , it is evident from the above information that this handcrafted footwear is the best choice , especially for the quality conscious and discerning individuals .
The Boss Has Gone Mad
169 YEARS before the Gaza War , Heinrich Heine wrote a premonitory poem of 12 lines , under the title “ To Edom ” .
The German - Jewish poet was talking about Germany , or perhaps all the nations of Christian Europe .
This is what he wrote ( in my rough translation ) : “ For a thousand years and more / We have had an understanding / You allow me to breathe / I accept your crazy raging // Sometimes , when the days get darker / Strange moods come upon you /
Till you decorate your claws /
With the lifeblood from my veins //
Now our friendship is firmer / Getting stronger by the day /
Since the raging started in me / Daily more and more like you . ”
Zionism , which arose some 50 years after this was written , is fully realizing this prophesy .
We Israelis have become a nation like all nations , and the memory of the Holocaust causes us , from time to time , to behave like the worst of them .
Only a few of us know this poem , but Israel as a whole lives it out .
In this war , politicians and generals have repeatedly quoted the words : “ The boss has gone mad ! ” originally shouted by vegetable vendors in the market , in the sense of “ The boss has gone crazy and is selling the tomatoes at a loss ! ”
But in the course of time the jest has turned into a deadly doctrine that often appears in Israeli public discourse : in order to deter our enemies , we must behave like madmen , go on the rampage , kill and destroy mercilessly .
In this war , this has become political and military dogma : only if we kill “ them ” disproportionately , killing a thousand of “ them ” for ten of “ ours ” , will they understand that it ’s not worth it to mess with us .
It will be “ seared into their consciousness ” ( a favorite Israeli phrase these days ) .
After this , they will think twice before launching another Qassam rocket against us , even in response to what we do , whatever that may be .
It is impossible to understand the viciousness of this war without taking into account the historical background : the feeling of victimhood after all that has been done to the Jews throughout the ages , and the conviction that after the Holocaust , we have the right to do anything , absolutely anything , to defend ourselves , without any inhibitions due to law or morality .
WHEN THE killing and destruction in Gaza were at their height , something happened in faraway America that was not connected with the war , but was very much connected with it .
The Israeli film “ Waltz with Bashir ” was awarded a prestigious prize .
The media reported it with much joy and pride , but somehow carefully managed not to mention the subject of the film .
That by itself was an interesting phenomenon : saluting the success of a film while ignoring its contents .
The subject of this outstanding film is one of the darkest chapters in our history : the Sabra and Shatila massacre .
In the course of Lebanon War I , a Christian Lebanese militia carried out , under the auspices of the Israeli army , a heinous massacre of hundreds of helpless Palestinian refugees who were trapped in their camp , men , women , children and old people .
The film describes this atrocity with meticulous accuracy , including our part in it .
All this was not even mentioned in the news about the award .
At the festive ceremony , the director of the film did not avail himself of the opportunity to protest against the events in Gaza .
It is hard to say how many women and children were killed while this ceremony was going on – but it is clear that the massacre in Gaza is much worse than that 1982 event , which moved 400 thousand Israelis to leave their homes and hold a spontaneous mass protest in Tel - Aviv .
This time , only 10 thousand stood up to be counted .
The official Israeli Board of Inquiry that investigated the Sabra massacre found that the Israeli government bore “ indirect responsibility ” for the atrocity .
Several senior officials and officers were suspended .
One of them was the division commander , Amos Yaron .
Not one of the other accused , from the Minister of Defense , Ariel Sharon , to the Chief of Staff , Rafael Eitan , spoke a word of regret , but Yaron did express remorse in a speech to his officers , and admitted : “ Our sensitivities have been blunted ” .
BLUNTED SENSITIVITIES are very evident in the Gaza War. Lebanon
War I lasted for 18 years and more than 500 of our soldiers died .
The planners of Lebanon War II decided to avoid such a long war and such heavy Israeli casualties .
They invented the “ mad boss ” principle : demolishing whole neighborhoods , devastating areas , destroying infrastructures .
In 33 days of war , some 1000 Lebanese , almost all of them civilians , were killed – a record already broken in this war by the 17th day .
Yet in that war our army suffered casualties on the ground , and public opinion , which in the beginning supported the war with the same enthusiasm as this time , changed rapidly .
The smoke from Lebanon War II is hanging over the Gaza war .
Everybody in Israel swore to learn its lessons .
And the main lesson was : not to risk the life of even one single soldier .
A war without casualties ( on our side ) .
The method : to use the overwhelming firepower of our army to pulverize everything standing in its way and to kill everybody moving in the area .
To kill not only the fighters on the other side , but every human being who might possibly turn out to harbor hostile intentions , even if they are obviously an ambulance attendant , a driver in a food convoy or a doctor saving lives .
To destroy every building from which our troops could conceivably be shot at – even a school full of refugees , the sick and the wounded .
To bomb and shell whole neighborhoods , buildings , mosques , schools , UN food convoys , even ruins under which the injured are buried .
The media devoted several hours to the fall of a Qassam missile on a home in Ashkelon , in which three residents suffered from shock , and did not waste many words on the forty women and children killed in a UN school , from which “ we were shot at ” – an assertion that was quickly exposed as a blatant lie .
The firepower was also used to sow terror – shelling everything from a hospital to a vast UN food depot , from a press vantage point to the mosques .
The standard pretext : “ we were shot at from there ” .
This would have been impossible , had not the whole country been infected with blunted sensitivities .
People are no longer shocked by the sight of a mutilated baby , nor by children left for days with the corpse of their mother , because the army did not let them leave their ruined home .
It seems that almost nobody cares anymore : not the soldiers , not the pilots , not the media people , not the politicians , not the generals .
A moral insanity , whose primary exponent is Ehud Barak .
Though even he may be upstaged by Tzipi Livni , who smiled while talking about the ghastly events .
Even Heinrich
Heine could not have imagined that .
THE LAST DAYS were dominated by the “ Obama effect ” .
We are on board an airplane , and suddenly a huge black mountain appears out of the clouds .
In the cockpit , panic breaks out : How to avoid a collision ?
The planners of the war chose the timing with care : during the holidays , when everybody was on vacation , and while President Bush was still around .
But they somehow forgot to take into consideration a fateful date : next Tuesday Barack Obama will enter the White House .
This date is now casting a huge shadow on events .
The Israeli Barak understands that if the American Barack gets angry , that would mean disaster .
Conclusion : the horrors of Gaza must stop before the inauguration .
This week that determined all political and military decisions .
Not “ the number of rockets ” , not “ victory ” , not “ breaking Hamas ” .
WHEN THERE is a ceasefire , the first question will be : Who won ?
In Israel , all the talk is about the “ picture of victory ” – not victory itself , but the “ picture ” .
That is essential , in order to convince the Israeli public that the whole business has been worthwhile .
At this moment , all the thousands of media people , to the very last one , have been mobilized to paint such a “ picture ” .
The other side , of course , will paint a different one .
The Israeli leaders will boast of two “ achievements ” : the end of the rockets and the sealing of the Gaza - Egypt border ( the co-called “ Philadelphi route ” .
Dubious achievements : the launching of the Qassams could have been prevented without a murderous war , if our government had been ready to negotiate with Hamas after they won the Palestinian elections .
The tunnels under the Egyptian border would not have been dug in the first place , if our government had not imposed the deadly blockade on the Strip .
But the main achievement of the war planners lies in the very barbarity of their plan : the atrocities will have , in their view , a deterrent effect that will hold for a long time .
Hamas , on the other side , will assert that their survival in the face of the mighty Israeli war machine , a tiny David against a giant Goliath , is by itself a huge victory .
According to the classic military definition , the winner in a battle is the army that remains on the battlefield when it ’s over .
Hamas remains .
The Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip still stands , in spite of all the efforts to eliminate it .
That is a significant achievement .
Hamas will also point out that the Israeli army was not eager to enter the Palestinian towns , in which their fighters were entrenched .
And indeed : the army told the government that the conquest of Gaza city could cost the lives of about 200 soldiers , and no politician was ready for that on the eve of elections .
The very fact that a guerrilla force of a few thousand lightly armed fighters held out for long weeks against one of the world ’s mightiest armies with enormous firepower , will look to millions of Palestinians and other Arabs and Muslims , and not only to them , like an unqualified victory .
In the end , an agreement will be concluded that will include the obvious terms .
No country can tolerate its inhabitants being exposed to rocket fire from beyond the border , and no population can tolerate a choking blockade .
Therefore ( 1 ) Hamas will have to give up the launching of missiles , ( 2 ) Israel will have to open wide the crossings between the Gaza Strip and the outside world , and ( 3 ) the entry of arms into the Strip will be stopped ( as far as possible ) , as demanded by Israel .
All this could have happened without war , if our government had not boycotted Hamas .
HOWEVER , THE worst results of this war are still invisible and will make themselves felt only in years to come : Israel has imprinted on world consciousness a terrible image of itself .
Billions of people have seen us as a blood - dripping monster .
They will never again see Israel as a state that seeks justice , progress and peace .
The American Declaration of Independence speaks with approval of “ a decent respect to the opinions of mankind ” .
That is a wise principle .
Even worse is the impact on hundreds of millions of Arabs around us : not only will they see the Hamas fighters as the heroes of the Arab nation , but they will also see their own regimes in their nakedness : cringing , ignominious , corrupt and treacherous .
The Arab defeat in the 1948 war brought in its wake the fall of almost all the existing Arab regimes and the ascent of a new generation of nationalist leaders , exemplified by Gamal Abd - al - Nasser .
The 2009 war may bring about the fall of the current crop of Arab regimes and the ascent of a new generation of leaders – Islamic fundamentalists who hate Israel and all the West ..
In coming years it will become apparent that this war was sheer madness .
The boss has indeed gone mad – in the original sense of the word .
Opinionated Frameworks
Once again my post about Jinja and the Django template engine appeared on reddit .
The second time in the last two weeks , probably because my feeds changed and planets re-displayed it .
I originally wrote the post a few months ago to promote Jinja a bit .
I was and still am very happy with Jinja2 and wanted to write some lines about what I like about it and how it works .
And I also was hoping that the Django guys have a look at it and copy some features of it .
Mainly because every once in a while I contribute code to a Django powered project or have my fingers in some way in such a project 's code .
And every time I 'm kinda puzzled how simple some really complex tasks in Django are .
So what has changed in Django 's templates the last four months ?
Not that much .
The only changes in the Django template engine was the addition of { % empty %} blocks in { % for %} loops ( which does exactly what Jinja 's { % else %} does for loops ) and some bug fixing .
Is that a problem ?
I do n't know , but probably not .
Django 's templates are still slow and limited as they were , but it 's not causing problems so that users have to switch .
Every once in a while I notice that people switch to Jinja from Django templates because of performance of the limitations , but very often they throw away half the framework because they discover that Python has more to offer than just Django .
And with that in mind I guess the Django guys are doing the right thing .
Django is designed for content driven websites not so much for independently deployed applications ( like trac , WordPress , MediaWiki and others ) .
So not so much for applications and also not so much for stuff where you need crazy database queries that are not possible with Django .
The template engine is designed for simple HTML generation and that 's it .
If you want more , you often want something different than Django anyways .
I know many successful projects that are running Django without problems and it works out for them , because their requirements match ( nearly ) exactly what the framework was developed for .
And I know many that adopted Django because of the fuzz but what they actually want to do does not fit into the Django style of development .
In many ways Django reminds me a bit of unpacking cool stuff .
You download it and are instantly blown away how cool it is .
Database just works , templating is awesome , URL routing gives you these incredible neat looking URLs and much more .
It 's so cool that many are trying to suddenly do everything with it .
And that 's kinda where the problem lays .
You are forcing Django to do things it 's not designed for .
I think what is missing is a website that explains the advantages and disadvantages of the particular solutions and what projects work best with what solution .
There are Pylons , Werkzeug , Paste , Repoze and a lot more frameworks and utility libraries that focus on different kinds of web applications .
And that does not only apply to full blown frameworks or WSGI utilities , but also template engines , database libraries and even databases themselves .
It would prevent a lot of frustration if people could find the framework or toolchain of choice before they start developing their project .
But such a page would have to be designed by someone unbiased .
And neither me , nor anyone else who develops on / for a Python powered framework should create such a comparison page .
But I would encourage everybody with experiences in multiple frameworks to write down their experiences with different Python frameworks , template engines , database adapters and combinations thereof .
Update : Fixed misleading sentence .
Swapped complex and simple .
But the fair harbors new talents of all kinds , which bodes well for modest prices , and other artists who are n’t yet household names among outsider fans .
Maxwell Projects has vividly detailed paintings of painters at work in a studio ( the same one every time ) by Elisabeth Aldwell .
Ricco / Maresca has tiny symbol - laden landscapes by Ben Hotchkiss .
Andrew Edlin is introducing the work of Frank Calloway , an Alabaman whose images of houses , cars and animals executed in saturated colors on large rolls of paper , approach billboard scale .
Keep a special eye out for Stephen Palmer ( 1882 -1965 ) , a Wisconsin farmer who , after becoming bedridden , turned out shrinelike portraits of Jesus and other religious figures framed in bright curvilinear plant patterns that suggest fancy , demonic playing cards .
His work , recently discovered in the estate sale of his caretaker , is making a double debut at the Carl Hammer and Ricco / Maresca stands .
He stands a good chance of joining the outsider pantheon .
Other firsts include the mesmerizing childhood crayon drawings of a Philadelphia artist named Violetta Raditz ( 1912 - 1998 ) at Luise Ross .
They were all made around 1920 , and their suave lines and rich , subtle palette reflect a precocious talent fed by an early exposure to the Ballet Russe , Japanese art and possibly Aubrey Beardsley .
The Ames Gallery is introducing the large , lusciously colored canvases of Ursula Barnes ( 1872-1958 ) , whose experience as a dancer on the New York stage may have encouraged a penchant for blond Mae West - like damsels and turn - of - the - century dress .
Across the aisle the related , but contemporary paintings of Y. G. Casey ( 1923-2002 ) stand out at Rising Fawn Folk Art. Ms. Casey stippled obsessively with tester paints on plastic , achieving large enamel - like scenes best described as Neo-Victorian with a sexual slant .
Nearby , Virginia Green , a dealer of modern and contemporary art , has devoted her stand to the work of Douglas Desjardins .
This 31 - year - old artist usually sells his exuberant , often tropical paintings , executed on found scraps of plywood , on the streets of SoHo .
Ms. Green bought one last spring , was struck by its staying power and there you have it : both artist and dealer are making their Outsider Art Fair debuts .
Gary Snyder ’s stand is all about Janet Sobel ( 1894 - 1968 ) , the canny outsider credited with developing a version of drip painting that influenced Jackson Pollock .
The selection here traces the development of her figurative work during the 1940s and early ’ 50s , from conventional folk art to increasingly wild , colorful and all - over compositions .
They establish a telling call - and - response with the wild women of the great Swiss outsider Aloïse Corbaz ( 1886 - 1964 ) at Safian .
What else ?
Plenty .
Not to be missed are the hallucinatory abstract patterns of Eugene Andolsek at American Primitive ; the heated - up Ecuadoran tourist paintings of Luis Millingalli at Grey Carter ; the intimate painted and annotated collages , made from cereal boxes , by Jerry Wagner , a former handyman , Yeshiva student and folk singer from Rhode Island at George Jacobs Self - Taught Art ; the billowing images of Amos Ferguson , the 88 - year - old Bahamian artist at Bonheur known as the Picasso of Nassau ; and the wall of African salon signs at Pardee .
Did I mention the hypnotic portrait of André Breton , the autocratic pope of Surrealism , by Miguel Hernandez ( 1893 - 1957 ) at Ritsch - Fisch ?
It does full justice to the pontiff ’s famously capricious charm .
So hold on to your butts , because we 've gone out and found 10 ads that are sure to leave a lasting impression . . . in your nightmares .
Sometimes it 's because TV ads try a little too hard to be " edgy . "
Sometimes it 's because ad executives are fucking insane .
Regardless of the reason , since the television was invented , it has brought us ads so unintentionally terrifying that they 'll haunt you forever .
10 Kinder Surprise

The Marketing Meeting :
Ferrero President :
We need a hook for our horrible chocolate eggs filled with two cents worth of plastic .
For some bizarre reason kids are not all over them .
Marketing guy : I propose a commercial with a Humpty Dumpty rip off .
A beloved icon shaped as an egg .
Ferrero President : Wonderful .
But what if we give him a nightmarish face and gently imply he is mentally retarded ?
Marketing guy :
And then when the children start weeping , their parents will comfort them with our chocolate !
That is why you are president , sir .
The Result :
What the Fuck ?
If insanity were a living creature , chances are this is what its nightmares would look like :

So this creature appears , and he's the love child of Humpty Dumpty and all of our darkest fears .
He addresses the viewers who are now sitting in a puddle of their own piss , with an important announcement on the versatility and intrinsic details of the Ferrero Kinder Surprise : " Kinder , yebbol shakey . "
Well , thank you Humpty , that certainly needed to be said .
" Me unscrabbly , " continues the giant egg wrapped in human skin .
After that , the whole thing spirals into some sort of gibberish , which we are forced to assume are spells from the Necronomicon .
The monstrosity strategically forgets to tell you anything about the chocolate which holds the " awesome " prize , proving to us that even Ferrero knows they are behind a barrel of surplus WWII diarrhea in the taste department .
But that 's okay , because the lousy chocolate holds an even lousier plastic toy inside .

A toy which , by the way , was apparently meant to be a chef in a red suit , but in this commercial , looks very much like a skinned torture victim :

Democracy spoke loudly last November with voters putting Barack Obama in the White House and providing Democratic majorities for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to preside over .
After eight years of George W. Bush , American voters wanted change — so we heard over and over again .
But after the first 30 days , with plenty of crisis to fix , the Obama administration looks like Bush part deux : more bailouts , more wars , bigger government .
How could 125 million voters not end up with the change they overwhelmingly voted for ?
After all , " Down there , one hears , lies a deep , illimitable reservoir of righteousness and wisdom , unpolluted by the corruption of privilege . "
Of course , no one today would write so disparagingly about the collective electorate .
After all , the American taxpayer foots the bill to spread democracy far and wide .
People who do n't have the slightest interest in the collective wisdom of the common herd electing their leaders are having it forced upon them at gunpoint by Uncle Sam .
Today , Americans believe it is the best thing going .
The words above are from a man who had his doubts : H.L. Mencken .
Back in the 1920s , Mencken was influencing a generation of educated people .
He was a journalist , satirist and social critic , a cynic and free thinker , known as either the " Sage of Baltimore " or the " Bad Boy of Baltimore . "
As well known and influential as he was in the 1920s , Mencken is sadly unfamiliar to many educated people today .
And even though he passed in 1956 , Mencken knew where America was headed long before today .
Writing in the Baltimore Sun back in 1937 , Mencken believed that , by now , " the incurable idiots may conceivably constitute an absolute majority of the population . "
Mencken wrote mountains of material and all of it is stunningly good .
It was a wonderful day when Murray Rothbard recommended that I read anything by his favorite author , Mencken .
And although it is hard to pick a favorite book of his , for me , Notes on Democracy is his best , perhaps because there is no bigger sacred cow than democracy .
Contemporary commentators equate freedom with democracy .
But modern America gets less free every day because of it .
For Mencken , democracy was a wonder to behold : " I do not believe in democracy , but I am perfectly willing to admit that it provides the only really amusing form of government ever endured by mankind . "
Originally published in 1926 , with a reprint in 1977 , Notes on Democracy has been hard to find for many years .
Dissident Books has changed all that with a brand new edition that not only contains Mencken 's sparkling prose but an illuminating introduction from Mencken expert Marion Elizabeth Rodgers , author of Mencken : The American Iconoclast .
Rodgers has devoted her adult life to the study of the Sage of Baltimore and her biography provides the most complete look at Mencken yet .
Rodgers also provides annotations to Democracy that are to , as the editor points out , " identify names , places , and events and to clarify otherwise obscure allusions . "
Any younger ( or older ) readers who have tried Mencken before and were scared off by the number of unfamiliar references will appreciate not only the clarity but also the extensive historical background these annotations provide .
Mencken divides the book into four unequal parts , beginning with Democratic Man , which discusses the common citizen or voter .
The proletarian " is never dangerous so long as his belly is filled and his eyes kept a - pop , " and " [ h ] e still believes in ghosts , and has only shifted his belief in witches to the political sphere . "
These are the men and women deciding who will be in charge in a democracy .
" What is worth knowing he does n't know and does n't want to know ; what he knows is not true . "
In the next section , The Democratic State , Mencken turns his attention to the legislators whom voters elect .
He also dismisses those who believe there is a great difference between representative government and direct democracy : " Under both forms the sovereign mob must employ agents to execute its will , and in either case the agents may have ideas of their own , based upon interests of their own , and the means at hand to do and get what they will . "
The requirement that legislators live in the districts they represent results in " the election of a depressing gang of incompetents , mainly petty lawyers and small - town bankers . "
Mencken then turns to Democracy and Liberty .
He contends that the common man has no interest in liberty : " he is not actually happy when free ; he is uncomfortable , a bit alarmed , and intolerably lonely .
He longs for the warm , reassuring smell of the herd , and is willing to take the herdsman with it . "
Mencken 's final word considers the future of democracy .
Mencken writes that democracy may be self - devouring and that it distrusts itself , " abandoning its whole philosophy at the first sign of strain . "
When national safety is threatened , " All the great tribunes of democracy , on such occasions , convert themselves , by a process as simple as taking a deep breath , into despots of an almost fabulous ferocity .
Lincoln , Roosevelt and Wilson come instantly to mind , " wrote Mencken , who would , no question , add George W. Bush to that short list .
In his brief afterword , Pulitzer Prize–winner Anthony Lewis longs for the voice of Mencken today " to goad an altogether too timid — fawning is not too strong a word — national press . "
Of course , the press has completely fallen in love with the newest president who is viewed as a hero to many .
" Public estimation of eminence runs in reverse ratio to its genuineness , " writes Mencken , anticipating Obama , " the sort of eminence that the mob esteems most highly is precisely the sort that has least grounding in solid worth and honest accomplishment . "
Tough Sledding Ahead , Surviving a coming USD Collapse By Chris Laird
Nov 6 2008 9:40 AM www.prudentsquirrel.com
Now that the US election is over , we get to think about the Future .
And , no matter how you look at it , the entire world , the West particularly , is in for tough sledding financially .
First , we will continue to battle an emerging economic slowdown .
Then , later , we will be battling world currency instability – we already have signs of this now .
Even though gold and commodities have taken a big hit because of a general liquidation in everything , there is one thing none of us should lose sight of , and that is what happens when the USD finally lets go .
Why the USD is presently rallying Just because the USD happens to be rallying now ( with weekly fluctuations ) does not mean that its fate is not bleak .
There are many reasons the USD is rallying right now .
They include flight to cash in general during market liquidations in all areas , but also cash hoarding because businesses cannot roll over the short term credit they use to do payrolls and ongoing operations .
Then we have the usual end of year cash surge for businesses and financial institutions .
Then of course there is flight to the USD for safety , and then finally , other countries currencies are adjusting to the slowing world economy , and the once hot foreign markets are cooling and there is lots of money moving out of the ‘ emerging ’ markets .
But , we are going to be facing two particular problems in 09 that none of us is really used to , that we really have never seen .
The world is going to have a severe recession bordering on an economic depression .
Essentially no one alive today knows what that is like .
Only the oldest of us have lived through that experience .
But then , on top of that , at some point later the USD will finally collapse .
This is not something way way out there in the future .
This issue is becoming a near term threat .
What has held the USD up and why that ’s going to change
The primary reason the USD has held up so well in the last decades , in spite of ever worsening US trade and budget deficits that add to over $ 1 trillion a year combined , is that the US was an export economy ’s dream customer .
Because the US was such a good customer to the world , they bought our US Treasury bonds , and lent trillions in other ways to the US consumer .
As long as the US consumer could carry that process out , our trade partners could make bank on the US and USD .
However , once the US consumer is tapped out , and cannot effectively make a return on investment of our trade partners , the rationale for the continuation of the USD goes away .
All that remains after that is a budget busted US Federal government .
At that point , why would our trade partners continue to buy all the US treasury bonds and such , and debase their currencies , if the US cannot be such a good customer anymore ?
At that point , the USD will rapidly fall into a devaluation crisis .
None of us in the US has ever dealt with the twin threats coming our way in the next few years .
The first is a real economic depression .
The second will be the demise of the US dollar , or at the very least , its severe devaluation like 70 % or more ( at first ) .
I would like to point out that in the last great depression in the US in the 1930 ’s , we did not have a combination of a currency crisis with the economic crisis .
The USD , although it fell compared to gold , held up well .
Deflation increased the value of anything called cash , including gold .
This time , the outcome will be different .
This time , the US faces an economic depression AND a currency crisis soon after .
How far off is this ?
Well , first , we are already well into the beginning of the economic depression .
The damage done to the world credit and financial markets has been stunning since August 07 .
Over $ 35 trillion of value has been lost in the world financial markets .
That has spilled over into the real economy now , and we will start to see bigger and bigger layoff notices .
Economic demand will decline and we wo n’t see any mere one year recession , like all the pundits say ‘ we foresee 5 quarters of economic decline in the US … ’
This time we are talking on the scale of 5 years of economic decline and unemployment getting over 20 % .
The Great Depression lasted ten years , and the US had well over 25 % unemployment .
US economic production was halved !
The China situation
The rest of the world fared worse .
And , we hear that China has this great economic growth , still on the order of 8 % a year , a number any nation would kill for .
But , China needs to ADD 15 million jobs a year merely to keep up with population growth , having 1.3 billion people !
So , this 8 % growth in China is mandatory , not merely a luxury since China still has 800 million peasants in the rural areas all clamoring to move to the cities for better pay .
Even at the lowest levels , Chinese city pay is three times the basic rural income which is starvation wages .
And then consider that there are 130 million undocumented Chinese who flocked to the cities for work ( not residents of the city ) who have nowhere to go now that their export dependent economy is slowing rapidly .
The recipe here is for a revolution in China if they cannot keep 800 plus million people working … and this is just beginning to happen .
And this issue is widely known to scare the hell out of the Chinese government .
But , to avoid a revolution , they MUST have 8 % economic growth indefinitely ?
That is not going to happen .
The party is about over in China .
The point here of emphasizing China ’s demographics is that , without big exports to the West , they cannot sustain stability economically or politically .
They are the poster child to what happens when the export economies slow drastically when the US export markets slow significantly .
Not going to stop economic contraction this time But , getting back to the issue of economic depression and the USD .
The whole point here is that the world economic engine is grinding to a halt and there is no way to stop it .
The US Fed and other central banks have found out they cannot reflate the world economies this time , like they did after 2001 and 911 and the Tech bubble .
This time reflation efforts are failing .
Things are slowing down too fast this time , and that is combined with the imploding credit markets in every nation of the world .
Without credit , the world economies contract badly .
Everything is credit based .
Businesses need it to merely do daily operations , and people need it for purchases .
The only other way is to have cash and pay as you go .
The world economy is not structured to operate that way ( things do n’t have to be credit based but our world economy is inextricably addicted to it , and credit collapse equates to a world economic depression if the credit does not come back right soon ) .
And the credit is NOT coming back .
Sure , we hear that Libor rates ( interbank borrowing rates that is the lifeblood of financial institutions for short term funding needs ) have improved .
But , these lenders are not lending it out , they are merely covering their own needs and hoarding cash , just like businesses are being forced to since the short term credit markets are still frozen , and there is little chance of that improving for a good while .
So what does all this mean for the USD ?
Now , what all this means for the USD is that , as the world loses its economic engine and goes into an economic depression , the highly abused USD will lose its reason to stay strong .
At some point all the US trade partners of the world will find the US is abusing the currency too much .
With all the bailouts now , that starts to become more certain .
Then , as an economic depression makes its way , the US fiscal deficits , which are already $ 1 trillion a year , will cause flight from the USD .
At some point , our trade partners will simply stop buying the US Treasury notes / bills .
This is going to happen , friends .
Then , the USD goes to hell fast .
Now when is this ?
Well , a few years ago I wrote several articles which stated that , when the US consumer reached a point of not being able to give our trade partners a return on their massive subsidies to the US government and buy our bonds , then the USD game is over .
The only reason the USD has managed to avoid a huge devaluation , and even a currency crisis , is because since 1945 after WW2 ended , every time the US economy contracted the US was able to grow out of it .
Or , in many cases the US was able to lower interest rates ( meaning borrow out of it ) and stimulate the economy .
Now , that stimulation process is broken , to say the least .
Lower interest rates are not working this time .
This time , we are not going to stimulate out of an economic depression .
This time we get a depression .
Why ?
Because , we have two irresolvable problems to avoid a depression this time .
This time , we are in the same situation generally as what happened in 1929 , and then the ensuing world deflation .
The Two insoluble problems that will lead to a depression and ultimately the final USD collapse Deleveraging cannot be stopped , there is too much
The USD is only supported by a healthy world economy and is subsidized
The world is deleveraging in totality and we have a breaking world finance bubble .
I estimate that way over $ 1000 trillion of world financial markets alone are deleveraging .
That number is calculated by adding up all the leverage out there , and the biggest one is the derivatives of all types that are really only big HUGE leveraged bets .
They are nothing more than that .
The BIS states that world derivatives alone are over $ 1 quadrillion worth – that ’s 1000 trillion .
Even if central banks move heaven and earth with their now $ 7 trillion of infusions to every market imaginable now , that ’s a drop in the bucket compared to what ’s out there .
So , the deleveraging will continue relentlessly this time .
Why did that happen ?
Quite simply , the Western consumers got tapped out .
They borrowed more than they can sustain a return on .
So , for example , we see the housing bubble collapse and then all the mortgage bonds collapse , and then all the banks collapse – get the idea ?
Then all the credit disappears everywhere and we get an assured economic depression .
And that will lead to 20 % unemployment or worse in the entire world – mark my words .
The overall picture is that the world economic / credit bubble since 1945 has just burst before our eyes since August 07 .
That is one huge bubble .
And , as they say , for every Ying there is a corresponding Yang , or more simply , what goes up must come down .
And it ’s coming down hard .
And … we have n’t seen nothing yet either .
The down has a long way to go ; we are merely in the first stages .
And , boy is the world already suffering .
So then , follow along here , the next victim of this emerging depression will be the USD .
As I said , the only thing keeping the USD afloat with the massive fiscal deficits has been an ever spending US consumer who bought trillions of dollars worth of exports .
When they get tapped out there is no reason for our trade partners to keep that up is there ?
The USD subsidies ( primarily our trade partners buying US bonds of all types ) will end this time around ( this economic cycle ) .
How can we get out of this mess ?
Well , first I have to say I do n’t think we will avoid a long , possibly ten years , depression .
But there are some ways it might be avoided .
First , if the US abrogated the $ 60 trillion of promises to Social Security and Medicare , maybe that would save the USD .
But that wo n’t happen .
Probably , what the US will do is just pay it all , but with worthless dollars .
The second thing that might get the world out of this impending economic depression and a collapse of the USD later would be to forgive all debts .
Possibly that would wipe out the USD too anyway .
But that would set the stage for a huge world economic recovery .
The trouble with debt forgiveness is it never seems to happen .
Believe me , I am not talking hogwash about debt forgiveness .
The Bible , for example , talks about how every 7 years and every 70 years there is to be total debt forgiveness .
It ’s called the Jubilee .
The idea is a legitimate concept that can work and has worked .
You do n’t think that ’s viable ?
Well it can work because all that happens is that the lenders who offer credit have to factor in either payment in full or forgiveness over a 7 year period .
This can be done and would actually result in the biggest sustained world economic boom ever imagined .
The thing that causes world economic depressions are debt and financial bubbles .
The two go together .
But , getting back to the fate of the USD .
The problem is , the lenders wo n’t forgive debt or make it amortize in a short time .
They insist on ever bigger debts .
They do things like making the bankruptcy laws far more stringent ( recently done in the US ) .
And thus , they guarantee that the world consumers ultimately will get tapped out ( just a matter of time ) and then a world bubble collapse and economic depression .
The interesting thing that happens is that there is ultimately dept repudiation in depressions anyway .
Which leads us to the USD ’s fate in coming years .
I do n’t think we will have to wait for 30 years to see Social Security and Medicare to bankrupt the US .
What will happen sooner is that , as the US enters economic depression this time , the return on investment for our trade partners will disappear .
The US wo n’t keep our trade parnters ’ hundreds of millions employed , and they will then stop buying US Treasury bonds .
And then the USD devalues 70 % in a year .
Maybe going to zero soon after that .
The US is then bankrupted .
When can this happen ?
Possibly mid way into the next US economic depression ( not recession ) .
And , since I think we are now entering the beginning of a US depression , then if it lasts ten years , that means we have about 4 years to go for the USD to finally give up the ghost .
Yes , I mean that .
We have maybe 4 years left , maybe even only 2 years for the USD to remain anything at all .
What can you do about all this ?
Well , aside from dealing with the certain political and social chaos and those dangers when the USD collapses , you need to move your money into a combination of other currencies and also into paid off real things .
It ’s conceivable that some stocks in real things like mines would do well too .
But stocks and financial products in general , like annuities , will be destroyed in value because , in an economic depression , companies either go out of business or shrink .
And in a currency crisis ( USD ) that Social Security check , that bank CD , that Treasury bond , that insurance annuity becomes worthless .
Sorry , but that is the reality .
So , to escape losing all your income and losing all your wealth in a currency crisis , you have to have money in other currencies , and also in paid off real things that are still there after the currency is destroyed .
Obviously , gold and precious metals figure in here .
The falling prices right now are quite beside the point .
What really matters is what happens in the next 4 or so years to the USD .
That ’s the BIG issue .
The reason why gold and such are dropping now is because of the general financial and commodity deleveraging .
When that bottoms , then gold will still be there .
The only thing is , when this world deleveraging bottoms , I do n’t think much else will still be there .
The problem is how to survive it .

Since our beginning in 2005 , we have grown constantly and now have more active paying subscribers than ever .
We also have an enviable renewal rate .
The Prudent Squirrel newsletter is our financial and gold commentary .
Subscribers get 44 newsletters a year on Sundays , and also mid week email alerts as needed .
We alerted our subscribers April 20 that the USD was bottoming .
The USD has strengthened significantly since .
The alerts include quick notification of important financial news developments by email .
Subscribers tell us that the alerts alone are worth subscribing for .
I had one potential subscriber ask me if the newsletter has much more content than these public articles , ie , if it was worth subscribing .
The answer is that the public articles have less than 10 % of our research and conclusions that subscribers see , not to mention the subscriber email alerts of important breaking financial news .
We have anticipated many significant market moves in the last year , such as imminent drops in world stock markets within days of them happening , and big swings in the gold markets within days of them occurring .
We have also made a number of good calls on big currency swings , such as with the USD , the Euro and the Yen .

How Metasploit Turned The Tables On Its DDoS Attackers
An inside look at how Metasploit creator HD Moore battled the botnet that flooded Metasploit servers for nearly one week
At one point during the recent weeklong round of distributed denial - of - service ( DDoS ) attacks on white - hat hacker site Metasploit , an anonymous hacker sent a blackmail message to Metasploit creator HD Moore .
" Some random guy [ said ] , " Give me all of your source codes , ' " says Moore , who employed various counter - attacks to the series of DDoS assaults , which he describes as more annoying than destructive .
But after stringing the purported blackmailer along for a while in order to trace him , Moore discovered the email message had come from one of the bots in a botnet army that was flooding the Metasploit site .
Moore says the email may have been from someone other than the DDoS attackers ; either way , Moore had no intention of falling for the blackmail .
The DDoS attacks began around Feb. 6 against security sites Metasploit , Immunity , Milw0rm , and Packet Storm , when a botnet flooded the sites ' domains with HTTP requests .
After a few days , the attacks focused entirely on Metasploit .
Moore says the DDoS ' incoming connection exceeded 15 Mbps with SYN packets sent to the www.metasploit.com and metasploit.com domains .
" They would follow over to the new IPs I had made , " Moore says of his attempts to change DNSes and evade the attackers .
But Moore remained undaunted , and even had a little fun with the attackers , who appeared to be novices , he says .
" It did n't look like the folks behind it were particularly clever -- more like someone got access to their friend 's botnet and went on an ego - stroking rampage , " Moore says .
At one point , Moore decided to try using Google Sites , a free Web hosting service from Google , to mitigate the DDoS attack .
It worked for a few minutes -- until Google Sites hit its page limit , Moore says .
With the help of other researchers , Moore was able to narrow down the culprit command and control ( C&C ) domains to three -- all out of Russia .
The researchers then got one of the domains blackholed .
All three of the domains are associated with botnets and malware distribution .
Most of the bots , meanwhile , were infected Windows XP machines based in Turkey .
Moore decided to give the remaining two C&C domains a taste of their own medicine .
He ran a reverse : For about 24 hours , he pointed the two DDoS streams that were flooding Metasploit back onto the offending domains so that they were flooding their own C&C infrastructure , he says .
" The flood showed no sign of stopping before , and I sure was n't trying to negotiate with them , " he says .
The DDoS attacks finally came to a halt last Thursday .
To take the sting out of future DDoS attacks , Moore is working on configuring his domain settings to a more " granular " level -- placing the various Metasploit resources , such as the framework and SSL , on different domains .
" That would make it easier to bring the service up and down [ in the event of another attack ] , " he says .
" I had mail on a different network [ so it was n't affected in the latest round of attacks ] , and our DNS servers were fine [ as well ] . "
But Moore says he would n't be surprised if the DDoS attacks on Metasploit resumed .
If and when that happens , he said he would also enlist the help of some botnet - fighting volunteer organizations at the onset of an attack .

A research team at the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Japan has successfully displayed simple images produced in the human brain on a computer screen .
Dream recorder anyone ?

In a nutshell , the device converts electrical signals sent to the visual cortex into images that can be viewed on a computer screen .
In their experiment , they showed test subjects the six letters in the word neuron and succeeded in reconstructing the word on screen by measuring their brain activity .
As the technology progresses , it could be possible to " see " what people are thinking , what they dream about and record it for posterity .
What do you think ?
Would that be awesome or scary as hell ?
All I know is that image weirds me out .

A REPORT comparing the public transport systems of 52 cities internationally , commissioned by the State Government , has found that only North American cities have worse access to services than Melbourne .
And the Public Transport Standards Review , completed by respected transport analysts Booz and Co , has found Melbourne 's public transport system performs worse than some Australian capitals in principal areas as well .
Melbourne is one of the developed world 's most car - dependent cities .
The report was completed as part of a government transport statement , released last month , and found eastern European cities invested 137 per cent more in public transport per head of population than Melbourne .
Western European cities invested 57 per cent more .
Israel is under suspicion of committing war crimes and should halt the " clear and present danger to the lives and well - being of tens of thousands of civilians " in Gaza , nine of the country 's main human rights organisations have declared .
The Israeli organisations have written to the government , armed forces chiefs and the attorney general , condemning the " unprecedented " harm to a civilian population now in " extreme humanitarian distress " , the " wanton use of lethal force " and a series of what it says are " blatant violations of the laws of warfare " .
These include the fact that , apart from the death toll , with border crossings closed residents are unable to escape the war zone and are living in " fear and terror " .
The organisations also cited the dire capacity problems of Gaza 's hospital system and the failure to evacuate about 600 wounded and chronically ill patients ; what they say is prevention by the army of rescue teams reaching isolated areas which have come under intensive attack ; and the fact that , with sewage now flowing in many streets , more than half a million people are without clean water and 250,000 residents have been without electricity for 18 days .
Another million residents are without power at any one time , the organisations said .
The agencies also said 12 medical personnel had been killed , and another 17 injured , and that there had been 15 separate attacks on medical facilities .
Meanwhile , Israel was hitting civilian targets which it defined as military solely because they are defined as " symbols of power " in Hamas - controlled Gaza .
Several human rights representatives went out of their way to make clear they were just as vigorous in their condemnation of the killing and injuring of Israeli civilians in militant rocket and mortar attacks .
But their letter says the harm inflicted on Gaza 's 1.5 million civilian population is " disproportionate " and calls on the government to open corridors to allow residents to escape the fighting and rescue teams to reach the injured .
Asked about the large majority of Israelis the polls show as supporting the warfare in Gaza , the Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard said : " We are witnessing a moral corrosion . "
Five years ago , when 15 bystanders were killed when a bomb was used to assassinate the Hamas militant leader Saleh Shehadeh , " there had been a very serious debate .
Today we 're doing it daily and and no one says a word .
The [ Israel Defence Forces ] has stopped expressing regret " .
The Israeli human rights letter also says that transformers , cables and other equipment allowed by Israel into Gaza 's only power station four days earlier were severely damaged in a bombing raid on Monday night .
Jakob Kellenberger , the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , said after a visit to Gaza that the three - hour window being offered by Israel for humanitarian operations " is simply not long enough " .
He added : " You must have 24 - hour access to people who are wounded , people who are hungry . "
ICRC officials said it is often impossible to organise ambulance convoys through the battle zones in that time .
Mr Kellenberger , who also visited the Israeli border town of Sderot , said he understood " the great psychological damage " caused by rocket attacks there .
But he said the scenes he had seen at Gaza 's Shifa hospital were " shocking , really shocking , it hurts to see it .
The number of patients keeps on increasing " .
Oxfam said the cost of the damage at the power plant was estimated at £ 280,000 .
Although less than a day 's normal supply , 369,000 litres of industrial diesel – needed to fuel the power plant and restore electricity supplies vital to Gaza 's water and sewage – is held up at the Nahal Oz terminal because it is too dangerous to transport it to the power station .
Gaza :
The statistics so far

In an interview with Brit Hume that aired today on Fox News Sunday , President Bush admitted that he personally authorized the torture of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
His admission today suggests
Bush had a far more direct role in developing the specific torture program , which included waterboarding , a freezing cell , and long periods of standing and stress positions all of which have long been considered torture .

For those of you who read “ Sperm Wars ” or “ The Selfish Gene ” and

______________________
The more a woman has sex with her partner , the more committed she
becomes , and the less attracted she is to other men — at least in the
short - term .
I blogged about this study several weeks ago and offered
explanations both hormonal and psychological .
But another theory came to
my attention today in the form of a study on fruit flies .
For decades , scientists have known that female Drosophila refuse sex for
a period of time after they come into contact with seminal fluid .
This
may give a reproductive edge to the first male with whom a female has
sex .
A study led by Geoffrey Findlay at the University of Washington has
finally shed some light on the phenomenon .
Turns out there are proteins
in seminal fluid , many of which transfer to the female ’s system after
sex .
Some of these proteins are warrior - like — they fight the sperm of
rival males .
Other proteins are like hypnotists — by affecting the
female ’s hormones , they dampen her interest in having sex with other
males .
Somewhat disturbingly , the more semen a female is exposed to , the
more influence the male has over her reproductive tract and her mating
behavior .
Semen , it seems , has mind control properties .
So what does this mean for humans ?

First , I got the Kodak Zi6 .
Then , I got the Flip Mino HD .
A few hours ago , I received a recently - ordered Creative Vado HD and decided that instead of doing a full - on review of it , I ’d compare it directly against the Mino HD and the Zi6 – in a short video shootout .
Flip Mino HD Likes : small and lightweight ; has decent software that runs on both Mac OS X and Windows ; decent “ foreground subject focused ” audio in noisy situations .
: small and lightweight ; has decent software that runs on both Mac OS X and Windows ; decent “ foreground subject focused ” audio in noisy situations .
Flip Mino HD Dislikes :
Touch controls are too sensitive ; there ’s a plastic protector that flips out along with the USB connector ; colors are always washed out ; flat video quality ; white balance is impossible ; tons of noise in low light ; my skin tone never looks right indoors ; built - in YouTube uploader decreases quality automatically ; tiny LCD screen ; cheap plastic wrist strap .

: great balance of color and saturation in the average shot ; tends to favor skin tones ; wide angle lens ; can record two hours ; replaceable / rechargeable battery via USB ; lightweight ; sharp definition .
Creative Vado HD
Dislikes : included skin does n’t accommodate battery replacement / hard reset ; audio is treble muted from behind ( in narration ) ; skews to light which is n’t always neutral ; has a wrist strap slot but does n’t come with a strap .
The Flip Mino HD is the worst of the bunch to my eyes and ears , and I ’m looking to sell it ( hardly used ) at a good price .
The Kodak is completely unusable in artificial light ( due to uncontrollable blurring ) , which rules it out for where I ’d need it most .
I do n’t think Flip is going to fix their problems with a software update , but I ’m holding out hope for a Zi6 fix .
Kodak has to get its act together – so does Pure Digital .
For my money right now , it ’s the Creative Vado HD .
The wide angle lens is absolutely essential when you ’re trying to get closer to a subject – or if you want more in the scene .
That ’s all you need to know – and all the reason to go with a Vado HD over the others .
Even if you think the Zi6 is n’t bad , the Vado ’s wide angle lens trumps it .
You have to be much further away from your subject to get the same shot as you can with a Vado ( closer , and with MORE in the frame ) .
Keep that in mind the next time you ’re in tight quarters , or when you have to take three steps back just to get the shot you wanted .
Plus , the Vado does a much better job with skin tones and saturation ( generally ) compared to the other two in indoor situations .
The HDMI cable may be another win for you and the Vado , but I seldom use video out in these cameras – so that ’s just a value add .
Hardware controls are comfortable on the Vado , and I like how its USB connector is flexible .
Now , you can watch the following videos inline – but I ’d also recommend viewing them on YouTube ( where you can watch the original 1280 × 720 as recorded and uploaded without editing ) .
I ’ve linked to the HD versions in the list above .
Understand , too , that the Zi6 was at least six inches behind both the Flip Mino HD and Creative Vado HD in this test – even though it appears as though the Creative Vado HD was the furthest away .
I ’m telling you : that wide angle lens is AWESOME .

I found this in a local super market , I could n’t resist the orange temptation !
Is n’t it grand ?
I wonder how they grow them ?
Is it a forerunner of the mutant vegetable future to come ?
Is this how we will feed the starving masses of the planet ?
Maybe , but I for one welcome our new carrot overlords !

" Bored , anonymous , pathetic bloggers who lie annoy me .... I 'll tell you , yesterday the Anchorage Daily News , they called again to ask — double - , triple - , quadruple - check — who is Trig 's real mom .
And I said , Come on , are you kidding me ?
We 're gonna answer this ?
Do you not believe me or my doctor ?
And they said , No , it 's been quite cryptic the way that my son's birth has been discussed .
And I thought , Okay , more indication of continued problems in the world of journalism . "

Zombification became a subject of popular Western interest during the occupation of Haiti by the USA between 1915 and 1934 .
The current United Nations intervention has again focused attention on a phenomenon regarded as exotic and improbable by the media , yet one which is taken by most Haitians as empirically verifiable .
Along with the related religious practice of vodu , it has been implausibly related by US physicians to the current epidemic of AIDS in Haiti .
Haitian medical practitioners regard zombification as the consequence of poisoning ; the clergy as the product of sorcery .
Zombis are frequently recognised by the local population , and estimates of their number are of the order of up to a thousand new cases per year ( L P Mars , personal communication ) .

Here , I have a photo of an owl that I took a while ago .
It would have been a nice shot if the owl did n’t wink at me .
Here ’s a trick I learned and I ’ll share with you .
The first thing I ’ll do is go to the Window menu on the tool bar and click on the Clone Source option :
The Clone Source panel will come up :
I ’m going to flip the source of the destination by changing the width value to negative 100 ( - 100 ) .
I ’ll also put the value of negative 5 ( - 5 ) in the Rotate Source area .
Every picture is different so this might need a little trial and error .
But try the ( - 5 ) first :
Now I ’ll go and click on the Clone Tool :
I ’ll go to the tool bar at the top of the screen and make sure that I have the Aligned box checked .
Also make sure that you are at 100 % opacity and the Mode is set to Normal :
Now I will ALT - Click on the center of the good eye .
This will become my source .
Then I ’ll just start to paint with the clone tool over the closed eye .
You ’ll see that the eye is being painted as a mirror of the good eye .
This will make it look completely natural :
Here is the end result .
When you ’re finished , do n’t forget to put the setting back to their original state in the Clone Source panel .
I hope you like this little trick .
You can use this with animals , people , anything .
I think it ’s very cool .
Have fun !
JERUSALEM — Israel ’s security cabinet is expected to meet Saturday night to declare a cease - fire in Gaza and will keep its forces there in the short term while the next stage of an agreement with Egypt is worked out .
“ It looks as if all the pieces of the puzzle are coming together , ” Mark Regev , a spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , said Friday .
“ There will be discussions tomorrow morning , and it looks like a cabinet meeting will take place tomorrow night .
Everyone is very upbeat . ”
Meanwhile , Israeli tank fire killed two boys at a United Nations - run school on Saturday in the northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiya , a U.N. official told Reuters .
Adnan Abu Hasna , a spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency , said two brothers had been killed and 14 people had been wounded in the attack , including the boys ' mother .
An Israeli army spokesman said that he was checking the report .
The most promising element for bringing the three - week conflict to a close occurred in Washington on Friday , where Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Israel signed an understanding on a range of steps the United States would take to stem the flow of new arms to Hamas from the Egyptian Sinai , mostly via tunnels .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -
The remarkable thing about President George W. Bush was n't that he was a horrible chief executive ; it 's that he was horrible in so many ways .
Contrary to the president 's own assessment of his tenure earlier this week , it was an astonishing eight years - and not in a good way .
The country suffered two recessions , and two shooting wars .
The government botched its response to a brazen attack by terrorists on two cities , and then four years later utterly failed to react when another city was consumed by a natural disaster .
The president took on tyranny by embracing torture .
He fought a war for freedom by trampling human rights .
He enriched the already rich , excused their excesses , and then bailed them out of trouble and handed us the bill .
He politicized everything , promoted incompetents , and -- whenever things got tight -- appealed to our basest instincts of fear , greed , ignorance and hate .
Bush had all the luck of Jimmy Carter , the attention to detail of Ronald Reagan , the adaptability of Lyndon Johnson , the abiding respect for the Constitution of Richard Nixon , the humility of Teddy Roosevelt , the rhetorical skills of Calvin Coolidge , the fiscal restraint of Franklin Roosevelt , the cronyism of Warren Harding , and the overreaching idealism of Woodrow Wilson .
And his election had all the legitimacy of Rutherford Hayes ' .
None of the disasters of the past eight years can be entirely blamed on Bush , of course .
No president is all powerful , and Bush was handed some raw deals , especially in that first year with the recession and then the nightmare of 9/11 .
But other presidents - Lincoln , Roosevelt , and the incoming Obama come to mind -- have had to deal with worse .
The test of greatness is what you do when faced with the impossible .
Here 's my list of the seven worst things Bush did during his time in the White House .
7. Bush politicized parts of the government that should be nonpartisan .
From NASA to the Justice Department , professionals were forced out or silenced if they departed from the true Republican way .
What was good for the Republican Party trumped what was good policy for the nation .
Every administration is political to some extent , but the Bush administration took it too far .
When Paul O'Neill was forced out at Treasury , it was clear that every major decision would be determined by Karl Rove 's calculus .
6 . Bush squandered the budget surplus .
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , Bush had a near - religious faith in the ability of tax cuts to deliver prosperity .
Tax cuts were the panacea that would cure all ills .
Economy too strong ?
Cut taxes .
Economy too weak ?
Cut taxes .
Stock market falling ?
Cut dividend taxes .
Investment weak ?
Cut capital gains taxes .
But tax cuts did n't make the economy stronger ; they merely blew a big hole in the budget .
Now , when we could really use that surplus to pay for the bailouts and the stimulus , it 's gone .
5 . Bush comforted the comfortable and afflicted the afflicted .
The Bush years were the ultimate test of trickle - down economics , the theory that says the government should favor the rich because the benefits will flow down to the rest of us .
The results of that experiment are clear :
We 've had the weakest job growth since the 1930s .
We 've had the biggest increase in debt ever .
We 've had the highest share of national income going to profits since the 1920s .
Income inequality has soared while our public and private investment has slowed to a trickle .
Instead of building a fundamentally sound economy , Bush nurtured a Ponzi economy based on get - rich - quick schemes .
4. Bush rewarded incompetence .
Because politics and personal loyalty were all that counted , Bush appointed incompetent people to vital jobs .
He hired interns to run Iraq .
He hired a horse expert to run the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
He wanted to hire Harriett Miers to be a Supreme Court justice .
Top jobs were reserved for sycophants , toadies and failures .
3 . Bush lied us into war .
Every argument for war against Iraq was a delusion , and hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost as a result .
Saddam Hussein was not responsible for 9/11 in any way .
He was not a danger to the United States .
The Bush administration ignored or dismissed mountains of evidence that showed that Saddam was not building an arsenal of chemical or nuclear weapons .
Bush rushed to war without giving diplomacy or weapons inspectors a chance .
Later , administration officials blew the cover of a CIA employee whose husband told the truth , and then lied about their involvement .
2. Bush has exposed himself to war crime charges .
By his own admission , Bush authorized interrogation practices that are illegal under U.S. and international law .
His administration at best looked the other way and at worst ordered prisoners at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib to be tortured .
Not only is torture an immoral and heinous crime against humanity , it is ineffective in the fight against terrorism .
Nothing has given Osama bin Laden more support than Bush 's immorality .
And our nation 's reputation has been tarnished , possibly forever .
1. Bush weakened our democracy .
Bush has embraced a theory of dictatorship .
Bush , under Vice President Dick Cheney 's guidance , encouraged an imperial presidency answerable to no one .
Working with a complacent Congress , Bush gutted the constitutional checks and balances that are supposed to keep any part of the government from growing too powerful or too corrupt .
In the name of an endless war against an amorphous enemy , he canceled our most fundamental rights of habeas corpus and the right to be free from unreasonable government spying .
One final note : Bush had the opportunity to be a great president .
After 9/11 , the nation was as united as it had been since Pearl Harbor , and Bush rode a wave of popularity that he could have used to turn around the nation 's politics , security and economy .
Instead of uniting us as he promised , he divided us instead .
The Ring of Quaternions :
Consider the ring of quaternions .
We define multiplication with the identities .
We have the identity , so in particular every nonzero element is invertible , making “ almost ” a field .
But multiplication is clearly not commutative .
A ring like , in which every nonzero element has an inverse , is called a division ring .
( or sometimes a division algebra )
All fields are division rings .
One interesting observation about : its center , or the set , is simply , and is a 4 - dimensional real vector space .
It is easy to see that the center of any division ring is a field , but a deeper result is that the dimension of a division ring over its center is always either infinite or a perfect square .
Finite Division Rings :
Since the theory of finite fields is so rich , one might expect the same from the theory of finite division rings .
But as the title of this post has no doubt suggested to you , there are no unexpected finite division rings .
The remainder of this post will prove this surprising and nontrivial fact .
Preliminaries
Let be a finite division ring , and its center .
Say that , then for some .
The statement that is a field is equivalent to , so assume .
We use some basic facts from group theory , namely the class equation , on the group .
First , notice that if , the centralizer is a ring containing , so it is a - vector space and its order is for some .
So the centralizer in has order .
The class equation gives us :
Now we need a little wishful thinking .
What if was divisible by some prime that no smaller was divisible by ?
Then we ’d have a contradiction and could finish the proof .
Playing around with examples will show you that this is not true in general .
For example , , is a counterexample , as is , .
But it turns out that these are the only counterexamples , which is a surprising result with a surprising name :
Zsigmondy ’s
Theorem :
If are relatively prime integers , then for any natural number there is a prime number that divides and does not divides for any positive integer , with two exceptions :
, , and .
, , and .
is a power of , .
Every finite division ring is a field , assuming Zsigmondy ’s Theorem :
I will present a ( somewhat technical ) proof of Zsigmondy in my next post .
In the meantime , we are done with our original problem unless we are in one of the two exceptional cases .
Suppose that and .
Then the class equation reads .
But each term of the sum must equal or , so we have .
But the right side is divisible by while the left is not , contradiction .
Now , suppose that .
Since every term in the right - hand sum must be , we see that the left - hand side is divisible by but the right - hand side is not , contradiction .
We conclude that every finite division ring is a field .

Learn Everything you need to know about legal Cannabis in Canada here !
The specifics .
Adults are allowed to own , consume , and share with other adults up to 30 grams of dried cannabis , enough for about 60 joints .
…
Even though cannabis is legal in Canada , it ’s illegal to bring it into the country , even if you ’re traveling from one of the U.S. states where it ’s legal as well .
Zope 2.12 alpha 1 has been released .
It ’s completely “ eggified ” , meaning that all parts of it are separate python modules , installable with setuptools easy_install command .
The main egg is called just Zope2 , and you can therefore now install Zope 2 with “ easy_install Zope2 ” from the command line .
Of course , this will install it in the system library , which is probably not what you want .
So you probably want to use virtualenv to create a separate installation , or use buildout .
Here are the commands I used to test this alpha version :
virtualenv zope212 # Create a python sandbox for testing
cd zope212
bin/easy_install Zope2 # Install Zope 2
# make coffee while Zope 2 gets downloaded and installed
bin/mkzopeinstance
cd testinstance #
Or whatever you called it
bin/zopectl fg
Yeah , that ’s it !
Works like a charm .
Even on Python 2.6 !
Zope 2.12 will be released probably around a similar time as Plone 4 .
Plone 3.2 is already completely eggyfied , but Plone buildouts still need to have special recipies for installing Zope 2 .
With Zope 2.12 this will no longer be necessary , and you can install Plone just by doing an easy_install Plone , and get all of the parts installed .
Which is totally cool !
So thanks to everyone involved in this , and also to everyone involved in eggifying Zope3 , without which this never could have happend !
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - A Tehran court has jailed a number of people accused of involvement in a U.S. - sponsored plot to overthrow Iran ’s Islamic system of government , a semi-official news agency said on Saturday .
The Mehr News Agency said the accused had confessed , but did not say how many they were or give any details on the sentences .
The judiciary last Tuesday said Iran had arrested four Iranians in connection with a suspected U.S. - financed plot to topple the Islamic system , in an announcement made a week before the inauguration of Barack Obama as U.S. president .
“ Based on clear confessions , the accused planned to weaken the foundation of the government and overthrow the Islamic system , ” Mehr quoted Tehran ’s revolutionary court as saying .
Iran often accuses the West of seeking to undermine the Islamic state through a “ velvet revolution ” with the help of intellectuals and others inside the country .
The United States accuses Tehran of seeking to build nuclear bombs .
Iranian officials deny the charge , saying the nuclear program is for electricity production .
Obama has said he sees Iran as a “ genuine threat ” but he has also pledged to increase diplomatic efforts to engage it , in a shift from George W. Bush ’s approach .
Mehr quoted the court statement as saying the accused in the case had been sentenced to imprisonment and were behind bars .
The Bush administration had “ hired a number of renegade and traitorous agents , ” who , with U.S. funding , aimed to “ realize their sinister goals , ” the court said , according to Mehr .
It added : “ The accused have explicitly confessed to the plan to present the United States as the only savior of the Iranian people by creating a gap between the people and the government of Iran . ”
Under Bush , the United States has spearheaded a drive to isolate Iran in order to pressure it into halting its nuclear activities , something which Tehran has repeatedly refused to do .
The New York Times this month said Bush had deflected an Israeli request last year for bunker - busting bombs it wanted for an attack on Iran ’s nuclear complex , saying he had authorized covert action to sabotage its suspected atomic arms development .
The New York Times report said Bush , aware that financial sanctions against Iran were inadequate , had turned to the CIA and authorized a broader effort aimed at Iran ’s industrial infrastructure supporting its nuclear program .
Obama , who takes office on Tuesday , has said he will take a new approach toward Tehran that will emphasize respect for the Iranian people and spell out what the United States expects of its leaders .

So far six audience members have stormed out midperformance of the Broadway show “ You ’re Welcome America .
A Final Night with George W Bush , ” the comedian Will Ferrell ’s lampooning of the 43rd president , according to those keeping count at the Cort Theater .
But they have n’t been leaving after a particular Ferrell quip .
They ’ve been standing up , instead , after the projection of a supersize photo on the backdrop of the stage .
A photo of a penis .
Specifically , as Mr. Ferrell ( who plays President Bush ) leads the audience to believe , the president ’s penis .
Except that ’s not quite right .
“ It ’s an anonymous but age - appropriate public domain Internet penis , ” said Adam McKay , the play ’s director .
“ We went on the Web and got a penis . ”
“ It ’s not the president ’s penis , as far as I know , and Will is 41 , so we were n’t going to use his , ” Mr. McKay added .
“ What I do know is that the photo gets one of the great shrieks of delight from the audience , and it ’s also the one moment that is followed by people walking out . ”
It 's been 22 years since the Shuffle Demons released their classic , " Spadina Bus , " and more than half a century since " The Subway Song " celebrated the construction of the Yonge line in the 1950s .
Now there 's a new ode to Toronto transit , a rap song and video called " I Get On ( The TTC ) , " that has attracted thousands of hits on YouTube and social networking sites since it was posted last week by a couple of 21 - year - old performers from Scarborough .
The affectionate , lighthearted look at the city 's quintessential ride on the Rocket was written , performed and shot by Humber College student Syrus , whose real name is Rudolph Anthony Watson .
His friend , Randal Paul Medford , a former MuchMusic intern and graduate of Centennial College , assisted with the video shoot , backup vocals and 10 hours of editing on the project .
Shot in late November , the video is a playful parody of American rapper Young Jeezy's , " Put On , " a song Syrus loved .
Instead of convertibles and scantily clad women , the Toronto duo 's version features scenes from Keele and Kipling stations , the 43 Kennedy bus and the TTC stop near Syrus 's home .
In one scene , Syrus spills a deck of Metropasses from his pocket .
In another , Medford is shown chasing a bus down the road after it fails to stop for him .
" I take the subway from Kennedy to Kipling on a daily basis .
I 've got nothing to do basically and I 'm in comedy writing so I figure I might as well take the hour and a half and write some stuff , " said Syrus , an aspiring actor who is studying comedic performance at Humber College .
The video , which pokes fun at the TTC 's downside and praises its convenience and affordability , has caught on because so many people can relate to the content , he said .
" Everybody has their individual experiences on ( the TTC ) but you 've got to love it because it 's convenient and you see funny stuff all the time , which is why I wrote about it , " said Syrus , who has seen it all , from fighting couples to people sitting and standing too close and digging in their ears .
Medford , who wants to direct , act and produce films , says he can't sit down on the bus or subway without falling asleep .
But once , standing on a packed Dufferin bus from the Caribana parade for more than an hour , he and a friend engaged fellow passengers in a loud debate on the difference between the sexes .
" The whole bus got into it .
It was the most entertaining bus ride I 've been on in my life , " he said .
The proud pair of Metropass owners knew they were onto something last Friday , a day after Medford posted the video on his YouTube page .
That morning Syrus noted 726 hits .
By the time he went to bed , " I Get On , " had attracted 4,262 viewers .
A new version of the video was posted yesterday , deleting a brief homophobic slur that appeared in the original and was causing controversy online .
Syrus and Medford say it was meant as a joke but when they realized it was offensive they dropped the word from the video .
TTC chair Adam Giambrone , who happened to ride the Dufferin bus with Medford on Sunday following an awards reception , is supportive of their effort .
" This song , along with a lot of the other pop presentations of the TTC , all confirm the fact that the TTC is important to the day - to - day lives of people .
That comes through not only in pop culture references but in ideas and positions people articulate , " he said .

SPADINA BUS
Lyrics from " Spadina Bus " by the Shuffle Demons ( 1986 )
One of our readers ChadMichael and his partner Mito contacted me over the great news that the media is picking up on their Christmas decorations which call for people to visit InvalidateProp8 , a site by the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center which has already raised more than $ 70,000 in the fight to overturn prop 8 .
These guys are n't done yet , they are just beginning their fight !
They have launched a new website called Designers for Equality ( D.E )
In response to prop 8 passing they are asking their fellow designers within the wedding industry ( i.e. wedding planners , wedding designers , bridal dress makers , florists , caterers , photographers , hair and make - up savants , wedding venues , everyone involved with making weddings come true ) ; including all who support us , to come together in solidarity and Boycott all weddings .
This also includes the cancellation of wedding magazine subscriptions .
D.E understands the economy is poor right now , and that it is very hard to turn down any opportunity to make money .
That is why when you commit to boycott all weddings until prop 8 is overturned , the people in the network will collaborate to help one another out .

Rep. Lynn Westmoreland , R - Ga. AP file photo CQPOLITICS .COM HEADLINES CQPOLITICS.COM
HEADLINES
The Harvard - educated couple that the Democrats want to install in the White House are part of an elitist , " uppity " class , a Republican congressman said Thursday .
Rep. Lynn Westmoreland , a two - term Republican who represents some of Atlanta 's suburbs , commented about class when asked about the performances under pressure of his party 's vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , and the Democratic nominee 's wife , Michelle Obama , as they introduced themselves to the nation in their separate convention speeches .
AUDIO : Hear Rep.
Westmoreland 's comments " Honestly , I 've never paid that much attention to Michelle Obama , " Westmoreland said .
" Just what little I 've seen of her and Senator [ Barack ]
Obama , is that they 're a member of an elitist class ... that thinks that they 're uppity . "
The 58 - year - old , Atlanta - born congressman declined to elaborate further , though he did repeat one part of his comment when asked to clarify .
" Uppity , you said ? " he was asked .
" Yeah , uppity , " Westmoreland replied .
He made his comments in the U.S. Capitol , where House Republicans are taking turns participating in daily news conferences and speeches in the empty chamber to highlight the issue of high energy prices .
Later , Westmoreland 's press secretary offered two clarifications .
" This was an adjective for elitism , not a code word .
It was obviously not a racially tinged remark , " said the press secretary , Brian Robinson .
Robinson subsequently said that Westmoreland had instructed his staff to check the dictionary to be sure he properly understood the meaning of the word .
The spokesman then e-mailed the dictionary definition : " 1. affecting an attitude of inflated self - esteem ; snobbish .
2 . rebelliously self - assertive ; not inclined to be deferential . "
Westmoreland is white .
The Obamas are black .
Vanessa Beasley , who teaches political rhetoric at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , said " uppity " is a word that hits the ear of African - Americans in a negative way — evoking images of the pre-civil rights era , when powerful whites sometimes punished blacks who spoke up for themselves .
" It has very clear roots in the history of slavery in the South , " Beasley said .
" The term ' uppity ' has such a specific , contextual historic meaning .
It is more evocative of a particular moment in history and particular set of fears that exist today within certain parts of the electorate .
" The racial politics that it reanimates are very worrisome . "
In St. Paul , where the Republican National Convention was in its final day , Robert Gibbs , senior adviser to the Obama campaign , was told of the exchange during a lunch with reporters arranged by the Christian Science Monitor .
" Since Congressman Westmoreland 's never met the Obamas ... maybe he could spend a couple of days with them , he can get out on the bus with a 10 - year - old and a 7 - year - old , they can watch TV together , " Gibbs said .
" We 'd invite Congressman Westmoreland to hit the trail with a real family in America , not just a member Congress . "
A fellow Democrat on the campaign trail had a different response .
Stephen Camp , the Democrat running against Westmoreland , issued a statement declaring that the congressman owed the Obamas an apology .
" Westmoreland should well understand the hurtful connotations of his reference , particularly for his own Georgia constituents , " the challenger said .
Georgia Democrats called for the 3rd District Republican to apologize for the comments he made .
" Political attacks like this do n't lower gas prices one cent , they do n't give one more American access to affordable health care , and they do n't get one more Georgian a job that pays the mortgage .
Lynn Westmoreland should be ashamed of himself , and he should issue a full and immediate apology , " Georgia Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kidd wrote in a press release sent to reporters Thursday night .

Several large websites in Norway have launched an advocacy campaign urging Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 users to upgrade their outdated web browsers .
Leading the charge is Finn.no , an eBay - like site that is apparently the largest site for buying and selling goods in all of Norway ( Finn is Norwegian for " Find " ) .
Earlier this week , Finn . no posted a warning on its web page for visitors running IE 6 .
The banner , seen at right , urges them to ditch IE 6 and upgrade to Internet Explorer 7 .
Dozens of other sites , including the influential tech news website Digi.no , have joined the campaign , but have widened the playing field by suggesting either upgrading to IE 7 or switching to an alternative like Firefox , Safari or , of course , Norway ’s own Opera browser .
The drive is spreading to other countries .
Sites in Sweden , Indonesia and Australia have joined in .
Norwegian blogger Peter Haza is cataloging the participants , and an international wiki called " IE6 – DO NOT WANT " has been set up to track the spreading browsercide .
There ’s a Facebook group , too .
Even Microsoft is supporting the campaign .
Norwegian news site Teknisk Ukeblad reports Thursday that Microsoft Norway ’s Alveberg Isabella says , " We of course hope that our users follow us on [ upgrading ] to Internet Explorer 7 . "
IE 6 , released in 2001 , is the scourge of web programmers , user - experience designers and technical - support staff alike .
The browser is stacked with quirks that cause web pages to render differently from all other browsers , and special considerations must be taken by web builders to accommodate users running IE 6 .
Most wish the browser would just go away , eliminating the need to continue supporting it .
Numbers vary from country to country , but somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the web ’s worldwide users are still running IE 6 — some because they simply do n’t know any better , some because they are stuck with whatever software their companies install on their machines .
Finn .no notes that 17 percent of its users are running IE 6 .
Numbers like that are currently too large for web builders to ignore .
This anti–IE 6 protest is playing out in the shadow of the European Union Competition Commission ’s examination of Microsoft .
The EU ’s anti-trust group , spurred by a December 2007 complaint by Opera Software , is questioning Microsoft ’s practice of bundling IE with Windows on PC desktops .
The group is considering forcing Microsoft and its European hardware partners to offer users the choice of installing one of several browsers when they first boot up a newly purchased PC .
Thanks to Axel from Finn for the tip !

Cleaning House
In terms of sustainable living , the $ 30 / Week household is still a work in progress and we always like take lessons from from folks who have way more experience than us .
On that note , our good friend Mary grew up in central Washington state , where her family grew their own produce , made their own peanut butter and soap ( among many other things ) , and bartered with neighbors for a lot of the stuff they did n’t make at home .
Obviously , she ’s got a ton of tips to share regarding the frugal , sustainable , DIY household .
So , moving away from food for the moment to broader household sustainability , Mary was kind enough to share some information on home - brewed household cleansers .
As you ’ll see , they ’re better for the environment and your wallet than the stuff you buy at the store .
We hope this will be the first of several installments .
Here ’s what she says :
***
I really dislike the idea of using chemicals around the house ( inside and out ) for both safety and environmental reasons .
I also hate that the chemical companies sell you different products for every task , each of which cost anywhere from $ 3 – $ 7 per bottle .
I prefer to use basic ingredients to perform various cleaning tasks without having to purchase multiple bottles of nasty chemicals .
Here ’s what you will need :
Vinegar : A store brand of 5 % acidity vinegar can often be found for $ 2 or so in gallon jugs .
Borax : Found in the laundry aisle , borax is a naturally - occurring mineral salt .
I use 20 Mule Team Borax , which is the only brand I see around here .
Fels Naptha Soap : Found in laundry ailse .
It is an old - school bar laundry soap .
It is sometimes hard to find .
Also used to make your own laundry detergent ( I ’ll write about that later ) .
Baking Soda : Self - explanatory .
I find that it ’s usualy 4 / $ 1 or 2 /$ 1 at the dollar store down the street .
Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol : I find bottles 2 / $ 1 on sale or at the dollar store and stock a few to make many batches of cleaner .
Lemon Juice : Again , if I see a good sale , I buy multiple bottles to keep in the fridge .
I found 16 oz .
bottles for $ 1 a while ago and bought a couple .
Here ’s what to do with it all :
General Household Cleaner :
For use on floors , glass , kitchen and bathroom surfaces , even carpet stains .
250 ml. each of water , white vinegar , and isopropyl “ rubbing ” alcohol .
Add two drops of biodegradable dish soap ( such as Seventh Generation ) and shake .
I use a spray bottle that I picked up at the hardware store for $ 1 that has the measurements on the side .
You can also just go on the equal parts rule and make different size batches .
Ink Stains :
This is a tough one , but when the dog got a hold of a Sharpie on top of our favorite quilt , I had to experiment until I could get the stains out .
I ’ve used this method a few times now , all with perfect success .
Pour straight rubbing alcohol on the spot and let sit for a few minutes .
Sprinkle with baking soda and let the baking soda sit until it starts soaking up the ink ( yes , it actually turns color ) .
Scrape off and discard .
Repeat multiple times until most of the spot is gone .
Follow with some vinegar on the next round of baking soda until it foams and use a rag or cleaning brush to scrub .
Repeat until the spot is gone .
For good measure , I rub a bar of Fels Naptha soap on the area and launder in cold water with 1/4 cup Borax .
Soap Scum , Mildew Cleaner :
Use for the shower , etc .
I use undiluted vinegar for this and it comes right off .
Greasy dishes : I use a biodegradable dish soap ( usually Seventh Generation ) which I love , but sometimes it ca n’t cut the greasiest of dishes .
For very greasy pans , I keep a bottle of lemon juice handy in the fridge and use a healthy squeeze of it in the dish water .
Vinegar also works to cut grease .
Stinky dishes , cutting boards , etc :
For a cutting board that reeks of onion , I make a paste of water and baking soda and rub it down before washing .
This gets the smell out that the dish soap sometimes leaves behind .
Likewise , if I have a tupperware container that is stinky ( yes , I eat a lot of onions ) , I fill it with either vinegar or lemon juice diluted with water .
I leave that to soak for a bit , then wash .
You can use various combinations of this .
I recently used lemon juice and vinegar together on a storage container that was both greasy and smelly and it finally got it clean .
Weeding : I love doing yard work and enjoy gardening , but I do not believe in non-organic methods .
I use many well - known and traditional organic gardening methods and products , but also find that these regular household ingredients are useful in the garden .
For weeds and grass growing in the driveway or in the sidewalks , I pour vinegar or boiling water on them .
Both work equally well , but I use them interchangeably depending on the size of the job at hand .
Boiling water burns the weeds and kills them .
As you can imagine , you sometimes have to make several pots of boiling water to clear a driveway .
Vinegar , when poured directly on the weeds , is very acidic and therefore causes them to die .
Boiling water is good with a steady hand , when used around other plants , as it will only kill what it touches .
Vinegar is fast and easy if used in an area where there are no other plants , as the acidity will spread in a limited area as it is diluted and spread through the soil with watering .
It may spread 6 - 12 inches with watering , but it is n’t harmful in the long - run because it ultimately does n’t change the soil acidity .
Pest Control :
If you have any problems with ants , there are many things that I will use to end the infestation .
Ants will not cross Borax , Baking Soda , Talcum Powder , or Chalk , as the crystals are sharp and harm their bodies .
I also understand that it ’s fatal for them if they eat it .
Not a pretty thought , but it is certainly better than putting poising in your home and let ’s face it ; you ’re not going to humanely trap ants and release them into the wild !
You can mix some sugar with any of these to make a bait to attract the ants to a certain place , though I prefer to use them around perimeters to deter , rather than bait and kill once they are in .
Peppermint oil ( or Dr. Bronner ’s peppermint soap ) should also be helpful if you have ants gathering on houseplants , as they sometimes do .
You can mix the peppermint with water in a spray bottle and spray the plant .
Dr. Bronners peppermint soap can make a great multi-insect insecticidal soap that also repels certain insects with the peppermint oils contained within combined with the castile soap .
One easy treatment , for sure !
Stained Toilets : I use borax to soak the toilet instead of bleach and it is great for removing toilet stains .
Just dissolve 1/4 cup of borax in the toilet and let sit and it will remove odors and stains .
Best of all , it does n’t smell like bleach !
Stinky Clothes :
When you have impossible clothing smells ( sitting around a campfire , etc. ) it helps a lot to put 1 / 4 cup of borax in with the load of laundry .
My Mom also says vinegar works well , but I ’ve always relied on borax .

Awesome .
Thanks ,
Mary !
I went to a local park and had lunch with a friend of mine today .
It ’s beautiful here , but we can tell that it ’s Summer ’s last attempt to hold Autumn at bay , and we ’ll be suffering through the misery of sixty degree afternoons soon enough .
There ’s even rumor of an inch of rain before the end of the year , which we both know will turn our freeways deadly .
Um , it also seemed like a good excuse to walk away from the computer and enjoy actual human contact for a change .
While we ate sandwiches and watched little kids chase each other , we talked about the election .
We ’re two small blue spots in a sea of red here , and we ’d shared hopes and fears over the last several months .
“ I guess we ’re supposed to be gracious in victory , ” I said , “ but I ’m profoundly offended to hear ‘ we need to look forward and not backward ’ and ‘ we need to stop being so partisan ’ from the very same fucking motherfuckers who have been telling us that we hate our country and love terrorists for the last eight years ?
These are the same people who worked really hard to make sure that I and everyone who did n’t agree with their blind support of Bush and Bush policies did n’t feel welcome in our own fucking country for eight years ! ”
I looked down at my hands , which had involuntarily clenched into fists .
I felt a frightening and unexpected , uncharacteristic fury rise in my chest .
“ I want to grab these people by the throat and scream at them ‘ HOW DO YOU LIKE IT FUCKER ?!
YOU LOST !
YOU FAIL ! YOU GO HOME NOW ! ’ ”
I kept my voice low , but was really worked up , shocked and horrified at the level of anger I was feeling .
We looked at each other for a moment .
I was embarrassed by my outburst .
This really is n’t like me .
Fortunately , my friend is incredibly cool and unflappable .
She is also incredibly wise .
She put her sandwich down and wiped the corners of her mouth with a paper napkin .
She pointed out at the different people in the park and said , “ They are home .
We share this country , all of us , whether we like it or not .
“ We voted against intolerance for people that do n’t share ‘ the right ’ views because we and people we respect and admire have been the victims of intolerance for too long .
We voted against hypocrisy and fear and hate .
We voted for a chance to change . ”
I unclenched my fists and looked at little half - moons in the palms of my hands .
“ I should feel celebratory .
I should feel happy and relieved .
Why in the world do I suddenly feel so angry ? ”
“ Seething quietly and privately is understandable and totally warranted .
Just , every time you want to grab someone by the throat , try to remember how both Obama and McCain have always reacted to boos from their audiences .
One man said ‘ we do n’t need any more of that ’ – and that ’s the administration we voted for .
Because we do n’t need any more of that .
We need to chip away at the havens of hate in this country until there is nothing left for the haters to fight with .
Because that is going to be the biggest payback of all .
“ Someday , the people that ‘ do n’t feel welcome ’ in a tolerant and just place are n’t going to feel welcome anywhere .
“ We do n’t need to take any shit from anyone , but we can not become the bullies we ’ve hated .
Or else we did n’t win anything at all . ”
While I processed all of this , she smiled and added , “ Yes , my horse is very high , and I like it that way .
I can see a long way from up here . ”
“ Damn .
You ’re wise , ” I said .
“ I ’m going to have to write down ‘ We do n’t need any more of that ’ and use it to get over eight years of resentment .
It ’s going to take awhile to get over being called a traitor and being told to , effectively , ‘ shut up and sing , ’ but you ’re absolutely right .
We can not become the bullies we ’ve hated . ”
We finished our sandwiches , and walked through the park before we both had to get home to our families .
“ Maybe I should n’t have had a second cup of coffee this morning , ” I offered .
“ I ’m sure you ’ll get your cool back once it wears off . ”
I hope she ’s right .
Afterthought :
This does n’t mean that progressives suddenly drop our agenda to fundamentally change things .
This does n’t mean that we do n’t fight for what we believe in over the next four and hopefully eight years .
This means that , as human beings and as Americans , we can choose to live in John McCain ’s vision of an angry , divided , fearful America , or Barack Obama ’s vision of a tolerant , united , hopeful America .
It ’s not going to be easy for me , especially after the hateful , divisive campaign McCain ran and eight years of being screamed at by George Bush 's True Believers .
But as my friend said , “ We need to chip away at the havens of hate in this country until there is nothing left for the haters to fight with .
Because that is going to be the biggest payback of all … we can not become the bullies we ’ve hated .
Or else we did n’t win anything at all . ”
Now Zimbabwe introduces the $ 100TRILLION note - worth about £ 22
Inflation is rife with prices doubling daily - so in its next effort to ease the cash shortage Zimbabwe is issuing a $ Z100 trillion dollar banknote .
Equivalent to about £ 20 on the black market , the note is part of the latest family of currency to be released by the African country 's central bank to tackle hyperinflation , state media said .
Food and fuel are in short supply in Zimbabwe , a cholera epidemic has killed more than 2,000 and a deadlock between President Robert Mugabe and the opposition has put hopes of ending the crisis on hold .
A Zimbabwean woman is estatic after receiving food aid through Oxfam International in Chirumhanzi , about 250 kilometres south - east of Harare as the country faces crisis in its peak hunger period
Hyper-inflation has forced the central bank to continue to release new banknotes which quickly become almost worthless .
There is an official exchange rate , but most Zimbabweans resort to the informal market for currency transactions .
In addition to the Z$ 100 trillion dollar note , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe plans to launch Z$ 10 trillion , Z$ 20 trillion and Z$ 50 trillion notes , the Herald newspaper reported .
' In a move meant to ensure that the public has access to their money from banks , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has introduced a new family of banknotes which will gradually come into circulation , starting with the Z$ 10 trillion , ' the Herald said , citing a statement from the central bank .
Previous issues of new banknotes have done little to curb the cash crunch faced by Zimbabweans , who often line up for hours outside banks to withdraw barely enough to buy a loaf of bread .
Critics blame the economic meltdown on mismanagement by Mugabe 's government , including the seizure and redistribution of thousands of white - owned farms .
The once - thriving agricultural sector has fallen into ruin .
The veteran Zimbabwean leader , in power since independence from Britain in 1980 , says Western sanctions are the main cause of the economic crisis and worsening humanitarian picture .
Political analysts say the establishment of a unity government between Mugabe 's ZANU - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) is the best hope of reversing the economic slide and worsening humanitarian crisis .
But power - sharing talks are deadlocked over the control of important government ministries .
Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of trying to assign the MDC a junior role and has demanded the release of detained opposition members before a deal is implemented .
The presidents of regional powers South Africa and Mozambique will meet political parties in Zimbabwe on Monday in a new regional push to break the impasse , South Africa 's government said yesterday .
From wrapping the ice - cap in blankets to moving the Earth further from the Sun ... 10 mad ways to save the planet
Can the world be saved from global warming ?
Opinion about the state of our planet is fiercely divided - at one end of the spectrum there are the gloom - mongers who are convinced we are all doomed , while at the other there are those who believe that planet Earth will simply heal itself .
But in between is an army of scientists who have spent years coming up with some very bizarre solutions .
Their inventions amount to the most astonishingly ambitious catalogue of ideas ever dreamed up by mankind , from fake volcanoes to trillions of sunshades in space .
From wrapping the ice - cap in blankets to moving the Earth further from the Sun , can anything stop climate change
Some of these madcap solutions are being put to the test in a Discovery Channel investigation to be screened in a series called Ways To Save The Planet .
Here , Nigel Blundell gives an exclusive preview of the results so far ...
SEED THE OCEANS WITH IRON FILINGS
British scientists recently announced that melting icebergs are triggering a natural process that could reverse climate change .
The team discovered that minute iron particles released by the melting ice are causing vast blooms of healthy green algae .
The algae , thriving on its ' iron supplement ' diet , rises to the surface and absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis .
The algae then sinks to the ocean floor , trapping the harmful greenhouse gas and preventing it from being released back into the atmosphere .
As a result of these findings , a ground - breaking experiment will take place this month off the coast of South Georgia , 800 miles southeast of the Falklands .
An international team will sail from Cape Town to ' seed ' the Great Southern Ocean with several tons of iron sulphate to create an artificial bloom of algae .
If successful , it is claimed that 15 tankers dropping iron particles non-stop could absorb all carbon emissions for a decade .
COST : An estimated £ 10 billion .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 8/10
MIRRORS OVER THE SAHARA
A variation of the same theme is the suggestion that the sun 's rays can be bounced back into space by turning deserts into giant mirrors .
The amount of sunlight reflected back into the sky naturally averages 30 per cent - but in areas covered by snow or ice , it 's a healthy 90 per cent .
But the ice caps are melting fast .
To counter this , say scientists , we would need to lay vast sheets of reflective material across 1.2 million square miles of the Sahara Desert , at a cost of £ 20 billion over ten years .
( A similar idea is to float immense artificial islands of white plastic in the oceans . )
One flaw in the plan is that it would require polyester film to be manufactured in unprecedented quantities , which in itself would add to the planet 's carbon emissions .
COST : Upwards of £ 50 billion .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 1/10
Smoke and mirrors :
Or a realistic way to save the planet ?
A SUNSHIELD IN SPACE
We know that blocking sunlight can counter global warming , so scientists are considering the notion of shading the planet with mirrors .
This would mean sending trillions of ultra - thin lenses into space to deflect the sun 's rays .
Arizona University astronomer Roger Angel suggests using electro - magnetically powered spacecraft ( a concept NASA is already exploring ) to blast the silicon lenses into orbit .
Once in place , they would create a 100,000 square - mile sunshade , reducing the sun 's rays by about two per cent .
British - born Prof Angel has already produced the prototype of the lenses .
Each is 3ft across , but wafer - thin and etched with a diffraction pattern that will cause the sun 's rays to change direction .
In an experiment in a giant hangar , a laser representing the sun was aimed at a model of Earth , with a single lens to protect it .
When the laser beam hit the lens , it split into a number of smaller beams that were successfully diffracted away from the model Earth .
COST : An annual bill of £ 70 billion over 50 years .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 5/10
ARTIFICIAL WEATHER
It has been a long - held dream - creating artificial weather .
Now a Scottish engineer says it can be done , by spraying salt into the clouds .
Stephen Salter , of Edinburgh University , and John Latham , a physicist based at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado , suggest launching unmanned windpowered ships into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans , which would suck up saltwater and spray a fine mist into the air .
This would increase the density and whiteness of the cloud cover - making them reflect four per cent more solar energy back into space .
Salter and Latham would like to see a flotilla of 1,500 ships roaming the world 's oceans to ' salt ' clouds and create the larger cloud droplets needed to reflect solar rays .
An additional immediate effect would be a local cooling of the sea surface , so the technique could be targeted around shrinking polar ice .
COST : Between £ 1 million and £ 2 million for each of the initial 1,500 ships .
But this fleet would have to expand by an extra 50 ships a year to keep pace with the current rate of increase in carbon - dioxide levels .

ARTIFICIAL VOLCANOES
It sounds scary , but a Nobel Prize winning scientist has suggested that we simulate volcanic eruptions to create a sun-blocking haze in the stratosphere .
Atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen proposes using artillery shells or large balloons full of sulphur - dioxide to create a huge cloud in the atmosphere , ten miles above the Earth , thereby duplicating the effect of a major volcano erupting and blocking out the sun 's rays .
He claims he has solid data to support his controversial theory that ' injecting one million tons of sulphur into the atmosphere a year would cool down the climate until the greenhouse effect is wiped out ' .
Some environmentalists take the notion seriously .
' This idea should at least be examined , ' said Steve Sawyer , a policy adviser for Greenpeace .
' As a last resort , it could buy us a few decades . '
COST : Crutzen says the bill for saving the planet might be £ 150 billion - though a ' relatively affordable ' £ 20 - £ 30 billion worth would cool the atmosphere for two years .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 2/10
FACTORY FILTERS
Coal - fired power stations pump tons of bad gas into the atmosphere - the 850 new ones planned by China and India by 2012 will produce five times as much pollution as the Kyoto Protocol aims to eliminate .
It has already been proved that super - filters fitted to factory smokestacks can turn pollution into harmless baking soda .
Plastic mesh filters being tested on the smokestacks of Texas power plants trap 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide emitted which , when mixed with sodium hydroxide , is turned into sodium bicarbonate , which can be used in everything from baking to industrial cleaning .
Mark Clayton , of the U.S. company Skyonic , which developed the process , says : ' With the value of the by - products produced ( including chlorine and hydrogen ) , the process can almost pay for itself . '
COST : As little as zero .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 9/10
JELLYFISH FARMS
One way in which the planet might ' heal itself ' is revealed in the TV natural history documentary Swarm , to be screened on BBC1 on Sunday at 9 pm .
The programme will demonstrate that animal swarms are not all bad news - as in the case of salps ; transparent jellyfish - like creatures whose numbers are exploding due to the warming of the oceans .
A single swarm of these little fishy filters consumes 4,000 tons of carbon - absorbing phytoplankton plants every day , removing carbon from the oceans .
Scientists propose creating vast oceanic processing plants to breed salps by the trillion , using them as biological filters to cleanse the atmosphere .
COST : £ 1 million per farm , but maintenance costs would be minimal - because nature would do all the work for us .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 8/10
Jellyfish could help the planet ' heal itself ' according to scientists
WRAPPING UP GREENLAND
We have been warned that continuing Arctic melting could cause catastrophic worldwide flooding .
Could giant blankets be the first step in stemming that tide ?
Nobel Prize - winning scientist Dr Jason
Box believes we can prevent glaciers from melting by simply covering them with giant blankets that will reflect the power of the sun .
The idea was inspired by similar shrouds already used in Alpine ski resorts .
Dr Box , of the Byrd Polar Research Center , Ohio State University , is convinced that his felt - like , man -made material is resilient enough for Arctic conditions - and is already testing the theory .
Ten thousand square metres of specially designed blankets were airlifted to Greenland to lay over more than two acres of the melt zone .
The long - term results are awaited .
COST : Covering just the melt zone of Greenland alone would mean manufacturing 770 million blankets at a cost of £ 250 billion .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 4/10
REPLANT FORESTS - FROM THE AIR
Forests are great carbon consumers and can absorb 15 per cent of global emissions - if we keep enough of them .
But half of the world 's forests have already been cut or burned down and it is estimated that only 20 per cent will remain by 2030 .
But American scientists have devised an ambitious plan to speed up the replanting process .
How successful this could be will be proved by an experiment taking place now .
Following the devastation of hurricanes Katrina and Rita , thousands of acres of Louisiana mangrove forests were left bare .
The huge swathe of land presented a perfect proving ground for the notion of using aircraft to re-establish the forest by dropping tens of thousands of canisters , each holding a tree seedling which will self - plant itself .
COST : £ 10 million per forest area .
FEASIBILITY RATING : 7/10
MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH !
We are now in the realm of science fiction , but why not cool down the Earth by moving the planet farther away from the sun ?
This idea , published in the professional journal Astrophysics And Space Science , involves shifting the Earth 's orbit .
All that is needed to achieve this is a usefully sized asteroid , about 60 miles long , say the report 's authors .
The asteroid , once located , would be used as a ' gravitational sling shot ' by strapping a rocket to it and putting it in an orbit around the solar system .
By having the asteroid pass close enough to Earth , it would slowly push the planet farther and farther away from the sun .
There are a couple of drawbacks , of course .
Every time the asteroid passed by , it would cause super - storms and tsunamis .
If it accidentally collided with Earth , it would eliminate all life on the planet .
And if it did n't , it would take 6,000,000,000 years to finish the job .
COST : Out of this world .

Fantasy Island star Ricardo Montalban died today at 6:30 a.m. Radaronline.com has learned .
He passed away at his home , lovingly referred to as “ Casa Montalban ” by his family , in Los Angeles .
Emmy winner Montalban , 88 , who retained his Mexican citizenship throughout his nearly 60 years of stardom , passed peacefully away from “ natural causes ” with his daughter and nurses with him , Gilbert Smith , Montalban ’s son in law , told Radaronline.com .
His wife of 63 years , Georgiana Young , preceded him in death last year .
Montalban lived in severe pain for many years , due to a spinal injury cause from a fall from a horse in 1951 while filming the Western The Wide Missouri .
Despite surgery , the agony stayed with him and largely confined him to a wheelchair in the latter years of his life .
His son - in - law Gilbert told Radaronline.com : “ He was at peace when he died .
His suffering had ended .
He was very conscious of his own mortality and he knew death was coming .
He knew it was his time .
“ His religion and his moral backbone carried him through the tough times . ”
Montalban performed in 61 movies , including Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , and most recently provided voice for The Ant Bully and , on television , the voice for a Family Guy episode .
In all , he was in 35 television shows , including the long - running “ Fantasy Island . ”
He was a pop culture icon in the 1970s , propelled to that status by his TV commercial for the 1975 Chrysler Cordoba .
Watch the video for that commercial here , with Montalban delivering the immortal phrase “ soft Corinthian leather ” in his signature manner .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : X Haskell Bindings
Folks , I 'd like to announce a preview - release of the X Haskell Bindings .
The goal of the library is to provide low - level access to the X11 protocol , in the spirit of the X C Bindings
This is a " preview " because I expect that the interface will still need to change - but I do plan on bump the minor - version number when that happens .
On Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xhb
What works :
All X protocol requests have corresponding functions .
I have n't tested all of them .
Requests are sent asynchronously - the caller is not blocked until they need to examine the result of the request Errors and Events are unpacked into Haskell data types
It should be safe to use the same connection in multiple threads
What needs improvement : * There 's no documentation - you pretty much need to be sitting down with the X Protocol reference while using this library .
Once we can get documentation into the XML that this library is generated from , we should be able to generate Haddock documentation at the same time *
A lot of parameters are specified using integer types , even though a proper Haskell enum - like data type exists .
*
Many functions take a ValueParam argument , which is not fun to work with in a language like Haskell .
I have plans for how to make these more type - safe , but this is something else that requires more information in the XML protocol descriptions .
*
There 's no way to share a connection between XHB and libraries built against the Xlib bindings .
* I have n't done any benchmarking , so it 's possible that all of this is pretty slow .
Keep in mind that this is a library for the X Protocol - it alone is not a replacement for XLib - XLib does a lot more than pushing and pulling on a file - handle .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Chrysler LLC on Friday received an initial $ 4 billion emergency loan from the U.S. government , two days after the government completed a parallel payout to its larger rival General Motors Corp .

“ This initial loan will allow the company to continue an orderly restructuring , ” Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli said in a statement .
U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin confirmed that the government had sent the $ 4 billion in funds to Chrysler on Friday .
General Motors Corp received $ 4 billion in emergency loans on Wednesday .
Both Chrysler and GM have said they need the infusion of government cash to meet payouts to suppliers at a time when a plunge in auto sales has drained their cash holdings .
Officials have not spelled out why the loan to GM and a separate $ 6 billion funding for its affiliated finance firm GMAC were completed ahead of the Chrysler transaction .
In an email to employees , Nardelli suggested that the complexity of the deals had delayed the first payout to Chrysler , which had been expected to be completed before the end of the year .
“ The Treasury Department has been working to complete the multiple , complex financial arrangements quickly and sequentially .
The magnitude of these discussions was significant , ” Nardelli said .
When major automakers release results on Monday , December auto sales are expected to show that industry - wide sales fell to the lowest full - year level since 1992 .
Under terms of the government bailout , Chrysler and GM will have to submit restructuring plans by mid-February and demonstrate that they are viable by the end of March .
Chrysler is controlled by Cerberus Capital Management , and as the only privately held of the Detroit - based automakers it faced the most scrutiny in congressional hearings on the proposed bailout for the industry .
Cerberus also owns 51 percent of GMAC .
The Bush administration approved a $ 17.4 billion bailout for the auto operations of GM and Chrysler in December .
Of that total , GM has been promised another $ 9.4 billion in government loans under that program in addition to the $ 4 billion payment made on Wednesday .
The final $ 4 billion of the bailout approved for GM will require Congress to approve the funding .
Chrysler was given $ 4 billion by the U.S. government after asking for $ 7 billon .
The bailout represents the second U.S. government rescue of Chrysler in 28 years .
Rival Ford Motor
Co has not sought government loans but has asked for a $ 9 billion line of credit it could tap if business conditions worsen beyond its projections .

Atom - sized Quantum Dots
Newly discovered property of silicon atoms may shrink computers
Video Click below for a description and an animated depiction of the properties of atomic quantum dots .
Launch Video Robert A. Wolkow / University of Alberta * Macromedia Flash Player 8 is required to view video .
INDIVIDUAL SILICON ATOMS can exhibit electronic properties typical of quantum dots composed of thousands of atoms , according to researchers at Canada 's National Institute for Nanotechnology and the University of Alberta , Edmonton ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 2009 , 102 , 046805 ) .
The discovery of atom - sized quantum dots and the associated room - temperature control over individual electrons may lead to a new type of circuitry that drives miniature , low - power computers .
Robert A. Wolkow
The two electrons in a quantum - dot Si 4 " molecule " can pinned in place ( blue and pink ) by judicious positioning of external charges ( green circles ) .
Semiconductor nanocrystals are often called quantum dots because , among other reasons , their electronic energy levels are quantized and discrete — like an atom's .
Researchers are studying that property , which ties the color of colloidal nanocrystals to their size for applications such as computing .
The idea is to use the electronic states of quantum dots , which are far smaller than today 's transistors , to represent the zeros and ones of digital processing .
At present , the working material for that research thrust is some the smallest quantum dots readily available — crystals of about 1,000 atoms .
But to use them for computations , researchers must chill the nanocrystals to millikelvin temperatures to prevent them from flipping spontaneously between electronic states .
The Edmonton team , led by Robert A. Wolkow , has discovered a way to sidestep those limitations .
Using a scanning tunneling microscope to probe hydrogen - blanketed silicon , the group showed that kicking out a hydrogen atom bonded to silicon results in a negatively charged Si atom that behaves like a quantum dot .
Kicking out another nearby hydrogen leads to an artificial Si 2 molecule with one electron shuttling between the two atoms ( similar to H 2 + ) .
Then by using a large charge , the team showed that this " bonding " electron can be pins at will , thereby locking the quantum dot into a given electronic state that remains stable even at room temperature .
" These results are remarkable , " says Craig S. Lent , professor of electrical engineering at the University of Notre Dame .
Wolkow 's group has demonstrated a new binary switching mechanism that operates at room temperature and at a truly atomic size scale , he explains .
Lent adds
" The world is looking for a new binary switch to replace the transistor when size scaling ends .
This just might be it . "

It ’s beginning to look like Bernie Madoff ’s business model had less in common with a hedge fund or investment management firm than it did with an online virtual reality game .
Sort of a Sim City for investors .
The money sent in was real : everything thereafter was from Oz .
Until now , we ’ve thought of Madoff ’s business as another financial management operation gone crooked .
Think rogue currency traders , badly hedged positions , or just pump and dump .
But the Madoff scandal may be truly unique .
Consider this , from the Boston Globe :
A federal agency that regulates brokerage firms says there is no record of Madoff ’s investment funds placing trades through his brokerage operation .
That leaves only two options – either he was placing trades only through other firms , which would be highly unusual , or he was not placing any trades .
" There was no evidence of the Madoff broker - dealer executing trades for the [ Madoff ] investment adviser , " said Herb Perone , spokesman for the regulatory group , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority [ FINRA ]
What are the implications ?
• If there were no trades , then there were no investment gains .
The “ profits ” he made were a myth .
• Madoff has claimed he made money only on trading commissions — but if there were no trades , then there were no commissions .
• The statements he issued to investors were truly fictitious .
His “ statements ” were to real accounts as an avatar is to a gamer .
All an investor could know for sure was that you gave Madoff money , and you got back pieces of computer paper with ink on them .
Let ’s say you sent in $ 1 M through a feeder fund .
You got back monthly “ statements . ”
Let ’s say you got a return of 15 % .
In five years , you “ owned ” $ 2 M .
But follow the money .
Your original $ 1 M went to Madoff ’s bank account .
Each year , Madoff took out a few percent ( “ transaction fees ” ) , and your feeder fund took 20 % of your “ profits . ”
( Neither “ transaction ” nor “ profit , ” of course , are real ; the only thing real is that Madoff and the feeders took money out ) .
In five years , that ’s about $ 400 K .
Instead of $ 2 M , you know “ own ” $ 600 K .
And of course , “ own ” belongs in quotes too .
Even that was bupkus .
Virtual reality money .
Sim City money .

In the real world , it did n’t exist except in Bernie ’s bank account and a computer program .
But it did exist , you say ; people got their money back !
Close your eyes and envision Christopher Walken , in his best Balls of Fury voice , saying , “ What paht of ‘ Ponzi Scheme ’ dint you unduhstand ? ”
I ’ve seen some Madoff statements .
They look like day - trader accounts .
They show page after page of “ transactions , ” without any subtotals or easy way of matching buy / sell orders .
If you checked , the market prices all looked valid .
They were .
They just were n’t hooked up to a real account .
He was in effect running an entire trading system in simulation mode — and telling everyone it was real .
If you looked at the bottom of your “ statement , ” you ’d find Madoff ’s broker - dealer firm ’s name .
Except — it apparently never made those trades .
Many people believe it ’s impossible that one man could pull all this off .
I ’m not so sure .
Madoff made his reputation on building complex financial systems , covering the full range of investment management — accounts , trades , taxes , clearinghouses , balances .
All he had to do was switch the input signal from real accounts to simulated accounts .
And every programmer knows what happens then : GIGO — Garbage In , Garbage Out .
Call it the Madoff Virtual Reality Trading Simulation Game .
And pay no attention to that man behind the curtain .
There is a great deal of controversy about how much uranium will be available for future use .
I decided to check to see for myself , and came to the conclusion that we are likely headed for problems within the next ten years .
Below the fold are a few things I discovered , in looking through reports available on the Internet .
Supply Disagreement
How much uranium is " out there " ?
One gets a very different answer if one looks at ( 1 ) known concentrations that are suitable for ore , versus ( 2 ) the amount that is theoretically available , if one considers all of the dilute amounts available in rocks almost everywhere , and in seawater .
Suppose we start from the point of known amounts hopefully suitable for ore .
In Figure 1 above , the Energy Watch Group ( see this 2006 report ) takes three levels of reserves and spreads them out in likely production patterns .
The dark orange section represents " reasonably assured resources " that can be economically mined for $ 40 per kilogram or less .
The lighter orange section represents " reasonably assured resources " for $ 130 per kilogram or less .
Current spot prices are about $ 50 pound , or $ 110 kilogram , so current prices are now somewhere between these two levels .
The top section in light blue adds " inferred resources " .
These are n't resources that anyone actually has found and examined .
These are resources that one would hope would be somewhere that we have n't looked yet .
Note that in the chart above , there is a likely shortfall even with the light blue " inferred resources " included .
The United States has been purchasing recycled Russian bomb material since 1994 , and our contract to purchase it continues until 2013 .
We also have plans to continue buying recycled Russian bomb material after 2013 , and to recycle American bombs .
These are the kinds of programs which are contemplated in the Energy Watch Group analysis .
Even with these in place , their analysis indicates a possible shortfall .
The Energy Watch Group is not the only one who has looked at the question of the adequacy of uranium resources .
The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a study in 2001 called Analysis of Uranium Supply to 2050 .
Its analysis also shows a peak and decline of uranium supply , with a peak occurring in 2024 , assuming all resources , including the highest cost resources , can be extracted .
If only lower cost resources can be extracted , the peak will be sooner .
Figure 2 . IAEA projection of market - based production from study reasonably assured resources by cost category - middle demand case .
What do other agencies have to say about these projections ?
The World Nuclear Association issued a report called Supply of Uranium in June 2008 in which it explains how there will be plenty of supply .
These are excerpts from the report :
From time to time concerns are raised that the known resources might be insufficient when judged as a multiple of present rate of use .
But this is the Limits to Growth fallacy , a major intellectual blunder recycled from the 1970s , which takes no account of the very limited nature of the knowledge we have at any time of what is actually in the Earth 's crust .
Our knowledge of geology is such that we can be confident that identified resources of metal minerals are a small fraction of what is there .
Uranium supply news is usually framed within a short - term perspective .
It concerns who is producing with what resources , who might produce or sell , and how does this balance with demand ?
However , long - term supply analysis enters the realm of resource economics .
This discipline has as a central concern the understanding of not just supply / demand / price dynamics for known resources , but also the mechanisms for replacing resources with new ones presently unknown .
Such a focus on sustainability of supply is unique to the long view .
Normally - functioning metals markets and technology change provide the drivers to ensure that supply at costs affordable to consumers is continuously replenished , both through the discovery of new resources and the re-definition ( in economic terms ) of known ones .
Figure 3 . WNA Explanation as to why Supply Concerns are Unwarranted
The World Nuclear Association ( with the above faith - based statements ) also published a report for £ 375.00 called
The global nuclear fuel market : supply and demand 2007 - 2030 .
I do not have a copy of this report , but according to the EIA Energy Outlook 2008 , WNA is forecasting that world uranium production will peak in 2015 , before slowly declining to 90 % of its peak level in 2030 .
It is strange that the report I quoted above , available on their website , fails to mention this .
In this section , I have not talked about the accuracy of the reserve amounts .
In several countries , production has stopped or nearly stopped after available resources have been exhausted .
If one compares the reserve figures prior to exhaustion to the amount actually produced , one finds that the stated uranium reserves were significantly higher than the production actually achieved .
Below is a chart by Energy Watch Group comparing France 's reserves with its actual uranium production .
This kind of pattern does not give one much confidence that mining companies will actually be able to convert the reserves ( as published by nuclear organizations , which are higher than individual company estimates ) into production .
Figure 4 . Uranium production for France , compared to prior reserve estimates
Where We Are Now
Energy Watch Group shows this graph of actual production versus demand through 2005 :
Figure 5 . EWG World Production vs Demand
More recent data from the WNA indicates that world production since 2005 has been flat :
Figure 6 . WNA Uranium Production by Country
Uranium production for the United States continues at a very low level , compared to the amount we use as fuel in nuclear reactors .
Recent EIA data shows that 2008 production has declined from the level produced in 2006 and 2007 , despite rising numbers of people working in mines and greater expenditure ( see this report and this one ) :
Figure 7 . US Uranium Production vs Amounts Loaded into Nuclear Reactors , based on EIA Data
The EIA in International Energy Outlook 2008 says there is no problem : there are lots of reserves ( the same ones as in Figure 1 , including the light blue ) .
It also says :
The relatively high price of uranium already is leading to increased output .
New mines in Australia , Canada , Kazakhstan , Brazil , and India are expected to add 30,000 metric tons of production capacity by 2010 .
Adding new mines takes a long time -- one often sees 8 to 10 years quoted as a reasonable time frame .
Production in 2007 was only 41,000 metric tons , so increasing production by 30,000 metric tons would represent a 73 % increase .
This does n't seem to be happening .
If we look at news reports , we find that mining companies are struggling financially , because of high debt loads and low prices available for their products .
Production plans are being cut back or delayed .
In Canada , the big new project is Cigar Lake , under development by Cameco .
I have n't seen production estimates for the mine , but would guess that they are of the order magnitude of 10,000 metric tons of production per year .
Cameco began work on the mine in 2001 , but the mine has repeatedly flooded .
The mine has very high grade ore ( 20 % ) , but is located below the water table .
The plan is to try to freeze the ground to stabilize the area for mining .
The most recent flood was in August 2008 .
Prior to the latest flood , the planned production date was 2011 .
No new date has been set .
Cameco has not given up yet , but one wonders whether the problems with this mine will ever be worked out .
The other very large project which many had great hopes for was the BHP Billiton 's Olympic Dam expansion in Australia .
The project would have cost about $ 15 billion , and increased world uranium production by something like 8 million metric tons a year .
The expansion is now being scaled back and delayed , because of the current financial situation .
If we read Cameco 's latest report about its mine in Kazakhstan , its report is less than glowing .
In describing its new Inkai mine , it reports sulphuric acid shortages , the Kazakh government reneging on the agreed upon tax rate , and an after - the - fact change in the subsoil law .
What does seem to be happening is a grab for available mines by countries like China and Japan .
These countries will be needing fuel for nuclear reactors and cannot see good long - term sources of supply .
For example , Ranger is the second largest mine in the world , representing 11 % of 2007 world production .
The Japanaese are trying to get a controlling interest in Ranger and in other mines , according to Japan : Securing Uranium Supply .
China has also been trying to invest in mines .
It has been having discussions with BHP Billiton , operator of Olympic Dam in Australia .
The United States believes that the free market will provide and is not trying to buy up assets .
Instead , we are trying to ramp up US production , but with little success so far .
The US is very dependent on foreign imports , as shown in Figure 7 , especially recycled Russian bomb material , which currently makes up 50 % of nuclear fuel .
Since about 20 % of US electricity is from uranium , this means that 10 % of our electricity supply is obtained from recycled Russian bombs .
Most of the remainder of our nuclear electric supply is from other overseas sources .
With current world financial problems , one wonders how secure these sources are .
Also , we will need to find additional sources when the Russian bomb contract runs out it 2013 .
How Do We Mine the Uranium ?
The amount of uranium available depends upon what mining techniques are available and how pollution is handled .
When countries first started producing fuel in the 1950 - 1980 period , there was little concern about pollution .
Open pit and underground mines were used to produce huge volumes of uranium .
Without adequate pollution control , there were often serious pollution problems .
Eventually , in the United States , Superfund was called upon to try to clean up many of these sites , and people became disenchanted with this approach to mining .
The cost of the Superfund clean - up was never charged back to the uranium industry , so analysts looking at statistics such as EROEI got a more favorable view of the industry than would otherwise be the case .
A USGS Report Issued in 2002 indicates that because of dissatisfaction with the pollution problems of open pit and underground mines , these mines are difficult to get permitted .
Instead , most mines now being built are in situ leaching ( ISL ) mines .
ISL mines can't be built everywhere -- only where conditions are right for them .
The need to use ISL mines has cut back significantly on the sites available for building mines , but reserve statistics ( at least in the United States ) do n't reflect this .
The 2002 USGS report says :
Future uranium mining in the U.S.A. will be mainly by ISL mining of large reserves in Tertiary sandstone formations in Wyoming , Nebraska , and Texas .
Mining of equally large reserves of uranium in Mesozoic sandstone formations in the Colorado Plateau region is less amenable to ISL .
It also says :
The national uranium resource assessment completed by the DOE in 1980 is significantly out of date .
A new Federal assessment , using recent developments in uranium assessment methodology and applying new geologic concepts , would greatly aid future planning for the uranium industry and contribute to the formulation of a national energy policy .
It is likely that reserve estimates for the United States are still using the 1980 DOE assessment , even though it is significantly out of date , and not up to date with mining techniques currently in use .
Clearly , if we were to develop better mining techniques that have acceptable pollution levels and can be used in a wider range of sites , then our ability to extract uranium resources would be improved .
As far as I can see , development of additional techniques has not yet happened .
Recycled bomb material has been flooding the market for almost twenty years now , keeping uranium prices low .
This has deterred investment in better techniques for extracting uranium , both by companies and governments .
The shortfall in supply that seems to be headed our way will be coming very soon -- as soon as we become unable to find sufficient recycled bomb material to fill the gap between nuclear reactor needs and current year production , which could be as soon as 2013 ( or sooner , if world financial difficulties interfere with imported Russian bomb material before then ) .
If we need new mines , we should have started years ago , since there is a lag of up to 10 years before a new mine begins operation .
If we need new mining techniques , research on these should have started even longer ago .
While there may be a whole lot of low level uranium resources " out there " , if we do n't have techniques to economically extract them and also keep pollution in bounds , the resources are not very useful to us .
We may someday develop new techniques , but in the meantime , we are likely to have a large supply gap .
Philip K. Dick and Human Kindness
I have never been able to stand the self - conscious novelist , who teaches university for a living and delivers one Great American novel a year .
Self - reverential and - referential , this individual bleeds " literature " to the exclusion of anything unconscious and true .
Opposed to this is the natural , the idiot savant , the desperate man who has no idea that he is writing anything memorable , the madman whose pulp fiction is half garbage and half genius .
This was Philip K. Dick , who started and ended his career writing cheap
Ace paperbacks , who did too many drugs and left too many marriages and died at age 53 , but whose writing has a quality of unexpected wild insight that guarantees he will be remembered .
He is best known as the author of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , which was filmed , not very faithfully , as Blade Runner .
The original -- which would have made a better , but less popular , movie if filmed exactly as written -- is among the best of Dick 's explorations of the question :
What is human ?
Dick took too many hallucinogenic drugs in his lifetime , and they undid him .
There is a very funny , yet very grave scene in A Scanner Darkly , a very realistic novel of drug use with a minimal science fiction overlay , in which a group of friends are unable to analyze how the gear shift on a bicycle works , due to the damage they have done to their brains .
Like the acid- inspired art in Timothy Leary 's books , in which human scenes decompose into unrecognizable abstract shapes , Dick 's hallucination - filled consciousness wound up being an obstacle to truth .
Dick fell for the major fallacy of the ' 60's , that hallucinogens would be a gateway to truth , not a path into darkness .
Sometimes he recognized this as the tragedy of his life , but would soon after revert to a search for mystical revelation .
He spent his entire life looking for God .
Dick 's fiction deals with three levels of reality .
To the is and the ought , favorite playing field of philosophers since the beginning of human abstraction , Dick adds the seen , which is stripped away by means of drugs to reveal the hidden is :
The soft - drink stand fell into bits .
Molecules .
He saw the molecules , colorless , without qualities , that made it up .
Then he saw through , into the space beyond it , he saw the hill behind , the trees and sky ....
In its place was a slip of paper .
He reached out his hand and took hold of the slip of paper .
On it was printing , block letters .
SOFT DRINK STAND
In this novel , Time Out of Joint , Ragle Gumm thinks he is living a quiet life in a 1950's American town , and solving a newspaper puzzle each day called Where Will the Little Green Men be Next ?
In reality , he is insane , living in a time of unbearable interstellar war , and predicting the time and place of the next attack by solving the puzzle .
His seen reality , entirely false , is stripped away , layer by layer , until he reaches the is .
It is only when we know the is that we can begin thinking about the ought .
Time
Out of Joint is an early and inferior novel , ringing some interesting changes on a traditional science fiction theme : Everything You Think You Know is False .
Dick would tell this story again , with increased certainty and poignancy .
Good novels and bad each contain one or more set pieces where reality spins out of control ; people fall through holes , everything changes , dead things come back to life or the protagonist falls into the underworld .
Many of these episodes are based on real drug experiences of Dick 's ; he plants them in the midst of a narrative , like an embedded and strange jewel , and then brings you most of the way back to the narrative afterwards .
He always leaves some details unexplained so that the episode continues to stand out ; it is never entirely integrated .
One of Dick 's most expert mindgames occurs in Androids .
The mentally slow J.R. Isidore , being held hostage by fugitive androids , finds a spider in his house .
All living things are precious in the future portrayed in the novel because there are so few animals left .
The androids , who feel no compassion , amuse themselves by cutting off the spider 's legs , to see how few it requires to walk .
With the scissors Pris snipped off another of the spider 's legs .
" Four now , " she said .
She nudged the spider .
" He wo n't go .
But he can . "
The scene is a tour de force ; at the same time as Pris is torturing the spider , an endless talk show which broadcasts 24 hours a day -- Dick 's morbidly funny take on the media -- is debunking the " Mercerism " religion of compassion in the background .
Dick , with a very sure touch , shifts back and forth between Pris , the talk show host 's revelations , and Isidore 's reactions to both .
Finally , Isidore can take no more and falls through the floor into the " tomb world " , where he sees dead things coming back to life , and meets Mercer , who freely admits that he is a fraud but is undeniably human , therefore real , at the same time .
He lifts Isidore from the tomb world and says ( in Dick 's truest voice ) :
" I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you until you lose interest and want to quit .
But you will have to stop searching for me because I will never stop searching for you . "
Isidore returns to the seen -- but the dead spider , which Mercer has restored to life , is still alive .
Dick usually leaves a loose end like this one to avoid complete incorporation of the hallucinatory set - piece into the narrative -- to let you know that the vision is more real than the life which it temporarily interrupted .
Android is Dick 's clearest statement about the nature of the human .
In stripping away the nonessential , he makes it clear that being human does n't mean walking on two legs , having eyes , speaking language or even making love -- the androids can do all this .
It is the crazy , off - kilter , unconscious compassionate quality that Isidore has , and which is echoed in Mercer , the loving and magical fraud whose dishonesty does n't matter , because it is completely dwarfed and made insignificant by his humanity .
In Dick 's universe , a creature that resembles an insect or a pudding may qualify as human even when something that looks , walks and talks like a man does not .
Dick 's fiction , like all fiction , held a mirror up to his life .
Proust said that great art results not from the quality of the life but of the mirror .
Dick 's was a spotted , distorted mirror that reflected flashes of the J.R.
Isidore quality ; so , if Dick 's novels dealt with life on three levels , each was a reflection of three levels of his own life , creating six levels in all :
The " seen " as Dick perceived it , which he believed to be false , but which in many instances was real , so that like many others in the ' 60's , he was evading the real when he thought he was finding it .
The " seen " of the novels , which is always false .
The " is " of his life , which was mainly a hallucination .
The " is " of the novels , which is always real .
The " ought " of his life , which ( even if he defined it in relation to a false " is " ) was founded on an ethic of compassion and love .
The " ought " of the novels , founded on the same ethic .
In a letter written a few months before he died , he called his life " decades of disorder and intoxication and smashing and leaving and just plain wandering the face of the Earth . "
He wrote to his daughter two months later that God intervenes when our burden becomes too great , but only if we call out ( this is of a piece with Mercer 's " only if you stop looking for me " ) :
this is why not all humans are saved , because not all humans see , ever , in their entire lives , that they live by and through God , and God alone .
Most of his life , he had been chaotic , physically and verbally abusing the women who loved him , even moving to harm when he hypocritically told himself he was helping ( as when he tried to have one woman committed to a mental institution . )
He was a cruel and self - involved man who genuinely wanted to be good -- not simply to be seen as good , like most people , but to be , in a mute , intuitive way , like J.R. Isidore .
All his novels portray his continual struggle for the ought .
He lost , but it was a noble failure .
The humanity he craved , and portrayed in the ought of his fiction , is an unobtrusive perfect work , like the unobtrusive perfect works that had a habit of turning up unexpectedly in his novels :
The blue vase made by Mary Ann Dominic and purchased by Jason Taverner as a gift for Heather Hart wound up in a private collection of modern pottery .
It remains there to this day , and is much treasured .
And , in fact , by a number of people who know ceramics , openly and genuinely cherished .
And loved .

We ’ve run out of articles !
If you like Debian Package of the Day please submit good articles about software you like !
Fonty Python is available from the fontypython package in both Debian and Ubuntu in Universe .
Fonty is a wxPython app so will work in any desktop environment .
It also has a command - line interface which avoids the gui .
What the font ?
As a graphic designer , one is called - upon to create artwork for many things .
Fonts change from one client to another , from one job to another .
If busy enough , then one can soon amass a vast pile of font files .
Some are downloaded from the net as freeware , others are purchased , others are supplied by the clients for their work .
These font - files are stored somewhere , independently of the system fonts managed by the Debian package manager , possibly sorted in whatever fashion you prefer .
It ’s crazy to have these fonts all installed at the same time .
Besides whatever that may do to your computer ’s speed , it has one gigantic drawback : it clutters up font - selection boxes .
Have you ever tried to find a font in a list of 500 fonts ?
Bleh .
What you need is a way to herd fonts and that ’s what Fonty does .
Bring out yer fonts !
Fonty will let you gather your fonts and structure them into “ collections ” — or what I call “ Pogs ” — a place to keep tyPOGraphy ( well , why not ? )
Think of Pogs as “ groups ” , “ bags ” , “ cases ” , “ boxes ” — that kind of thing .
It ’s an oddball word invented to describe a bunch of font files .
Ye olde basic idea
You visually gather fonts into Pogs .
You then install a Pog and all the fonts within it are active on the system .
You finish your work and then uninstall the Pog .
Your fonts never move from where they live ( so do n’t worry ) .
Neither are copies of your fonts made ; only links to the original files are used to install the fonts into your home . fonts subdirectory .
For example , you might have a Pog called logoZoo into which you place all the TTFs you need to design a logo for a Zoo .
After that , when you need to work with them , you simply install the logoZoo Pog and start your design app .
All those fonts will now appear in Inkscape or The Gimp , and other apps .
Do your work as normal , and forget about fonts .
When you are done designing , you uninstall logoZoo and all those fonts go away .
The links to the original files are removed from your home .
fonts
directory , effectively uninstalling each font .
Fonty is also great for just looking at fonts wherever they are on your computer , without having to install them first .
Fonty also has a command - line , allowing very quick use .
You can install or remove pogs without having to start the entire gui , which is neat .
Quick tour
The layout of Fonty is supposed to be as simple as possible .
I stayed away from context - menus and drag and drop because I find them hard to use .
The flow is left - to - right with the sources of fonts on the left and their targets on the right .
Point 1 : You choose a Source Folder ( or Source Pog ) on the left .
Point 1 : You choose a Source Folder ( or Source Pog ) on the left .
Point 2 & 3 : You then see the fonts in the middle .
You can page or Point or search around ( Points 5,7 ) .
You click the fonts you want to use .
Point 4 : On the right , you choose a Pog , or make a new one .
Point 6 : Once you have a Target Pog selected , you can place fonts that you ticked into it .
Point 8 : On the bottom - right you then Install or Uninstall Pogs as you need them .
There is a settings box ( ctrl+s ) where you can change the sample text and sizes .
Check the help too — it ’s full of tips and quite short .
Bad fonts
Some fonts are simply bad to the bone .
Fonty relies on freetype and PIL to open and draw the glyphs , and when this fails so does Fonty .
I have put a lot of effort into catching this , but it does not always work .
When a font crashes Fonty , you should get a popup box telling you which one did the deed .
You really ought to remove that font !
Some fonts cannot be displayed , and Fonty will show that by using coloured bars in the display area .
There is also a menu item ( File > Check Fonts ) that you can point at a given directory and scan it for fonts that will crash Fonty .
Use this when you want to cull all the fonts that are bad .
Font Flavours
Originally , Fonty could only show TTF files .
Since then I have expanded it to include OTF , Type1 and TTC files .
As far as I can tell , being only seminiscient , this all works .
i18n
Fonty speaks your language ; or it will if you translate it .
There are a few translations available and you can join the project to contribute others .
Fonty needs help
With Python heading for version 3 and all kinds of other changes , Fonty is falling behind .
She still works quite well , but I cannot spend the time I want to on her .
If there ’s anyone out there who wants to stick a fork in her and run — please do .
I hope to find some time this year to have another go ; fix some bugs and include a few translations I have been sent , but I ca n’t be relied upon .
You can check out the author ’s home page for Fonty and the project home page .

Ministers have admitted they handed over terror suspects in Iraq to US authorities , sparking claims of collusion in extraordinary rendition .
Defence secretary John Hutton said two men detained in 2004 were transferred to US custody and were then transported to Afghanistan , where they remain .
He said he was reassured they had been treated humanely but apologised for past incorrect answers given to MPs .
The Tories said the UK faced charges of being " complicit with serious abuse " .
The Lib Dems said Mr Hutton 's comments raised " as many questions as answers " and called for all relevant documents in the case to be published .
Mr Hutton said that contrary to previous statements he now knew UK officials were aware that the two men , understood to be Pakistani nationals , had been transferred to US custody in 2004 but that no action had been taken on the issue .
New evidence
He said " brief references " to the case had been included in papers sent to then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Home Secretary Charles Clarke in April 2006 but its significance had not been highlighted at the time .
The UK has always denied allegations of collusion in extraordinary rendition - the term used for sending terror suspects for interrogation in countries where torture is not illegal - despite frequent claims to the contrary .
In a statement to MPs , Mr Hutton said a review of detainees held by the UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003 had uncovered the case of the two men , members of the banned group Lashkar e Tayyiba , which has links to al - Qaeda .
I regret that it is now clear that inaccurate information has been given to the House by my department

Rendition : Blair in quotes
They are still being held in Afghanistan , where they are classified as " unlawful enemy combatants " .
Mr Hutton said there was no " substantiated evidence " that they had been mistreated or subjected to abuse there .
But he added : " I regret that it is now clear that inaccurate information on this particular issue has been given to the House by my department .
" I must stress that this was based on the information available to ministers and those who were briefing them at the time .
" My predecessors as defence secretary have confirmed to me that they had no knowledge of these events . "
' Not candid '
The Conservatives said that although the case was a " specific rather than a systemic failure " , it raised serious questions about the practice of extraordinary rendition .
Shadow security minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Hutton 's remarks seemed to contradict assurances given in 2006 and ministers were wrong to " overlook " the importance of the case .
" It is of serious concern that there is a underlying charge of complicity with serious abuse of people detained by British forces on operations overseas , " he said .

Shadow security minister Former shadow home secretary David Davis said the case was the " latest in a series of issues where the government has been less than straightforward " in regard to allegations of torture .
For the Lib Dems , security spokesman Nick Harvey asked the defence secretary to state categorically that UK forces were explicitly told not to be complicit in " abduction , rendition or torture " .
" I would like you to tell this House that you are absolutely confident that nothing will come to light subsequently which might cause you or any other minister in the future to have to come to the despatch box and acknowledge that we have n't had as comprehensive a version of the truth today as you might like to think , " he said .
Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Cambell pressed ministers on whether the UK had sought assurances that the two men would not be tortured before they were handed over .
' Shocked ' Civil liberties campaigners said they were " shocked but not surprised " by Mr Hutton 's statement .
" This was rendition , " said Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti .
" It was transfer of prisoners of a kind which had previously been denied . "
The government admitted last year that two US flights carrying terror suspects for interrogation landed on UK territory in 2002 , contradicting previous ministerial statements on the matter .
Foreign secretary David Miliband said the planes had refuelled on the UK dependent territory of Diego Garcia .
The suspects in question were detained in Iraq by UK forces in 2004
He said he was " very sorry " previous denials about rendition flights by among others , former prime minister Tony Blair , had been wrong but said they were made in good faith at the time .
In December 2005 , Tony Blair told MPs the practice of rendition - moving suspects from one country to another - had been US policy for " many years " .
He added : " It is not something that I have ever actually come across until this whole thing has blown up ( the row at the time about whether US extraordinary rendition planes had passed through the UK ) and I do n't know anything about it , and the reason why I am not going to start ordering inquiries is that I can't see a reason for doing it , I am afraid . "
The latest revelation comes days after Binyam Mohamed , the former Guantanamo detainee who claims UK intelligence agencies colluded in his torture , returned to the UK .

A while back I amused a few people up when , while waxing poetic about BBQ , I commented that the pig is a magical beast .
But the thing is ... it 's true .
And part of that magic is bacon .
While I dare not claim bacon is a healthy food , as Emeril says , pork fat rules .
Few other meats can claim so much flavor and uniqueness in the culinary realm .
Seldom does one see so many men get misty eyed when discussing meat as when bacon enters the conversation .
So , my friends , I present for your reading pleasure , the 10 greatest moments in bacon history .
1. Eggs & Bacon - a s a meal name was popularized in the United States by Edward Bernays in the 1920s and 1930s .
In order to promote sales of bacon , he conducted a survey of physicians and reported their recommendation that people eat hearty breakfasts .
He sent the results of the survey to 5,000 physicians , along with publicity touting bacon and eggs as a hearty breakfast .
2. Pork & Beans -
They are just beans until you layer those strips of bacon on top before baking .
All the sudden the beans , sauce , brown sugar , and spices marry to make a dish that says summertime like few others .
Who among us has not angled to get a stripe of the bacon off the top at a picnic or church pot luck ?
3. BLT - Do not mess with perfection .
Fix it exactly this way .
The sandwich has several strips of cooked bacon , leaves of lettuce ( traditionally iceberg or romaine ) , and slices of tomato , all sandwiched between slices of bread , commonly but optionally toasted .
( In New England , " BLT down " means the bread is to be toasted . )
Mayonnaise is the traditional condiment used .
4. Bacon Wrapped Scallops - Genius .
Pure Genius .
Any social event serving Genius .
Pure Genius .
Any social event serving this tasty appetizer instantly goes up a notch .
You do not believe me ?
Ask around .
In addition , serving this food is the best use of the toothpick ever .
5. Bring Home the Bacon
In the twelfth century , a church in the English town of Dunmow promised a side of bacon to any married man who could swear before the congregation and God that he had not quarreled with his wife for a year and a day .
A husband who could bring home the bacon was held in high esteem by the community for his forbearance .
6. Cobb Salad -
I 'm eating healthy today , I 'll just order the salad ... yea , I 'll have the Cobb Salad .
I ts main ingredients include bacon , chicken breast , hard - boiled egg , avocado , and Roquefort cheese .
Outstanding !
Here 's a little history on my ( and what should be your ) favorite salad :
In 1937 , Brown Derby owner Robert H. Cobb went into the restaurant 's kitchen to fix a late - night snack for Sid Grauman , operator of Grauman 's Chinese Theater .
He browsed the refrigerator for ingredients , and chopped them up finely .
Thus , the Cobb salad was born .
From then on , Grauman often requested that a Cobb salad be prepared for him .
Word soon spread about this creation throughout Hollywood , quickly increasing its popularity .
It became such a hit that film stars started requesting " Cobb 's salad " , and it was eventually added to the menu of the Brown Derby restaurant .
7. Chicken Fried Bacon -
Have you ever made that food choice when traveling that you just would not make at home ?
As the host says , eating healthy on the road is n't always easy !
8. Chocolate Covered Bacon - I 've called great BBQ pig candy ( especially the caramelized outside chop ) .
Hey , Ithink they borrowed my tag line !
I 've called great BBQ pig candy ( especially the caramelized outside chop ) .
This stuff really in pig candy .
9. Bacon Explosion - Look at this .
Do n't flinch .
LOOK AT THIS .
Oh me .
Oh my .
Sausage , bacon , dry rub and BBQ sauce ?
This is so wrong , yet so right .
No , I have never had it , but I would stand in line for a taste .
I dare not make it lest I become addicted .
Hearst has given up trying to fix the cash - bleeding Seattle Post - Intelligencer .
It has put it up for sale , and if it can't find a buyer , it will fire most of the staff and nix the print edition -- or just shut the whole thing down .
The speed with which the 200 - year old newspaper industry is disintegrating is remarkable .
The model no longer works , at least not for most papers .
And most of the industry seems incapable of -- or unwilling to -- adapt to the new reality .
AP : Hearst Corp. put Seattle 's oldest newspaper , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , up for sale Friday , saying that if it can't find a buyer in the next 60 days , the paper will close or continue to exist only on the Internet .
" These options include a move to a digital only operation with a greatly reduced staff , or a complete shutdown of all operations , " Hearst , the P - I 's parent company , said in a statement .
" In no case will Hearst continue to publish the P - I in printed form following the conclusion of this process ... "
The mood in the newsroom was grim .
Some staff members cried , others were angry .
" People are kind of depressed .
There 's some crying , " said Candace Heckman , P - I breaking news editor who has worked at the paper since 2000 ...
" People are just pretty shocked and amazed , " said [ another staffer ] who has been at the paper for eight years .
Here 's the PI 's own write - up :
After 146 years of delivering news , the Seattle P - I faces becoming what it has chronicled : history .
The Seattle P - I 's parent company , The Hearst Corp. , said Friday that it has put the paper up for sale and will stop publishing unless someone buys it in 60 days .
If no buyer emerges , the paper would either become a Web - only publication or cease all operations .
" We 've been on the knife edge all this time , " P - I managing editor David McCumber said Friday .
" We finally slipped . "
Economic reasons have forced the state 's oldest morning newspaper into a sale , Steven Swartz , president of The Hearst Corp .'s newspaper division , told employees Friday .
" One thing is clear :
At the end of the sale process , we do not see ourselves publishing in print , " Swartz told employees gathered in the newsroom overlooking Elliott Bay .
" Since 2000 , the P - I has lost money each year , and the losses have escalated and continue to escalate in 2009 .
We have had to make a very tough decision . "
Hearst said the P - I lost about $ 14 million in 2008 .

Ehud Olmert , the Israeli prime minister , said that Israel 's offensive in the Gaza Strip had achieved all its objectives .
The security cabinet voted to end the campaign after concluding that Hamas had been " beaten badly " and its ability to fire rockets into Israel – the original point of conflict – had been severely limited .

Watch the first footage of the ovulation of a human egg
Following the publication last week of the best ever photos of the ovulation of a human egg , we now go , Fantastic Voyage - like , to the first video footage of the moment itself .
To record the sequence , Stephan Gordts and Ivo Brosens of the Leuven Institute for Fertility & Embryology in Belgium performed transvaginal laparoscopy , which involves making a small cut in the vaginal wall and observing the ovary with an endoscope .
Advertisement
“ This allows us direct access to and observation of the tubo - ovarian structures without manipulation using forceps , ” says Gordts .
For the photos of ovulation , which only accidentally captured the critical moment , Jacques Donnez at the Catholic University of Louvain ( UCL ) in Brussels , Belgium , used gas to distend the organs for photography .
However , Gordts and Brosens planned the procedure to coincide with ovulation and used saline solution to “ float ” the structures .
Perfect timing
Observation was timed for the day of the peak of the patient ’s luteal hormone cycle .
Ovulation was predicted to occur on the evening of the day of the LH peak , and the endoscope introduced at 6 pm .
A small amount of saline was used to float the opening of the fallopian tube , its fimbriae ( the “ fingers ” that sweep the egg into the tube ) and the ovary itself .
This gives a more natural appearance than gas , says Gordts .
In the video , the fimbriae can be seen sweeping in time with the patient ’s heartbeat .
A mucus plug can be seen protruding from the ovary – this contains the egg .
“ The ovum is not captured ‘ naked ’ , ” says Gordts .
“ There is no eruption like a volcano . ”
Gordts says that in clinical practice it is not easy to organise the observation of ovulation .
“ We were probably lucky to be successful at our first attempt , ” he says .
Dream researchers in the 1950s concluded that people typically dreamed in black and white whereas modern dream research reports most people dream in colour .
Philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel discusses this curious finding in a 2002 article , arguing that it is unlikely dreaming has changed so radically and that this is likely evidence of how bad we are at introspection into our dream lives .
Schwitzgebel discusses a whole range of theories and ideas , but begins by summarising the evidence from a time when it was largely assumed that people dream in monochrome :
In 1951 , Calvin S. Hall announced in Scientific American that 29 % of dreams are either entirely colored or have some little bit of color in them ( Hall , 1951 ) .
He called such dreams ‚ Äòtechnicolored ‚Äô , thereby explicitly comparing them to the colored movies that were becoming increasingly prevalent in the 1940s and ‚ Äô50s , and implicitly contrasting them with lower - tech black and white movies and dreams .
Some of Hall ‚Äôs contemporaries might have thought him too generous in his estimation of the proportion of colored to black and white dreams .
Tapia , Werboff and Winokur ( 1958 ) found that only about 9 % of a sample of people reporting to the hospital at Washington University in St. Louis for non-psychiatric medical problems reported having colored dreams , compared with 12 % of neurotic men and 21 % of neurotic women .
Middleton ( 1942 ) found that 40 % of his college sophomores claimed never to see colors in their dreams , 31 % claimed rarely to do so , and only 10 % claimed to do so frequently or very frequently .
The first objection you might think of is that perhaps these results are accurate , owing to the fact people watched lots of black and white TV and films .
But in an age when people still spent a relatively small proportion of their time in the cinema or in front of the TV ( which only had restricted broadcasts ) it is unlikely to account for the virtual ‘ absence ’ of coloured dreaming , especially considering that ‘ real life ’ is experienced in colour .
One of the most interesting hypothesis tackled by the article is that dreams are like narratives , and do not necessarily have colour , but black and white media might just have led people to interpret their dreams in this way .
Consider , as an analogy , a novel .
While novels surely are not in black and white , it also seems a little strange to say that they are ‚ Äòin color ‚
Äô.
Certainly novels make fictional attributions of color ( ‚Äòshe strode into the room in a dazzling red dress ‚
Äô ) and refer to objects that normally have a particular color ( ‚ Äòshe promptly chopped a carrot ‚ Äô ) .
Maybe it makes sense to describe such fictional claims as ‚ Äòin color ‚Äô or partly in color .
However , most elements of most scenes in novels do not have determinate colors in that way …
If you find yourself disinclined to think that novels , or the images evoked by novels , are properly described as being either in black and white or in full color , then you might likewise find yourself hesitant to apply the terms ‚ Äòblack and white ‚
Äô or ‚ Äòcolored ‚ Äô to dreams .
Perhaps dream - objects and dream - events are similar to fictional objects and events , or to the images evoked by fiction , in having , typically , a certain indeterminacy of color , neither cerise nor taupe nor burnt umber , nor gray either .
The article goes on to suggest that this reconstructive aspect is a core feature of consciousness and that is further evidence that we are just not very good at introspecting our own minds because as soon as we do , we alter the contents of what we ’re attempting to experience .

Booby Traps : for & by Boobs
ACME Styled DIY Home Security = Epic FAIL
Anyone who grew up in the heyday of Wile E. Coyote and The Roadrunner cartoons remembers Wile E. ’s “ SUPER Genius ” adventures with ACME products : ACME Bombs , Detonators , Dynamite , ACME Giant Mouse Trap , and a variety of ACME Anvils ( 1 ) .
Most of Wile E. ’s charades backfired .
But he was lucky .
In Looney Tunes land characters have the ability to walk on air , defy fire , easily shake - off explosions and other ingenious snares that slice , dice and chop them into a zillion different pieces all with the goal of entertaining millions of cartoon - watchers .
Daffy
Duck had his beak blown off nearly everyday , but he ’d pick it up and screw it right back onto his head .
In our modern civilized world we face the threat of intrusion , theft , and other predatory crimes .
In some cases certain among us are inspired to respond with “ clever ” if deadly booby traps they ’ve convinced themselves are fair and reasonable child ’s play .
Brief History of Booby Traps
If you take a quick foray into the evolution of “ booby traps ” the trip is not nearly as funny or light - hearted as the visual pranks drawn in a Warner Brothers cartoon .
In fact , booby traps are almost a required part of tactical guerrilla warfare everywhere : they ’re cheap , constructed of materials at hand and designed to intentionally inflict horror or maim and kill as many people / soldiers / enemy troops as possible in one fell swoop .
Booby traps have been used in both major World Wars , in Vietnam ( 2 ) and they are being currently employed in the Middle East ( 3 ) and other combat hot spots around the globe .
Humankind centuries ago learned the value of ingenious hidden traps and lures for eliminating attackers with little effort and human expense .
The practice of laying booby traps has survived and become just one component of an effective war strategy .
By definition a “ booby trap ” is “ An explosive device designed to be triggered when an unsuspecting victim touches or disturbs a seemingly harmless object … . ” ( Answers.com )
In guerrilla combat camouflaged or otherwise hidden killer traps are physically and psychologically effective at securing and destroying important weaponry , transportation routes , and strategically eliminating enemies with little or no trouble at all .
But booby traps are also used as a low - tech strategy for protecting home and property , sometimes with lethal results .
The Booby Trap Mentality
Today if you subscribe to the hard - core booby trap school of thought , most people think you ’re a survivalist , an anti-government crusader ( 4 ) or just plain nuts for your off - kilter tactics that usually involve duct tape and a sawed off shotgun or some foolish fishing - line contraption and a homemade grenade .
The array of curiously sarcastic , slightly to totally deranged , and misguided social misfits chatting about in online “ booby trap ” forums and posting homemade do - it - yourself booby trap videos to multi-media websites is as enlightening as it is disturbing .
Almost anyone can learn , step - by - step , how to fashion an assortment of dangerous homespun defensive devices and primitive foils .
Even more unnerving is this : more online users have searched for “ booby traps ” than for “ diy home security ” or “ diy burglar alarms ” put together .
Do home security booby traps work ?
Check out the list below .
Unfortunately the results seem to be that the truly effective booby traps often land their inventors in the news and in jail – certainly not at the top of any list for heroism .

What the Law Says About Booby Traps
Most traditional booby traps like those in the list above are nothing but huge legal backfires if they actually work against anyone .
You , on the other hand , think you ’re being clever , outsmarting the system in every way : you strategically lay out your fishing line trip wire attached to some homemade grenade you ’ve concocted and set the device to trip when an intruder comes through your front door . …
Here ’s the legal low - down on that bit of gadgetry you ’ve got rigged :
It does n’t matter how hardened , how notorious or how outfitted with weaponry your victim is - he can be a prison escapee for that matter .
If your homebrew booby trap hurts him , maims him or kills him , or anyone else , you ’re going to jail .
Why ?
The law in America plainly states that any device rigged as a trap and “ intended to harm ” is against the law .
Period .
There are better ways to protect your home and property without going to jail and still get the endorphin rush of cobbling together your own devices and gadgets .
DIY Home Security
DIY , or do - it - yourself home security kits and gadgets answer the innate urge to create , cobble , and otherwise mash - up your own defensive homebrew with the legal sting removed .
We ’re in the high - tech , internet age which not only offers you endless gadgetry , but also puts you in touch with online handbooks , guides and video tutorials that lead you step - by - step through home security installations .
And you ’ll find legions of gear - heads more than willing to collaborate and share tips and tricks for ultra-cool home security systems that far outsmart the barbarian booby contraptions .
Homebrewed High - and Low - Tech Home Security
Informal , or homemade , home security devices or systems are differentiated from booby traps because they are non-lethal , usually quite passive high - tech or low - tech devices .
When you have the hankering to rig your own home with lights , cameras , and sirens , consider the staggering assortment of do - it - yourself home security devices and burglar alarms available online and offline .
The cost variables alone make it worth looking into a DIY kit .
You could turn a simple inexpensive web camera and an old Windows PC into a remote surveillance monitoring station ( 5 ) .
Do-it - yourselfers may hook up a single , standalone device or develop sophisticated interconnected systems of devices and gadgets each designed to monitor , divert , and / or collect data , on their home security status , trespassers , intrusion attempts , and break - ins .
Many such home prototypes can be started with a simple $ 30 PC webcam .
And the techie know - how for getting even an advanced DIY home surveillance system functioning is readily available on the Internet for free .
You could learn to build AND monitor your own home security system in a pinch .

As intriguing as some booby traps may be , and as strong as your instinct may be to “ take down ” anybody that dares cross your threshold uninvited , the truth is that booby traps – when they actually work – often deliver tragic results .
Many have injured and killed unexpectedly , been left unwittingly set to trigger , and a few have even killed the “ geniuses ” behind them .

Normally , a baby inherits 23 chromosomes from each parent , for a total of 46 .
Each chromosome matches the corresponding chromosome from the other parent , forming 23 numbered pairs .
Biological errors can happen during the early stages of cell division , causing some fetuses to develop with 47 chromosomes : Instead of 23 matched pairs , they have 22 pairs plus one set of three , a chromosomal abnormality called trisomy .
Most fetuses with trisomy are miscarried during the first trimester .
Most of those who survive have Down syndrome , also known as trisomy 21 because it 's caused by an extra chromosome 21 .
While all babies with Down syndrome have some degree of mental retardation , it 's severe in only about 10 percent .
Many people with Down syndrome have rich and fulfilling lives into adulthood .
Other babies with chromosomal abnormalities have trisomy 13 or 18 , which are almost always associated with profound mental retardation and other congenital malformations .
These babies rarely live more than a few days or months .
The risk of having a baby with trisomy increases with the mother 's age , which is why healthcare providers suggest genetic testing for women who will be 35 or older on their due date .
Mustafa Abu Yazid on As Sahab , al Qaeda ’s propaganda arm .
Al Qaeda ’s military commander in Afghanistan has threatened India with further attacks if the country attacks Pakistan .
“ India should know that it will have to pay a heavy price if it attacks Pakistan , ” Mustafa Abu Yazid said in a recently released videotape .
“ The Mujahideen will sunder your armies into the ground , like they did to the Russians in Afghanistan . ”
In the videotape , Yazid referred to the November 2008 terror assault in Mumbai , saying the Indians suffered “ humiliation ” in the attack and more was in store if India decides to retaliate against Pakistan , the BBC reported .
The 62 - hour terror spree in Mumbai resulted in 165 innocent people killed and hundreds more wounded .
The Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistan - based terror group allied with al Qaeda and supported by powerful elements within Pakistan ’s Inter - Service Intelligence agency and the military , carried out the attack , an Indian intelligence dossier stated .
The dossier contained proof of calls made between the Mumbai terrorists and their handlers inside Pakistan as the attacks were ongoing , as well as transcripts of the handlers providing information to the terrorists and ordering them to murder the civilians .
The handlers were heard cheering after the murders .
Yazid is al Qaeda ’s military commander in Afghanistan and is a senior leader in the organization .
He has claimed credit for the December 2007 assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as she campaigned in Rawalpindi , as well as a suicide attack on the Danish embassy in Islamabad in June 2008 .
The Pakistani military claimed Yazid was killed during a battle in the Bajaur tribal agency August 2008 , but never provided confirmation .
The Pakistanis repeated the claim of Yazid ’s death at the end of September 2008 .
Today ’s BBC report that Yazid has not appeared since the report of his death last summer is incorrect .
Since last summer , Yazid has appeared in at least four other al Qaeda propaganda tapes prior to the latest threat against India .
On Sept. 2 , 2008 , Yazid lionized Abu Gharib al Makki , a senior al Qaeda field commander from Saudi Arabia who was killed during fighting with US forces in Farah province in southwestern Afghanistan .
On Sept. 5 , 2008 , Yazid appeared on a videotape that praised the suicide bomber who attacked the Danish embassy in Islamabad .
On Sept. 8 , 2008 , Yazid appeared on al Qaeda ’s propaganda tape that was released three days prior to the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks .
Abdulmalik Droukedel , the leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , and Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command , also appeared on the video .
On Oct. 4 , 2008 , Yazid appeared on a videotape that featured Adam Gadahn , al Qaeda ’s American - born spokesman .
Pakistani officials also had claimed Gadahn was killed in a January 2008 airstrike that killed al Qaeda military commander Abu Laith al Libi .
On Nov. 13 , 2008 , al Qaeda castigated the Pakistani military for claiming Yazid was killed .
“ It was a cheap publicity shot on behalf of the Pakistani security forces to boast their military successes in Bajaur , ” a jihadi told Adnkronos International .
Two months later , and seven months after the Pakistani military began fighting in Bajaur , Pakistan ’s adviser to the prime minister on internal Pakistani security issues claimed security forces “ succeeded to retake about 98 percent control ” of Bajaur .
But fighting is still ongoing and the Taliban have begun bombing schools in the region , as they have been doing in Swat , a district that has been under Taliban control for almost two years .
For more information on the poor reliability of Pakistani government , military , and intelligence sources ’ claims regarding the death of senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders , see Pakistan has poor track record reporting deaths of senior terrorist leaders .

How much does the typical American family make ?
This question is probably one of the most central in figuring out how we can go about fixing our current economic malaise .
After all , we do n’t hear many people saying in today ’s world that they have too much money .
The median household income in the United States is $ 46,326 .
Here in California people have a hard time understanding that yes , 50 percent of our population live on $ 46,000 or less a year .
Even today , all the elixirs and remedies being thrown around fail to focus on income and the big brother of income , solid employment .
Dual earner households have a higher median income at $ 67,348 .
To highlight the massive discrepancy I ’ve put together a chart showing the household income distribution :
As you can see from the above chart , only 17.8 % of all U.S. households make more than $ 118,200 a year .
Only 2.67 % make more than $ 200,000 .
The fact that only 34 % make more than $ 65,000 is astounding given how expensive other cost of living items have gotten over the past decade .
That is why the middle class is feeling squeezed from all different sides .
When I put together a budget for a family making $ 100,000 I received a bit of feedback on both sides .
Even though I realized very few people had household incomes in the 6 figure range looking very closely at the data , I can understand why people took issue with a budget that was at that level .
I also put together a budget from someone living in California making $ 46,000 a year and received feedback as well .
I think when it comes to income , you can never have too much .
What is even more fascinating , is how even amongst the super wealthy income is not distributed evenly .
There are approximately 146,000 ( 0.1 % ) households with incomes exceeding $ 1,500,000 a year .
Even at that , the top 0.01 % of households had incomes of $ 5,500,000 and accounted for 11,000 households .
The 400 highest tax payers in the nation brought in a stunning $ 87,000,000 a year .
Now that is wealth .
For us mere mortals , it is important again to focus on that chart .
$ 46,000 does not go a long way .
In a recent Census report there are 110,000,000 households in the United States .
What this data tells us is that 55,000,000 households are living on $ 46,000 or less a year .
Let us assume this is a married couple with 1 child .
Let us run the numbers :
I ran the numbers for a state with no state income tax , Texas .
A family at this level is only bringing in $ 3,215 a month .
The national median home price peaked around $ 200,000 .
So let us assume this family purchased the median home :
5 % down payment : $ 10,000
Mortgage 30 - year fixed ( 6.5 % ) : $ 1,200
Taxes and Insurance : $ 333
PITI : $ 1,533
Right off the bat , this family is spending 47 % of their net pay on a median priced home .
We did n’t even account for any pre-tax retirement account investing .
Given the recent stock market performance and the loss of $ 50 trillion in global wealth , maybe that was n’t such a bad idea .
The bottom line is the average American family is being squeezed from every angle .
What we need is a focus on jobs and our economy , not bailing out banks .
That defeats the entire purpose .
The average American family is struggling getting by and when they hear about these billion dollar handouts , they ca n’t help but to feel left out .
** Update February 2013 :
Since this article was written , not much has changed on the household income front .
I went ahead and dug out the most recent data on household income :
Source : Census , ACS 2011
The latest Census data has the median household income in the US at $ 50,500 .
But as the chart above highlights one out of four US households are living with less than $ 25,000 per year in household income .
This makes sense when we measure this up against Social Security data that has the median per capita worker income at $ 26,000 for 2010 .
You also begin to realize why two income households are almost a necessity to get by in American today .

A Peruvian nativity ( photo : National Perinatal Institute )
A Peruvian woman called Virgen Maria , who is married to a carpenter , has named her son Jesus Emanuel after giving birth on Christmas Day .
Twenty - year - old Virgen Maria Huarcaya Palomino had not been due to give birth on Thursday , but went into labour early and underwent a Caesarean operation .
Her husband , who shares the same profession as Saint Joseph , is in fact called Adolfo Jorge Huaman .
He said the couple had been planning to name their son after a football player .
" But thanks to a happy coincidence this is how things ended up , " he said .
Baby Jesus was born at 0220 local time ( 0720 GMT ) on 25 December at the National Perinatal Institute in Lima and weighed 3.32kg .
His mother said : " I am so happy to give birth on such a special date .
I did n't think that my baby was going to be born today and now that I have him in my arms I am very happy . "
Virgen Maria means Virgin Mary in English .
She told local television that her grandfather , a devotee of the Virgin Mary , had chosen her own unusual name , with which , until now , she had not felt comfortable .
" In school they made fun of my name , " she said .
While these pages are grouped under “ Piracy & Security ” , they mainly relate to yacht security worldwide , and in some cases piracy .
Worldwide Security Incident Reports :
The Reports section below includes all reports on security incidents against yachts and cruisers reported to Noonsite ( a very extensive list dating back to 2008 ) .
In addition , each country has a related reports section ( easily found via the hamburger menu ) with an option to view security reports for that particular country .
For example – Panama Security Reports .
These are not intended to be all - encompassing lists of all crimes against yachts in the world , however , may give you an indication of your relative safety in a particular country and need for extra precautions .
Each country also has a security section within the country profile which outlines any concerns for visiting yachts and summarises latest incident reports .
For example – Grenada Profile / Security .
Worldwide Areas of Concern :
Parts of the world where caution is advised specifically to cruising yachts are detailed on this page below , with links to further information .
Piracy
No other danger has marred the beauty of cruising more than the threat of piracy , whether on the high seas or in coastal waters .
Indeed it is a risk that mariners have had to confront for many thousands of years and continue to do so in certain areas of the world today .
Piracy incidents on pleasure boats in recent years have been mercifully few in numbers and restricted predominantly to the Gulf of Aden region , Venezuela and offshore waters and the Philippines .
2019 : Piracy Falls to Five - Year Low for Q1 - Q3 ( IMB )
General Security Guidelines
It is ALWAYS prudent to lock the yacht when you leave for a trip to the shore , for a visit to another yacht , or at night when sleeping .
Your dinghy and outboard should be treated like you do your car .
Lock both at all times with a robust chain and padlock and always raise both out of the water at night .
See the “ Self - defence and Deterring Attacks ” section below for more information .
Reporting an Incident
In addition to reporting an incident to Noonsite , it is also important to report to the local authorities .
If they know what is happening in their jurisdictions , they can then take steps to stop the activity and to apprehend the criminals .
E-mail [ email protected ] with the following details when reporting an incident :
Date and Time of Incident
Country / Port
At Anchor / On Mooring / In Marina – co-ordinates
Description of Incident with as much detail as possible
Items stolen / damaged / other
Outcome
Did you report the incident to the local authorities ?
If cruising the Caribbean , be sure to also report to our information partners the Caribbean Safety and Security Net .
Anderson Cooper 360 interviewed FLDS member Betty Jessop , 19 , who had escaped the ranch with her mother and seven siblings , but then chose to return on her own , saying the " outside world " provides no satisfaction .
Betty 's one of the 54 children of Merril Jessop , who is believed to be the leader of the sect .
Her mother Carolyn left Merril after 17 years of marriage , and fled the compound with her eight children .
She wrote about her experiences in her book Escape .
Betty is the only one of her children to return to the ranch and the religion , saying that life outside the compound is " shallow . "

Q&A :
Q : How is Steve ?
How will things be different under Tim ?
Would Tim remain in charge if Steve does not return ?
A : Steve remains CEO and will be involved in strategic decisions going forward .
Tim is COO and will be overseeing day - to - day operations .
We are pleased with the depth of talent in our team , and that is n't changing .
We do n't settle for less than excellence in all departments , so regardless of who is in charge , our values will allow us to succeed .
Q : Are you scaling back retail expansion ?
A : Plan to open about 25 stores in fiscal 2009 , half international .
Continuing to be very selective with sites .
We 're confident in our stores and happy with how they are performing in a difficult environment .
Q : Is iPhone segment elastic and would price reductions make sense in the future ?
A : You 've seen us reduce prices over time .
In the US , $ 599 down to $ 399 down to $ 199 saw big jumps at each level .
But we believe that $ 199 is a solid price point , with nothing able to offer a comparable experience at that level .
Q : Will gross margins be around 30 % for fiscal 2009 as guided previously ?
A : We are benefiting from some factors that are giving us slightly better margins in the first half of 2009 , but expect closer to 30 % in second half .
Q : Your guidance for March quarter is a bit narrower than for this past quarter .
Is this due to stability from subscription - based accounting ?
A : We consider a $ 400 million range pretty wide for us .
Last quarter 's guidance was given around the time when banks were failing left and right and there was a lot of uncertainty .
While the economy is still bad , many things that affect us appear to have stabilized a bit .
Q : How is the market for component pricing ?
A : We expect a favorable market in aggregate for NAND , DRAM , LCDs .
Not huge prices decreases , but favorable .
Q : Are there iPhone markets where your pricing is too high ?
Will you address that ?
A : Yes , there are markets , such as India , that do n't have subsidized prices .
We recognize the low penetration in these markets and their potential and will respond accordingly going forward .
We will not do low - end though ; we 'll leave that to others .
Q : What about the netbook ( A : We 're watching it , but we do n't feel that they offer good products ... underpowered , poor software , cramped keyboards , etc .
We 've got some ideas , but we will not provide the inferior experience that we believe other companies are providing .
Q : What about Apple TV ?
A : Still a hobby for us , but movie rentals are increasing popularity .
We will continue to invest in it , because we believe there is something there .
Q : How are the pro and education segments ?
A : Businesses are cutting back .
Education down 6 % year - over - year in total , K - 12 down 10 % .
Very significant funding uncertainty due to state budget shortfalls .
We do n't see this picking up very quickly .
Q : Any comments on Snow Leopard ?
A : No comment .
We 're very excited about it , but we are not prepared to announce a launch date at this time .
Q : Anything to say about inventories for iPhone ?
A : Difficult to say due to number of countries we 're in and uncertain seasonal variations at this point .
Q : Where is iPod growth coming from ?
A : US sales actually declined , so growth is coming from international markets .
Huge spike in the final week of the quarter accounted for all of our growth .
Q : How did product mix affect gross margins ?
A : We do n't talk a lot about year - over - year changes in margins due to a number of complicating factors contributing to the data .
All we can say that it was flat compared to the year - ago quarter .
Q : Thoughts on operating expenses ?
A : We 're confident in our business and we 're going to invest our way through this downturn .
We 're investing in engineering , marketing , customer service .
Q : Any plans for your cash ?
A : We have no new updates on this .
Q : Can you speak to details of guidance for March quarter ?
A : We can't go into that .
We 're shipping great products and our customers are responding .
Q : Can you talk about adding Wal - Mart as iPhone distribution point ?
A : We just started with them at the very end of December , so we do n't have enough data to draw any conclusions on performance .
Wal - Mart gives us a much broader reach beyond what we and AT&T can provide .
They were already selling iPods , and we were pleased with that relationship .
Q : Can you talk about linearity in Mac and iPhone sales ?
A : Mac sales second - highest in history .
New portable announcement drove huge sales and resulted in the stunning 34 % growth in that segment given the overall market .
Overall , international performance better than US .
iPhone does n't have much history , so hard to say , but we 're pleased with the performance .
Q : Is there a different retail store philosophy for international vs. domestic ?
A : International retail performance was a bit stronger than in US .
We think the retail stores help us in each of our locations .
We just want to be sure that the Macs and iPhones have a great place for customers to experience them .
Q : How have dynamics of discounting to third - party retailers like Best Buy and Wal - Mart affected you ?
A : Retailers are free to do what they want .
Around the holidays we saw some attaching promos like gift cards to purchases , and that 's fine with us .
Q : There are other iPhone competitors coming to the market : Android , Palm Pre .
How do you think about sustaining leadership in the face of these competitors ?
A : It 's difficult to compare to products that are not yet in the market .
i Phone has seen terrific rating from customers .
Software is the key ingredient , and we believe that we are years ahead of our competitors .
Having different screen sizes , different input methods , and different hardware makes things difficult for developers .
We view iPhone as primarily a software platform , which is different from our competitors .
We do n't mind competition , but if others rip off our intellectual property , we will go after them .
Q : The Palm device seems to directly emulate the iPhone 's innovative interface .
Is that what you 're referring to ?
A : We do n't want to refer to any specific companies , so that was a general statement .
We like competition because it makes us better , but we will not stand for companies infringing on our IP .
Q : How many One - to - One sessions did you have at retail stores this quarter ?
A : We do n't have that number here , but we did set a record .
Q : How many of your 500 million App Store downloads were paid and how many were free ?
A : That 's not something we 're prepared to disclose .
Q : Will you eventually separate out App Store sales results from iTunes Store sales ?
A : The App Store is part of iTunes , and we have no plans to separate them .
- End of Call -
The holder of a patent involving Internet music distribution is crying foul today after learning that the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's tenacious Patent Busting Project has convinced the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) to reconsider his decade - old successful claim .
This PTO decision makes the EFF team a nifty six for six in seeking and being granted patent reexaminations , with one already having been killed off and the others pending final disposition .
The development also demonstrates anew the need for Congress to make sure that any " reform " of the patent system does not do injury to efforts such as the Patent Busting Project .
Legislation filed but not acted upon last year would have effectively killed the project , EFF warned at the time .
From today 's EFF press release about its latest win :
Seer Systems was awarded this patent for a system and method for joining different musical data types together in a file , distributing them over the Internet , and then playing that file .
In the reexamination request , EFF , along with the law firm Day Casebeer Madrid & Batchelder , show that descriptions of this technology were published a number of times before Seer Systems made its claim -- including in a book written by Seer 's own founder and the named inventor of the patent , Stanley Jungleib .
" Mr. Jungleib encouraged others to use the techniques he described in his book and sought patent protection only after those ideas had entered the public domain , " said EFF Senior Intellectual Property Attorney Michael Kwun .
" It 's unfortunate that Seer Systems did n't call Mr. Jungleib 's book and the other prior art we cited to the PTO 's attention before the patent issued . "
Contacted by e-mail , Jungleib vigorously disputes the Patent Busting Project 's grasp of the facts and questions whether the advocacy group is on the right side .
Says Jungleib :
Seer Systems is a " company of one " ( me ) that followed the law and sought a court 's help to stop the likes of Microsoft , Yamaha , and good portion of the cell phone industry ( not some " little company or innovator " ) from what we saw as taking our intellectual property .
EFF is factually wrong .
The patented method was not disclosed in my book General MIDI .
Microsoft raised the same " book " issue in that lawsuit .
After 22 + months of litigation , we settled confidentially .
That would seem to suggest that the EFF 's " book " contention , not my company 's patent , is " bogus . "
The book issue is not settled , says Attorney Paul Grewal of the law firm Day Casebeer Madrid & Batchelder , which is working with EFF on this matter .
" Neither the Patent Office nor any court has previously ruled on the prior art cited in our petition , " he says .
" We are delighted that the PTO has agreed to review this art and are confident that Seer 's claims will be rejected . "
Jungleib insists that he is the victim here .
EFF 's self - righteous confusion reflects both a lack of technical discernment and of informed diligence .
EFF could have learned the facts from the public records or by contacting me .
EFF has not once contacted Seer Systems .
Why they have n't is as much a mystery as why they attack a lone inventor whose patent has already endured scrutiny by the finest legal teams in the country .
The ( patented ) invention is as legitimate as the windshield wiper of current movie attention .
Sadly in parallel , EFF now endorses the unfair practices of , and surrogates for , huge corporations striving to appropriate the creativity of the lone inventor .
This raises fundamental questions about the thoughtfulness and credibility of EFF 's so - called " freedom " agenda .
Attorney Grewal 's retort : " Illegitimate patents like the Seer patent do not promote innovation , they stifle it .
Patent re-examination is an important tool is preventing this type from happening . "
As for those concerns raised last year about Congress " reforming " the patent busters right out of business , EFF attorney Kwun offered me this update today :
We 'll have to see what proposals are made once the new Congress convenes .
There 's nothing pending , to my knowledge , that raises the issue you note , but it 's always possible that similar proposals will be raised by the new Congress .
It 'll be interesting to see if President Obama 's administration tries to steer things in a different direction .
Let 's hope such is the case .
( Update : More from Kwun regarding Jungleib 's contention that this has already been settled :
" The short ( er ) answer is that the patent office has already agreed that the prior art we cited -- Mr. Jungleib's own book , another author 's book about Sound Blaster sound cards , a 1993 USENIX paper about network - distributed audio , two patents filed before the Seer patent -- individually and / or in combination raise substantial new questions regarding the patentability of the 45 claims of the Seer patent .
We expect that the patent office will go on to conclude , as we did , that those claims are invalid .
" The combinations of prior art that we cited are particularly important given the Supreme Court 's 2007 guidance ( in KSR v. Teleflex ) concerning the obviousness standard that applies when considering whether patent claims are novel in view of combinations of prior art .
While we believe the combinations would have been appropriate even under the pre-KSR case law , it 's abundantly clear that in a post - KSR world , a so - called " person having ordinary skill in the art " ( what patent lawyers sometimes refer to as a " PHOSITA " ) would have considered the combinations of prior art that we noted in our reexam request .
... " As an aside , the settlement that Mr. Jungleib points to does n't tell us much about the merits of his claims .
Litigating a patent case through trial these days in a situation like this often costs between 3 and 5 million dollars .
We do n't know how much he was paid in the settlement .
Companies often settle patent cases because the settlement costs are below ( often well below ) the cost of continued litigation .
That 's a business judgment , and does n't mean the defendant thought the patent was valid . "
There was more ; lawyers do n't do short answers .
However closely you look , this is not the Lost City of Atlantis The Lost City of Atlantis is still lost - despite hopes that Google Earth had located the fabled city on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean .
Observers noted what seemed to be a grid of streets and the outlines of a big city on the sea floor about 960 km ( 600 miles ) off the African coast .
Experts had said this was one of the possible sites of the city described by Plato , the Greek philosopher .
But Google said the lines represented sonar data collected from boats .
" It 's true that many amazing discoveries have been made in Google Earth including a pristine forest in Mozambique that is home to previously unknown species and the remains of an Ancient Roman villa , " a Google statement said .
The lines reflect the path of the boat as it gathers the data
Google statement " In this case , however , what users are seeing is an artefact of the data collection process .
Bathymetric ( or sea floor terrain ) data is often collected from boats using sonar to take measurements of the sea floor , " she added .
" The lines reflect the path of the boat as it gathers the data .
The fact there are blank spots between each of these lines is a sign of how little we really know about the world 's oceans . "
The story of Atlantis , a fabled utopia destroyed in ancient times , has captured the imagination of scholars ever since it was first described by the philosopher Plato more than 2,000 years ago .
He wrote of a land of fabulous wealth , advanced civilisation and natural beauty .
Debate rages over where it might lie , if it existed at all : some say it is near Cuba , off the coast of Cornwall , near Gibraltar or in the middle of the Atlantic .

Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn , Sen. Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , Sen. Susan Collins , R- Maine , and Sen. Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , talk about the Senate 's work to pass the economic stimulus bill in the face of strong GOP opposition .
Billion a page : 778 - page , $ 827B stimulus
With a deal filed Saturday night and growing business support , President Barack Obama must next overcome two 60 - vote Senate hurdles Monday and Tuesday before plunging into final negotiations with Congress over the final shape of his economic recovery plan .
Those same House - Senate talks will give the administration an opening to exert itself more directly than it has up to this stage .
But so many changes have now been made to the initial House bill that the conference will almost surely run past Obama ’s Feb.
14th deadline and into the Presidents '
Day recess .

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has vowed there will be no holiday until the bill is done .
And at a party retreat in Virginia Saturday , the California Democrat sought to tamp down criticism from her caucus about the concessions made in the Senate talks .
“ Respect the bill for what it does , do n’t judge it for what you wish it did , ” she said , according to a leadership aide .
Nonetheless , her home state has huge issues with how the Senate would distribute new Medicaid funds , and the reduced level of state aid is a flashpoint for many governors struggling with budget deficits .
The first Senate test Monday evening will come on a cloture petition to cut off debate on the revisions negotiated Friday — revisions that cut about $ 108 billion from the total cost of the package .
The second challenge would follow on mid-day Tuesday when 60 votes will be needed again to waive budget points of order and complete passage .
The administration is betting on at least three Republican moderates to help see it through , and the traditionally Republican - leaning business lobby is beginning to exert itself more as well .
In announcing his support Friday night , Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) pointedly read from a Chamber of Commerce endorsement .
The National Association of Manufacturers has also weighed in , telling Republicans that votes on the bill “ including potential procedural motions ” may be considered for designation as key votes in NAM ’s scoring of their legislative record .
Coming in at noon , the Senate held a rare Saturday session to set this process in motion .
As it worked out , Democrats needed all day — and a big chunk of the night — - just to finish assembling the papers to implement Friday ’s agreement .
The final package , filling 778 pages , was not filed until near 10 p.m. Saturday , and Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) broke the silence by filing cloture an hour later .
Reid thanked Sen. Jon Tester ( D. , Mont. ) , who sat in the chair for hours waiting , for being on hand to “ get the wheels finally moving . ”
The text before the Senate now is essentially a complete substitute for the initial Senate bill , wrapping together the agreement Friday and all the amendments previously adopted on the Senate floor .
Among these is a $ 15,000 homebuyer ’s tax credit , which has since been estimated to cost much more than first advertised .
But no changes were made in this section , though the question is sure to be revisited in talks with the House .
As for the bill itself , it 's now clearer that the overwhelming share of the $ 108 billion in reductions would come from the spending side of the ledger .
The end result is a bill about the same size as the nearly $ 820 billion House package but tilted far more toward tax reductions , which would be more than 40 % of the total .
Discretionary funds governed by the Senate Appropriations Committee are cut by about $ 83 billion , a 23 percent reduction that includes a $ 40 billion cut from a state fiscal stabilization program and the virtual elimination of a $ 19.5 billion public school and higher education construction program opposed by Republicans .
One of the last decisions was to strike $ 5.8 billion in public health funds to fight preventable diseases .
Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) was the driving force in making this cut , but elsewhere , she was also a force in adding $ 870 million for community health centers .
Within the Senate Finance Committee , about $ 7 billion in savings would be achieved from spending programs and $ 18 billion from tax changes .
The savings include $ 2 billion from the president ’s health information technology initiative .
Another $ 5 billion would be achieved by scaling back subsidies promised under a new initiative to help workers maintain their employer - provided health insurance when cut from company payrolls .
Among the modifications to tax provisions , the single largest relates to the treatment of low - income housing tax credits .
But politically , the two more sensitive issues relate to income rules applying to the refundable child tax credit and Obama ’s signature “ Making Work Pay ” payroll tax credit , worth $ 500 per individual and up to $ 1000 for families .
In each case , the revisions dial back eligibility to save a total of $ 5 billion altogether .
The payroll tax credit would begin to phase out when a worker ’s adjusted gross income exceeds $ 70,000 , compared to $ 75,000 .
In the case of the refundable child tax credit , a worker would become eligible only when his or her wages exceed $ 8,100 , $ 2,100 higher than the initial Senate bill and far above the House version .

PRESS RELEASEBoston , MA - 1/18/09FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEJoachim Martillo , Founder of Ethnic Ashkenazim Against Zionist Israel ( EAAZI ) , an anti-racist educational network , that engages Christian , Muslim , Jewish and Humanist intellectuals , warned today that an Israel advocacy organization , masquerading as an ecumenical citizens group , ironically calling itself " Citizens for Peace and Tolerance " ( CPT ) , has been disseminating defamatory and unsubstantiated accusations about local Muslim community members , who are raising money for humanitarian aid to Gaza .
CPT 's last press release dated 1/15/09 may violate Federal Laws ( Conspiracy Against Rights , 18 U.S.C. - 241 and the RICO Act ) .
The inflammatory press release claims that , " For the Muslim American Society to raise funds for a Hamas - linked charity in the heart of Boston is an affront to the traditions of liberty and tolerance on which this city was built .
" As a result of the scare - mongering like that of organizations like CPT , many innocent Muslim clergymen and charity workers have been imprisoned and even tortured .
CPT is dedicated to preventing Muslim Americans from enjoying equal rights in the US under the Constitution and uses innuendo , insinuation and defamation to achieve its goals .
While the Pope , who also sent material aid to Gaza , voiced his concern for “ the most vulnerable people in Jesus ' birth land , today tragically hit by death , suffering and material damage , " CPT 's latest press release insinuates with malice that donating money to the besieged population of the Occupied Palestinian Territories is a potentially criminal offense .
The subtext of CPT 's press release is barely concealed support for genocide through an effort to make sure the maximum number of Palestinians die as a result of the horrendous and murderous IDF attack on Gaza .
"
The pattern of defamation by Zionist groups such as CPT is not only despicable , but it is also shamelessly clear .
They have a very clear goal to marginalize Western Muslims , " Martillo said .
CPT , whose founder is Christian Zionist extremist and Boston College professor Dennis Hale , serves as a front organization for The David Project ( TDP ) , particularly in cases where the Jewishness of TDP might create problems .
TDP is a widely discredited Jewish supremacist organization specializing in Israel Advocacy training and anti-Islamic incitement .
Hale has served as a member of the David Project Advisory Board .
He has been President and Director of two other TDP initiatives , the Judeo - Christian Alliance and the Episcopal Jewish Alliance .
Hale also serves on the Board of Christians for Fair Witness on the Middle East , which is a pro-Israel political lobby and hate - mongering racist organization .
Because both the David Project and Christians for Fair Witness incite hate , their claim to 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax exempt status is almost certainly fraudulent .
While acting as an Israel lobbyist , Hale is probably involved in a wide - ranging conspiracy to commit tax fraud that long ago almost certainly reached criminal proportions .
Israel National
News reported in 2006 that " at the last national Episcopal convention , three resolutions hostile to Israel were brought before the resolutions committee - a committee that was chaired by the aforementioned Bishop Shaw , speaker at the " Israel - Apartheid " conference .an Episcopal lay leader who teaches at Boston College , Rev. Dr. Bruce Chilton of Bard College and Sister Ruth Lautt O.P. , a Dominican nun from New York , the resolutions were shelved .
" However , the New York Sun reports that Hale 's genocidal racist viewpoints were not shared by the other Episcopalians : " Even so , Sister Lautt and Mr. Hale , an associate professor in political science at Boston College tell a disturbing story of their treatment while manning a booth for the group at the convention 's exhibition hall .
' We were at first treated like pariahs , ' says Hale , who began to reconsider his Episcopalian affiliation given the negative reception he received .
" On October 4 , 2004 , CPT , under the names of Hale and Cohen issued an outrageous press release entitled " New Citizens Group Challenges Mosque Leaders to Honestly Address Radical Islamist Roots of Boston Mosque : Concerned about threat to Boston 's tolerant communal tradition . "
CPT 's website , " hatefreeamerica.org " also asserts , without providing any evidence , that " some of the founders of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center have explicitly promoted hatred of Christians , Jews , and Americans .
" Martillo pointed to the clear evidence of CPT ’s involvement in a criminal conspiracy :
" The discovery process during the 2005 lawsuit of the Islamic Society of Boston against the David Project , the CPT and associated individuals and organizations revealed that CPT was engaged in a wide - ranging conspiracy to prevent Boston area Muslims from exercising their Constitutional rights to assemble freely and to practice their religion .
The NE Israeli Consulate , FOX , owned by Rupert Murdoch , and the Boston Herald , owned by Pat Purcell , supplied resources while well - known Islamophobic crackpots like Robert Spencer contributed to the racist effort .
" Spearheading the David Project 's campaign to bulldoze the Roxbury mosque was Steven Cohen , the lawyer and real estate developer who was listed as a contact for CPT .
CPT was exposed by the court discovery documents to have collaborated with the David Project , with the blessing of the Israeli Consulate , in devising legal strategies to force the City of Boston to revoke the sale of land out from under the Roxbury Mosque while simultaneously disseminating professional PR fluff pieces to the media full of misleading suspicions and racist innuendos against innocent Muslim community leaders , who properly responded against the David Project , CPT and other racist conspirators with a lawsuit for defamation .
Howard Cooper , the lawyer for the Islamic Society of Boston stated , " One person with whom the David Project cooperated in this effort , the ISB alleges , was Steve Emerson , the self - styled terrorism ‘ expert ’ who declared the Oklahoma City bombing to be the work of Middle Eastern terrorists within hours of it occurring .
In the Muslim community , and elsewhere , Mr. Emerson is regarded as a person who has made a living attacking Muslims . " " There is grave concern that in every case without exception where a Muslim activist , clergyman or charity founder has been imprisoned based on ‘ secret evidence ’ or ‘ security concerns , ’ the ‘ evidence ’ turns out to be nothing more than empty insinuations that are disseminated by CPT associates such as Steven Emerson or Robert Spencer , " Martillo added .
The CPT is recipient of grants from the right wing Bradley , Olin , and Earhart Foundations .
These three organizations are heavily enmeshed in Neoconservative and Islamophobic mobilization and subversion .
CPT regularly collaborates with other Zionist organizations to create hate campaigns against local Muslim and Arab community members as well as against charities serving victims of war .
The ongoing pro-Israel campaign to prevent Muslim Americans from exercising their Constitutional rights constitutes a severe violation of civil rights law .
CPT has explicitly and continuously subjected Boston 's Muslim community to vacuous , racist , malicious accusations in the media , casting doubt upon local Muslims ' " connections " to some of the most highly regarded and prestigious organizations in the world like
IRW provided humanitarian relief to fellow Americans during the Katrina disaster .
IRW came to Boston last spring and raised tens of thousands of dollars to dig wells and found schools in Darfur .
Islamic Relief is a 5 - star charity that works directly with the UN .
Ethnic Ashkenazim Against Zionist Israel first raised concerns about Citizens for Peace and Tolerance in 2005 , predicting that the Zionist organization 's coordinated media defamation campaign against the Muslims of Roxbury would result in an economic downslide for the City of Boston by making it difficult for Arab and Muslim investors to work with the local and state government to revitalize the Massachusetts and national economy .
The collapse of the world finance system is almost solely attributable to the US - Israel Alliance , which has already cost Americans at least $ 6 - 8 trillion dollars .
" It gives us no pleasure to be proven correct in this matter , " said Martillo .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India ’s Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh underwent successful coronary bypass surgery on Saturday , while confusion surrounded who was in charge of government just months before a general election .
The 76 - year - old leader will be in hospital for at least a week and may be able to return to work in a month , doctors involved in his operation said .
“ The entire country is rejoicing because our Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has come out ... successfully from the operation , ” ruling Congress party general secretary Veerappa Moily told reporters .
Singh ’s operation came just as his Congress party prepares its re-election campaign for a general election by May .
No acting prime minister has been named while Singh is in hospital .
Some officials said Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee would take over most prime ministerial responsibilities , including defense , security and the finance portfolio , while Singh was recovering from surgery .
“ Pranab Mukherjee is in charge of the government until the prime minister resumes his duty , ” an official in the prime minister ’s office , who asked to remain anonymous , told Reuters .
“ This is normal procedure as he is the most senior member of the cabinet , so there has been no official announcement . ”
But a government spokesman insisted this was not the case .
India 's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh speaks during a conference on development , freedom and welfare in honour of Indian Nobel economics laureate Amartya Sen in New Delhi December 19 , 2008 .

Mathur
“ The prime minister is still in charge , ” he told Reuters .
“ Nobody has taken over his functions . ”
Moily told local media : “ There can not be two prime ministers and under the constitution , there can only be one prime minister . ”
“ NO CLARITY ”
That confusion was mirrored in the media , where some papers and television channels said Mukherjee was in charge but others disagreed .
“ Nobody named in charge , ” the Mail Today announced on its front page .
“ No clarity on who controls the nukes . ”
The confusion led to speculation the ruling Congress party did not want to give Mukherjee a public endorsement as acting prime minister just before an election , and overshadow other candidates within Congress battling to be Singh ’s successor .
Rahul Gandhi , heir to one of India ’s most powerful family dynasties , is emerging as a potential successor , media reports said .
Singh has been expected to continue as prime minister if the Congress coalition wins the general election .
The main battle is between the Congress - led government and a coalition led by the Hindu- nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party .
A soft - spoken economist , Singh does not play an important role in election rallies , so analysts said the impact of his absence on the Congress party ’s chances may be limited .
Singh underwent bypass surgery in 1990 in Britain .
He also underwent wrist surgery in 2006 , prostate gland surgery and a cataract removal procedure last year , officials said .
Across India , hundreds of Indians prayed for him at temples .
Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani sent bouquets of flowers to the prime minister .
India ’s relations with Pakistan have been tense since attacks in Mumbai in November which killed 179 people .
In neighbouring Bhutan , hundreds of Buddhist monks held special prayers for the Indian prime minister .
Jamie and Gladys Scott have been wrongfully convicted for armed robbery and received double life sentences each .
No one was murdered or taken to the hospital during this robbery , no one was even injured .
The transcripts state that 9 , 10 or 11 dollars was stolen .
They have been in prison now for 14 years .
America turns its head to those who are incarcerated , especially those considered as brutal and thoughtless .
The average American believes that the justice system is perfect and would never incarcerate those who are innocent .
This line of logic is grossly inconsistent with reality , as thousands of formerly incarcerated inmates have been freed by DNA - evidence only .
Our justice system is failing day by day , minute by minute .
One wrongful conviction is one - too - many , and numbers are escalating well into the tens of thousands .
Adequate legal representation is available to those who are able to pay ; those who cannot , however , suffer .
Consequently , inadequate legal representation mostly leads to an inevitable unjust verdict .
As a legal analyst , I ’ve observed the legal processes in depth over the years , and watched those with money , resources and networks receive justice within a system allegedly designed to serve all .
I ’ve observed the poor and unknowledgeable suffer , as finances , resources , and networks are very limited or void !
It is our right under the Constitution to petition our courts for justice .
What does this say for a Nation of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness — Inalienable Rights ?
Slavery Is Alive and Flourishing In America
Poor people are enslaved in America ’s Prison Industrial Complex .
Indigent legal representation unfolds as inexperienced , underpaid and overworked lawyers provide inadequate representation to the poor – resulting in wrongful convictions ; thus , enslavement to the prison industrial complex increases .
The use of felonious , unethical , and often , illiterate witnesses is an increasing vehicle for wrongful convictions .
The financially disempowered are the burden barriers for society ’s ills , but those with money and corporate networks never experience this enslavement .
As the poor suffer , prosecutors and law enforcement officers are becoming even more corrupt in their policies .
America incarcerates more individuals , especially minorities , than any other nation in the world .
Wrongful convictions are on the rise and corruption is escalating .
Slavery is alive and flourishing in America .
In my years of service to the community , I ’ve come across two distinct cases that yield inconsistencies from the onset .
The case of Ali Khalid Abdullah is one of them .
Ali Khalid Abdullah was released from prison on August 1 , 2008 and has had multitudes of problems dealing with a new society , ever since .
Ali describes his experience as “ being freed from Prison but not free . ”
Ali served 19 years in prison for taking action against a drug dealer who had molested an 11 - year old .
How does a government release prisoners with no assistance , financial or social , and expect positive results ?
My opinion is , they do not .
They expect and hope for recidivism as it is the key to maintaining The Prison Industrial Complex .
The other case is that of two sisters , Jamie and Gladys Scott .
In 1994 , Jamie and Gladys Scott were wrongfully convicted in the state of Mississippi .
A corrupt sheriff used coercion , threats , and harassment to convict the Scott Sisters of armed robbery .
The case of the Scott sisters is an intriguing one , with transcripts stating that perhaps 9 , 10 , or 11 dollars was stolen , at most .
It ’s important to note that no one was murdered or injured .
One of the state ’s witnesses , a 14 year old , testified that he did not have an attorney present when signing a statement prepared by the sheriff .
Jamie and Gladys Scott have served 14 years of double - life sentences , thus far .
That ’s Double Life Each !
The absurdity of their sentencing reaches new heights with the reality that neither of the Scott sisters had prior convictions .
Sadly , the cases of Mr. Abdullah and the Scott sisters are becoming an accepted phenomenon in our society .

The Prison Industrial Complex is the 21st century slave master in the minority community , and unless we are made aware and trained to take action , the enslavement will continue to fester more and more rapidly in years to come .

" The capacity of this [ Goulburn ] facility has been exceeded due to an increasing number of recruits , " the tender document states .
Senior police say the lack of access to shooting ranges has resulted in some younger officers receiving so little practice that they are scared of using their guns .
Officers also claim their annual day - long firearms requalification training is inadequate , leaving them unprepared to use their weapons in dangerous situations .
The criticisms come after the shooting of 48 - year - old Susan Bandera in Sydney last month by a 35 - year - old female constable who has been in the force for two years .
Virtual ranges involve replica guns , complete with recoil , being " shot " at scenarios on a video screen , via wireless technology .
The force will pay $ 1 million for a building plus $ 850,000 for the computer system , which may be operational by September .
" We have a lot of young cops who are scared of guns , " a senior officer told The Sun-Herald .
" They are deployed most of the time and do not get enough access to training and other courses - it's a major problem . "
Another officer said the once - a - year requalification program was not enough : " It 's amazing an innocent bystander has n't been shot .
We all know it 's a pathetic level of training - command say it comes down to money and a lack of resources . "
Opposition police spokesman Michael Gallacher said officers should have more firearms training .
" These simulators are very advanced but quite simply nothing will replace live fire training needed to allow officers to learn how to use their weapons at a moment 's notice , " he said .
" The idea of the training is to get a feel for the pressure of the situation of actually using the firearm that you 're going to be issued .
I 'd be concerned we 're now reducing live fire training and replacing it with the Nintendo Wii . "
Police Association spokesman Greg Black said the union supported virtual training as long as it did not replace live training .
Assistant Commissioner Michael Corboy defended the force 's training regimen , saying there would be no reduction in live training .
" The use of a weapons simulator [ will allow ] NSW Police to train students more frequently in a more efficient and technologically advanced manner , " he said .
Mr Corboy said he had received no complaints about the yearly training program or officers being concerned about using their guns .
Mr Brown wants savers to wait longer before buying their first home Gordon Brown has called for a more responsible banking system , in which banks are the " servants of the economy and society and never its master " .
The prime minister said the Financial Services Authority was looking at how new mortgages of more than 100 % should be controlled in the future .
Writing in The Observer , he called for a return of " prudent " , old - fashioned high street banks .
He also said banks should have a focus on making loans to UK businesses .
" In order to get lending going , we must continue to develop agreements that remove the uncertainty arising from banks being unsure of their losses in return for improved lending conditions for families and businesses , " he wrote .
Critics have described the calls as " humbug " , after Mr Brown 's previous support of light - touch bank regulation .
Although he has extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented power over the banks , the prime minister 's programme of change for the banking system is strikingly conservative
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
See Robert Peston 's blog During his time as chancellor , the prime minister was openly critical of other European banking systems for their strict regulation and inflexibility .
Britain , he said , was strong because of its light - touch regulatory environment , which encouraged investment and created jobs and wealth .
But BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the credit crunch and the ensuing financial crisis had changed Mr Brown 's attitude to banking .
We have got to get the balance right between serving homeowners better and encouraging responsibility in the market
Gordon Brown Mr Brown said the Financial Services Authority would be considering controls on mortgages of more than 100 % of a home 's value , and so - called high multiple mortgages offering loans of up to six times an applicant 's salary .
More caution in the mortgage market , he said , would reduce chances of a future property crash .
' Absolute madness '
In the article he ruled out legislation to create a " rigid divide " between retail high street banks , which offer standard deposit accounts and loans , and investment banks trading globally in complex financial instruments .
Treasury minister Stephen Timms told the BBC the government was not intending to " outlaw " 100 % mortgages .
Mr Brown believes pressure from consumers seeking somewhere safe to put their money will drive banks back to a model more common before the de-regulatory " big bang " in the City .
But Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : " Until very recently Gordon Brown was trying to justify 100 % mortgages . "
He added : " Only last week the Liberal Democrats set out a proposal for Safestart mortgages as the new models for the industry , with 85 % mortgages and protection against negative equity . "
" I 'm glad to see Gordon Brown is catching up with us . "
Earlier Alex Brummer , City editor of the Daily Mail , told the BBC it was " humbug " for the prime minister to now ask people to forget those years of deregulation when bankers could " do what they wished " .
New Banking
Act comes into effect " He did nothing to put the brakes on - quite the opposite .
He claimed we were being very prudent but , of course , we were n't being very prudent and we have now had the consequences of that , " he said .
Mr Brummer also argued it was " absolute madness " for Mr Brown to pretend Britain could " turn the clock back " .
" Banking has changed , the world has changed - finance moves much faster now and I think it is impossible now to go back to that era , " he added .
Mr Brown 's comments came a day after the UK's new Banking Act , which gives greater powers of intervention to the Bank of England , was introduced .
The act enables the Bank to intervene more quickly to help troubled banks and protect investors .
It will be able to give hidden support to stricken banks , with the aim of maintaining financial stability .
However , critics of the act say it throws a cloak of secrecy around the banking world , which could be detrimental for consumers .

( CNN ) -- Evangelical pastor Ted Haggard says he contemplated suicide after his relationship with a male escort was revealed in 2006 , resulting in his being fired from the influential megachurch that he founded two decades ago .
Rev.
Ted Haggard tells Oprah Winfrey he still struggles with homosexual urges but says he is not gay .
Haggard told talk show host Oprah Winfrey on Wednesday that the scandal forced him to work through his " issues " with homosexuality .
" I was dying .
I had settled in my mind exactly how I was going to commit suicide , " Haggard told Winfrey .
" I was preparing , and in my life , Jesus came to me and he said , ' Now , now I can save you . ' "
The interview also addressed the latest scandal involving the embattled pastor .
In a statement from Haggard that Winfrey read at the end of the program , Haggard denied having " physical contact " with a second man whose allegations of an inappropriate relationship with Haggard surfaced recently .
Watch Haggard 's accuser speak out »
Haggard , who appeared in the prerecorded interview segment with his wife and two of his three children , said he continues to struggle with homosexual urges but insisted he is not gay .

Thursday , 9 p.m. ET on CNN see full schedule »
Haggard continues to have " sexual thoughts about men , but they 're not compulsive any more , and I do have temptations , but they 're not compulsive , " he told Winfrey .
He said one therapist described him as a " heterosexual with homosexual attachments , " and he admitted to struggling with homosexual urges all his life .
" I do believe I do n't fit into the normal boxes , " Haggard said .
" I do think there are complexities associated with some people 's sexuality , but it just was n't as simple as I wanted it to be , because I was so deeply in love with my life . "
But , he added , " I had this other thing going on inside of me too . "
Haggard founded the Colorado - based New Life Church in his basement in 1984 and oversaw its growth to a megachurch with some 15,000 members .
After the scandal , he was fired from the church in 2006 and also resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals -- a group that says it represents millions of people in 45,000 evangelical church congregations nationwide .
Do n't Miss Disgraced pastor Haggard facing new sex allegations
His fall followed allegations from male escort Mike Jones about a sex - for - money relationship that involved drugs .
" When it first started to happen , I lied about it because I was so ashamed , and it was the first time that that dark area of my life that I had worked so hard to keep secret and fight against was coming to the surface , " he told Winfrey .
" I thank God , though , that in this process , I am where I am now and that accusation and the scandal had a lot to do with that , " he said .
The interview aired as Haggard tries to combat the latest allegations .
A senior pastor at New Life Church in Colorado Springs , Colorado , said Monday that the church agreed to pay the second man -- a 20 - year - old church volunteer -- in exchange for his pledge not to talk publicly about the relationship with Haggard .
After the taped segment , Winfrey read a statement from Haggard about those new allegations .
" Even though there was never any physical contact , I have regretted my irresponsible behavior , " Haggard said , referring to allegations from a man he identified as Grant .
" I apologized to Grant , my family and the church two years ago .
I now ask him again for his forgiveness as well as the people of the church , " Haggard said .
In the past three weeks , the man told New Life Senior Pastor Brady Boyd that he was considering going public with his story because Haggard was portraying himself as a victim in an upcoming HBO documentary called " The Trial of Ted Haggard , " which is scheduled to air Thursday .

Vitter calls auto bailout ' ass backwards ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Louisiana Sen .
David Vitter had some colorful language to describe a proposed $ 15 billion loan to Detroit 's big three , calling the deal " ass backwards . "
The hooker - patronizer 's colorful language caused some blushing at MSNBC , a network that may still be overly sensitive about on - air profanity .
" Can I say this ? " wondered congressional correspondent Mike Viqueira .
" ' Ass backwards . '
He said it on the floor of the Senate and it was on public television , so I guess I can say it .
...
That 's an indication of the significant Republican opposition in the United State Senate . "
Afternoon anchor Contessa Brewer joked that Viquera should have just said " bass ackwards " to avoid the profanity .
But she reminded him , " We have heard some language on the floor of the Senate ... which should not be repeated on television , from people higher up than David Vitter . "
It 's not clear exactly what she meant , but the anchor was probably referring to Dick Cheney 's infamous f-bomb laden outburst from 2004 .

Tania Zaetta Gets Apology for Sex with Soldiers Accusation ( PHOTOS )
Australian actress received an apology from Australia 's military chief on Tuesday for falsely accusing her of engaging in sex with elite special forces soldiers during a 2008 concert tour at a military base in Afghanistan .
Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston met with Zaetta and her family to apologize for naming her in a defense briefing note , which was leaked to the press .
" There was no substance to the allegations , " Houston said in a statement .
" Ms. Zaetta gave her time and her talent to entertain our forces serving in Afghanistan and she deserves our praise and our thanks .
I have also made clear to Ms. Zaetta that she is welcome to again join a Forces Entertainment Tour in the near future . "
Zaetta , considered " one of the first foreigners to conquer Bollywood , " toured Australian Defence Force bases in Afghanistan and Iraq during early 2008 with a group of entertainers .
A draft ministerial " hot issues brief " was published in various newspapers intimating that the 38 - year - old actress had engaged in sex with several members of the Australian Special Air Services Regiment .
Other entertainers touring with the group said in media interviews that they were so " managed " and tired during the trip that they could not imagine that this could be possible .
" I 've heard of quickies mate , but you 'd have to be really quick - we did n't have time to do anything , " said John Clinton , from the country rock band The Wolverines .
Additionally , various members of the Government of Australia denied that this was seriously suggested .
Zaetta strongly denied the allegation , and demanded an apology .
Late last year Australia 's defense department and Zaetta reached an agreement to compensate her for " an unacceptable breach of privacy " in relation to " false allegations . "

This article is marked as ' retired ' .
The information here may be out of date and / or incomplete .
Transgenics , while still in its infancy as a field , is nothing new at this point .
We already have genetically modified corn , rice , and numerous other plants that have been altered to produce crops that are more disease resistant , more nutritious , or just about anything else the plant geneticists have been able to dream up .
Now labs are starting to branch into animals .
Recently researchers in Taiwan created some pigs that are a tad – different .
Using genetic material from jellyfish , the National University of Taiwan , Department of Animal Research treated 265 pig embryos , implanted them in sows , and managed to produce three live births , all male , all glowing – but not just with good health .
These pigs glow green down to the cellular level .
Even their internal organs glow green , which is what distinguishes them from previous green transgenic pigs .
The hope of the researcher is that these pigs can breed true , leading to a reproducible line of glowing green pigs .
The pigs become somewhat less surprising when you look at the success several Asian labs have had with fish .
Three years ago , in 2003 , the University of Singapore produced a line of transgenic zebrafish .
The zebrafish were treated with genes from sea anemones , and the result was a bright red , glowing fish .
The Glofish are now an established line , and an established brand name .
The fish are being marketed in the US as a novelty pet , and other colors have been created to enhance their appeal for that purpose .
Researchers , however , have much broader uses in mind for their fish .
It is their hope to breed versions of the Glofish whose luminescence is reactive to certain environmental chemicals – some pollutants , for example .
Then it would be possible to use the Glofish as organic pollution detectors ; place them in a waterway , and check whether or not they glow to determine if a particular pollutant is present .
Because of the broader applications envisioned for the Glofish , it has become somewhat more controversial than the pigs are ever likely to be .
Environmentalists are concerned that released Glofish may pose a threat to wild zebrafish populations .
They posit several possible scenarios .
One of the most alarming has been dubbed the “ Trojan Gene ” .
In this version , the glowing display of the transgenic fish would render them irresistible as mates , thereby causing a large - scale mixing of the wild and transgenic populations .
However , the glow could also make them an easy mark for predators .
The combination would result in a crash in the zebrafish population as the first mixed generation became easy prey .
The “ Trojan Gene ” is one of several posited hypotheses of the effect of released Glofish , there are several others with results ranging from nominal to devastating .
Regardless of which set of hypotheses prove to be true , it will be take a lot of research and testing before any country is likely to allow the fish to be used in an uncontrolled environment .
Whatever the obstacles to their use in the wild , the idea of organic detectors is an intriguing one that is unlikely to go away , even if environmental concerns keep them in the lab .
Using transgenic animals in this way could allow detection or tracking of effects that would normally require an animal be biopsied or sacrificed to allow close study .
The line of green pigs , once established , is destined for use in stem cell research .
A glowing green stem - cell culture could be tracked visually as it grew and interacted with a host animal , no biopsies needed .
Glofish , if the researchers manage to make them pollutant specific , could be used to study toxin uptake , as the transparency of small fish would make it possible to watch the various sections of the fish start to glow .
It does n’t take much imagination to see a future with animals that can be modified in almost any way desired .
Technicolor sheep may one day be a common sight .
Whether this is a direction we wish to travel is something yet to be seen .
What happens in the next few years with the transgenic animals we have now could easily set the direction we follow for years , or decades , to come .
The family of a 22 - year - old man shot to death by a transit police officer on New Year ’s Day urged Oakland residents Thursday to remain calm and deplored the violence that erupted during a protest over the shooting a day earlier .
The city bristled with anger and sorrow as store owners cleaned up the debris from the vandalism during Wednesday night ’s protest and officials announced that the Oakland Police Department would join in the investigation of Oscar J. Grant III ’s death .
Demonstrators disrupted a Bay Area Rapid Transit district board meeting to demand justice .
After several hours of anguished testimony , board members apologized Thursday to the family for the shooting death and agreed to consider creating a board subcommittee to oversee BART police procedures .
But it was Wanda Johnson , Grant ’s mother , who spoke in the strongest terms about the aftermath of her son ’s death and that protest that resulted in more than 100 arrests , scores of damaged buildings and a number of torched cars .

“ I am begging the citizens to not use violent tactics , not to be angry , ” Johnson said during a news conference a day after burying her son .
“ Oscar would not want to see all the violence going on . ”
“ You ’re hurting people who have nothing to do with the situation .
You ’re vandalizing their cars , their properties , you ’re breaking their windows , ” said the Hayward woman , who was flanked by family members and their attorney .
“ Please stop it .
. . .
Just , please . ”
Grant was returning home to the East Bay on a BART train in the early hours of Jan. 1 , after celebrating New Year ’s Eve in San Francisco .
A fight broke out between two groups of riders on the train about 2 a.m .
BART police met the train at Oakland ’s Fruitvale station and ordered passengers onto the platform .
Grainy cellphone videos broadcast on television and viewed thousands of times on the Internet show Grant lying facedown on the platform .

He reaches for his weapon and shoots Grant point - blank in the back .
Grant was unarmed .
The family has filed a $ 25 - million wrongful - death claim against BART and Mehserle that could result in a lawsuit .
Grant , who has a 4 - year - old daughter , was buried Wednesday morning .
A peaceful protest began about 3 p.m. Wednesday at the Fruitvale station , near where Grant died .
It turned violent after demonstrators left the station and began marching toward downtown Oakland .
Police in riot gear tried to control the crowd , which grew to 200 to 300 people .

Dumpsters were overturned , windows were smashed and cars were set on fire .
Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums tried to calm the crowd , which reached the steps of City Hall .
Protesters were angry about Grant ’s death and the transit agency ’s handling of the investigation , saying that police officials had taken too long to interview the officers involved .
Mehserle resigned Wednesday without giving a statement , although BART spokesman Linton Johnson said all of the other officers involved have been interviewed .
Reiko Redmonde , a spokeswoman for Berkeley - based Revolution Books , attended Wednesday ’s protest .
She said protesters carried signs with the words “ Justice for Oscar Grant ” and “ This is not the first time this has happened . ”

Some lay facedown on the ground , with signs on their backs pleading , “ Please do n’t shoot me . ”
Asked about the property damage , Redmonde said the “ resistance was justified .
I support what happened in Oakland . ”
Such views were little comfort for Leemu Tokpa , 36 , who was cleaning up broken glass at Creative African Braids on Thursday .
She had spent the night at her 14th Street store with her husband , baby and three brothers , worried that the mob would return .
Tokpa said she had heard about the Grant case on the news , but she was baffled about why she ended up being a victim , why demonstrators broke her store windows and threw a bottle at her while she held her 8 - month - old son .
“ I ’m disappointed in them , ” she said of the protesters .
“ They ’re saying a black man was killed , and they ’re mad .
We ’re all mad .
But to come to a sister ’s shop and cause damage ?
How can they treat me like this ? ”

Initially , the investigation into Grant ’s death was carried out by BART officials , with the Alameda County district attorney ’s office conducting a parallel independent effort .
John L. Burris , attorney for Grant ’s family , demanded that a murder investigation be conducted .
And on Wednesday , Dellums called for the Oakland Police Department to launch its own investigation .
At a City Hall news conference Thursday , Dellums appeared with Oakland Police Chief Wayne Tucker and Dist .
Atty .
Tom Orloff , where they announced the new effort .
“ The Oakland Police Department has met with us , and we are going to move together jointly ” to investigate the shooting , Orloff said , estimating that it would take two weeks before the agencies could decide whether criminal charges would be filed .

“ I think it ’s important that when we move forward , that we move forward with a case that is court - ready , ” Orloff said .
“ That ’s what my goal is . ”

How many vice presidents does it take to shoot from the lip ?
Ask Vice President Joe Biden , who this week experienced a sweat - inducing " did I really say that ? " moment after he lamely tried to turn U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts into a punch line while standing next to the president of the United States .
Instead , Biden found himself the target of an arctic blast of reaction from President Obama .
Ouch .
Not only did his line about " my memory is not as good as Justice Roberts " - a reference to Roberts flubbing the words to the oath of office when he administered it to Obama Tuesday - earn him groans from the crowd of White House staffers he was swearing in Wednesday .
It earned him a YouTube moment - and a firm put - a lid- on - it presidential grip on Biden 's arm .
It 's nothing new .
" Shoot from the lip " Biden has n't exactly been a stranger to the gaffe - o - meter this week .
The former Delaware senator apparently had told his wife , Jill , that he was offered a choice of jobs : secretary of state and vice president .
Or at least that 's what she said on Oprah Winfrey 's TV show Monday .
That put him in shushing mode - and ended with a release in which Biden said it was , well , a misunderstanding .
While the genial vice president is known for verbosity - he even jokes about it - the week 's goings - on have some political insiders wondering and joking if the talkative , congenial Biden can get a handle on his " foot in mouth " syndrome before he makes more headlines .
Comedians appear to be still finding their footing when it comes to ribbing the popular president , but some - like Andy Borowitz , in a Huffington Post commentary - are gratefully turning to the VP for rich material .
Especially in the wake of the Dick Cheney years .
" In the first major initiative of his presidency , President Barack Obama today dispatched Vice President Joe Biden on what he called ' an important and special mission ' to Antarctica , " Borowitz wrote Wednesday .
He said the news came as a surprise to Biden , who " was in the middle of making a joke about Chief Justice John Roberts :
Here 's how John Roberts sings the national anthem , Mr. Biden was saying , ' Oh see can you say . ' "
But some media seized on the moment as evidence of trouble ahead .
" That did n't take long , " huffed the conservative Washington Times , whose writer Jon Ward called it " an unsubtle dig at the chief justice " and the second time in a week that Biden had gone " off script . "
Political analysts say Biden 's headline - making moments are , at least for now , being taken with a grain of salt - but they caution he'd better be more careful or become punch line material .
" At what point does the vice president merely become a sideshow to a new president who spoke in his inaugural address of casting off childish things ? " says Republican strategist Karen Hanretty .
" Biden has said he wants to be the last person in the room when important decisions are made , and I wonder ... can you be the last man in the room if you can't keep your mouth shut ? "
Others are tougher .
" He 's an embarrassment , " said GOP strategist Patrick Dorinson .
If the vice president keeps making news on this front , he predicts , " Biden 's reputation is going to suffer , because people are going to realize he's not that sharp , that he thinks he 's going to be this big shot . "
But Democratic strategist Phil Trounstine says it 's understandable that conservatives may be anxious to get some political traction - what with that popular president and his inaugural celebration this week .
But they should relax , he cautions , because Biden 's slip - ups are small compared to the last VP , and they 're bound to be more entertaining .
" The Roberts thing was sort of a typical Joe Biden ' shoot from the lip ' kind of quip , " he said .
" Obama knows the guy ; he knew what he was getting in for . "
While the Biden remarks did get noticed - and in some cases , raised eyebrows - " I just do n't think it 's a problem , " Trounstine said .
" If Joe Biden starts getting into getting into public conflicts with Hillary on foreign policy or saying things that create genuine problems , that is a different thing . "
But right now , he said , Biden just " adds a little spice to the mix .
He 's definitely the un-Cheney . "
" And if the Republicans want to make an issue out of it , " said Trounstine , they better remember : " This guy has n't shot anybody in the face yet ... and I do n't think he will . "

The Bush administration ’s infatuation with presidential power has finally pushed the country over a constitutional precipice .
As of New Year ’s Day , ongoing combat in Iraq is illegal under US law .
In authorizing an invasion in 2002 , Congress did not give President Bush a blank check .
It explicitly limited the use of force to two purposes : to “ defend the national security of the US from the threat posed by Iraq ” and “ enforce all relevant UN Security Council resolutions . ”
At precisely one second after midnight , Congress ’ authorization of the war expired …
The question is how President Obama should respond to the legal catastrophe that Bush has left as his Iraqi legacy .
Five years after the fall of Saddam Hussein , the government of Iraq no longer poses a threat .
Our continuing intervention has been based on the second clause of Congress ’ grant of war - making power .
Coalition troops have been acting under a series of Security Council resolutions authorizing the continuing occupation of Iraq .
But this year , Bush allowed the UN mandate to expire on December 31 without requesting a renewal .
At precisely one second after midnight , Congress ’ authorization of the war expired along with this mandate .
Bush is trying to fill the legal vacuum with the new Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) he signed with the Iraqis .
But the president ’s agreement is unconstitutional , since it lacks the approval of Congress .
Bush even refused to allow Congress access to the terms of the deal .
By contrast , Prime Minister al - Maliki followed his constitution and submitted the agreement for parliamentary approval .
While the Iraqi parliament debated its terms , leading members of Congress were obliged to obtain unofficial English translations of texts published by the Arab press .
Bush defends his extraordinary conduct by claiming that it is traditional for commanders in chief to negotiate status of forces agreements without congressional consent .
But the Iraqi agreement goes far beyond anything in the traditional SOFAs concluded with close to 100 countries since World War II .
Indeed , it goes far beyond any sensible interpretation of the president ’s power as commander in chief .
For example , the SOFA creates a joint US - Iraq committee and gives it , not the president , broad control over the use of American combat troops .
It thereby asserts the authority to restrict President Obama ’s powers as commander in chief throughout most of his first term in office .
But under the Constitution , no president can unilaterally limit his successor ’s authority over the military .
This defective agreement cannot serve as a valid substitute for the congressional authorization that Bush so casually allowed to expire on December 31 .
It is up to Congress to authorize continuing military action .
Gaining the consent of a foreign power simply is n’t enough .
The question is how Obama should respond to the legal catastrophe that Bush has left as his Iraqi legacy .
It ’s easy to eliminate one option .
Whatever the original infirmities of Bush ’s agreement , Obama should not repudiate it .
Now that Maliki has won approval from his parliament , the agreement has become the basis for the next phase of Iraqi politics .
It also contains withdrawal timetables that are compatible with Obama ’s goals : all combat troops out of Iraq ’s cities by July ; all troops out of Iraq by the end of 2011 .
As a consequence , Obama may be tempted to accept the agreement that Bush has left behind , and proceed without correcting its obvious constitutional deficiencies .
But this would be a tragic mistake .
We are living in an age of small wars — some are blunders , but some will be necessary .
The challenge is to sustain their democratic legitimacy by keeping them under congressional control .
If Obama goes along with the Bush agreement , he will make this impossible .
Future presidents will cite the Iraqi accord as a precedent whenever they choose to convert Congress ’ authorization of a limited war into an open - ended conflict .
There is a better way ahead .
President Obama should submit the Bush - Maliki agreement to Congress on January 20 and urge its speedy approval .
This request is likely to win broad bipartisan support .
Rapid congressional ratification will not only fill the legal vacuum threatening the constitutional integrity of our military operations in Iraq .
Together with the closing of Guantanamo , it will show that Obama is serious about reining in the worst presidentialist abuses of the Bush years .
Members of the incoming administration have already taken steps in the right direction .
Both Secretary of State - designate Hillary Clinton and Vice President - elect Joseph Biden took the lead as senators in protesting Bush ’s unilateralism in the conduct of the Iraqi negotiations .
And Obama has made clear that he appreciates the role of checks and balances in our constitutional scheme .
Now is the time to reverse the precipitous slide toward the imperial presidency .
Bruce Ackerman and Oona Hathaway are professors of law at Yale and the University of California Berkeley , respectively .
LCD Screen Makers Plead Guilty in Price Fixing Case
by Jeff Gamet , 9:20 AM EST , November 13th , 2008

Sharp , LG , and Chunghwa Picture Tubes have all agreed to plead guilty to charges that they collaborated to fix the price of LCD displays .
The companies agreed to pay US $ 585 million in fines for artificially raising the price of displays in products including Apple 's iPod , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Sharp was accused of involvement in three different price - fixing conspiracies where it sold LDC panels to Apple , Dell , and Motorola , LG and Chunghwa were accused of conspiring to set mutual LCD component prices .
The companies were able to set artificially high prices , which ultimately were passed on to consumers .
Assistant Attorney General Thomas O. Barnett said that the conspiracy " affected millions of American consumers who use computers , cellphones and numerous other household electronics every day . "
He added that LCD prices should come down now , leading to lower prices for consumers .
Sharp representatives stated that the company " understands the gravity of this situation and will strengthen and thoroughly implement measures to prevent the recurrence of this kind of problem , and will earnestly work to regain the public 's confidence . "
LG and Chunghwa have not commented on their plea .
This week the ever - hateful Something Awful Forum Goons took a bit of time to carefully remove the " fun " from life itself .
With cold indifference they brutalized many popular games and toys , turning them into hideous chores that gnaw at the fabric of the human spirit .

Senate consideration of President Obama ’s choice for the Pentagon ’s No. 2 job will be allowed to proceed after the Armed Services Committee chairman said that an ethics waiver would be granted to the nominee , William J. Lynn III , who was a registered lobbyist for a military contractor .
Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the committee , said the director of the Office of Management and Budget waived provisions of Mr. Obama ’s new executive order on ethics for Mr. Lynn , nominated to be deputy defense secretary .
Without a waiver , those provisions would appear to preclude Mr. Lynn ’s acting on many significant issues .
With the waiver , Mr. Levin said , the Senate can act on the nomination .
He also emphasized that the committee would continue to insist that Mr. Lynn comply with ethics rules that would require him to recuse himself for one year from decisions involving his prior employer , Raytheon , unless specifically authorized to participate .
I tend to keep quiet about how much I like Gossip Girl .
I ought to like edgy shows such as The Wire but I do n't , really .
I tell everyone that I do , because otherwise the cool police will come and get me .
But actually I watch Gossip Girl and talk about it in secret with Simon , my one friend who also admits to watching it .
This is moderately shaming because Gossip Girl is terrible .
It is vacuous rubbish with no real redeeming features , aimed just below the intellect of your average 13 - year - old .
Yet I can't get enough of it .
Produced by Josh " The OC " Schwartz , the show follows an unlikeable and unbelievable bunch of rich and slightly less rich teenagers and their staggeringly moronic parents around Manhattan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The central premise is so simple it 's genius , and it's one that the pre-teen and teen audience – and I – can , like , totally relate to .
There are these two girls , Blair Waldorf ( Leighton Meester ) and Serena van der Woodsen ( Blake Lively ) , and they used to be best friends but now they hate each other .
And that 's it .
Each episode gleefully details what terrible new things they have dreamed up to do to each other .
The plot is ludicrous , the dialogue at times laugh - out - loud bad .
For example : " My father left my mother for a 31 - year - old model ... a 31 - year - old male model ! "
Or : " So what if your BFF can make you go WTF ? "
The eponymous and anonymous Gossip Girl is a blogger , posting about " the scandalous lives " of the residents of the Upper East Side .
Referring to the characters by their first initial , she provides a voice - over for the action , coming out with such gems as " Who does n't love a five - finger discount ?
Especially if one of them is the middle one ! "
Gossip Girl is , in short , the Showgirls of teen TV .
Watching an episode is like eating an entire bag of penny sweets all in one go .
But the programme , based on the best - selling books by Cecily von Ziegesar , is actually far more enjoyable and compelling than The OC , the show that made Schwartz 's name and with which Gossip Girl is constantly compared .
Even when it is rubbish and frankly embarrassing , at least Gossip Girl has none of The OC 's nauseating smugness .
The clothes are better on the Upper East Side , too ; the subjects are less challenging ; the clichés are more cringeworthy ; and the whole thing is so sincerely insincere , rather than insincerely sincere ( like The OC ) , that it is entirely more likeable .
I bet Josh Schwartz knows this .
There was doubtless plenty of money in making
The OC , but there is even more money in the pre-teen and teen audience who own every single one of Von Ziegesar 's books ; they are a demographic that in any given country have a combined disposable income that outstrips the US Army 's budget .
And little training - bra brats absolutely love Gossip Girl .
They gobble it up and spit it out in the playground with relish .
Which one are you ?
Tall , blonde , thin , perfect ( if a bit scruffy ) Serena van der Woodsen ?
Or short , dark , scheming , power - crazed über - bitch ( but totally popular ) Blair Waldorf ?
Anyone who has met a 13 - year - old girl ( or , actually , a girl any age ) can probably attest to the fact that what they really hate is each other : Serena and Blair 's relentless power struggle is only the magnification and slight distortion of what happens , daily , in young girls ' lives .
Although , Serena and Blair do n't get nearly personal enough .
If I were Serena I would definitely make far more of the ripe acne Blair hides under all that make - up .
And there 's a reason the camera rarely strays below Serena 's shoulders – she 's got thighs the width of the M4 !
Just as ever - shifting " friendship groups " are absolutely central to the lives of teenage girls , everything and everyone else in Gossip Girl is an accessory to the main Blair / Serena catfight .
Serena and Blair 's posh male peers are curiously sexless , mere eunuchs serving at the ultra - feminine court of bitchery .
They say things like " It 's expected of me – after all , I am an Archibald " , and " Of course I 'm going to an Ivy League school – I'm a Bass ! " and " Hey , it 's OK , he can afford it – he 's a Von der Dietzenmesserschimdt ! "
Nathan " Nate " Archibald , who looks exactly like boy robots will in the future , is the cause of the original row between Blair and Serena .
He spends most of the first series as Blair 's boyfriend , but he and Serena have a bit of a " thing " .
There is precisely zero chemistry between him and Blair , who , episode after episode , desperately throws her virginity at him , which he politely declines ; nor is there any chemistry between him and Serena .
He does spend an awful lot of time sleeping on the sofa of the deliciously unfeasible rotter Chuck Bass , who lives in the hotel his dad owns , and is Bad because he drinks a lot and tries to seduce 14 - year - old girls .
If he could grow a moustache , he would twirl it .
I just hope Nate turns out to be gay and Chuck develops a nasty smack habit .
Counter - intuitively , Dan Humphrey , the obligatory wrong - side - of - the - tracks boy , whose sole purpose is to be a bit dangerous and loosen a bit of rich - girl knicker elastic , is a total drip .
He 's a virgin , for God 's sake , and when his girlfriend Serena wants to do it he has to read the Kama Sutra for tips and be advised by his dad to change his sheets , which are decorated with a football motif .
Which brings us to a key Gossip Girl trait : the lack of any solid adult figures .
If Gossip Girl were a documentary , all the parents would immediately be investigated by social services .
Serena 's mother , Lily , is an entirely one - dimensional multiple divorcée who only cares about money and social status ; Blair 's mom , Eleanor , is downright horrible , and picks Serena over her own daughter to star in a photo campaign for her clothing line ;
Dan 's aforementioned dorky dad owns a gallery in Brooklyn , wears a gap - year - tragedy leather - thong necklace and used to be in a band .
Nate 's mum is a Valium zombie ; his father ( seen thrashing around in Samantha Jones ' bedroom in Sex and the City ) at least has an entertaining cocaine habit , exposed when he buys a fist - sized bagful and hides it in the living room bookcase .
When Nate confronts him , his dad throws a no - doubt cocaine - fuelled punch and is arrested by a conveniently passing policeman .
Feckless parents , catty teenagers who are so thin their eyes bulge out of their tiny heads , petty arguments , and actors with names that sound like they were cobbled together from a Scrabble set with half the letters missing .
Gossip
Girl is not cool , it 's not clever and it's not realistic .
What 's not to like ?
Gossip guy : Ed Westwick , the Upper East Side 's hottest heartthrob
A strange thing happens ahead of my meeting with Ed Westwick aka ' Gossip Girl ' 's smooth - talking , flash - dressing bad boy Chuck Bass : I start to get inundated with texts and phone calls from England , all of them asking the same thing : " Have you interviewed him yet ?
What 's he like ?
Phone me immediately you 've finished and let me know . "
The people making these phone calls are otherwise sane , rational human beings of both sexes , yet their interest in ' Gossip Girl ' 's most devious gossip boy appears to verge on obsession .
Not since a long ago interview with a pre-' Shameless '
James McAvoy have so many people been so keen to ask me what an interviewee is really like .
The answer is that , like McAvoy , Westwick is likeable , candid and down - to - earth .
When we meet on a cold Sunday night in a Manhattan bar , he starts talking the instant we sit down , pausing only to order a beer : " Sorry if my voice sounds a bit odd , we were just doing this crazy shoot for ' Rolling Stone ' and they made us pretend to have a pillow fight so the feathers got everywhere and now I keep thinking that I 've got some stuck in my throat .
I 'll probably start choking or something . "
Stray feathers apart , it appears that little fazes Westwick who manages to be refreshingly open about life in the spotlight while remaining both unbothered by the idea of fame and by the notion that it might stop him doing whatever he fancies .
" It can be crazy , " he admits referring to the attention devoted to ' Gossip Girl ' 's young cast by the New York paparazzi .
" But I came to a decision once everything started taking off that I was n't going to be imprisoned by it [ success ] .
I did n't see the need to restrict myself , if I want to go out and get pissed up then I 'm going to go out and get pissed up .
As long as it's not damaging me or anyone else then I do n't think it 's a problem . "
It may not be a problem but surely it 's somewhat exhausting ?
Westwick is regularly papped outside of some of New York 's hottest bars , his every move seems to be tracked by both the ' New York Post ' 's Page Six and , more light - heartedly , by New York blogs such as Intelligencer and Gawker , meanwhile his love life is the source of much speculation ( he 's rumoured to be dating cast member Jessica Szohr aka Vanessa Abrams , who pops in during our interview ) .
" I'm a 21 - year - old in New York and New York is like London on crack or , no , New York 's like London on speed , it 's incredible , " says Westwick with a grin .
" I 'd be lying if I said I did n't love living here . "
Dedication to having a good time or otherwise there 's also no doubting Westwick 's commitment to the role that is making his name .
Born in Stevenage , Westwick originally auditioned for the part of preppy golden boy Nate Archibald but , while the show 's creators , Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage , loved him , the network felt that he looked more like a serial killer than a romantic lead .
He was given the role of Chuck instead and , despite a wardrobe that teeters on the verge of parody , turned the character from potential sleazebag into the show 's romantic heart .
" I think the reason people like Chuck is because more people prefer to see a bad person grope towards redemption than to see a good person go to the bad , " Westwick says .
" And also he and Blair have a relationship that echoes classic films , plus , of course , they get all the witty lines . "
Nor is it just viewers who have fallen for the strangely seductive Chuck Bass .
The Chuck / Blair pairing was cited in almost every US magazine 's end of year review .
" It has been amazing , " Westwick admits .
" I really miss London in the summer , " he says .
" But the rest of the year ... when I go back it 's like a glimpse of what my life might have been if I had n't got lucky and what it still could be .
At the moment I 'm here and it 's fun and I 'm making the most of it .
Would n't you ? "

Ministers ... decided the time for talking was over - the time for action on this pollution is now
Achim Steiner , Unep World governments have agreed to crack down on mercury pollution .
Environment ministers meeting in Nairobi have initiated a process that should end in a legally binding , international treaty .
The landmark decision was taken by more than 140 countries attending the governing council of the United Nations Environment Programme ( Unep ) .
Mercury compounds can be damaging to the central nervous systems of humans and animals .
Unep 's Executive Director , Achim Steiner , said : " Unep has , for some seven years , co-ordinated and contributed to an intense scientific and policy debate on how best to deal with the issue of mercury .
" Today the world 's environment ministers , armed with the full facts and full choices , decided the time for talking was over - the time for action on this pollution is now . "
American position
The key factor enabling ministers to agree a way forward has been the willingness of the new US Obama administration to buy into a treaty .
In his address to the council on Monday , US delegate Daniel Reifsnyder , said mercury was the " most important global chemical issue facing us today " , and required " immediate action " .
He said that a half of all mercury deposition within the US now came from sources outside its borders , and that only international coordination could address the problem .
The previous Bush administration had steadfastly opposed legally binding measures to control mercury .
The ministers meeting in the Kenyan capital agreed an eight - point interim plan to help curb pollution while awaiting the full treaty .
This included : • Boosting the world - wide capability for nations to safely store stockpiled mercury •
Reducing the supply of mercury from , for example , primary mining of the heavy metal • Carrying out awareness raising of the risks alongside projects to cut the use of mercury in artisanal mining where an estimated 10 million miners and their families are exposed •
Reducing mercury in products such as thermometers and high - intensity discharge lamps , and in processes such as some kinds of paper - making and plastics production Mining issue Mercury is a naturally occurring metal released into the environment from rocks and soils , and in volcanic eruptions .
But human activities are continually adding more .
The vast majority of human emissions come from the burning of coal and the incineration of waste materials .
And of particular concern down the years has been the use of mercury to mine gold .
Poor gold mine practices have elevated levels of mercury in the environment Gold particles will stick to mercury when the precious metal is panned .
The resulting amalgam can then be burnt to recover the gold .
The practice followed in some developing nations has resulted in huge quantities of the heavy metal being washed into the environment , putting mine workers at risk .
One of the most common ways mercury affects people is in the organic form methylmercury .
Methylmercury attacks the central nervous system : symptoms include numbness and unsteadiness , tiredness , ringing in the ears , and problems with vision , hearing and speech .
It is a particular risk to pregnant women and their foetuses , infants , children , and people whose diet includes a lot of fish .
Animals and birds that prey on fish are also at risk , especially otters , mink , eagles and ospreys .
Mercury levels in Arctic ringed seals and beluga whales have also risen sharply in parts of Canada and Greenland .

Ted Nugent wants to be Obama 's drug czar Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday January 15 , 2009
Print This Email This
It seems as though self - titled " rock legend " Ted Nugent is no fan of taking a Journey to the Center of the Mind .
The same Nugent who said , during an August 2007 concert , -- as he was holding what appeared to be two assault rifles -- " Obama , he 's a piece of shit , and I told him to suck on my machine gun , " seems to have undergone a change of heart .
Instead of death threats , now Nugent wants a job .
And not just any job .
He 's got the Cat Scratch Fever for no less than US Drug Czar .
RAW STORY apologizes for the level of absurdity portions of this story reach .
Something tells us that when Obama promised " change that we can believe in , " he could n't have possibly imagined this .
But Ted seems convinced .
" [ Drug traffickers ] are as evil an adversary as the voodoo terrorist Taliban our soldiers face in Afghanistan , " writes Nugent in a Thursday editorial .
An avid hunter , Nugent has been politically active as an opponent of gun control laws and he is a board member of the National Rifle Association .
He has considered trying to take his political activism all the way to the Governor 's Mansion in his native Michigan .
" That would be beautiful , " Nugent said when asked by Reuters if he would run for governor in 2010 .
" I have threatened to do so and I was sincere . "
In today 's America , even with the Terminator serving as Governor of California , a conspiratorial wrestler as the former Governor of Minnesota , a variety show comedian likely to take a seat in the US Senate , and swirling reports that the President - elect is offering the job of Surgeon General to a television doctor ...
Well , perhaps Nugent 's plea should n't come as a surprise .
Although , unlike his unexpectedly viable counterparts , Nugent once , reportedly , urinated on a nun .
Despite the context , his appeal is easily , and hopefully , construed by most as rhetorical .
" Call me , President Obama , " writes Nugent .
" Hippies , dope heads , corrupt politicos and various other human debris hate me , which makes me the perfect man for the job . "
Then again , perhaps Nugent has a leg - up on the competition .
He certainly sounds like a US Drug Czar .
It was only 1937 when Harry J. Anslinger , father of America 's drug war and the government 's first drug czar , testified to the Senate : " the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races . "
Nugent 's take is ... A bit modernized .
" Our inner cities will remain war zones until we commit to taking the trash out , " he writes at the polemic 's most cringe - inducing line .
" [ A ]s America 's Drug Czar , I would put a big hurt on the drug kingpins and consumers like they have never seen , " he concludes .
" Every American who smokes dope , manufactures , buys or sells meth or uses any illegal drugs is aiding and abetting the enemies of America .
Case closed .
This spiritual inbreeding and cannibalism must be identified , admitted to and stopped immediately .
America can , and must do this . "
For Nugent to ask Obama for this position in particular is humorous on its face , especially considering what he once told High Times magazine about how he escaped the Vietnam draft .
" I got 30 days ' notice of the physical , " Nugent reportedly said .
" I ceased cleansing my body .
Two weeks before the test I stopped eating food with nutritional value .
A week before , I stopped going to the bathroom .
I did it in my pants .
My pants got crusted up . "
High Times also reported he told military health officials that he'd been smoking enough meth to get " this big juicy 4F . "
When confronted by The Independent on these quotes , Nugent denied their veracity and instead claimed he had simply fabricated his responses to High Times because the interviewers came in with " glazed eyes . "
He also denies ever urinating on a nun , but notes to Texas Monthly , " believe me , had I the opportunity , I probably would have " and , " many of them deserved it ! "
Your move , President - elect Obama .
Senate Bill 320 ( document ) , prefiled in the Oklahoma Senate and scheduled for a first reading on February 2 , 2009 , is apparently the first antievolution bill of 2009 .
Entitled the " Scientific Education and Academic Freedom Act , " SB 320 would , if enacted , require state and local educational authorities to " assist teachers to find more effective ways to present the science curriculum where it addresses scientific controversies " and permit teachers to " help students understand , analyze , critique , and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories pertinent to the course being taught . "
The only topics specifically mentioned as controversial are " biological evolution , the chemical origins of life , global warming , and human cloning . "
Unsurprisingly , SB 320 is a further instance of the " academic freedom " strategy for undermining the teaching of evolution ; as NCSE 's Glenn Branch and Eugenie C. Scott recently wrote in their article " The Latest Face of Creationism , " published in the January 2009 issue of Scientific American , " ' Academic freedom ' was the creationist catchphrase of choice in 2008 : the Louisiana Science Education
Act was in fact born as the Louisiana Academic Freedom Act , and bills invoking the idea were introduced in Alabama , Florida , Michigan , Missouri and South Carolina ... "
Of these , only the Louisiana bill was passed and enacted , over protests from the scientific , educational , and civil liberties communities .
The sponsor of the Oklahoma bill is Randy Brogdon ( R - District 34 ) , who was a cosponsor in 2006 of House Concurrent Resolution 1034 .
If enacted , HCR 1034 would have encouraged " the State Board of Education and local boards of education to revise the recommended academic curriculum content standards in science to ensure that , upon graduation , all students can accomplish the following : 1 . Use of [ sic ] the scientific method to critically evaluate scientific theories including , but not limited to , the theory of evolution ; and 2 .
Use relevant scientific data to assess the validity of those theories and to formulate arguments for and against those theories . "
HCR 1034 died in committee in May 2006 .
Oklahomans concerned about SB 320 are encouraged to get in touch with Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education , a non-profit educational organization that promotes the education of the public about the methods and values of science and advocates excellence in the science curriculum .
As OESE explains on its website , " The formation of OESE was prompted by the attempts in the Oklahoma State Textbook Committee in 1999 to diminish the teaching of evolution by the introduction of creationist textbook disclaimers to be inserted into any textbook used in public schools that discussed evolution .
There have been bills introduced almost every year since 1999 for legislation that would allow teaching creationism in science courses ; OESE has opposed all such attempts . "
Travel scams run the gamut from elaborate and well - orchestrated ( think Agra food poisoning ) to simple ( giving incorrect change back ) .
Here ’s a few I ’d like to avoid :
There ’s poo on your shoe !
Some travelers say that this is a rite of passage in India , especially in big cities like Delhi and Mumbai .
I think , however , that I can get to know the country quite well without fecal matter on my feet .
Here ’s how this one works : the bleary - eyed traveler is walking around a busy , crowded area .
Scam Artist # 1 ( hmmm , maybe we should call him Scam Artist # 2 ) squirts some poo on your shoe .
Scam Artist # 2 points it out to you .
“ Sir !
There ’s poo on your shoe ! ”
Coincidentally , Scam Artist # 2 happens to be equipped with everything needed to clean the poo off your shoe… for a price .
This begs two questions for us .
First , what can you do ?
Not a thing , really .
Chalk it up to bad luck , you ’ve just been had .
Chances are you wo n’t pay much for your impromptu shoe cleaning , so try to have a sense of humor about it ( you have to admit , it is a pretty good trick ) .
The second question is : how did they get the poo into a tube to begin with ?
We ’re not sure we want the answer to that one .
Those samosas cost how much ?!
This has to be one of the more outrageous Indian travel scams I ’ve heard , in part because of how nervy and blatant it is : a Dutch couple visiting India were recently charged 10,000 rupees — the equivalent of over 200 dollars — for four samosas , the deep - fried pastry - stuffed - with - potato .
That ’s right , as in the snack .
What shocks us is that the Dutch couple actually coughed up the dough .
( Read the full BBC story about the incident ) .
That reminds me of another food - related scam that can leave your pockets slim : the Taj Mahal ( Agra ) food poisoning scam .
This one is a few years past , but you never know if and when it will resurface .
In fact , when I was in India in the summer of 2007 , several Indian friends cautioned my travel mates and me not to stay overnight in Agra and advised us to avoid the food and water there .
So , what was the scam ?
Allegedly , restaurants were serving unwitting tourists bad food .
OK , you can get food poisoning anywhere in the world , but it did n’t stop there .
In Agra , the restaurants were in cahoots with local doctors who then charged the sick tourists exorbitant fees for necessary medical treatment .
The doctors then gave a commission to the restaurant .
Yikes .
Have you ever been scammed while traveling ?
Have you ever been a victim of the poo on the shoe scam ?

Abstract : A circular program creates a data structure whose computation depends upon itself or refers to itself .
The technique is used to implement the classic data structures circular and doubly - linked lists , threaded trees and queues , in a functional programming language .
These structures are normally thought to require updatable variables found in imperative languages .
For example , a functional program to perform the breadth - first traversal of a tree is given .
Some of the examples result in circular data structures when evaluated .
Some examples are particularly space - efficient by avoiding the creation of intermediate temporary structures which would otherwise later become garbage .
Lastly , the technique can be applied in an imperative language to give an elegant program .
Keywords : circular program , functional programming , lazy evaluation , call by need , recursion .
Introduction .
Bird1 describes the use of circular programs and applies the technique to transform a program making multiple passes over a data structure into another program making only 1 pass .
He attributes knowledge of the technique to Hughes and to Wadler .
Bird 's examples are specialized and given in a program - transformation setting .
The purpose of this paper is firstly to show that circular programs are more widely applicable as a programming technique .
Under suitable circumstances , circular programs can be used to program circular and doubly linked lists , threaded trees and queues2 .
These classic data structures are normally thought to require updatable variables .
Secondly , a circular program can be more space - efficient than a conventional program by avoiding the creation of temporary data structure which need to be garbage collected later .
Examples include removing duplicates from a list and variations on the sieve of Eratosthenese .
Lastly , a circular program can often be translated into an imperative language , if that is necessary , giving an elegant and efficient program .
A circular program involves a recursive or self - referential expression for a data structure .
let rec ds = f( ds ) in ds Note that ds is a data structure and not a function .
To write a circular program in a functional language requires a lazy language3, 4 .
The evaluation of the data - structure refers to the data - structure itself ; this plainly rules out a strict language .
The evaluation must not use any part or attribute of the structure before it has been , or can be , computed as this would call for prescience .
Many applications involve specifying a structure before its contents are known and this is a forte of lazy languages .
There appears to be no universally accepted and precise definition of lazy evaluation .
The bare minimum for the programs in this paper to run correctly is a call by name mechanism for binding the right - hand sides of local definitions and for passing parameters .
This would however be enormously inefficient and result in duplicate evaluation of many expressions and void the point of the exercise .
The minimum requirement to gain the full advantages of circular programs is a graph reduction mechanism using call by need for the right hand side of local definitions , for parameter passing and in particular for the parameters of type constructors such as cons or `. ' for lists .
Under call by need , an object is bound to a recipe5 which will produce the desired value if and when it is needed .
If the value is needed then the recipe is forced or evaluated and the recipe is also overwritten so that the value is immediately available thereafter .
A value may contain sub-recipes and these are not forced until necessary .
If a value contains a recursive reference to itself , this is implemented as a pointer to the top of the value - hence graph reduction .
All of this is invisible to the programmer .
Lazy evaluation is taken to mean such a system throughout this paper .
In the scheme above , ds is bound initially to a recipe for f( ds ) .
As parts of ds are used in other computations the recipe is progressively evaluated .
When f finally makes reference to ds all is well if the required parts and attributes have been computed .
If f( ds ) simply incorporates ds itself in its value , ds must already have been forced to avoid non-termination .
In this case a pointer to the " top " of the data structure is incorporated and a circular data structure results in the underlying implementation of the language .
There is then a path from the top of the data structure only through type constructors , or unevaluated functors in logic - programming terms , back to the top of the structure .
This can be very efficient as some infinite values can be represented in finite space !
In other examples f uses ds in some other way and no circular data structure is created .
The programs given here do not require the even more parsimonious evaluation rule called full laziness ( although it does no harm ) which guarantees that no expression at all is evaluated twice .
As an example6 consider : let f x y = sqrt x+y in let g = f 4 in g 1 + g 2 the expression sqrt x = sqrt 4 = 2 is evaluated twice .
In a fully lazy system an optimization equivalent to the following is made : let f x = let sqrtx = sqrt x in lambda y. sqrtx+y in let g = f 4 -- = lambda y.2+y in g 1 + g 2 and sqrt x is only evaluated once .
A final requirement for writing any functional program is that the data structure , ds , be of the single assignment type .
That is , values are not changed once they are known .
Many uses of data structures do have this property .
Sometimes the fact is disguised in an imperative coding in that a value may be tagged , set to nil or otherwise marked until the proper value is known .
In the following sections various examples are given of circular programs in a functional language .
The use of the technique in imperative languages is then discussed .
Functional Examples .
Various applications of circular programs follow .
A simple functional language is used in which local definitions are included by `let in ' or by `where ' .
Recursive definitions are qualified by `rec ' .
Lists are frequently used and the empty list is denoted by nil or by ` [ ] ' and the list constructor ( cons ) by ` .'.
The convention of writing a self - referential structure in bold characters is adopted simply to catch the eye .
Circular Lists .
The simplest circular program of all creates the apparently infinite list [ 1 , 1 , ... ]. let rec ones = 1.ones in ones
This is easily evaluated in a lazy language and the implementation creates a circular list containing one cell that points to itself .
Initially ones is bound to a recipe for 1.ones .
Assuming that this is evaluated , a list cell is created which contains recipes for 1 and for ones .
If the latter is evaluated , it is also overwritten - with the value of ones which is a pointer to the list cell .
This creates the following graph : ones :------------> .
<----- / | ^ / | | / --->--| 1
A program scheme for creating many , although by no means all , circular lists generalizes ones : let circ x = c where rec c = build x -- c self - referential and build y = f(y ) .
( if p y then c else build ( g y ) ) p is some predicate and f and g are arbitrary functions .
Note that c is a data structure and build is a function .
The result is a list , c which is equal to the result of appending [ f ( x ) , f ( g( x ) ) , f( g2 ( x ) ) , ... , f ( gn( x ) ) ] and c where n>=0 and p ( gn( x ) ) is true .
The final c is implemented as a pointer back to the start of the list .
It is possible to eliminate c by substituting it in build to get the following program : let uncirc x = build x where rec build y = f(y ) .
( if p y then build x else build ( g y ) )
This produces the correct value but it is no longer implemented as a circular structure ; the data structure is unfolded : [ f ( x ) , ... , f ( gn ( x ) ) , f( x ) , ... , f ( gn( x ) ) , f( x ) , ... ] .
This is an equivalent , although much more wasteful , way of representing the value .
Note that a system using string reduction rather than graph reduction is liable to produce this data structure for program circ .
Hughes7 describes a mechanism called lazy memo functions which would build the circular data structure for the program uncirc by remembering and reusing function results for past inputs - such as build x. Doubly Linked Lists .
A doubly linked list can be defined in a manner similar to a circular list .
A doubly linked list is either nil or contains three things - a pointer to a predecessor , an element and a pointer to a successor node .
datatype dbl_list = nil | dbl of dbl_list × elt_type × dbl_list let double x = build [ ] x where rec build prev y = if p y then [ ] else d where rec d = dbl ( prev , f y , build d ( g y ) )
If p y is immediately true build returns nil otherwise it creates a node d .
The node points to its predecessor prev .
It also points to the successor created by a recursive call of build .
The predecessor of this next node is d.
D is local to build because the predecessor of a node was created by the preceding call to build .
On the other hand , c is global to the routine for circular lists because the start point remains the same through the recursive calls .
In an imperative language a doubly - linked list would be created one node at a time .
The successor pointer of a node would be set to nil or left undefined until the successor was created .
The pointer would then be overwritten .
In the circular program above , a node is created although part of it ( the successor pointer ) is unevaluated .
The node can still be passed as a parameter so that a pointer to it can be included as the predecessor of the succeeding node .
Given a lazy language , any amount of scanning the doubly linked list backwards and forwards causes no extra copies of the list to be created .
D is directly recursive and can only be removed first by using a fixed - point operator and then by substituting in build but then , as in the previous example , no circular data structure is created .
Threaded Trees .
A node of a binary tree contains an element and pointers to the left and right subtrees .
Most of the tree consists of leaves and most of the pointers are empty .
A threaded tree8 uses those right pointers that would be empty to point to successor nodes in infix order .
The threads allow the elements in the tree to be processed sequentially by an iterative or linear - recursive routine .
datatype threaded_tree = empty | thrd of threaded_tree | fork of threaded_tree × elt_type × threaded_tree
Such a tree may be created in an imperative language by overwriting empty pointers when the threads were known .
Provided that all the elements to be placed in the tree are given at one time , a circular program can be written to create a threaded tree .
( In this example the tree is also a binary search tree without duplicates . ) let thread L = build true empty L where rec build isleft succ L = if null L then if isleft then empty else thrd ( succ ) else t where rec t = fork ( build true t ( filter (< hd L ) L ) , hd L , build false succ ( filter (> hd L ) L ) )
The input elements are in the list L. Filter is a common function to select elements from a list according to a predicate or test : let rec filter p l = if null l then [ ] else let h=hd l and rest = filter ( tl l ) in if p h then h.rest else rest
If L is not null , a node t is built .
T contains a left subtree and either a right subtree or a thread .
The successor thread for the left subtree is t itself .
The successor thread for the right subtree is the successor of t .
This example uses only right threads but left or predecessor threads are easily added .
The requirement that all elements be given in a list L is to ensure that the tree does not need to be updated when new elements arrive .
Breadth - First Traversal .
The next example and following ones use expressions which are recursive or circular but whose values , the result of evaluation , are not and thus no circular data structures are created .
Prefix , infix and postfix traversals of a tree are easily programmed in a functional language but breadth - first traversal is harder .
The usual imperative algorithm employs a queue and seems to need destructive assignment .
An element is taken from the front of the queue for traversal and its children are added to the end of the queue .
This appears to imply that either the queue must be updated or that new copies of a modified queue must be created at each step .
A circular program can be written however in which elements are removed from the front of the queue as the end is still being computed : datatype tree = empty | fork of tree × elt_type × tree let bfirst t = r -- bfirst : tree -> list where rec r = case t of empty => [ ] | fork ( left , elt , right ) => t.( bf r 1 ) where rec bf q n = -- bf : list -> int -> list if n=0 then [ ] -- q is used up else let root = hd q and rest = bf ( tl q ) in case root of fork ( empty , e , empty ) => rest ( n - 1 ) | fork ( left , e, empty ) => left .( rest n ) | fork ( empty , e , right ) => right .( rest n ) | fork ( left , e , right ) => left .( right . ( rest ( n+1 ) ) )
Bfirst returns a list or queue of the nodes of the tree t in breadth - first order .
If t is not empty , the first node is the root t itself ; at this point the queue has 1 known element .
Bf is the central function .
It absorbs a queue q whose known part is of length n while computing the result queue ; the two queues are in fact one .
N indicates the shape of that part of the structure r that can be used safely .
In an imperative language n would not be necessary and r might be temporarily terminated by nil but that can not be done in a functional language .
Bf places non-empty children in the result queue and adjusts its length accordingly ; each call to bf uses one element from q and adds 0 , 1 or 2 elements .
Rest is a function to build the result literally for the rest of the input queue after the current node .
Note that bfirst can traverse even infinite trees .
It uses one list cell for each node that is traversed .
Unique .
The previous examples illustrated the use of circular programs to implement classical data structures in functional programs .
The next example uses the technique to make a space - efficient program .
Consider the problem of writing a function unique .
It is to accept a list as parameter and to return a list with the same members but with duplicate members removed and the order of first occurrence is to be maintained .
The problem is close to finding the union of two sets represented by lists .
It is easy to write such a function if the constraint on order is dropped : let rec uniqueL L = if null L then [ ] else if member ( hd L ) ( tl L ) then uniqueL ( tl L ) else ( hd L ) . ( uniqueL ( tl L ) ) uniqueL preserves the order of last occurrence so reverseouniqueLoreverse would solve the original problem .
It would also create garbage in the shape of two intermediate lists .
Another solution to the problem that is not quite good enough is let rec uniqueF L = if null L then [ ] else ( hd L ) . ( uniqueF ( filter ( != hd L ) L ) )
UniqueF certainly preserves the order of first occurrence but each call of filter creates a temporary list .
UniqueF creates O ( |L| ) such lists and uses O ( |L|2 ) space .
An imperative programmer might arrive at the following informal description of a solution .
Unique should create a list r.
It should examine the input L , element by element .
If the current element of L is in r it should not be added again .
If it is not in r it should be added to r .
There is no need to use an imperative language to implement this algorithm .
A circular program can use the list r while creating it at the same time : let unique L = r where rec r = u L 0 and u L n = if null L then [ ] else if member ( hd L ) r n then u ( tl L ) n else ( hd L ) .( u ( tl L ) ( n+1 ) ) and member e L n = if n=0 then false else if e=hd L then true else member e ( tl L ) ( n - 1 ) R is the self - referential data structure that function u both creates and uses at the same time .
Member is a variation on the conventional list membership function .
While the result r is being built its end is unknown ; it terminates in a recipe .
Member cannot therefore use null ( L ) to detect the current end point of the search list .
As in breadth - first traversal , an integer parameter n is added to keep track of the length of the known part of r ; it stops member from forcing the recipe and causing an infinite loop .
Note that the shape of a list is represented by a single integer but that the shape of a tree is more expensive to represent ; a circular program that computes a tree where the computation depends on the shape of the part already evaluated is unlikely to be so efficient .
Note that uniqueF and unique will operate on infinite lists but that only unique creates no intermediate lists and runs in space linear in the amount of output .
Primes .
The final functional examples of circular programs are variations on the sieve of Eratosthenese .
A typical non-circular coding , similar to one in Henderson 's book5 is let knot p x = not ( p x ) and mult m n = n mod m = 0 in let rec from n = n.( from ( n+1 ) ) and sieve L = ( hd L ) . ( sieve ( filter ( knot mult ( hd L ) ) L ) ) in sieve ( from 2 ) This program creates many intermediate lists - from 2 and various sublists containing fewer and fewer composites .
This is due to the many successive calls on filter each of which returns a list .
There are two main families of primes programs in imperative programming .
A sieve program finds successive primes and for each prime removes all multiples of it from the set of numbers .
A program of the other family maintains a set of primes .
There is a loop over new candidates and each candidate is tested for primality against members of the set .
It may then be added to the set .
The filtering of each candidate becomes the inner operation and it can be coded as follows : let rec multiple L n = if sqr ( hd L ) > n then false else if mult ( hd L ) n then true else multiple ( tl L ) n in let rec primes = 2. ( filter ( knot ( multiple primes ) ) ( from 3 ) ) in primes
In this circular program , the expression for primes is self - referential .
It starts with 2 and a sublist of from 3 follows .
All composite numbers are removed by one call to filter and so no intermediate lists are created .
The predicate `multiple primes ' tests if a number is composite by examining only primes already calculated .
When a new number is tested for primality , primes exceeding its square root are known and so it is not necessary to pass the number of known primes to multiple ( compare this with breadth - first and unique ) .
The central expression `knot ( multiple primes ) ' is precisely the predicate isprime .
This observation yields the alternative circular program : let rec primes = 2. ( filter isprime ( from 3 ) ) and isprime = knot ( multiple primes ) in primes primes and isprime form a mutually recursive data structure and function pair .
Alternatively , substituting primes in isprime gives : let rec isprime = knot ( multiple ( 2. ( filter isprime ( from 3 ) ) ) )
Substituting and moving between these three programs brings no disadvantage except perhaps for the loss of the ability to refer to both primes and isprime , because no circular data structure is created in any of the programs .
The behaviour of isprime is interesting because it runs faster the second time that it is called on a number of a given order of magnitude because the primes that it needs have already been calculated .
Imperative Languages .
On circular programs , Bird1 states `the Pascal programmer confronted with the same idea for optimization has to undertake a major revision of his or her program to achieve the same end ' .
It is certainly true that Bird 's transformations , and many others , are very hard to apply systematically in an imperative language because of side - effects but a circular program can often be written quite easily in such a language .
If using an imperative language is a condition of the job , a circular program might still be coded to give an elegant and efficient result .
A direct translation of unique , for example , into Pascal will not work because Pascal uses strict evaluation .
But function f(... ) :... ; begin ... f:=e ; ... end can be replaced by procedure f( ... var fresult :... ) ; begin ... ; fresult :=e ... end which is defined more often than the former .
If this is applied to unique , the result is : function unique ( L:list ) : list ; var r : list ; function member ( e: element ; L:list ; n:integer ) : boolean ; ... ; procedure u( L:list ; n:integer ; var uresult : list ) ; begin if L=nil then uresult : =nil else if member ( L^.hd , r , n ) then u( L^.tl , n , uresult ) else begin uresult : =cons ( L^.hd , nil ) ; (* nil - not a recipe *) u( L^.tl , n+1 , uresult^.tl ) end end ; begin r:=nil ; u( L , 0 , r ) ; unique : =r end Note that the list r is nil terminated so a more usual version of member can be adopted and parameter n of routines u and member can be dropped .
Needless to say the Pascal version will not run on infinite lists .
A similar transformation can be performed to give a Pascal version of the breadth - first traversal program and of the other programs .
The Pascal version of unique is simply doing what the implementation of a lazy language would do for a circular program .
It marks the current end of the result r as nil for unevaluated and this is overwritten when its value is known .
One of Bird 's examples is to transform a tree , into a tree of the same shape but replacing the leaf values by the minimum leaf value of the input tree .
His circular program builds a leaf with a minimum but unevaluated value while incorporating this leaf in a tree of the correct shape .
The leaf 's value is calculated during the same traversal that copies the tree 's shape .
A Pascal version is almost as simple .
It creates a node , traverses the input tree incorporating the node in a new tree and also searching for the minimum value .
When all is done this value is stored in the leaf .
Again this mimics the lazy implementation .
Conclusions .
A circular program uses a recursive expression for a data structure .
In cases where the evaluation of the expression incorporates the data structure directly , the result is a circular data structure .
Circular programs permit classic data structures such as circular and doubly - linked lists , threaded trees , and queues to be used in a functional programming language and brings some of the efficiency of imperative programming to functional programming .
Provided that the structures are subject to the single assignment rule , reference variables and assignment ( := ) are not needed .
Many times a circular program is more space - efficient than its conventional counterpart by avoiding the creation of intermediate structures .
A lazy functional language is needed to write a circular program .
Garbage collectors based purely on reference counts cannot collect circular structures but mark - scan collectors , copying collectors and hybrid schemes can9 .
Since the programs are space efficient , the collector should in any case be called infrequently .
In addition to the use of functional languages , a circular program can often be translated into an imperative language such as Pascal with only minor revision of ideas .

Indeed , city officials said that it was unclear , as of Thursday night , just how Mr. Bloomberg planned to generate the extra revenue in sales taxes :
Would he repeal the sales tax clothing exemption ?
And would he increase the sales tax permanently ?
Or would he do what has been done before , and increase a portion of it temporarily ?
The menu of budget options Mr. Bloomberg and his aides released in November called for a sales tax increase to 8.75 percent , generating almost $ 900 million .
If that approach is approved , this is how the increase would affect New Yorkers , according to a consumer spending analysis by the city ’s Independent Budget Office :
An individual who makes $ 35,000 a year would pay an extra $ 55 .
Someone making $ 125,000 would pay $ 140 more a year .
And someone making $ 500,000 a year would pay an additional $ 247 .
In addition to the sales tax increase , Mr. Bloomberg would eliminate the $ 400 property tax rebate , for an approximate savings of $ 250 million .
He also planned to renew his call for Albany to approve legislation that would charge customers a nickel for each new plastic bag they use at most stores .
So far that measure has not gained great traction with the public , despite supporters ’ claims that it is both environmentally friendly and good for the city ’s bottom line .
There may be other taxes or fees as well .
The tax increases are part of a broader package of tough - love measures that Mr. Bloomberg intends to outline on Friday .
He plans to slice another $ 1 billion in spending and will also unveil various proposals to overhaul the city ’s pension system , reduce capital spending and require city employees to contribute toward their health care .
That might be a tough sell with labor unions , but the mayor plans to warn that if unions do not cooperate , the work force could shrink by as much as 23,000 through attrition and layoffs .

If not himself , then he has naught

US rates slashed to nearly zero
The US Federal Reserve has slashed its key interest rate from 1 % to a range of between zero and 0.25 % as it battles the country 's recession .
In its statement , the Federal Reserve warned that " the outlook for economic activity has weakened further " .
It predicted that rates would stay at the current exceptionally low levels " for some time " .
It added that it was considering ways it could spend money on supporting the economy and credit markets .
Analysts said that the key rate is now virtually zero .
" Whether it 's zero or 0.25 % actually does not make a huge difference , " said Holger Schmieding at Bank of America .

He added that the more important factor is what policymakers plan to do now that they cannot cut interest rates any further .
The Federal Reserve is already injecting billions of dollars into the banking system as well as buying debt based on home loans .
Postpone purchases
The Federal Reserve stressed that it was already planning to buy large quantities of additional debt based on mortgages and is considering whether it would be a good idea to buy long - term US government bonds .
The strategy of a central bank buying government bonds mirrors the so - called quantitative easing carried out by the Japanese government when it was fighting deflation in the late 1990s and early 2000s .
Q&A : Fed rate cuts Deflation becomes more of a risk as interest rates approach zero .
It is a serious problem for an economy because people postpone making any large purchases as they believe prices are going to fall , which stifles economic activity even further .
Quantitative easing is , " just another word for the central bank injecting so much money into the system that a good deal of it is passed onto households and businesses at a reasonably low interest rate , " Mr Schmieding explained .
The rate has been cut drastically by the Federal Reserve from the 5.25 % where it stood in September 2007 .
Market response
It is the lowest the central bank 's key rate - the target rate for banks to charge to lend to each other overnight - has been since records began in 1954 .
The decision received a lukewarm initial reception from the stock market , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising from 8,684 just before the decision to 8,740 about half an hour after it , which is a rise of just 56 points .
But once the news had been digested , the Dow Jones closed up 360.4 points , or 4.2 % at 8,924.9 .
" You 've seen the dollar weaken because it was a larger than expected cut - the dollar is falling against all major currencies , " said Matt Esteve at Tempus Consulting in Washington .
" On one side , we effectively have a zero interest rate in the US - on the other side , the Fed has sent a sign that they are ready to use all tools to help the US economy out of recession . "
Earlier in the day , official data confirmed that the threat of inflation is receding , as consumer prices fell a record 1.7 % in November .
Government help President - elect Barack Obama said in a speech on Tuesday that his administration would also be doing its bit to stimulate the economy because the central bank could no longer use its main tool .
" We are running out of the traditional ammunition that is used in a recession , which is to lower interest rates , " he said .
" That 's why the economic recovery plan is so absolutely critical . "
He has undertaken to create at least 2.5 million jobs by 2011 as well as launching a programme of improvements to the country 's infrastructure .

Why OO Sucks by Joe Armstrong
( Note : This is a copy of the original that used to live at http://www.bluetail.com/~joe/vol1/v1_oo.html)
When I was first introduced to the idea of OOP I was skeptical but did n’t know why - it just felt “ wrong ” .
After its introduction OOP became very popular ( I will explain why later ) and criticising OOP was rather like “ swearing in church ” .
OOness became something that every respectable language just had to have .
As Erlang became popular we were often asked “ Is Erlang OO ” - well , of course the true answer was “ No of course not ” - but we did n’t to say this out loud - so we invented a serious of ingenious ways of answering the question that were designed to give the impression that Erlang was ( sort of ) OO ( If you waved your hands a lot ) but not really ( If you listened to what we actually said , and read the small print carefully ) .
At this point I am reminded of the keynote speech of the then boss of IBM in France who addressed the audience at the 7th IEEE Logic programming conference in Paris .
IBM prolog had added a lot of OO extensions , when asked why he replied :
“ Our customers wanted OO prolog so we made OO prolog ”
I remember thinking “ how simple , no qualms of conscience , no soul - searching , no asking " Is this the right thing to do ” …
Why OO sucks
My principle objection to OOP goes back to the basic ideas involved , I will outline some of these ideas and my objections to them .
Objection 1 - Data structure and functions should not be bound together
Objects bind functions and data structures together in indivisible units .
I think this is a fundamental error since functions and data structures belong in totally different worlds .
Why is this ?
* Functions do things .
They have inputs and outputs .
The inputs and outputs are data structures , which get changed by the functions .
In most languages functions are built from sequences of imperatives : “ Do this and then that … ” to understand functions you have to understand the order in which things get done ( In lazy FPLs and logical languages this restriction is relaxed ) .
Data structures just are .
They do n’t do anything .
They are intrinsically declarative .
“ Understanding ” a data structure is a lot easier than “ understanding ” a function .
Functions are understood as black boxes that transform inputs to outputs .
If I understand the input and the output then I have understood the function .
This does not mean to say that I could have written the function .
Functions are usually “ understood ” by observing that they are the things in a computational system whose job is to transfer data structures of type T1 into data structure of type T2 .
Since functions and data structures are completely different types of animal it is fundamentally incorrect to lock them up in the same cage .
Objection 2 - Everything has to be an object
Consider “ time ” .
In an OO language “ time ” has to be an object .
But in a non OO language a “ time ” is a instance of a data type .
For example , in Erlang there are lots of different varieties of time , these can be clearly and unambiguously specified using type declarations , as follows :
- deftype day ( ) = 1..31 . - deftype month ( ) = 1..12 . - deftype year ( ) = int ( ) . - deftype hour ( ) = 1..24 . - deftype minute ( ) = 1..60 . - deftype second ( ) = 1..60 . - deftype abstime ( ) = {abstime , year ( ) , month ( ) , day ( ) , hour ( ) , min ( ) , sec ( ) }. - deftype hms ( ) = {hms , hour ( ) , min ( ) , sec ( ) }. ...
Note that these definitions do not belong to any particular object .
they are ubiquitous and data structures representing times can be manipulated by any function in the system .
There are no associated methods .
Objection 3 - In an OOPL data type definitions are spread out all over the place
In an OOPL data type definitions belong to objects .
So I ca n’t find all the data type definition in one place .
In Erlang or C I can define all my data types in a single include file or data dictionary .
In an OOPL I ca n’t - the data type definitions are spread out all over the place .
Let me give an example of this .
Suppose I want to define a ubiquitous data structure .
ubiquitous data type is a data type that occurs “ all over the place ” in a system .
As lisp programmers have know for a long time it is better to have a smallish number of ubiquitous data types and a large number of small functions that work on them , than to have a large number of data types and a small number of functions that work on them .
A ubiquitous data structure is something like a linked list , or an array or a hash table or a more advanced object like a time or date or filename .
In an OOPL I have to choose some base object in which I will define the ubiquitous data structure , all other objects that want to use this data structure must inherit this object .
Suppose now I want to create some “ time ” object , where does this belong and in which object …
Objection 4 - Objects have private state
State is the root of all evil .
In particular functions with side effects should be avoided .
While state in programming languages is undesirable , in the real world state abounds .
I am highly interested in the state of my bank account , and when I deposit or withdraw money from my bank I expect the state of my bank account to be correctly updated .
Given that state exists in the real world what facilities should programming language provide for dealing with state ?
OOPLs say “ hide the state from the programmer ” .
The states is hidden and visible only through access functions .
Conventional programming languages ( C , Pascal ) say that the visibility of state variables is controlled by the scope rules of the language .
Pure declarative languages say that there is no state .
The global state of the system is carried into all functions and comes out from all functions .
Mechanisms like monads ( for FPLs ) and DCGs ( logic languages ) are used to hide state from the programmer so they can program “ as if state did n’t matter ” but have full access to the state of the system should this be necessary .
The “ hide the state from the programmer ” option chosen by OOPLs is the worse possible choice .
Instead of revealing the state and trying to find ways to minimise the nuisance of state , they hide it away .
Why OO was popular ?
Reason 1 - It was thought to be easy to learn .
Reason 2 - It was thought to make code reuse easier .
Reason 3 - It was hyped .
Reason 4 - It created a new software industry .
I see no evidence of 1 and 2 .
Reasons 3 and 4 seem to be the driving force behind the technology .
If a language technology is so bad that it creates a new industry to solve problems of its own making then it must be a good idea for the guys who want to make money .
This is is the real driving force behind OOPs .
The economic crisis , a highly contentious trade issue , and energy will dominate the agenda as Barack Obama makes his first foreign visit as president , meeting with Canada 's prime minister in a whirlwind tour Thursday .
President Obama hinted Tuesday that he hopes to find continued military support from Stephen Harper in Afghanistan beyond 2011 .
But if his conciliatory tenor – evident in a television interview aired in Canada in advance of the meeting – is any indication , the president appears to be using his maiden foreign visit to send a broader diplomatic signal : America wants to rebuild its alliances .
At the very least , the meeting with Canada 's prime minister is expected to set the tone for relations for years to come .
And although the Canadian leader 's ideological views are more closely attuned to Obama 's predecessor , George W. Bush , the shared economic problems of both nations are likely to bridge partisan divides , analysts say .
" They 're in the same boat , facing the realities of the world situation , so they will certainly be working together , " says Colin Robertson , an expert in Canada - US trade relations .
" The focus here for Obama – as it has been at home – is jobs .
It 's an integrated economy .
We do n't just trade things anymore .
We make things together , so the emphasis is going to be on how we make things better together . "
World 's largest trading partnership
The survival of the Big Three automakers for example , who asked the US federal government for an additional $ 14 billion in bailout money this week , is just as important to Canada because the companies all operate major plants in Ontario , the country 's manufacturing heartland .
General Motors recently announced plans to cut 47,000 jobs globally , but the company 's 11,000 workers in Canada appear to have been spared the axe .
The two countries are not only old friends , they 're also business partners , with bilateral trade topping $ 500 billion yearly .
" It 's the largest trading relationship in the world , " says Denis McDonough , US deputy national security adviser .
The president 's stopover , scheduled to last six hours , will include a working lunch and a joint press conference by the two leaders , as well as a meeting between the president and Michael Ignatieff , a former Harvard University professor and the new leader of Canada 's main opposition party .
President Obama 's delegation , which includes top advisers for security , the economy , and energy , reflects the journey 's emphasis .
Although the two leaders are likely to find common ground on many economic issues , the controversial " Buy American " clause attached to the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan signed into law by the president Tuesday has been playing badly in Canada .
In recent weeks , Prime Minister Harper has said he wants to ensure that it does not lead to protectionist measures that would squeeze Canadian steel and iron manufacturers .
In the wake of intense lobbying , lawmakers in the US added the caveat that the provision could not violate international trade agreements , including WTO and NAFTA pacts .
President Obama tried to allay fears , saying Canadians " should n't be too concerned " about the " Buy American " clause .
" Canada is one of our most important trading partners , we rely on them heavily ... it is not in anybody 's interest to see that trade diminish , " the president told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , both environmentalists and oil industry executives will be listening closely to the outcome of any discussions over energy .
Dispute looming over oil sands ?
Environmentalists have been heavily critical of Harper 's environmental record , particularly the widespread extraction of oil - rich sands in Alberta , and have recently been running ads in US newspapers , urging the Obama administration to " say no to dirty oil . "
The industry is concerned that the president 's aggressive green - energy plans and initiatives to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions will make their operations too costly .
Harper has long touted Canada as an emerging energy superpower and has proposed a joint Canada - US climate regime as one way of blunting possible punitive regulatory measures from the United States .
Some political watchers believe energy issues may well be a flash point between the two leaders .
" It 's a crucial economic issue and I do n't think Canada has any reason to be confident on the successful outcome of this issue , '' says Prof .
Paul Quirk , who specializes in US politics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver .
" The US administration is likely to be quite avid in its concern for reducing the causes of climate change . "
No push likely for more troops
And on the same day the president committed an additional 17,000 American troops to Afghanistan , Obama told the CBC that problems there can't be solved by military means alone .
He said that the situation would also require diplomacy and development of a comprehensive strategy he hopes " that ultimately the people of Canada can support . "
Obama said he will be asking America 's allies to '' think through " their approach to Afghanistan .
Still , he fell short of asking Canada to reconsider its plan to pull its troops out at the end of 2011 .
Since the 1920s , about half the first foreign trips of US presidents have been to Canada .
The personal relationship between North America 's two top leaders has varied over time .
Ronald Reagan and Brian Mulroney famously celebrated their common heritage , most notably by taking to the stage and singing " When Irish Eyes are Smiling . "
However , there was no love lost between Richard Nixon and Pierre Elliott Trudeau .
In a well - publicized incident , Mr. Nixon used an expletive to describe Mr. Trudeau after a meeting in the Oval Office , prompting Trudeau to respond : " I 've been called worse things by better people . "
The plutocrats of palm oil are in trouble .
The makers of Wall 's ice cream and Dove soap and Flora margarine are worried you 'll get the idea that these products are being produced at the expense of the rainforests of southeast Asia .
Because they are .
And , so far , efforts to rebrand palm - oil plantations as oases of sustainability have proved about as convincing as those old ads that insisted you could n't tell the difference between butter and margarine .
In late November , the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) will hold its sixth annual meeting in on the Indonesian island of Bali .
Food manufacturers , commodity traders and plantation owners will applaud the " first trickle " of palm oil certified as wildlife and climate - friendly and definitely not grown on recently deforested land .
Sadly , this will underline how , after six years of trying to identify sustainable sources of palm oil , the RSPO has to admit that 99 % of the ubiquitous edible oil – found in a third of all the products on supermarket shelves – cannot be shown to have been produced sustainability .
In the chair in Bali will be Unilever 's director of sustainable agriculture , Jan Kees Vis .
The Anglo - Dutch conglomerate Unilever ( purveyors of the Wall's , Dove and Flora brands ) began life as Lever Brothers , obliterating the forests of west Africa a century ago to create palm oil plantations .
Today , it buys more than a million tonnes of the oil annually from deforested Malaysia and Indonesia .
The world is getting in a fuss about growing palm oil for biofuels .
But the vast majority of the crop – more than 80 % of which comes from these two countries – goes into foodstuffs and soap products .
Rainforests are being burned and felled across the islands of Borneo and Sumatra to create new land for palm - oil plantations .
Fearing a backlash from consumers , Unilever was one of the founders of Roundtable .
But six years on , that body is being dismissed as a front for continuation of business as usual in the jungle clearings .
Earlier this year , about 200 environment and human rights groups signed an " international declaration against the greenwashing of palm oil by the RSPO " .
And one of Unilever 's leading suppliers has been singled out .
The Singapore - based Wilmar International has a huge land bank across Indonesia waiting to be cleared and planted with palm oil .
Wilmar was recently forced to concede defeat in a long dispute with Friends of the Earth over whether it was linked to illegal land clearing for palm oil .
Unilever insists that it is sincere .
Some other food manufacturers are seeking alternatives to palm oil .
But Unilever promises instead that by 2015 all its palm oil will come from sustainable plantations .
Leading retailers such as Sainsbury 's make similar promises .
Last November , Sainsbury 's announced that it was " switching to sustainable palm oil " in its own - brand food .
Critics say such promises are pie in the sky .
At Sainsbury 's , a year after that bold promise , just one brand of fish fingers has switched .
Progress seems bound to be slow while most of the producers of palm oil remain in denial about their problems .
The Malaysian Palm Oil Council is haughtily dismissive of any suggestion that the methods of its members may be less than perfect – claiming that they only plant on land zoned for agriculture .
But that provides little comfort for conservationists .
Particularly in Sarawak , the Malaysian province on Borneo , large amounts of forest land is zoned for agriculture , and the state is aggressively promoting conversion .
Researchers say active deforestation is still creating space for palm oil .
Nonetheless , the Malaysian council 's boss , Yusof Basiron , tells anyone who will listen that the RSPO , of which the council is a prominent member , is merely a promotional tool .
Its system of certification is a " condition imposed by certain markets to certify practices that Malaysian planters have been undertaking for years . "
Such statements appear to breach the RSPO 's own rules which forbid " claiming conformity to RSPO principles and criteria " without formal certification .
Can the likes of Unilever and Sainsbury 's get all their palm oil from " sustainable sources " by 2015 as they promise ?
In one sense , maybe .
Cynics point out that rainforest scientists expect both Borneo and Sumatra to be virtually treeless by then .
There will be no more to chop down , so palm oil plantations will no longer be accused for deforestation .
But meanwhile , the patina of sustainability being wrapped round our biscuits and soap and ice cream and margarine and cosmetics and much else is helping fuel their final destruction .
RACINE , Wisconsin ( Reuters ) - Republican
White House hopeful John McCain ’s campaign accused Democrat Barack Obama on Thursday of playing racial politics in some of the most biting back - and - forth of the presidential campaign .
The negative twist in the campaign for the November 4 election was prompted by a McCain television advertisement on Wednesday that called Obama a celebrity akin to star - crossed U.S. personalities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
In response , Obama said McCain was trying to scare voters away from him by pointing out he has “ a funny name , and he does n’t look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills . ”
Obama , whose father was Kenyan , would be the first black U.S. president .
Only white men , most of them former presidents , are on U.S. paper currency .
“ Barack Obama has played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck .
It ’s divisive , negative , shameful and wrong , ” McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said in a written statement .
Obama fired back during a town hall meeting in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , saying the attacks did not help voters deal with the array of problems they face .
“ You ’d think we ’d be having a serious debate but so far all we ’ve been hearing about is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
I do have to ask my opponent :
Is that the best you can come up with ? ” Obama said .
He said McCain had pledged to run an honorable campaign but had fallen back into “ these negative ads , these negative attacks . ”
But McCain said “ we ’re proud of that commercial ” in speaking to a friendly audience at a town hall meeting in the battleground state of Wisconsin .

“ I admire his campaign , but what we are talking about here is substance and not style .
And what we ’re talking about is who has an agenda for the future of America .
Campaigns are tough , but I am proud of the campaign that we have run , ” McCain said .
UNDERDOG
The McCain campaign is trying to shake up a race that currently favors Obama at a time when the U.S. economy is weak , the U.S. military is stretched fighting two wars , and the annual budget deficit is approaching a half trillion dollars .
The McCain campaign believes the 71 - year - old Arizona senator is the underdog but that the race is close and is trying to paint Obama as an inexperienced lightweight .
McCain went through a point - by - point litany of questions about Obama ’s positions on taxes , energy and the Iraq war .
Noting Obama ’s opposition to offshore oil drilling , he said his Democratic rival had urged Americans to make sure their tires were properly inflated as a way to increase gas mileage .
“ Yesterday , he suggested that we put air in our tires to save on gas .
My friends , let ’s do that .
But do you think that ’s enough to break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil ?
I do n’t think so , ” he said to chuckles from the crowd in this Milwaukee suburb .
The “ celebrity ” television ad showed spliced images of Spears and Hilton with video of Obama addressing 200,000 Germans in Berlin last week .
The McCain side defended the ad , which generated much publicity , and said the Obama camp was over - reacting .
“ It celebrates the excitement that he has generated , that is certainly more akin to the excitement that a celebrity generates than a normal politician , ” McCain senior adviser Nicolle Wallace said on MSNBC .
But Obama adviser Robert Gibbs said on NBC’s “ Today ” show that McCain is “ running an increasingly dishonorable campaign . ”
“ The McCain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative .
We believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years , ” he said .
Both candidates vying to succeed President George W. Bush have said in the past they planned to run campaigns that would stay away from negative attacks and mud-slinging that have marked some presidential contests in recent years .
Home ownership policy of the Bush and Clinton administrations was , in
essence , an attempt to pay low - income people to make a risky investment
that they would otherwise rationally avoid .
I cannot understand why
anyone would think that such a policy would be sensible .
In some cases ,
these people will do well and enjoy the upside of their investment , but
in other cases they will do poorly , with the result that they will be
worse off than ever .
That 's Eric Posner .
You 'll note that Henry Paulson has been calling for the mortgage agencies to be resurrected as " public utilities " of some sort .
I do n't understand this path .
There is a very good ( modern ) liberal case against more home ownership : behavioral economics is true , people overestimate their prospects , poor people should n't take too much risk , and the natural market tendency is too much home ownership , not too little .
That 's without taking environmental issues into account .
Here is a recent Richmond Fed article , skeptical of the idea of homeownership subsidies .

A report on Canada 's freedom - of - information laws says Canadian police force continue withhold key information from the public about how officers are using tasers .
In Regina , Saskatoon and Saint John , the police , In Winnipeg , the police agreed to release the information but were charging $ 4,500 to do so .
While in Hamilton , police asserted that Ontario law prevented them from making such reports public .
Some police forces did provide the information without charge , Halifax , Fredericton , Calgary and Victoria , for example .
In 2008 , the RCMP apologized for excessive secrecy surrounding its use - of - force taser reports , which initially had key information removed when released to The Canadian Press and other news media .
The association 's annual audit of Canada 's freedom - of - information laws , this one organized by Fred Vallance - Jones , a journalism professor at the University of King 's College in Halifax , found police forces in Canada continue to withhold key information from the public about how officers are using tasers .
This is the fourth audit carried out by the daily newspaper group .
The report was complied by sending 219 requests to 22 municipal governments and their police services , 10 provinces and Yukon , and 11 federal departments and Crown corporations .
The requests were made by students acting as ordinary citizens .
The refusal to release taser information is disturbing , as there is a growing controversy about the use of the weapon in Canada " The police must be held to account , just like government or anyone who exercises power on the public 's behalf , " said David Gollob , senior vice - president of policy and communications .
" Police forces are supposed to be examples of lawful compliance , " Canada 's Information Commissioner Robert Marleau said .
Marleau stated the federal act as " an outdated piece of legislation with a weak compliance model . "

Mickey Rourke is Thin -Skinned
Actorjust won a Golden Globe for his work on the film The Wrestler and according to his ex-wife , Mickey has many insecurities
The couple first met back in 1980 when they were both filming the movie Hardcase and Debra thought that he was totally inept and mad .
Why then would she have married him , you might ask ?
Yeah , we do n't know either .
The two married in 1981 and she soon realized that he was riddled with fears .
" He is the most thin - skinned , oversensitive person I have ever met .
When we met he was like a little abused dog .
He was so vulnerable .
He hated flying and he would n't go in the ocean because he was afraid there would be sharks .
He was so nervous .
Despite taking up polo , he was even terrified of horses .
He made his name playing sex symbols and fighters but he'd make a much better Woody Allen character .
He 's so phobic . "
Feur stuck out the marriage until 1990 when they divorced .
It seems like Debra must have issues of her own to have married Rourke in the first place .
We 're just saying ...

You of course need to have a great stable job where you make TONS of money for me to spend in any frivolous way I can think of .
You need to be AWESOME in the sack with a huge package and have complete ejaculation control , so my intimate needs can be met each and every time you are lucky enough to have me .
You also need to be content with no sex for months on end if it makes me happy .
You must love kids because I have 7 ( do n't worry the state has them for now ) .
You also must LOVE my cats and instantly memorize the names and ages of all 12 of them .
I have a hard time moving around so I bathe with a washrag on a stick and you must be willing to get the parts I cant reach .
You must also be willing to fight other fat women off the electric shopping carts in large stores so I can ride them in comfort while shopping .
My image of perfection can change at any time , depending on mood , time of the month , etc . .
You are required to conform to my changing expectations with little or no input from me .
But enough about you .
I 'm oddly enough shaped like a pumpkin .... LOL .
I am very obese ( I just got sweatin to the oldies so I 'm working on it ) and as I mentioned I cant move around very well , I do have a few minor medical problems .
I have a bedsore on my ass from the computer chair I 'm in all day .
However I did recently get a blow up donut so that 's finally healing up .
The area between my belly and my huge pendulous breasts does n't get much air so I have a few sores under there , I prop the ladies up with dvd boxes to improve air circulation whilst I surf the net so that should be improving soon as well .
I just love the way cats freshen up any living space , I like the way they smell and you should too !!
I like long walks in the rain , well , you walk and I hoveround .
I also LOVE , LOVE , LOVE chocolate , LOTS of it ( ice cream form is acceptable also ) .
I have long dirty blond hair that I comb in such a way that you can hardly notice my dandruff and pattern baldness .
I love to snuggle , just not on bath day ( bath day is for me to enjoy ) .
I have a massive collection of sexy floral moo moo's so you will never be without a little eye candy * wink * .
Many of them just need to be washed and they 'll look like brand new .
I 'm a smokin bBw waiting for you , the capitol B is for a little extra beautiful .
I 'm real you be too !!!!!!

New Grid Battery Could Solve Peak Energy Demands
December 7th , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
GreenSmith Energy Management Systems has unveiled technology it claims can solve the peak demand issues experienced by U.S. utilities .
The company has created a battery control - management system , that when paired with a lithium ion battery , can store up to 20 kilowatt - hours .
The system can then deliver a full 4,000 discharge cycles .
Ideally , utilities could charge the system at night when energy is cheaper to produce and then discharge that energy in to the grid during peak hours .
Is it just me that hates using the word discharge ?
“ Utilities are far more receptive to distributed storage technologies than they are to smart grid , and for a reason , ” CEO Rodney Smith told the Cleantech Group .
“ Grid replacement is like trying to replace the air traffic control system .
You have to put a lot of money into it before you see any rewards from it .
With our technology , you get the benefit right away . ”
The part I am enthusiastic about is how the system can be paired up with renewable energy sources .
For example , wind and solar could be better aligned with demand .
And while consumers are not the target audience , Smith did say that the devices could be modified for home use .

KINGSVILLE , Texas ( AP ) —
In this friendly little ranching town , “ hello ” is wearing out its welcome .
And Leonso Canales Jr. is happy as heck .
At his urging , the Kleberg County commissioners on Monday unanimously designated “ heaven - o ” as the county ’s official greeting .
The reason : “ hello ” contains the word “ hell . ”
“ When you go to school and church , they tell you ‘ hell ’ is negative and ‘ heaven ’ is positive , ' ” said the 56 - year - old Canales , who owns the Kingsville Flea Market .
“ I think it ’s time that we set a new precedent , to tell our kids that we are positive adults . ”
The new salutation , according to the county resolution , is a “ symbol of peace , friendship and welcome ” in this “ age of anxiety . ”
On Thursday , courthouse employees were answering the phones , “ heaven -o . ”
And the chamber of commerce was working on a campaign promoting Kingsville , a Rio Grande Valley town of 25,000 , as a “ heavenly ” place to visit .
“ People seem to think that it might catch on , ” said county Judge Pete De La Garza .
Not everyone is a convert to Kleberg County ’s heavenly ways .
Madolyn Musick , who runs a bookstore , insisted , and linguists would agree , that “ hello ” has nothing to do with “ hell . ”
Besides , she added , “ What ’s wrong with , ‘ Howdy , y’all ? ' ”
Canales , a Catholic but not a regular churchgoer , has been as serious as heck about “ hello ” since 1988 , when he told his brother he might start greeting people with “ God-o . ”
His brother suggested “ heaven - o ” instead .
David Sabrio , a professor of English at Texas A&M University - Kingsville , noted that the Oxford English Dictionary says “ hello ” stems from an old German greeting for hailing a boat .
“ Linguistically and historically , the word ‘ hello ’ has no connection at all with what we associate with the underworld , ” he said .
“ People may make that connection in their own mind .
I certainly do n’t . ”
David Cameron and his wife , Samantha , thanked well - wishers today for their messages of support following the death of their son , Ivan .
The six - year - old , who was severely disabled , was taken ill overnight and died at St Mary 's Hospital , Paddington , early this morning .
A statement posted on the Conservative party 's website said : " David and Samantha are grateful for all the warm messages of support and condolence that they have received . "
The couple asked anyone considering sending flowers to instead make a donation to one of five charities : Mencap , Friends of St Mary 's Hospital , Paddington , Friends of Jack Tizard School , Helen & Douglas House , Twickenham , and Shooting Star children 's hospice .
Prime minister 's question time was cancelled this afternoon , and Brown and other senior politicians instead offered their condolences in the Commons chamber .
" I know that the whole house will want to express their sorrow at the death of Ivan Cameron , " Brown told MPs .
" He brought joy to all those around him .
Every child is precious and irreplaceable .
The death of a child is an unbearable sorrow no parents should have to endure . "
The Browns ' first child , Jennifer Jane , was born prematurely in late 2001 and died after 10 days .
They have since had two sons , Fraser , who has cystic fibrosis , and John .
For the Tories , William Hague , who spoke to Cameron before making his statement , said : " Ivan 's six years of life were not easy ones .
" His parents lived with the knowledge for a long time that he could die young but this has made their loss no less heartbreaking …
He will always be their beautiful boy . "
The Camerons were " hugely grateful " to the NHS care workers who " not only did their utmost for their son this morning but have helped every day since he was born " , he said .
The birth of Ivan in 2002 had a profound effect on Cameron .
The Tory leader has admitted that learning about his son's illness hit him " like a freight train " , but his friends believe the experience of caring for Ivan gave him a much deeper understanding of the difficulties faced by people with a less sheltered upbringing .
Ivan needed care at night , and Cameron and his wife often took turns sleeping in his room .
He also needed constant visits to hospital , and Cameron 's passionate commitment to the NHS – which has marked him out from other Tory leaders – was largely influenced by the contact he has had with his son 's carers .
The Camerons had to adapt their west London home to accommodate Ivan , who needed a lift to get in and out of his bath .
Like Tony Blair , but unlike Brown , Cameron has always been keen to talk about his children and to be photographed with them .
Ivan was not able to talk , but Cameron spoke with obvious delight about the pleasure he got from seeing his son smile at him .
The Camerons also have a daughter , Nancy , five , and another son , three - year - old Arthur .
Although the Camerons have had " scares " in the past when Ivan 's condition has been particularly bad – at one stage last year Cameron had to cancel a party visit because Ivan was in hospital – the family had had no warning that his life was in danger until he was suddenly taken ill .
It is understood Cameron and his wife were both with Ivan when he died .
A party spokesman said : " They had no particular warning that this tragedy was going to happen .
Ivan had a bad night , but he 's had bad nights before .
" They got him to hospital .
But he did not pull through . "
The spokesman said the mood in Conservative headquarters was very sombre .
" People are very , very upset , " he added .
" They knew that David cared for Ivan very , very deeply .
David brought him to Westminster occasionally and lots of his staff had met him . "
The Tory leader has postponed a planned appearance with Lady Thatcher at 10 Downing Street this evening for the unveiling of a new portrait of her , and party officials said he might cancel public engagements for the next two weeks .
The Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , whose wife gave birth to their third son at the weekend , said : " My heart goes out to David and Samantha at this incredibly difficult time for them and their family . "
Asked about the suspension of today 's question time , Brown 's spokesman said : " The prime minister 's view is that he wanted to consult the opposition parties and listen to their views and agree to a sensible way forward which marks the very difficult day it is going to be for everybody at Westminster . "
Prime minister 's questions was last cancelled was in 2000 , when debate on a controversial bill ran overnight into the morning , and before that in 1994 , on the day John Smith , the then Labour leader , died .
I can exclusively report that the 14 - year - old child star - she turns 15 on Feb. 23 - is in talks to play Jane opposite Robert Pattinson & Co. in New Moon , the upcoming sequel to box office megahit Twilight .
“ There were no auditions , ” a source reveals .
“ They just offered it to her outright , and now they ’re in negotiations .
They ’ve been going back and forth . ”
Jane is a member of Italy ’s Volturi , the most deadly group of bloodsucking killers in author Stephenie Meyer ’s best - selling series .
In the casting notice we got our hands on earlier this month , Jane is described as a petite blonde with a “ Botticelli angel - like face … [ and ] crimson irises . ”
While fellow Volturi guards Demetri & Felix “ are three times the size of her , they are terrified of her , ” the casting notice reads .
Coincidentally ( or maybe not ) , an online petition started by a Twilight fan already asks the studio , Summit Entertainment , to cast Fanning because she would be “ perfect ” for the role .
E ! Online is reporting that ( Hide and Seek , The Secret Life of Bees , Push ) is in talks to join the cast of “ “ , the upcoming sequel to “ . ”
There is nothing confirmed but she could be playing the role of Jane .
From E !

Friday Q&A 2009-01-23
Welcome to the first Friday Q&A ; of the new Presidential administration .
Unlike Mr. Obama , I 'm afraid of change and so this week 's edition will be just like all the other ones .
This week I 'll be taking Jonathan Mitchell 's suggestion to talk about how Key - Value Observing ( KVO ) is actually implemented at the runtime level .
What Is It ?
Most readers probably know this already , but just for a quick recap : KVO is the technology that underlies Cocoa Bindings , and it provides a way for objects to get notified when the properties of other objects are changed .
One object observes a key of another object .
When the observed object changes the value of that key , the observer gets notified .
Pretty straightforward , right ?
The tricky part is that KVO operates with no code needed in the object being observed ... usually .
Overview
So how does that work , not needing any code in the observed object ?
Well it all happens through the power of the Objective - C runtime .
When you observe an object of a particular class for the first time , the KVO infrastructure creates a brand new class at runtime that subclasses your class .
In that new class , it overrides the set methods for any observed keys .
It then switches out the isa pointer of your object ( the pointer that tells the Objective - C runtime what kind of object a particular blob of memory actually is ) so that your object magically becomes an instance of this new class .
The overridden methods are how it does the real work of notifying observers .
The logic goes that changes to a key have to go through that key 's set method .
It overrides that set method so that it can intercept it and post notifications to observers whenever it gets called .
( Of course it 's possible to make a modification without going through the set method if you modify the instance variable directly .
KVO requires that compliant classes must either not do this , or must wrap direct ivar access in manual notification calls . )
It gets trickier though : Apple really does n't want this machinery to be exposed .
In addition to setters , the dynamic subclass also overrides the - class method to lie to you and return the original class !
If you do n't look too closely , the KVO - mutated objects look just like their non-observed counterparts .
Digging Deeper
Enough talk , let 's actually see how all of this works .
I wrote a program that illustrates the principles behind KVO .
Because of the dynamic KVO subclass tries to hide its own existence , I mainly use Objective - C runtime calls to get the information we 're looking for .
Here 's the program :
// gcc -o kvoexplorer - framework Foundation kvoexplorer .m #import < Foundation / Foundation.h > # import < objc/runtime.h > @interface TestClass : NSObject { int x ; int y ; int z ; } @property int x ; @property int y ; @property int z ; @end @implementation TestClass @synthesize x , y , z ; @end static NSArray * ClassMethodNames ( Class c ) { NSMutableArray * array = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; unsigned int methodCount = 0 ; Method * methodList = class_copyMethodList ( c , & methodCount ) ; unsigned int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < methodCount ; i ++ ) [ array addObject : NSStringFromSelector ( method_getName ( methodList [ i ] ) ) ] ; free ( methodList ) ; return array ; } static void PrintDescription ( NSString * name , id obj ) { NSString * str = [ NSString stringWithFormat : @ " %@ : %@
\t NSObject class %s
\t libobjc class %s
\t implements methods < %@ > " , name , obj , class_getName ( [ obj class ] ) , class_getName ( obj -> isa ) , [ ClassMethodNames ( obj -> isa ) componentsJoinedByString : @ " , " ] ] ; printf ( " %s
" , [ str UTF8 String ] ) ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { [ NSAutoreleasePool new ] ; TestClass * x = [ [ TestClass alloc ] init ] ; TestClass * y = [ [ TestClass alloc ] init ] ; TestClass * xy = [ [ TestClass alloc ] init ] ; TestClass * control = [ [ TestClass alloc ] init ] ; [ x addObserver : x forKeyPath : @ " x " options : 0 context : NULL ] ; [ xy addObserver : xy forKeyPath : @ " x " options : 0 context : NULL ] ; [ y addObserver : y forKeyPath : @ " y " options : 0 context : NULL ] ; [ xy addObserver : xy forKeyPath : @ " y " options : 0 context : NULL ] ; PrintDescription ( @ " control " , control ) ; PrintDescription ( @ " x " , x ) ; PrintDescription ( @ " y " , y ) ; PrintDescription ( @ " xy " , xy ) ; printf ( " Using NSObject methods , normal setX : is %p , overridden setX : is %p
" , [ control methodForSelector : @selector ( setX :) ] , [ x methodForSelector : @selector ( setX : ) ] ) ; printf ( " Using libobjc functions , normal setX : is %p , overridden setX : is %p
" , method_getImplementation ( class_getInstanceMethod ( object_getClass ( control ) , @selector ( setX : ) ) ) , method_getImplementation ( class_getInstanceMethod ( object_getClass ( x ) , @selector ( setX : ) ) ) ) ; return 0 ; }
Let 's walk through it , top to bottom .
First we define a class called TestClass which has three properties .
( KVO works on non- @property keys too but this is the simplest way to define pairs of setters and getters . )
Next we define a pair of utility functions .
ClassMethodNames uses Objective - C runtime functions to go through a class and get a list of all the methods it implements .
Note that it only gets methods implemented directly in that class , not in superclasses .
PrintDescription prints a full description of the object passed to it , showing the object 's class as obtained through the - class method as well as through an Objective - C runtime function , and the methods implemented on that class .
Then we start experimenting using those facilities .
We create four instances of TestClass , each of which will be observed in a different way .
The x instance will have an observer on its x key , similar for y , and xy will get both .
The z key is left unobserved for comparison purposes .
And lastly the control instance serves as a control on the experiment and will not be observed at all .
Next we print out the description of all four objects .
After that we dig a little deeper into the overridden setter and print out the address of the implementation of the - setX : method on the control object and an observed object to compare .
And we do this twice , because using - methodForSelector : fails to show the override .
KVO 's attempt to hide the dynamic subclass even hides the overridden method with this technique !
But of course using Objective - C runtime functions instead provides the proper result .
Running the Code
So that 's what it does , now let 's look at a sample run :
control : < TestClass : 0x104b20 > NSObject class TestClass libobjc class TestClass implements methods < setX :, x , setY :, y , setZ :, z > x : < TestClass : 0x103280 > NSObject class TestClass libobjc class NSKVONotifying_TestClass implements methods < setY :, setX : , class , dealloc , _isKVOA > y : < TestClass : 0x104b00 > NSObject class TestClass libobjc class NSKVONotifying_TestClass implements methods < setY :, setX : , class , dealloc , _isKVOA > xy : < TestClass : 0x104b10 > NSObject class TestClass libobjc class NSKVONotifying_TestClass implements methods < setY :, setX : , class , dealloc , _isKVOA > Using NSObject methods , normal setX : is 0x195e , overridden setX : is 0x195e Using libobjc functions , normal setX : is 0x195e , overridden setX : is 0x96a1a550
TestClass
First it prints our control object .
As expected , its class isand it implements the six methods we synthesized from the class 's properties .
Next it prints the three observed objects .
Note that while - class is still showing TestClass , using object_getClass shows the true face of this object : it 's an instance of NSKVONotifying_TestClass .
There 's your dynamic subclass !
Notice how it implements the two observed setters .
This is interesting because you 'll note that it 's smart enough not to override - setZ : even though that 's also a setter , because nobody has observed it .
Presumably if we were to add an observer to z as well , then NSKVONotifying_TestClass would suddenly sprout a - setZ : override .
But also note that it 's the same class for all three instances , meaning they all have overrides for both setters , even though two of them only have one observed property .
This costs some efficiency due to passing through the observed setter even for a non-observed property , but Apple apparently thought it was better not to have a proliferation of dynamic subclasses if each object had a different set of keys being observed , and I think that was the correct choice .
And you 'll also notice three other methods .
There 's the overridden - class method as mentioned before , the one that tries to hide the existence of this dynamic subclass .
There 's a - dealloc method to handle cleanup .
And there 's a mysterious - _isKVOA method which looks to be a private method that Apple code can use to determine if an object is being subject to this dynamic subclassing .
Next we print out the implementation for - setX : .
Using - methodForSelector : returns the same value for both .
Since there is no override for this method in the dynamic subclass , this must mean that - methodForSelector : uses - class as part of its internal workings and is getting the wrong answer due to that .
So of course we bypass that altogether and use the Objective - C runtime to print the implementations instead , and here we can see the difference .
The original agrees with - methodForSelector : ( as of course it should ) , but the second is completely different .
Being good explorers , we 're running in the debugger and so can see exactly what this second function actually is :
( gdb ) print ( IMP ) 0x96a1a550 $ 1 = ( IMP ) 0x96a1a550 < _NSSetIntValueAndNotify >
nm -a
0013 df80 t __NSSetBoolValueAndNotify 000 a0480 t __NSSetCharValueAndNotify 0013e120 t __NSSetDoubleValueAndNotify 0013e1 f0 t __NSSetFloatValueAndNotify 000e3550 t __NSSetIntValueAndNotify 0013e390 t __NSSetLongLongValueAndNotify 0013e2 c0 t __NSSetLongValueAndNotify 000 89 df0 t __NSSetObjectValueAndNotify 0013e6 f0 t __NSSetPointValueAndNotify 0013e7 d0 t __NSSetRangeValueAndNotify 0013e8 b0 t __NSSetRectValueAndNotify 0013e550 t __NSSetShortValueAndNotify 000 8 ab20 t __NSSetSizeValueAndNotify 0013e050 t __NSSetUnsignedCharValueAndNotify 0009f cd0 t __NSSetUnsignedIntValueAndNotify 0013e470 t __NSSetUnsignedLongLongValueAndNotify 0009f c00 t __NSSetUnsignedLongValueAndNotify 0013e620 t __NSSetUnsignedShortValueAndNotify
_NSSetObjectValueAndNotify
long double
_Bool
CFTypeRef
It 's some sort of private function that implements the observer notification .
By usingon Foundation we can get a complete listing of all of these private functions :
There are some interesting things to be found in this list .
First , you 'll notice that Apple has to implement a separate function for every primitive type that they want to support .
They only need one for Objective - C objects ( ) but they need a whole host of functions for the rest .
And that host is kind of incomplete : there 's no function foror .
There is n't even one for a generic pointer type , such as you 'd get if you had aproperty .
And while there are several functions for various common Cocoa structs , there obviously are n't any for the huge universe of other structs out there .
This means that any properties of these types will simply be ineligible for automatic KVO notification , so beware !
KVO is a powerful technology , sometimes a little too powerful , especially when automatic notification is involved .
Now you know exactly how it all works on the inside and this knowledge may help you decide how to use it or to debug it when it goes wrong .
If you plan to use KVO in your own application you may want to check out my article on Key - Value Observing Done Right .

July 23 - 25 , 2004
On the New York City nightclub scene , Walter Monheit is a fixture , an icon even .
Since the days of ballroom dancing clubs in the 1950 ’s , this now - 78 - year - old man has been clubbing two to three nights per week from around midnight until about 5 a.m .
A retiree who lives in Bensonhurst with his cat , Precious , he is known for nocturnal antics like dancing with sexy young women in clubs , and getting their phone numbers .
In a world marked by status - consciousness tied to youth , physical beauty , and wealth , this elderly man of modest means is popular and respected , and some club owners admit him for free — the mark of a VIP .
Once inside a club , Mr. Monheit , who walks slowly due to arthritis in his knees , typically sits for a while , then grabs the prettiest , most voluptuous , or most dynamic woman in the room and pulls her onto the dance floor .
He twists and gyrates .
If his partner is game , he slow dances with her .
Small and square , wearing a black suit , black cap , and string of multicolored Mardi Gras beads , he balances lit candles and drinks on his head , tells jokes , and philosophizes , dispensing wisdom on race ( “ If you do n’t like someone ’s color , argue with God .
It ’s God who made us all different , ” ) and spirituality ( “ People say , ‘ There are no miracles . ’
I say , ‘ Look at the snow .
Look at the rain .
Life is a miracle . ” )
When asked why he has chosen to devote so much time to activities most people associate with youth , Mr. Monheit suggests the answer is simple : it makes him happy .
“ I keep myself busy , ” he says in a thick Austrian accent .
“ When you cry , you cry alone .
But when I smile , the whole world smiles with me . ”
So what ’s the secret of his eternal youth ?
“ Young girls , ” he says .
Is he still interested in them romantically ?
His answer is cryptic .
“ People ask me , ‘ Can you still get it up ? ’
I tell them , ‘ I ca n’t complain . ’ ”
Very occasionally , Monheit does succeed romantically with younger women , according to his first cousin ’s son , Ira Gold .
“ I ’ve seen him making out with 35 - year - old women , ” says Mr. Gold , who visited clubs with Monheit semi-regularly in the mid-80’s .
“ Maybe he ’s just doing what everyone wants to do .
He lacks all self - consciousness , which can be a good thing . ”
It is tempting to speculate that Monheit ’s unconventional lifestyle may be rooted in the desire to forget tragedy .
Born in Austria in 1926 , he vividly remembers Kristallnacht , the night the Nazis destroyed Jewish businesses and homes , and killed and injured many Jews in Germany and Austria .
Monheit recalls that that night , Nazis pushed his father down the stairs of the family ’s home in Vienna .
His father was taken away , and was one of the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust .
Eventually Mr. Monheit ’s mother was deported to a concentration camp as well .
Mr. Monheit has two brothers — one older and one twin .
They were all spared when their mother sent them from Austria to England on the Kindertransport–a program in which England agreed to accept 10,000 Jewish children from within the Third Reich as refugees after the Anschluss , or German takeover of Austria .
At one point , Mr. Monheit remembers being separated from his brothers , who were taken on a transport ahead of him .
For several months , he waited in Holland in the care of a Jewish organization , Agudath Israel .
Eventually , he made it to England .
The children were reunited with their mother after the war , when his older brother found their mother in Czechoslovakia and brought her to the U.S .
Mr. Monheit is proudly Jewish ; he frequently wears a ring that bears a silver star of David , keeps kosher , and attends Shabbat services on Saturday mornings .
Unlike Mr. Monheit , who is a lifelong bachelor , his brothers are married , with several children and grandchildren each .
One niece is a career officer in the Israeli army .
As to why he never married , he says , “ Why make one girl miserable when you can make all the girls happy ? ”
He has been a guest of Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion , and fondly remembers the heyday of New York City ’s nightclub scene in the 70’s , when places such as Studio 54 and the sex club , Plato ’s Retreat , were all the rage .
“ It was the greatest party of all time , ” he says .
Celebrity news photographer Marina Garnier , who met and began going to clubs and parties with Mr. Monheit in the 80’s , says she did so because she shared Mr. Monheit ’s love of the nightlife .
“ We shared the desire to have fun and meet people , ” she said .
“ Many people saw an older man and younger woman and had the misconception that something was going on .
But for him , friendship is enough of a reason to spend time together .
That ’s the European in him . ”
Mr. Monheit ’s star rose in the late 1980 ’s when Garnier , then a photographer for Spy magazine , introduced him to the staff there .
He was originally a messenger , but soon became a kind of official prankster .
“ He was a happy - go - lucky disco guy , a colorful character , and Spy was a fun , party magazine , so his personality matched the Spy ambience , ” Ms. Garnier said .
Spy began using Mr. Monheit ’s image , wearing a monocle , as part of a spoof on film critics , and even recruited him for an article in which he posed as a Scottish laird , wearing a kilt and riding in a limousine , in order to fool society types into thinking he was royalty .
In the 1990’s , Vanity Fair editor - in - chief Graydon Carter borrowed Spy ’s film reviewer spoof idea , pairing Mr. Monheit ’s image with ghostwritten film reviews .
When asked what he did for income in his life , Mr. Monheit , a twinkle in his blue eyes , speaks of having been a massage therapist and ballet dancer who performed with Mikhail Baryshnikov .
Then he confides that he held a clerical job in a bank .
Today , he manages to get by on a pension from that job and social security .
He says he also “ thank [ s ]
God , ” for city services like the Access - a - Ride van , which provides transportation for the elderly .
He uses this service to go to doctors ’ appointments — and also to return from the Manhattan nightclubs to his Bensonhurst apartment in the wee hours .
On a recent morning at 4:30 a.m , Mr. Monheit unwinds at a small , dingy Indian fast food restaurant on Tenth Avenue .
He strikes up a conversation with two young British women , Serena and Maryanne .
He gives them his phone number , gets theirs , then shuffles with exquisite slowness into the early dawn to wait for the Access - a - Ride van .
It ’s supposed to come at 5:30 .
In front of Marquee , the dance club in which he ’s spent the night , he sits on a stool to wait .
In the orange glow of the club ’s lights , he looks at the glossy invitations he ’s been handed by party promoters .
A beautiful , olive skinned woman with a jewel in her navel and a tight halter rushes over to him , breaking away from her companion .
She embraces him , asking , “ Where have you been ? ”
He tells her the clubs : Pangaea , China Club , Au Bar , and here , Marquee .
He smiles , his handsome , lined face lighting up .
It ’s 5:40 , and no van .
He sighs .
“ You know my favorite part of the night ? ” he asks .
“ The morning .
The sun rise on Ocean Parkway . ”
The van comes , and Mr. Monheit slowly rises to go home .

AMERICA may be moving closer to creating a " bad bank " to absorb its banking system 's impaired assets .
Would it work ?
No one knows , but everyone is looking to Sweden — which used that model in the early 1990s after its banks crumpled under the weight of bad real estate loans — for guidance .
I talked to Bo Lundgren , who was the minister in charge of taxation , financial markets , and sports ( yes , sports ) at the time of the bail - out , to learn more about which issues are likely to prove stickiest for America .
What are the toughest challenges — the extent to which banks are nationalised , the relative importance of recapitalisation versus purchases of bad assets , or something else ?
What follows is based on our conversation .
Sweden ’s first major step to alleviate its crisis was a blanket guarantee of all bank liabilities .
This immediately restored depositor and creditor confidence , preventing runs which would have made it impossible for banks to restructure .
Under emergency legislation passed by the parliament , the financial authorities could then take over and nationalise any bank on the verge of failing .
In the end , Sweden only nationalised two banks — Nordbanken ( which had been majority government - owned anyway and was in the process of privatisation ) and Gota Bank , which was on the verge of failure with some 37 % of its loans non-performing .
It also provided substantial aid to the leading savings bank .
Though it recapitalised both Nordbanken and Gota , Sweden also set up a bad bank for each to dispose of their bad loans .
Mr Lundgren said removing their bad assets in addition to recapitalisation was necessary , else the good banks ' management teams would have been consumed with the handling of non-performing loans , rather than making new loans .
Moreover , the bad banks were better equipped to dispose of the loans or the underlying collateral ( mostly real estate and some corporations ) .
The price of the assets the bad banks purchased from the good banks was determined with the help of consultants and government examiners who tried to apply a value as close to pure market value as possible .
Since Nordbanken and Gota Bank were both government controlled at this point , there was no issue of taxpayer subsidy from overpaying or capital depletion from underpaying .
Mr Lundgren anticipated at the outset that even with the blanket liability guarantee , the government would have to inject substantially more capital into almost all the banks .
This , he thought , would result in their de facto nationalisation as the government fully intended to buy common shares and to exercise its ownership rights .
But this did not prove necessary .
The other big Swedish banks , like SEB and Swedbank , gained enough time and creditor patience from the blanket guarantee to restructure themselves .
They did this by establishing their own bad banks and then obtaining new capital from private investors , including the Japanese .
The Swedish worried , as Americans do now , that banks would reduce lending in order to rebuild capital and to avoid nationalisation .
The blanket guarantee mitigated deleveraging pressure somewhat .
Loan growth would have fallen anyway due to the reduced credit - worthiness of so many Swedish borrowers .
Large Swedish corporations were insulated somewhat by the availability of capital markets financing outside Scandinavia .
I see at least two important distinctions between Sweden ’s situation then and America 's now .
First , Sweden entered the crisis without existing powers for government authorities to take over banks , as America currently has under FDICIA ( although America lacks similar powers for non-banks , a glaring gap in the safety net ) .
It had to get these in the midst of the crisis through emergency legislation .
Second , Sweden ’s room to manoeuvre was helped by the fact that only Scandinavia at the time was experiencing a systemic banking crisis ; this meant that the Swedish economy benefitted from external support , and there existed foreign sources of capital to aid in the bank restructuring process .
One final note : Mr Lundgren says one of the most useful books he read at the time was The banking crisis of 1933 by historian Susan Estabrook Kennedy .
( She died in 2003 ; the book is out of print . )
He ended up using the same three categories for banks that Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt did at the time of the Great Depression — needing little support or guarantees ; needing capital but viable in the long run ; and needing to be taken over completely .

Many children will , at some point , profess an ambition to be prime minister .
But for Rupert Murdoch , governing a single country has never been of interest when the whole world is there for the taking .
" He functions as a separate city state , " says Michael Wolff , author of a new biography , The Man Who Owns the News .
" When he came to the UK , he was n't like Maxwell or Conrad Black , who wanted to be approved by the establishment ; he does n't care remotely about that kind of thing .
He does n't want to get along with other cultures or help them .
He is a conqueror . "
Last year , aged 76 , Murdoch bought Dow Jones , the owner of The Wall Street Journal , for $ 5.6bn ( £ 3.8 bn ) .
It was , says Wolff , his retirement present to himself .
" He still had some doubts he was the world 's last great newspaper proprietor and he wanted to nail that . "
Wolff believes The New York Times , chief rival to his New York Post , would be the clincher .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was during the takeover of the WSJ that Wolff , a columnist for Vanity Fair , gained access to Murdoch .
Over nine months he saw Murdoch regularly at his New York home , usually dropping in on a Saturday when he was looking after his two children by his second wife Wendi Deng .
" He would be relieved to have someone to talk business to , " says Wolff .
Wolff 's book claims to be the first to reveal the man as a person .
A picture emerges of a quixotic , patrician character with no masterplan other than to dominate ; he is unhampered by the routine human burdens of self - doubt , self - awareness or any kind of coherent moral code .
Murdoch is , though , above all , a newspaper man .
" He lives for newspapers .
They are his reason for being , " says Wolff .
" He does n't understand modern technology . "
Wolff 's book , which aims to psychoanalyse Murdoch , concludes there is no underlying reason for his megalomania .
What , no Freudian pigeon hole ?
" A dominating mother and remote father , " concedes Wolff .
Rupert and his mother , Dame Elisabeth Murdoch , still very much alive aged 99 , are not close .
Described as formidable , she brought up Rupert and his three sisters in the old upper - class English mould , at arm 's length .
" Does Elisabeth revere him ?
No , not that fondly .
But obviously she loves her son . "
Does Rupert have a hero ?
" The only person I ever heard him speak of in a clearly approving way was Silvio Berlusconi .
You can see why – he is a media mogul who took over the government . "
Would Murdoch have liked to have done likewise ?
" I think he did , in a sense , take over Australia .
But Australia is too small for him .
The UK is too small .
Maybe the US is worthy , but even that was n't enough – the world was his prize . "
It is revealing to learn who Murdoch favours .
" He really likes Gordon Brown , " says Wolff .
" He has a close identification with him , to the extent that , although there are lots of issues they diverge on , there is nevertheless a clear soul - mate feeling .
And Wendi and Sarah Brown also get along . "
So there 's hope for Brown , after all , not least thanks to Murdoch 's apparent detestation of David Cameron .
" He does n't like Cameron at all , " says Wolff , " His mouth literally goes into a contortion when he has to consider him .
But Rupert gets a lot of pressure from James [ Murdoch , his son and a boss at Rupert 's News Corporation media empire ] and [ Sun editor ]
Rebekah Wade that Cameron is the person they like , and so he speaks about Cameron in a very begrudging way .
When it comes to the election , he will do what they want him to do .
Right now he says he will support Cameron .
But when someone says what they want him to do , he does the exact opposite , so there is no guarantee . "
If he wanted to ensure a successful dynastic succession , the obvious move would be to hand over control to one of his children .
But which one ?
" Like all fathers , he has favourites at different moments .
He is probably most in love with his eldest son [ Lachlan ] , most respects his second - eldest daughter [ Elisabeth ] , most fears his youngest son [ James ] , and most depends on his eldest daughter [ Prudence ] . "
Thinking about the succession provides Murdoch with hours of entertainment .
" He openly speculates on the trouble one of his children might cause the others .
A favourite theory is that Lachlan , who he 's desperate to get back to work for the company , will buy the Australian operation .
He also thinks Elisabeth will be successful enough to buy out her other siblings . "
One thing Murdoch cannot control is the future , but he is making every effort to do so .
" He has tied up all his children so deeply into the company that , whatever happens , News Corp will always be led by a Murdoch . "
Today Gmail Labs released a new feature that bridges the gap between desktop and web - based applications like never before : Offline Gmail .
You can now access your Gmail from your browser any time , whether or not you 're online .
Offline Gmail uses Google Gears to download all of your email to your desktop ( every last gigabyte ) .
Using Gmail in offline mode is exactly the same as using it normally — except that when offline mode is enabled in your browser , Gmail is that much faster .
Advertisement
Composing emails in offline mode puts them in your outbox , and those emails are automatically sent once you 're back online .
Offline Gmail even has a very cool ( though poorly named ) " flaky connection mode , " which is sort of like a middle ground between online and offline Gmail .
While in flaky connection mode :
[ Gmail ] uses the local cache as if you were disconnected , but still synchronizes your mail with the server in the background .
Our goal is to provide nearly the same browser - based Gmail experience whether you 're using the data cached on your computer or talking directly to the server .

The upshot to flaky connection mode is that your computer does n't have to hit Google 's servers to access old emails , which generally will mean a faster , more responsive inbox .
I 've been using Offline Gmail for a few months now , and I noticed the speed differences immediately .
It takes a while for Gears to download all of your old email , naturally , but once it has , it keeps your offline cache in sync with your online email pretty seamlessly .
Check the offline Gmail FAQ for more , and if you give it a try , let 's hear how it 's working for you in the comments .

If you ’re getting erlang out of memory crashes when using mnesia , chances are you ’re doing it wrong , for various values of it .
These out of memory crashes look something like this :
Crash dump was written to : erl_crash .
dump eheap_alloc : Cannot allocate 999999999 bytes of memory ( of type " heap " )
Possible Causes
You ’re doing it wrong Someone else is doing it wrong
You do n’t have enough RAM
While it ’s possible that the crash is due to not having enough RAM , or that some other program or process is using too much RAM for itself , chances are it ’s your fault .
One of the reasons these crashes can catch you by surprise is that the erlang VM is using a lot more memory than you might think .
Erlang is a functional language with single assignment and no shared memory .
A major consequence is that when you change a variable or send a message to another process , a new copy of the variable is created .
So an operation as simple as dict: update_counter ( “ foo ” , 1 , Dict1 ) consumes twice the memory of Dict1 since Dict1 is copied to create the return value .
And anything you do with ets , dets , or mnesia will result in at least 2 copies of every term : 1 copy for your process , and 1 copy for each table .
This is because mnesia uses ets and / or dets for storage , which both use 1 process per table .
That means every table operation results in a message pass , sending your term to the table or vice - versa .
So that ’s why erlang may be running out of memory .
Here ’s how to fix it .
Use Dirty Operations
If you ’re doing anything in a transaction , try to figure out how to do it dirty , or at least move as many operations as possible out of the transaction .
Mnesia transactions are separate processes with their own temporary ets tables .
That means there ’s the original term (s ) that must be passed in to the transaction or read from other tables , any updated copies that your code creates , copies of terms that are written to the temporary ets table , the final copies of terms that are written to actual table (s ) at the end of the transaction , and copies of any terms that are returned from the transaction process .
Here ’s an example to illustrate :
example ( ) -> T = function ( ) ->
Var1 = mnesia : read ( example_table , " foo " ) , Var2 = update ( Var2 ) , % a user - defined function to update Var1 ok = mnesia: write ( Var2 ) , Var2 end , {atomic , Var2} = mnesia: transaction ( T ) , Var2 .
First off , we already have a copy of Var1 in example_table .
It gets sent to the transaction process when you do mnesia : read , creating a second copy .
Var1 is then updated , resulting in Var2 , which I ’ll assume has the same memory footprint of Var1 .
So now we have 3 copies .
Var2 is then written to a temporary ets table because mnesia : write is called within a transaction , creating a fourth copy .
The transaction ends , sending Var2 back to the original process , and also overwriting Var1 with Var2 in example_table .
That ’s 2 more copies , resulting in a total of 6 copies .
Let ’s compare that to a dirty operation .
example ( ) ->
Var1 = mnesia : dirty_read( example_table , " foo " ) , Var2 = update ( Var1 ) , ok = mnesia: dirty_write ( Var2 ) , Var2 .
Doing it dirty results in only 4 copies : the original Var1 in example_table , the copy sent to your process , the updated Var2 , and the copy sent to mnesia to be written .
Dirty operations like this will generally have 2/3 the memory footprint of operations done in a transaction .
Reduce Record Size
Figuring out how to reduce your record size by using different data structures can create huge gains by drastically reducing the memory footprint of each operation , and possibly removing the need to use transaction .
For example , let ’s say you ’re storing a large record in mnesia , and using transactions to update it .
If the size of the record grows by 1 byte , then each transactional operation like the above will require an additional 5 bytes of memory , or dirty operations will require an additional 3 bytes .
For multi-megabyte records , this adds up very quickly .
The solution is to figure how to break that record up into many small records .
Mnesia can use any term as a key , so for example , if you ’re storing a record with a dict in mnesia such as {dict_record , “ foo ” , Dict} , you can split that up into many records like [ {tuple_record , { “ foo ” , Key1} , Val1} ] .
Each of these small records can be accessed independently , which could eliminate the need to use transactions , or at least drastically reduce the memory footprint of each transaction .
Iterate in Batches
Instead of getting a whole bunch of records from mnesia all at once , using mnesia : dirty_match_object or mnesia : dirty_select , iterate over the records in batches .
This is analagous to using lists operations on mnesia tables .
The match_object methods may return a huge number of records , and all those records have to be sent from the table process to your process , doubling the amount of memory required .
By iteratively doing operations on batches of records , you ’re only accessing a portion at a time , reducing the amount of memory being used at once .
Here ’s some code examples that only access 1 record at a time .
Note that if the table changes during iteration , the behavior is undefined .
You could also use the select operations to process records in batches of NObjects at a time .
Dirty Mnesia Foldl
dirty_foldl( F , Acc0 , Table ) -> dirty_foldl( F , Acc0 , Table , mnesia: dirty_first( Table ) ) .
dirty_foldl(_ , Acc , _ , ' $ end_of_table ' ) -> Acc ; dirty_foldl( F , Acc , Table , Key ) -> Acc2 = lists : foldl( F , Acc , mnesia: dirty_read( Table , Key ) ) , dirty_foldl( F , Acc2 , Table , mnesia : dirty_next ( Table , Key ) ) .
Dirty Mnesia Foreach
dirty_foreach( F , Table ) -> dirty_foreach( F , Table , mnesia: dirty_first( Table ) ) .
dirty_foreach(_ , _ , ' $ end_of_table ' ) -> ok ; dirty_foreach ( F , Table , Key ) -> lists : foreach ( F , mnesia: dirty_read( Table , Key ) ) , dirty_foreach ( F , Table , mnesia : dirty_next ( Table , Key ) ) .
Conclusion
It ’s probably your fault Do as little as possible inside transactions
Use dirty operations instead of transactions Reduce record size Iterate in small batches

Herbert Heimie Hamrol was the last known survivor of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire , and right up until the minute he died on Thursday at the age of 106 , he packed every moment as if it were his last .
Mr. Hamrol 's still - crisp memories of the smoke and the ruin served as the only true time machine left for a catastrophe most people know only from ancient photographs .
But that was only a part of what Mr. Hamrol brought to the plate when he woke up each morning at his home in Daly City .
He was also the oldest known grocery clerk in San Francisco , punching a clock until a week before he died at a local hospital of complications from pneumonia .
And if you were lucky enough to have talked with him , you probably would have learned a thing or two .
" Do n't spend every dime you get , " he told a Chronicle reporter in 2003 .
" Stay away from wild women . "
" Wear a tie when you go to work , also a nice shirt . "
And there was always the advice he offered year after year at the annual April 18 downtown observation of the quake and fire that rattled and burned San Francisco to ruin in 1906 .
Asked how he got to such an advanced age , he invariably gave a version of his answer in 2005 : " Do n't drink , or smoke , or take drugs . "
It was n't an ironclad rule - he did allow himself the occasional brandy or cigar .
As recently as 2000 , there were 16 survivors at the annual quake commemoration , held at 5:12 a.m. at Lotta 's Fountain to mark the exact moment the quake began .
But last year , on the 102nd anniversary , Mr. Hamrol was the only survivor present .
Planners of the annual event now know of no survivors to invite to this year 's event .
" I suppose this year we will all go down there and toast Herb Hamrol at 5:12 in the morning , " said publicist Lee Housekeeper , who has helped organize the annual event for more than 25 years .
" This time , it will be for Herb . "
Gladys Hansen , a historian who wrote a book on the 1906 earthquake and fire , believes there may still be some survivors .
She noted that San Francisco had a population of more than 400,000 at the time of the quake and some , somewhere , must still be alive .
" Every day , I hear new stories , " she said , " And I would not be surprised ... maybe not in San Francisco , but somewhere in the area . "
In April , Mr. Hamrol showed up fully alert as always .
He wore a baseball cap , chatted with the mayor and fire chief and kissed any lady who asked .
" There is no greater San Franciscan than Herb , " Mayor Gavin Newsom told the crowd of 350 .
Mr. Hamrol remembered little of the actual quake , being just 3 years old when it happened .
But the nuggets he did recall became more important as the years rolled by and older survivors passed away .
" I remember my mother carrying me down the stairs , " he said last spring .
He also remembered staying in Golden Gate Park while smoke filled the skies and rubble lay heaped everywhere .
" We do n't get an earthquake every day , so we celebrate the one we had , " he added .
" It was a beautiful earthquake . "
Mr. Hamrol was born in San Francisco on Jan. 10 , 1903 .
After graduating from the sixth grade , he took a job delivering meat for a butcher .
He also worked as a phone company clerk and a food wholesaler before settling in as a clerk at Andronico 's market on Irving Street in 1967 .
" He was revered and respected by everyone here , " said Andrea Fitzgerald , a manager at the store .
" Young kids could n't believe it at all when we told them how old he was .
He was still amazingly sharp . "
Mr. Hamrol 's wife of 40 years , Cecilia , died in 1969 .
He always kept her picture in his room , and he told The Chronicle in 2003 , " Every morning I say ' good morning ' to her . "
Mr. Hamrol 's son , Bill Hamrol of Galt ( Sacramento County ) , said his father believed if a person did n't have hobbies , he or she should continue to work .
" I believe that 's what kept him alive - work , " he said .
" That , and the fact that he was one of the best dads there was .
He loved his family and he loved his friends . "
Mr. Hamrol is survived by another son in addition to Bill , Burt Hamrol of San Francisco ; five grandchildren ; six great - grandchildren ; and two great - great - grandchildren .
Services will be held Sunday at 2 p.m. at Salem Memorial Park , Colma .
Jonathan Weisman reports on the White House .
The top congressional leaders from both parties gathered at the White House for a working discussion over the shape and size of President Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus plan .
The meeting was designed to promote bipartisanship .
But Obama showed that in an ideological debate , he ’s not averse to using a jab .
Challenged by one Republican senator over the contents of the package , the new president , according to participants , replied : “ I won . ”
The statement was prompted by Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl of Arizona , who challenged the president and the Democratic leaders over the balance between the package ’s spending and tax cuts , bringing up the traditional Republican notion that a tax credit for people who do not earn enough to pay income taxes is not a tax cut but a government check .
Obama noted that such workers pay Social Security and Medicare taxes , property taxes and sales taxes .
The issue was widely debated during the presidential campaign , when Sen.
John McCain , the Republican nominee , challenged Obama ’s tax plan as “ welfare . ”
With those two words — “ I won ” — the Democratic president let the Republicans know that debate has been put to rest Nov. 4 .
Democratic and Republican aides confirmed the exchange .
A White House spokesman said he was n’t immediately aware of the exchange .
The aides who heard the remarks stressed that it was n’t as boldly partisan as it might sound .
Still , other Democrats echoed the sentiment .
As he left the White House , House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina was asked about Republican complaints that Democrats are n’t listening to what their GOP colleagues have to say .
“ We ’re responding to the American people , ” he said .
“ The American people did n’t listen to them too well during the election . ”
Why Feinstein broke with Obama on Panetta WASHINGTON IN TRANSITION
Insiders see signal to Obama that he must play by the rules
Washington , UNITED STATES : Iraq Study Group member and former Clinton Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta makes remarks during a news conference after the Iraq Study Group delivered their report to President Bush and Congress , 06 December 2006 in Washington , DC .
The bi-partisan group reported that the situation in Iraq is " grave and deteriorating " , and offered recommendations to be taken .

Sen .
Dianne Feinstein 's chilly response Tuesday to outreach from President - elect Barack Obama - after stomping on his choice of fellow Californian Leon Panetta as head of the CIA - dealt the incoming administration what is being described as the first " brush - back pitch " from powerful Democrats in Washington .
Feinstein - the new chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , who will oversee Panetta 's confirmation hearings - raised eyebrows when she expressed surprisingly sharp disapproval of Panetta as nominee for CIA chief on Monday .
She said that " the agency is best served by having an intelligence professional in charge . "
Panetta has no intelligence agency experience .
Feinstein , the outgoing chair of the Senate Rules Committee , followed that shocker Tuesday by breaking with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Obama when she said Roland Burris should be seated as the newest U.S. senator after he was appointed to Obama 's seat by Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , who is under investigation for trying to sell the seat vacated by the president - elect .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden said Tuesday it was a mistake not to give Feinstein a courtesy heads - up about the coming nominations of Panetta and retired Adm.
Dennis Blair as national intelligence director .
But even after Biden and Obama contacted her personally Tuesday , the California senator did n't soften her opposition to Panetta , saying only that now she is " looking forward " to talking to the former Clinton White House chief of staff " about the critical issues facing the intelligence community . "
Those who know Feinstein well and have worked intimately with her insist that her public critique of Panetta was not personal in nature .
Though the two have competed on the political stage - a movement in 1998 to get Panetta to run for governor was derailed largely by rumors that Feinstein would throw her hat in the ring - insiders say that this week 's dustup was more a message to the incoming Obama administration about Beltway politics .
" Leon certainly has management and organizational experience up the wazoo , and clearly he knows how to run an organization , " said Barbara O'Connor , professor of political communication at Cal State Sacramento .
But Feinstein is " chair of the committee ... the rules are the rules .
You have to get along with the senior elected officials of your own party , and she 's one .
And they require face time .
Had they briefed her adequately ... she would n't have been surprised , " she said .
Power move
One high - level Democrat with strong ties to Feinstein , who spoke on condition of anonymity , characterized the senator 's statements on Panetta this week as " a show of strength , a brush - back pitch , from a powerful chair who can be helpful or hurtful " to Obama .
" She feels strongly about protocol , " Feinstein 's friend said .
" As chair of the Intelligence Committee , she expected a courtesy call , especially if it was going to be outside the norm . "
" If she did not respond with a show of strength , she'd be seen as weak , " the insider said .
" This is not the time for weak leaders .
And she is not the kind of wallflower that would simply turn the other cheek with this kind of offense . "
Feinstein 's public irritation was not echoed by the junior senator from California , Democrat Barbara Boxer , who expressed enthusiastic support of Panetta in an interview with The Chronicle on Tuesday .
" He 's a wonderful leader , manager , reformer ... with a lot of skills , " Boxer said .
" And I guess there 're two things you could look for - an outsider like Leon who could come in and reform the agency and build up the trust ... and make it more amenable to working with the other agencies .
The other is to just take an expert in intelligence and put them in charge - and that 's more a hands - on person , an ' into the weeds ' person . "
Obama , she said , " took the right approach ... you pick someone like Leon , " with insider experts like Blair working alongside him and others with experience assisting him .
Reality check
With just 14 days until the president - elect 's inauguration , the unexpected umbrage from a powerful California senator over the naming of a well - known and highly respected California nominee underscores what one Democratic insider describes as a political " reality check for Obama .
" The lesson is that , despite the Democratic euphoria over winning the White House back and expanding our margins in the House and the Senate , you still have very powerful committee chairs ... who will be very protective of their turf , " said Democratic strategist Garry South .
Democrats who dismiss such matters might recall that " Jimmy Carter came into office and ran afoul almost immediately of the Democratic Congress - and never recovered because of that , " he said .
" It is a warning sign to the Obama administration that despite his significant electoral victory and popular victory , he still has to contend with powers that be in the Senate . "
But critics decried Feinstein 's move as representative of tired inside - the - Beltway politics - the very thing voters rejected when they elected Obama .
The critics dismissed objections that Panetta lacks intelligence agency experience as outrageous - pointing out that former President George H.W.
Bush served the CIA competently as its director after serving as a congressman and ambassador to China with no previous agency experience .
A key voice
Some , who wo n't be quoted by name , even suggest that Feinstein aims to establish her clout as an influential player on intelligence issues - and as a key voice from California - as Obama takes office .
Panetta , they note , has long been popular with state Democrats and has a good relationship with the incoming president .
Boxer acknowledged that for any president , " it 's good to work with the chairman " of key committees on important appointments - though she noted Obama " did n't confer with me on the ( Environmental Protection Agency ) appointment .
I talked to him about it , and I would have loved to have known . "
" I think the more communication with the Senate , the better ... ( it 's ) a better way to go , " she said .
" We 're all going to be on his team . "
Boxer predicted the controversy will soon be over - she said she 's confident Panetta will be confirmed .
Then , she said , the whole issue will be merely " water under the bridge . "
Until then , O'Connor said , it should be a lesson learned .
" You do n't want a chair of your own party , who 's chairing a major subcommittee , reacting this way to your appointment , " she said .
With the withdrawal of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as Obama 's nominee for commerce secretary - in the face of a pay - to - play inquiry - and the current brouhaha over Panetta , she said , " I would be more careful .
You do n't want to squander all the good will from the election . "

A rare Worcester ’s buttonquail ( Turnix worcesteri ) , a probable female , which is also locally known as the Philippines quail , is shown being photographed while being held by a bird hunter in Caraballo ( above ) .
The bird , thought to be extinct , was photographed for the first time in the Philippines , and then sold to a poultry market as food .
Found only on the island of Luzon , Worcester ’s buttonquail was known solely through drawings based on dated museum specimens collected several decades ago .
( Turnix sylvatica )
Locally called “ Pugo ” , these birds are known to inhabit rice paddies and scrub lands near farm areas because of the availability of seeds and insects that they feed on regularly .
The Worcester ’s buttonquail males are characterized by black heads with white spots , a brown or fawn colored body and yellow legs .
The females are brown with white and black spots .
These birds are very secretive , choosing to make small path ways through the rice fields , which unfortunately leads to their deaths as well , as they are hunted by children and young men by means of setting spring traps along their usual path ways .
( Turnix pyrrhothorax )
Scientists had suspected the Turnix worcesteri species , listed as “ data deficient ” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature ’s 2008 Red List , was extinct .
Wild Bird Club of the Philippines President Michael
Lu asked a question that naturally came to my mind : “ What if this was the last of its species ? ”
He told the Agence France - Press news agency that it ’s unfortunate that the locals are n’t more conscious of the threatened wildlife around them .
However , the buttonquail is from a “ notoriously cryptic and unobtrusive family of birds , ” according to the nonprofit Birdlife International , so the species may survive undetected in other regions .
A news feature about the Worcester ’s Buttonquail was aired in the Philippines recently by the documentary filmmaker Howie Severino , a member of the GMA Network .
It was mentioned that the documentary was the first time an actual live photo of the bird was taken .
The photo , with appeared only briefly in their credits , was taken in Nueva Vizcaya in northern Luzon .
The photographer is Arnel Telesforo .

Last year we told you about Oscar Dios , a Swede with a wacky idea : Park a retired Boeing 747 outside the Stockholm airport , and turn it into motel for the budget - minded traveler .
His vision has become a reality , with Dios ’ 25 - room , 85 - bed Jumbo Hostel scheduled to open next week .
The Jumbo Hostel is now accepting reservations on its website for stays beginning Jan. 15 .
Dorm rooms start at 350 Swedish kronor ( $ 45 ) , with deluxe private rooms at
$ 1,350 Kroner ( $ 175 ) .
For even more , you can spend the night in the plane ’s cockpit , which has been converted to a sort of honeymoon suite and is the only room on the plane with its own bathroom and shower .
Dios ’ vision for the Jumbo Hostel has up to now been limited to a series of conceptual drawings , but last week he invited a reporter from Britain ’s < cite > Guardian < / cite > aboard for a look at the place .
The paper posted video of the tour ( narrated by an extremely monotonic reporter ) on its website , and it provides some interesting new details on Dios ’ digs .
For those of us who have done a lot of backpacking , the words hostel and claustrophobia are interchangeable , but judging from the Guardian footage , even rooms at the low end of Jumbo Hostel ’s price range look pretty good .
Each dorm room is around 20 square feet , but because Dios was able to remove the cable and wiring that made the 747 fly , the ceilings are a spacious 13 feet high .
Overhead bins have been bolted to the walls for storage , and all rooms have free wireless internet access , as well as flatscreen televisions that double as arrival - departure monitors .
The Jumbo Hostel might be cheap , but it still comes with some hotel - style extras .
The 747 ’s upper deck , which airlines often use as a lounge , will remain such , with the original seats and serving areas intact .
The plane ’s first - class cabin has been turned into a cafe that seats 20 and is open to the public 24
hours a day .
Passengers are also free to use the plane ’s emergency exits to step onto the wing and take a look around .
And if you ’re looking to catch an early flight , Jumbo Hostel ’s location ca n’t be beat .
It ’s just a 15 - minute walk to the airport terminal , or you can catch one of the shuttles that runs every 7
minutes .
Beyond putting up weary travelers , Dios plans to offer guided tours of the plane to the public for around $ 10 each , and says he hopes to franchise the concept .
Judging from the state of the airline industry , there should be some surplus planes Dios can snap up cheap .

As a bartender I find that I ’m constantly being asked what my favorite cocktail is , to which I have always replied that I do n’t have a favorite cocktail , but that what I truly enjoy is change and when I frequent my local watering hole it is a rare occasion indeed that I would order the same drink twice .
Another question that I ’m often asked is what the “ best ” cocktail is , to which I have to reply that there is no such thing as a “ best ” cocktail .
I usually then bring out the analogy of shoes ( I used to mention cars , but that was lost on much of the fairer sex ) .
I ask what they would consider to be the “ best ” pair of shoes .
There is usually a pause to which I answer the question for them : “ Best for what ?
Dancing ?
Hiking ?
Boating ?
Work ?
Winter ?
Summer ?
The shoes that one chooses depend upon the time , your needs and your attitude .
It is the same with a cocktail ” .
Having said that , it has come to my conclusion that while I may not have a “ go to ” cocktail , I definitely have a favorite style of libation : that of the venerable Old Fashioned .
While it may be true that I ca n’t recall the last ( or first ) time that I have actually ordered an Old Fashioned in a bar , panning over some of my older posts I became aware that I ’ve mentioned the Old Fashioned or a variation of it several times , which got me to thinking : whenever I ’m at home , nine times out of ten , when I ’m wanting of a cocktail , I ’m going to make myself an Old Fashioned or similar concoction .
And while I may not be able to remember the last time I ordered an Old Fashioned in a bar , it was n’t that long ago that I ordered one of its more famous variants : the Sazerac .
But I digress .
The Old Fashioned refers to , of course , the Old Fashioned Cocktail .
It was as early as the 1870 ’s when the discerning drinker began to tire of all the new cocktail variations and just wanted an old fashioned ( or original ) cocktail , which as I ’m sure we all know by now , consisted simply of a spirit , water , bitters and sugar .
There was no ice in the finished drink ( one must realize that ice during this time was a luxury , and would never have been just given away to a customer ’s unless absolutely necessary ! ) and heaven help the barkeep that threw in a fruit salad of orange and cherry : such an action was liable to get the man shot !
The Cocktail was a simple drink , made in simpler times , but oh the chorus of angels that made their presence known when this amazingly deep and complex concoction was first put to the imbiber ’s lips and past his gullet .
OLD FASHIONED
2 oz rye whiskey ( or quality dry bourbon )
3 goodly dashes of Angostura aromatic bitters
1 sugar cube ( or ¼ oz rich simple syrup )
dash of club soda ( if not using simple syrup )
place the sugar cube into a chilled mixing glass
wet the cube with Angostura and soda
crush the cube with a muddler
add rye and stir
add ice and stir until well chilled
strain into a chilled rocks glass
garnish and add ice at your own peril
As great as the Old Fashioned is , as with most things in life , there is always room for improvement .
Those that are familiar with my recipes know that I am always looking for ways to add or compact as much flavor and complexity as possible when creating cocktails , and to this end , I ’ve come up with the Cubed Old Fashioned .
In this variation , I ’ve tripled the number of spirits , I ’ve tripled the types of bitters and even complicated the sugar by making a syrup with three ingredients , not one of which is water ( more on this later ) .
In the creation of the Cubed Old Fashioned , I ’ve added just as much flavor as is humanly possible , and the only way to go further would be to add a scotch or absinthe rinse .
Sometimes one has to just let things be ( as hard as that may be for the likes of this bartender ) .
My “ eureka ! ” moment for this cocktail came when I decided to create an Old Fashioned within the Old Fashioned by making a syrup to replace the normally used sugar out of the ingredients that one would find in a traditional Old Fashioned .
In other words , I replaced the water with rye and bitters when making the syrup , and for added complexity I employed turbinado sugar instead of refined white sugar ( demerara or raw sugar will work wonders as well ) .
I ’ve now made other syrups using this technique and am in absolute love with how they enrich cocktails .
Good examples have been a Caipirinha syrup using lime peel , cachaca and white sugar , as well as Margarita syrup with tequila , orange bitters , sugar and honey .
As you can see , the possibilities are endless and the syrups do n’t have to be used solely with the cocktails after which they are named .
Enough talk , let ’s mix up a :
CUBED OLD FASHIONED
¾ oz Remy VSOP ( or any good cognac )
¾ oz Appleton V/X ( or any good rum )
¾ oz Rittenhouse 100 ( or any good rye / bourbon )
½ oz Old Fashioned syrup
1 dash Bitter Truth Xocolatl Mole bitters
1 dash Angostura bitters
1 dash Angostura orange bitters
stir all ingredients with ice
strain into a chilled rocks glass filled with one giant ice chunk
garnish with orange zest and brandied cherry resting on the top of the glass
Old Fashioned Syrup
200 mL Bourbon or rye
100 mL Angostura bitters
550 mL Turbinado sugar
5 cloves
7 allspice
3 star anise
stir ingredients in a pot over low heat until all sugar is incorporated
let cool
strain and funnel into a sanitized bottle
add 1 oz of bourbon / rye to help preserve your syrup
While I do n’t ordinarily add ice to my Old Fashioneds , the Cubed Old Fashioned is so complex that I feel it requires a large chunk of ice .
If you do n’t have a large chunk of pristine ice on hand ( and the sad reality is that few of us do ) , the least you can do is order one of these trays .
If both options fail you , try the drink without ice , as small ice cubes will just muck up the dynamics of this powerful , yet elegant libation .
Try other iterations of the Old Fashioned by subbing out the sugar / syrup with a variety of liqueurs ( St Germain , Crème Yvette , St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram , Fernet , or Canton ad infinitum ) or swapping out the spirits and bitters and you ’ll find that this is a cocktail that has no bounds .
Leave comments below to tell me of some of your newfound Old Fashioned variations , or experiments with new types of flavor - packed syrups .
Happy mixing !

This is one of those things that always seems un-intuitive to developers who are n't familiar with SQL .
I 've heard a lot of explanations for it over the years , but this is probably the most succinct I 've come across , thanks to Matt Ryall on the Atlassian intranet .
… there 's actually a reason for this distinction .
They 're not equivalent at all , because NULL is n't a value that you can be equal to .
It represents a value that is undefined .
For example , if my date - of - birth in a database is NULL ( because it 's unknown ) and so it yours , they should n't be considered the same .
They 're two different , undefined values .
A query where this might happen is : select s1.name , s2.name from staff s1 , staff s2 where s1.id != s2.id and s1.dob = s2.dob
Nine Inch Nails ' Ghosts I - IV out - sold Coldplay , Keane and Snow Patrol , despite Trent Reznor making it freely and legally available on P2P networks
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Amazon 's bestselling MP3 album of the year was legally available as a free download on filesharing networks .
Proving either that market economics are complicated or Nine Inch Nails fans are crazy , Trent Reznor 's Ghosts I - IV topped Amazon 's list of 2008 sellers , beating Coldplay , Snow Patrol and Keane .
The double - album was available for purchase at Amazon , direct from NIN , or as a free , Creative Commons - licensed download on major P2P networks .
Ghosts I - IV was a surprise release in March , announced without warning on the Nine Inch Nails website .
Forgoing record labels , Reznor used independent licensing company Tunecore to make the 36 tracks available on Amazon – paying just $ 38 for the service .
By selling special versions of the album , Ghosts I - IV generated some $ 1.6 m ( £ 1 m ) in revenue in its first week .
Other winners in Amazon 's year - end MP3 album charts were Coldplay 's Viva La Vida , Death Cab for Cutie 's Narrow Stairs , the Mouldy Peaches - studded soundtrack to Juno , and 3 Doors Down 's self - titled album .
Radiohead 's
In Rainbows , which was also available as a free , legal download , was ranked No 8 .
Buoyed by his success with Ghosts I - IV , Reznor 's follow - up was again free , without even the need for P2P .
The Slip is available as a direct download from the NIN site .
More recently , Reznor made available over 400GB of high - definition live NIN footage , inviting fans to edit the material themselves .
Though he referred coyly to " a shadowy group of subversives " and " lacking security " , this is presumably the raw footage from NIN 's aborted live DVD project .
So yes , it is , inevitably , free .
We ’re down to the last loop on the Granville Street Bridge .
Now that a City report is recommending the reconfiguration of both loops at the north end of the bridge , only the southwest loop ( lower left above ) will remain .
Opened in 1954 at the height of the post - war infrastructure boom , the Granville Bridge was vastly overscaled for its purpose .
This high - elevation eight - lane structure would never reach its design capacity unless the feeder roads to it were likewise enlarged .
But back then , they presumed that the city would be rescaled for the car , so they built freeway - style cloverleafs at both ends .
In 1997 , the Pacific Press building , a bland modernist box squatting on the block just above the southeast loop , was acquired with the intent to build what is now the Portico condo complex .
The City took the benefit moneys to develop an adjacent park , requiring the removal of the loop .
Vehicles now have to make two right turns to get on to the bridge from Fourth Avenue .
The landscape architects retained the memory of the curving on - ramp in their design of a pathway between the tennis courts and water feature .
The changes at the north end will be even more dramatic .
Here ’s the current situation :
When the loops are removed , the blocks will be subdivided , squared up , and sold as development sites .
To eventually look like this :
Several new streets will be created :
Tilly Rolston , after whom the streets are named , was the first woman cabinet minister in British Columbia , given the Education portfolio by Premier W.A.C. Bennett .
Most of the land is currently under asphalt , mainly a parking lot for a taxi company .
The city - owned Continental currently serves as social housing , to be replaced as part of the redevelopment .
It ’s not quite clear how pedestrian linkages and bikeways will work to connect Granville Street to False Creek – but the changes will be far superior to the near - impenetrable barrier there now .
Another sign that we are in a post - Motordom city , reversing the insensitivities of the era when the car was king and the pedestrian an interloper .

By the time Calli Vanderaa discovered the seven - week - old puppies in the garbage dumpster stationed behind her house , the fourth grader had spent two years soaking up ample evidence of society ’s dark underbelly .
She ’d already seen more than most people witness in a lifetime .
The little girl was tossing away grass clippings with her dad last summer when they turned to walk away .
She stopped in her tracks , ears instinctively tuned to the pleading cries coming from the big brown bin .
The sounds were faint but unmistakably alive .
“ I asked him , ‘ Did you hear that ? ’ ”
“ No , ” he said .
“ Well , come here . ”
Her father Corey found a stool to boost himself up into the tall steel structure .
Thankfully Calli stayed behind .
“ He said I did n’t want to see what was inside there , ” she told me .
The incident of cruelty made an impression on Calli .
Last month , she wrote a letter to her local newspaper , the Winnipeg Free Press , detailing what had happened .
A poem she had composed was also enclosed .
Dear Sir
My name is Calli Vanderaa .
I ’m 9 years old and I live with my daddy .
One day we found a little puppy in the BFI bin in our lane .
Somebody had put 3 puppies in there and set them on fire .
Two of the puppies died but daddy and I saved one that was sitting in the corner crying .
We took her home and named her Jessie .
She is happy and growing bigger every day .
Besides loving animals , I have a couple of things in common with Calli .
I spent my childhood living in and around Winnipeg , Manitoba , a Canadian prairie city known for its bitterly cold winters and warm , friendly people .
And for three years , I worked at the Free Press , the newspaper Calli addressed her letter to .
It ’s where I held my first full - time reporting job after graduating from journalism school .
It was a former Free Press colleague and writer friend who was kind enough to share Calli ’s story with me .
But the similarities between my life and Calli ’s seemed to end with the geography we shared as children .
A child of economic privilege , I grew up in nice homes nestled in safe neighbourhoods .
Meanwhile , Calli lives in Ground Zero of Winnipeg ’s war zone , the most squalid section of the notorious North End .
It ’s the kind of place that people drive through and automatically reach over to lock their car doors .
Solvent abuse , alcoholism , drug dealing and gang violence run rampant , ruling the streets .
Poverty is a given .
A series of setbacks caused Calli ’s 34 - year - old single father Corey to move from a respectable suburban neighbourhood to the more affordable but dangerous inner city .
It all began with Calli 's mother moving to the United States and leaving her 18 - month - old daughter behind .
Even in the North End , Corey struggles to meet financial obligations .
He ’s employed as a long - haul truck driver and clears snow part time to pay the bills .
He agonizes about not spending enough time with his daughter .
Circumstances would be even tougher if it were n’t for Corey ’s mother , Betty .
The 76 - year - old drives over from sleepy St. Vital six days a week to watch over her granddaughter while her son works .
Animals are n’t the only victims of the grinding despair in Calli ’s neighbourhood .
Last year , six of the city 's drug - or gang - related slayings happened within a two - street radius of her house .
Once , a dead body turned up in her backyard .
A crack house a couple of doors down used to blight the street -- until it was firebombed .
Calli has been victimized , too .
Now attending Grade 4 , she had to change schools when she first moved to the area as a Grade 2 student .
The skinny , pretty and perky Caucasian girl stuck out as a moving target , and got into three fights in short order .
One was sparked by a boy in Grade 5 calling her a “ f------ white bitch . ”
A few months ago , a 13 - year - old boy with a pellet gun shot Calli in the left shoulder blade as she walked home from school .
“ Now I take Judo .
It ’s for my own protection , ” she said .
Despite what she 's survived , it is n’t Calli ’s personal plight that upsets her .
She remains deeply troubled by what happened to the puppies in the garbage bin that day .
Her face clouded over when we spoke about it .
“ I just ca n’t believe someone could do something like that , ” Calli said .
“ She had green gum up her bum .
My dad had to take it out . ”
The shy puppy was frightened at first , but quickly realized that she was in gentle , safe company at the Vanderaa household .
“ She was really scared , but within an hour she was calmer , ” Calli said .
Initially she believed the soot - coated pup hiding under the coffee table had black fur until a bath in the kitchen sink revealed her true color .
“ She turned golden brown .
It was magic . ”
Jessie quickly became part of the family .
“ She gets so excited when my dad comes home that she pees in the house , ” Calli said .
I asked her what she would tell the person who did this to Jessie and her littermates if she had the chance .
“ I really do n’t know , ” she started .
Then , after a pause , she finished her thought with resolve : “ I would actually have nothing to say to them at all . ”
Calli ’s Christmas list for this year had four things on it , topped by an Avril Lavigne poster .
But in the face of the family ’s financial strain , Calli changed her mind about her list and took it down last week .
With her father on the road six days a week , and Sundays being their only full day together , there 's one gift that matters most to her .
“ I do n’t want anything for Christmas .
I only want to spend time with my daddy .
He ’s a good daddy because I ’m not spoiled . ”
She ’s also thinking about her pup Jessie , and what she needs for Christmas .
The five - month - old dog can go into heat any day now , and Calli is wise enough to understand the importance of stopping the endless cycle of overpopulation .
Wiser than many adults I encounter , in fact .
But the procedure costs $ 140 .
It ’s money the family does n’t have .
When readers of Winnipeg Free Press columnist Gordon Sinclair Jr. saw Calli ’s story in the December 13th edition of the paper , they spontaneously stepped up to help .
People wrote that they planned to buy gifts for this family instead of themselves .
They pledged cash and gift certificates .
Dog food and toys .
Relief babysitting for Grandma Betty that included Jessie in the deal .
Even Habitat for Humanity emailed to say they could potentially help Corey purchase a house with affordable payments in a safer neighbourhood .
One man was so touched that he offered to help Corey get a job at his workplace that might pay better and keep him closer to home and his daughter .
An award was promised for Calli , who will be nominated as a Humane Hero through the Winnipeg Humane Society .
One of the most important gifts pledged by three different people was for Jessie .
It ’s the $ 140 the family does n’t have to spay her .
It was n’t as if Calli was n’t trying to do right by her dog .
The junior animal rescuer was already saving small change in two coffee cans for the surgery .
She understands that her efforts will help stop the cycle of death that her father had witnessed in the dumpster behind their house .
After meeting Calli and being impressed by what she ’s already accomplished for this puppy , I had to ask :
What does she want to be when she grows up ?
“ Being a teacher just sounds so cool , ” she said , breaking into a big smile .
I was kind of hoping she ’d say animal rescuer and writer .
But at least she ’s already qualified for both .
And she has n’t even turned 10 .
“ Here is my poem about my little friend , ” Calli wrote to the Winnipeg Free Press in the letter she included along with this penciled ode to her dog , reprinted below .
My dog Jessie
I heard a little puppy crying
in a garbage bin
My daddy picked her out cause she was
scared and very thin .
we took her home and bathed her
then to our surprise she was n’t
black but golden brown with big brown
puppy eyes .
We took her to the doctor
and he said she ’s doing fine
how can people be so cruel
Why ca n’t they just be kind ?

For background on the Iraqi journalist who on Sunday hurled two shoes at George W. Bush during a press conference in Iraq , there ’s this November 18 , 2007 report from Reporters Without Borders :
Reporters Without Borders voiced deep concern today about the disappearance of Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al - Zaidi of satellite TV station Al - Baghdadiyah , who was kidnapped in central Baghdad on 16 November .
The news agency reports of his abduction offer little reason for optimism .
“ The kidnapping of a journalist in Iraq is often a prelude to his murder , and we have every reason to fear for Zaidi ’s life , ” the press freedom organisation said .
“ This war has resulted in massive bloodshed for both the Iraqi and foreign media .
Never before in history have journalists suffered so much in a war .
We urge all the security forces present in Baghdad to work together to find Zaidi .
And we extend our support to his family and colleagues . ”
The Associated Press quoted an Al - Baghdadiyah editor as saying Zaidi went missing in central Baghdad while on his way to work .
The editor said that , when Zaidi failed to turn up , a colleague called his mobile .
A strange voice answered and said : “ Forget Muntadhar . ”
Broadcasting from the Egyptian capital of Cairo , Al - Baghdadiyah is regarded as pro-Sunni and critical of the current , US - backed Iraqi government .
Zaidi ’s abduction surprised his colleagues because the 28 - year - old journalist ’s reports were considered “ moderate ” and neither he nor his station had received any threats .
Al - Baghdadiyah has nonetheless lost two of its employees to violence since the start of the war .
The latest , Jawad al - Daami , was murdered on 23 September .
A total of 206 media workers – journalists , technicians and assistants – have been killed since the start of the US - led invasion in March 2003 , 46 of them since the start of this year .
Al - Zaida was released after being held for three days .
He was not harmed .
UPDATE : On Monday afternoon ( Washington , DC time ) , CNN reported that Al - Zaida was still in custody and was possibly facing charges for throwing shoes in the vicinity of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , not for hurling footware at Bush .
To supplement storage space with the initial purchase of the Aspire One ( 8 GB SSD version ) , I bought a 16 GB Transcend TS16GBSDHC6 card that integrates nicely into the left card slot .
The pre-installed Linux Linpus just was n’t what I needed since I use many networking tools at work and at home .
I initially ran Ubuntu 8.041 with the /home partition on the 16 GB SDHC card .
I discovered Eeebuntu while searching for information on how to boot and run Linux off a SDHC card .
The goal was of multi-boot installations of Ubuntu , with one install specifically loaded with the tools I use at work .
The Acer Aspire One BIOS does not ‘ see ’ the card , so you ca n’t boot from it using the [ F12 ] startup key ( More on the SDHC boot up further in this article ) .
( A brief review , SSD F.U.D. and adventures with the grub boot loader )
Eeebuntu 2.0 On The “ One ”
The Aspire One works nicely with many Linux distributions , but there had been hardware issues in particular the Atheros WiFI support .
Finding the reports in the forum sounded good for the Eeebuntu 2.0 release on the Acer One .
I tried the ‘ Standard ’ and ‘ NBR ’Â versions first with live CDs .
Both worked great .
Installing Eeebuntu 2.0 is just like any typical Ubuntu install .
I used a CD / DVD drive with a USB - IDE / SATA adapter .
Once running , I had to select 160 x 120 resolution for the webcam to work ( in the Cheese application ) and to have the HDA Intel sound be Alsa for the microphone to work correctly .
I also needed to disable the EeePC temperature sensors services as they did n’t work on the Aspire One .
Here ’s a capture of my Eeebuntu desktop on the Aspire One .
Gnome interfaced Eeebuntu is designed for the Asus EeePC series based on Ubuntu 8.10 .
It uses the custom Array kernel ( http://www.array.org/ubuntu/) optimized for the EeePCs .
It also works great on the Aspire One which shares the same Intel Atom processor .
Eeebuntu is available in three flavors : A Standard Version which has the Mac - like AWN manager installed ; A Netbook Version with the Netbook Remix front end and a Base version minus the specific EeePc utilities and major applications .
Preferences are easily modified using the System / Control Center utilities .
Here ’s the Eeebuntu 2.0 Base default desktop :
The NBR Eeebuntu Desktop featuring Netbook Remix .
The Atheros WiFI support is the best it ’s ever been on the Aspire One .
I ’ve encountered connections issues and drifting signal levels with other distributions and came the closest by compiling the MadWiFI ( http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/About/MadWifi) modules myself in a base Ubuntu 8.041 installation .
Even Ndiswrapper never worked good for me .
This distro is a dream .
The custom kernel is “ apt pinned ” Â in that normal Ubuntu updates , will not break it .
Unfortunately I could not do a dpkg force install of WICD , ( http://wicd.sourceforge.net/ ) which I use at work , to replace the network manager .
( I have WICD on another Ubuntu 8.10 base install on a boot - able USB stick I ’ve used a few months . )
This may be related to the pinned kernel and WiFI modules .
I will investigate further sometime .
The AWN interface is ok being very usable providing a different way to switch work spaces and running applications .
Move the mouse to the lower screen to make the AWN manager visible ( default setting ) and click on your particular running application icon .
I have 47 % of the 16 GB SDHC card ( a bootable install … I ’ll get to that ) filled with all my favorite applications thanks to the Ubuntu Intrepid repositories .
I even did a update via the Update Manager after enabling all Ubuntu Intrepid repositories and Mediabuntu , without a problem .
So far Eeebuntu 2.0 is the BEST Linux distro I ’ve tried on the Aspire One , especially the rock solid WiFI operation .
Running Eeeebuntu 2.0 off the 16 GB Transcend SDHC Card
First some flash storage discussion .
Fun with F.U.D .
There is little information to some mis-information about solid state flash for operating systems around various Linux web sites .
NASA and the military have used flash drives for years .
Most hard drives do n’t work over 10,000 ft .
They require air pressure to keep the heads precisely over the platters .
We do know , at least for now , SLC ( Single layer chip ) Nand Flash has been better and more expensive than MLC ( Multi - layer chip ) NAND Flash .
The MLCs are getting bigger and faster and perhaps closer to the specs of the SLCs .
There are few details available as this technology is advancing fast .
The Aspire One SSDs use the new Intel MLC chips .
They are somewhat different in data path design than other MLCs .
Intel rates the Z - P230 PATA drives as 1,000,000 hours MTBF and with 3 years of useful life .
Is this at 100 % duty cycle ?
I do n’t know but at a 25 % duty cycle using one of the various formulas found on the ‘ net , you ’d find the life span increases to 6 - 8 years .
That ’s close to standard hard drives .
SLCs are 10 times greater in write / erase endurance so SLC life spans could increase to 30 - 80 years .
Toshiba calculated that a 10,000 write cycle endurance would enable a complete write and erase the entire contents of USB flash drives once per day for 27 years .
There are variables to consider such as “ wear leveling ” Â algorithms and hardware design , but generally solid state storage is consumer ready as prices fall .
If my 25 % duty cycle logic applies , then 6 - 8 years of life is acceptable as hard drives seem to last this long .
Note : Hard drives are mechanical so they have a much lower MTBF such as 150,000 hours .
The 16 GB Transcend cards are a bargain whether they are MLC or SLC Flash .
I am not concerned about all of the extra OS writes to the drive .
( The journaled ext3 file system has saved my butt a few times . )
A good article is found at : http://www.storagesearch.com/ssdmyths-endurance.html about SSD endurance and general Solid State storage at the site .
I planned to boot and run Eeebuntu 2.0 Linux from the SDHC card .
This can be done on the Asus EeePCs but the Acer ’s BIOS does n’t see SD media , only the internal IDE or external USB drive devices ( such as with USB adapters ) .
Thanks to Linux embedded sites and information scattered elsewhere , the setup process is n’t difficult to do for a more advanced Linux user that has fooled around with grub .
It ’s just takes some time .
The Transcend TS16GSDHC6,16 GB
Mode 6 cards can be found for $ 27 .
They work great in the Aspire One for extra mountable Linux storage , such as with an internal 8 GB SSD installation by putting a / home and / var partition on them .
Now to put OSes on them like the EeePCers do .
Nice Idea !
More OS Installation Space , without opening the Acer up and voiding the warranty .
Booting Linux from the SDHC card in the Acer Aspire One :
If the kernel has the support for SD cards , at the inital bootup , have the initrd.img pre-loaded with the SD card modules using the initramfs - tools .
Linux in ram will be able to see these devices and thereby boot from them .
The strategy
[ a ]
Create new initrd-img files for booting with the SDHC modules pre-loaded for each installation . [ b]
Do the SDHC installations using USB to SDHC card readers . [ c ]
Obtain the unique UUID from eachUSB - SDHC adapter installation . [d ]
Copy the new initrd-img and kernel files to the internal drivedirectory . [ e ]
Add the new entries to the internal drive ’ sinserting the correct device UUIDs , , and kernel file names .
I did TWO complete , tested , identical installations .
The first installation is to the internal SSD drive without the SDHC card installed .
I did manual partitioning with a 1GB swap partition and placed the MBR code at the beginning of the drive , such as / dev/sda , NOT / dev/sda1 .
Reboot then go to then from the command line :
$cd /etc/initramfs - tools
Now as root we need to edit the modules file :
$ gksu gedit modules
Add these each on one line ( do not comment with # ) :
mmc_core
mmc_block
sdhci
sdhci-pci
Save the modules file .
Now at the command line type :
$ sudo update - initramfs -u
This rewrites ( -u means updates and overwrites ) the Linux initrd.img.xxx.xxx in the / boot directory .
The initrd.img now has the the modules preloaded so it can boot a SDHC device .
Now go and view the / boot / grub / menu.lst file and find the lines starting with “ uuid ” and “ kernel ” .
Note that the two uuids are the same hexadecimal values .
We will return here to edit later .
The next installation is to the SDHC card using a USB - SDHC card adapter .
I used a USB to SDHC card reader and booted again using the USB - CD / DVD .
Once in the Live CD installer , be careful and verify you have the correct device to install to .
Use fdisk -l from the command line to verify the device assignment if needed .
I did a manual partition with a 1 GB “ swap ” partition at the end of the install drive .
The other swap partition on the internal drive was selected as not used .
Like the first internal installation , I placed the MBR code at the beginning of the SDHC device - drive labeled / dev/sdb .
( If Acer ever updates the BIOS for direct SDHC boot , these SDHC card installations will be ready for it . )
When complete , reboot from the USB - SDHC adpater device , hitting [ F12 ] select boot devices , choose the USB - SDHC card adapter .
Now test the installation .
If it works , go and view the / boot / grub / menu.lst file of this install and find the lines starting with “ uuid ” Â and “ kernel ” .
Note that the two uuids are the same hexadecimal values .
Write this hexadecimal value down and or save it somewhere .
Shut down and insert SDHC card itself in the left slot of the Apsire One .
Boot from the internal 8 GB SSD installation .
Now as root we need to edit the / boot / grub / menu.lst file with a text editor or vi :
$ gksu gedit / boot / grub/ menu.lst
Scroll down to the entry of the default installation .
Here ’s my internal SSD installation ( with my own labeling )
title Ubuntu 8.10 , kernel 2.6.27-8- eeepc SDD – Internal
uuid 736f6f5a-28c8-4848-9b97-04342ca875b2
kernel / boot / vmlinuz -2.6.27-8-eeepc root=UUID=736f6f5a-28c8-4848-9b97-04342ca875b2 ro clocksource=hpet
initrd / boot / initrd.img-2.6.27-8-eeepc
quiet
Copy that entry and paste it below the first ( internal SSD ) entry .
Edit this one with the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ uuidsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â of the SDHC device from the USB - SDHC adapter installation .
In this case for my hardware : UUID=a555d64d-5991-410e-b725-d3f7e76d2fe8 .
Your ’s will be different as each UUID is unique as Ubuntu Linux assigns them .
title Ubuntu 8.10 , kernel 2.6.27-8- eeepc SDHC CARD
uuid 736f6f5a-28c8-4848-9b97-04342ca875b2
kernel / boot / vmlinuz -2.6.27-8-eeepc root=UUID=a555d64d-5991-410e-b725-d3f7e76d2fe8 ro clocksource=hpet
initrd / boot / initrd.img-2.6.27-8-eeepc
quiet
Save the / boot / grub / menu.lst , reboot and then select the new entry from the grub boot up menu and see it it works .
This is nuts but I purchased another Transcend 16 GB SDHC Mode 6 card and Installed a base Ubuntu 8.10 ( from my USB stick install ) to it for the Aspire One .
Using the same technique with the additional modules update - initramfs as with the first install , I produced another new initrd - img - 2.6.27 - 7 - generic image with SDHC support .
This kernel vmlinuz - xxx.xxx.xx , and new initrd.img.xxx.xxx of this 2nd SDHC card installation WERE COPIED TO THE / boot DIRECTORY of the internal SSD installation .
I edited the / boot / grub / menu.lst with another entry and now can boot 2 different Linux installs on SDHC cards from the grub start up menu .
( That is BOTH the left and right SD card slots of the Aspire One . )
Here ’s the ADDITIONAL / boot / grub / menu.lst entry to the INTERNAL DEFAULT SSD INSTALLAION .
title Ubuntu 8.10 , kernel 2.6.27-7- generic SDHC Card Rt Slot
uuid 736f6f5a-28c8-4848-9b97-04342ca875b2
kernel / boot / vmlinuz -2.6.27-7-generic root=UUID=0b217a58-efb6-4121-85cf-5daa5a473b53 ro
initrd / boot / initrd.img-2.6.27-7-generic
quiet
The Aspire One is booting the internal SSD ( / dev/sda ) install loading the / boot / grub / menu.lst from it as seen in the uuid line under the title line .
The right slot SDHC has a different kernel and different UUID .
The kernel and initrd lines define them .
Conclusions :
– Eeebuntu 2.0 is the finest Ubuntu Linux derivative I ’ve tried on the Aspire One .
– Acer needs to add SDHC support like Asus did for the EeePCs BIOS , a direct boot is so much easier .
– The initramfs with grub technique to boot the non-BIOS supported SDHC works on the Aspire one .
– Boot up time is slightly longer than just running the SSD install , since the initial boot information is being read twice off two devices .
Write speed of the SDHC cards is close to the slow , but usable SSD installation .
Read speads I feel no difference .
– For owners of Aspire One with Window ’s pre-loads , this technique if carefully done , could preserve the Windows setup if the internal drive is partitioned with a small / boot partition .
Gparted would work well at resizing and creation of a small 50 - 100 MB / boot partition .
Upon a USB - adapter card install , the / boot partition could be specified on the internal drive .
Ubuntu is smart enough to add the Windows chain loader entry into the grub menu .
– Plan on spending a few hours if you do a SD card boot installation .
– Solid state drive F.U.D.?
I feel these solid state wonders will outlive the life of these computers .
High ESD and physical abuse , such as bending , is more of a threat to the longevity of these SD cards than using one for an operating system installation .
Once roomy NAND
Flash drives reach the price and performance levels of today ’s hard drives , consumers will see solid state is vastly superior .
No moving parts , high vibration and shock resistance .
Flash drives work in greater temperature extremes , work over 10,000 ft. and are close to surpassing hard drive IO speed on the high end models .

GlimmerBlocker : a more stable ad - blocker
Download : GlimmerBlocker -1.6.6.dmg ( release notes ) .
This version requires macOS 10.10 ( Yosemite ) , 10.11 ( El Capitan ) or 10.12 ( Sierra ) .
After upgrading macOS , you might have to reinstall GlimmerBlocker .
Older versions of GlimmerBlocker supports older versions of OSX .
There is no version for iPhone .
Easy to uninstall if you do n't like it anyway .
GlimmerBlocker is free :
No payments required , but please help spread the word as ad - based sites would very much like to keep it a secret :
Screenshots gallery and detailed installation help .
About GlimmerBlocker
The problem with other ad - blockers for Safari is that they are implemented as awful hacks : as an InputManager and / or ApplicationEnhancer .
This compromises the stability of Safari and very often create problems when Apple releases a new version of Safari .
​ Snow Leopard does n't support the InputManager - based blockers when Safari runs in 64 - bit mode .
GlimmerBlocker is implemented as an http proxy , so the stability of Safari is n't compromised because it does n't use any hacks .
It is even compatible with all other browsers and other native Mac OS X applications which uses http , e.g. NetNewsWire .
The proxy runs on the mac and not on a central server like most proxies .
You 'll always be able to upgrade Safari without breaking GlimmerBlocker ( or waiting for a new release ) ; and you 'll be able to upgrade GlimmerBlocker without upgrading Safari .
This makes it much easier to use the beta versions of Safari and especially the nightly builds of ​ WebKit .
Because GlimmerBlocker does n't hack Safari , there is a few things it is n't able to do : adding a block by right - clicking an image , stopping pop-unders , and filtering cookies from 3rd party sites .
But you win a lot in stability , and GlimmerBlocker provides much easier methods for adding your own modifications to pages by adding css rules , pieces of Javascript or by transforming the html before Safari receives it .
So I 'll hope you 're happy with the tradeoff .
If you can program in Javascript you 'll be able to add your own modification to pages .
See the included filters for examples , e.g. adding a download link to YouTube .
​ Guido 's description of GlimmerBlocker in German , and ​ Fingster Kevin 's description and filter for Chinese users .
Share your filters
A set of default filters for common worldwide ad- providers are included in GlimmerBlocker .
So out - of - the box it blocks most ads .
If you still see ads on common , high - traffic sites , please ​notify me so the filters can be improved .
You can create your own filters and publish them using MobileMe or plain WebDav so other users can subscribe to your filter .
See the list of filters which other users have published .
You can setup iPhone / iPod to use Glimmer Blocker when they 're using wifi .
How to develop advanced filters
In addition to just blocking ads , Glimmer Blocker can add css or javascript to the pages , can modify the content using Javascript , can modify the request before Glimmer Blocker sends it to the remote server , can specify which dns-server or http / socks5 proxy that Glimmer Blocker must use when fetching that specific URL .

Application workarounds
The following applications needs workarounds or configured :
Miscellaneous
Very short FAQ .
GlimmerBlocker is fully open source and is licensed using ​ GPLv3 .
You can download the source , make your own modifications , submit changes , etc .
Older versions can be found in the downloads directory .
Sparkle uses two rss feeds : official releases and beta releases .
Even though the rss feeds includes a link to the new version , the easiest method to update GlimmerBlocker is to open the " System Preferences " , choose GlimmerBlocker and click " check now " in the " Setup " tab pane .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. economy entered a recession in December 2007 , a committee of economists at the private National Bureau of Economic Research said Monday .
The economy reached a peak in December and has been declining since , according to the business cycle dating committee of the NBER .
The committee does not judge a recession as two consecutive quarterly declines in gross domestic product ; rather , it looks at four key monthly economic indicators , including employment , industrial output and sales .
Employment peaked in December .

Friday Q&A 2009-01-16
Happy Friday to everyone , and welcome back to another Friday Q&A .
This week I 'll be taking Eren Halici 's suggestion to discuss the various ways to do interprocess communication on OS X .
IPC is an interesting and sometimes complicated topic , especially on OS X , which has a veritable zoo of IPC techniques .
It can be hard to decide which one to use , and sometimes hard to even know what 's available .
OS X is a funny mixture of mach and UNIX so you end up with IPC mechanisms from both :
Mach ports :
The fundamental IPC mechanism in mach .
Fast , light - weight , extremely capable , and difficult to use .
Mach ports will not only let you talk to other processes , but do things as drastic as inject code into other people 's programs .
The poor state of the mach documentation makes it hard to get started and easy to make mistakes with it .
On the other hand , the core mach_msg function is probably the most optimized syscall in the system , so they 're really fast to use , and your machine will barely blink if you decide to allocate million mach ports at once .
CFMachPort : A very thin wrapper around mach ports .
CFMachPort essentially exists to allow a mach port to be used as a runloop source .
It can also help with creating and destroying the ports .
It helps a little with receiving messages and not at all with sending them .
CFMessagePort :
This nice CoreFoundation wrapper around some mach functionality makes it easy to set up synchronous back - and - forth communication between two unrelated processes .
You can start a server with just a few lines of code .
Another program can then look up that server by name and message it .
You get the speed advantages of mach without all the messy stuff going on underneath .
NSPort / NSMachPort / NSMessagePort : Cocoa has some mach port wrappers too .
They 're mainly geared toward use with Distributed Objects ( more on that below ) but can be used on their own as well , if you 're brave .

POSIX file descriptors :
There are actually several kinds of these but they can all be used with the typical read and write calls once they 're set up .
Pipes :
The archetypal POSIX IPC mechanism .
If you 've ever used the | pipe operator in a UNIX shell , you 've used a pipe .
Pipes get created in pairs within the same process , so they 're good for communicating between parents and children ( or between two children of a single , coordinating parent ) but not so good for communicating between unrelated processes .
Make them with the pipe call .
FIFOs : It 's like a file , but it 's like a pipe !
A FIFO gets an entry in your filesystem , just like a file , but writes do n't go to the filesystem , instead they go to whatever process has opened the fifo for reading .
You can make these with the mkfifo call .
The end result is a pipe that has a filesystem entry , which can make it easy for two unrelated processes to hook up .
The processes do n't even have to know that they 're talking to a fifo .
Try it out in your shell : $ mkfifo / tmp / fifo $ cat / tmp / fifo # in another shell cat > / tmp / fifo type some junk here Sockets :
You probably know these from working with TCP / IP , but they can also be used to communicate locally , and not just by connecting to localhost .
If you create a socket in the AF_UNIX family you get a socket that 's only for local communication and uses more flexible addressing than TCP / IP allows .
AF_UNIX sockets can be created using a filesystem path much like a FIFO by using the socket and bind calls , but allowing multiple clients and more options for how the communication works .
They can also be created anonymously using the socketpair call , giving you something much like a pipe , except bidirectional .
There are actually several kinds of these but they can all be used with the typical and calls once they 're set up .
Shared memory : Shared memory is a magical piece of memory which appears in multiple processes at once .
In other words , you write to it from process A , and read from it in process B , or vice versa .
This tends to be very fast , as the data itself never touches the kernel and does n't have to be copied around .
The downside is that it 's really difficult to coordinate changes to the shared memory area .
You essentially get all of the disadvantages of threaded programming and most of the disadvantages of multi-process programming bundled together in one neat package .
Shared memory can be created using either mach or POSIX APIs .

Miscellaneous , not really IPC :
There are some techniques which do n't really count as " IPC " but can be used to communicate between programs if you want to .
ptrace :
This system call exists mainly for writing debuggers , but could in theory be used to do non-debugger things too .
Not recommended , included only for completeness .
Files : Sometimes it can be useful to communicate using plain old files .
This can be as simple as creating a lock file ( a plain empty file that works simply by being there ) for mutual exclusion , or you can transfer actual data around by writing it to a file , then having the other program read it .
This tends to be inefficient since you 're actually writing to the filesystem , but it 's also easy and nearly universal ; every application can read files !
There are some techniques which do n't really count as " IPC " but can be used to communicate between programs if you want to .
Those are all what I would call system - level functionality , things which are either provided directly by the kernel / libSystem , or which are thin wrappers around them .
OS X also provides a bunch of higher - level IPC mechanisms at the framework level :
Apple Events : Scourge of the Skies , Champion of the Ugly Contest , King Slow , Emperor Horrible .
Apple Events are all of these things , but they 're also tremendously useful .
They 're the only IPC mechanism which is universally supported by GUI applications on Mac OS X for remote control .
Want to tell another application to open a file ?
Time for Apple Events .
Want to tell another application to quit gracefully ?
Apple Events time .
Underneath it all , Apple Events are built on mach ports but this is mostly not exposed in the API .
AppleScript : Everything Apple Events is and worse , but still often useful , AppleScript is a scripting language built on top of Apple Events .
Generally it 's best to avoid AppleScript and simply send the corresponding raw Apple Events instead , either directly or through a mechanism like Scripting Bridge .
AppleScript support is the standard way to allow users to script your application , although if you ever try to add AppleScript support to your application you 'll find yourself wishing for a different standard .

Distributed Objects :
It 's like Objective - C , but it happens over there !
DO gives you proxy objects that can be used ( mostly ) just like local objects , with the exact same syntax and everything , except that your messages fly across to the other process and get executed there .
DO normally runs over mach ports but can also be used with sockets , allowing it to work between computers as well .
DO is really cool technology and it's the sort of thing that tends to blow people 's minds when they come to Objective - C from lesser languages such as Java or C ++.
Unfortunately DO is also really old and crufty and tends to be strangely unreliable .
This is especially true when using it with sockets to talk to remote machines , but is even true when using it locally .
DO is also completely non-modular , making it essentially impossible to swap out the IPC mechanism it uses for something custom ( like if you want to encrypt the stream ) .
It is worthy of investigation if only to learn about how it works , and despite the shortcomings can still be very useful in certain situations .

Distributed Notifications :
These are simple one - way messages that essentially get broadcast out to any process in the session that 's listening for them .
Extremely easy to use , and available in both Cocoa and CoreFoundation flavors .
( And they interoperate ! )
The downside is that they do n't guarantee delivery and they 're very resource - intensive due to potentially messaging every application on your system .
They would be completely unsuitable for something like transmitting a large picture to another process , but are great for simple one - off things like " I just changed my preferences , re-read them now " .
Internally this is implemented by using mach ports to talk to a centralized notification server which manages the task of getting notifications to where they want to go .

Pasteboard : Probably the IPC mechanism that you 've directly used the most .
Every time you copy and paste something between applications , that 's IPC happening !
Inter - app drag and drop also uses the pasteboard , and it 's possible to create custom pasteboards for passing data back and forth between applications .
Like distributed notifications , pasteboards work by talking to a central pasteboard server using mach ports .
So which one is right for you ?
Well , it all depends on what you 're doing .
I 've used nearly every one of these to accomplish different things over the years .
You 'll have to see which one fits your problem best , and I hope the above gives you a good place to get started .
That wraps things up for this week 's Friday Q&A .
Come back next week for another exciting installment .
Did I miss your favorite IPC mechanism ?
Do n't understand the point of one of them ?
Did I miss the whole point of one of them ?
